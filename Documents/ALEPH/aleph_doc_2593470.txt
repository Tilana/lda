GLOSSARY OF CERTAIN TERMS AND CONVENTIONS USED HEREIN
 
The following are abbreviations and definitions of certain terms used in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q:
 
“Bbl.” A standard barrel containing 42 U.S. gallons.
 
“Boe.” One barrel of oil equivalent, calculated by converting natural gas to oil equivalent barrels
at a ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil.
 
“Boe/d.” One Boe per day.
 
“Btu.” One British thermal unit, which is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a
one-pound mass of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
 
“Completion.” The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent
equipment for the production of oil or natural gas or, in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of
abandonment to the appropriate agency.
“Development well.” A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir to the
depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
 
“Differential.” An adjustment to the price of oil or natural gas from an established spot market
price to reflect differences in the quality and/or location of oil or natural gas.
 
“Dry hole” or “dry well.” A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient
quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and
taxes.
“Drilled but uncompleted well.” A well that has been drilled but has not undergone the final steps
of hydraulic fracturing and procedures necessary to place the well on production.
“Exploratory well.” A well drilled to find and produce natural gas or oil reserves not classified as
proved, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of natural gas or oil in
another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir.
“Field.” An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to,
the same individual geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition. The field name refers
to the surface area, although it may refer to both the surface and the underground productive
formations.
 
“Formation.” A layer of rock that has distinct characteristics that differs from nearby rock.
 
“Horizontal drilling.” A drilling technique used in certain formations where a well is drilled
vertically to a certain depth and then drilled at a right angle within a specified interval.
 
“MBbl.” One thousand barrels.
 
“MBoe.” One thousand Boe.
 
“Mcf.” One thousand cubic feet.
"MMcf." One million cubic feet.
 
“NGLs.” Natural gas liquids. Hydrocarbons found in natural gas that may be extracted as
liquefied petroleum gas and natural gasoline.
 
“NYMEX.” The New York Mercantile Exchange.
 
“Operator.” The individual or company responsible for the exploration and/or production of an oil
or natural gas well or lease.
 
“Plugging.” The sealing off of fluids in the strata penetrated by a well so that the fluids from one
stratum will not escape into another or to the surface.
1
Table of Contents
“Proved developed reserves.” Reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing
wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
“Proved reserves.” The estimated quantities of oil, NGLs and natural gas that geological and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable in future
years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
“Realized price.” The cash market price less all expected quality, transportation and demand
adjustments.
 
“Recompletion.” The completion for production of an existing wellbore in another formation from
which the well has been previously completed.
 
“Reserves.” Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related
substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of
development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a
reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the
production, installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to market and
all permits and financing required to implement the project. Reserves should not be assigned to
adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are
penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to
areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non‑productive reservoir
(i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir or negative test results). Such areas may
contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered
accumulations).
“Reservoir.” A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation
of producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is
separate from other reservoirs.
 
“SEC.” The United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
“Spot market price.” The cash market price without reduction for expected quality, transportation
and demand adjustments.
 
“Wellbore.” The hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for oil and natural gas production on a
completed well. Also called well or borehole.
 
“Working interest.” The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and
own oil, natural gas or other minerals. The working interest owners bear the exploration,
development and operating costs on either a cash, penalty or carried basis.
 
“WTI.” West Texas Intermediate.

NOTE 1—NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
Organization and Description of the Business
 
RSP Permian, Inc. ("RSP Inc." or the "Company") was formed on September 30, 2013, pursuant
to the laws of the state of Delaware to be a holding company for RSP Permian, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company (“RSP LLC”). RSP LLC was formed on October 18, 2010, by
its management team and affiliates of Natural Gas Partners, a family of energy-focused private
equity investment funds (“NGP”). The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploration,
development and production of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas
reserves in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The Company priced its initial public offering
("IPO") and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RSPP in January
2014. Additional background on the Company, its IPO and subsequent public stock offerings,
along with details of the ownership of the Company, are available in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and other documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
 
Basis of Presentation
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the SEC. They reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of
management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods, on a basis
consistent with the annual audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain information, accounting policies, and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been omitted pursuant to
such rules and regulations, although the Company believes the disclosures are adequate to
make the information presented not misleading. The financial statements in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10–Q should be read together with the financial statements and notes thereto included
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which
contains a complete summary of the Company's significant accounting policies and disclosures.
Subsequent Events
 
The Company has evaluated events that occurred subsequent to June 30, 2016 in preparing its
consolidated financial statements. There were no material subsequent events requiring
additional disclosure in these consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Although management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual
results could differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded prospectively.
Significant assumptions are required in the valuation of proved oil and natural gas reserves that
may affect the amount at which oil and natural gas properties are recorded. Estimation of asset
retirement obligations (“AROs”) and valuations of derivative instruments also require significant
assumptions. It is possible that these estimates could be revised at future dates and these
revisions could be material. Depletion of oil and natural gas properties are determined using
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in
the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of production
and the timing of development expenditures. Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and
unproved oil and natural gas properties are subject to numerous uncertainties including, among
others, estimates of future recoverable reserves and commodity price estimates.

Accounts receivable, which are primarily from the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
(“NGLs”), are accrued based on estimates of the volumetric sales and prices the Company
believes it will receive. In addition, settled but uncollected derivative contracts, and receivables
related to joint interest billings are included in accounts receivable. The Company routinely
reviews outstanding balances, assesses the financial strength of its customers and records a
reserve for amounts not expected to be fully recovered. The need for an allowance is determined
based upon reviews of individual accounts, historical losses, existing economic conditions and
other pertinent factors. Management's expectations are that all material receivables at period-end
will be collected. Bad debt expense was zero for each of the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
 
The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities. Costs incurred by the Company related to the acquisition of
oil and natural gas properties and the cost of drilling development wells and successful
exploratory wells are capitalized, while the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed
when determined to be unsuccessful.
 
The Company may capitalize interest on expenditures for significant exploration and
development projects that last more than six months, while activities are in progress to bring the
assets to their intended use. The Company has not capitalized any interest as projects generally
lasted less than six months. Costs incurred to maintain wells and related equipment, lease and
well operating costs and other exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses
arising from the sale of properties are generally included in operating income.
Capitalized acquisition costs attributable to proved oil and natural gas properties and leasehold
costs are depleted on a field level, based on proved reserves, using the unit-of-production
method. Capitalized exploration well costs and development costs, including AROs, are depleted
on a field level, based on proved developed reserves. For the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, depletion expense for oil and natural gas producing property was $46.9 million and
$39.3 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, depletion
expense for oil and natural gas producing property was $91.1 million and $70.3 million,
respectively. Depletion expense is included in depreciation, depletion and amortization in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
 
The Company’s oil and natural gas properties as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
consisted of the following: 
 
 
Proved oil and natural gas properties
Unproved oil and natural gas properties 883,547

In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been
found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be
capitalized if the anticipated reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing
well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of
the project is being made. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no costs
capitalized in connection with exploratory wells in progress.
 
Capitalized costs are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To determine if a field is
impaired, the Company compares the carrying value of the field to the undiscounted future net
cash flows by applying estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future

production of oil and natural gas reserves over the economic life of the property and deducting
future costs. Future net cash flows are based upon our reservoir engineers’ estimates of proved
reserves.
 
For a property determined to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the difference between the
property’s carrying value and its estimated fair value is recognized. Fair value, on a field basis, is
estimated to be the present value of the aforementioned expected future net cash flows. Each
part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment, including the determination of the
depletable units’ estimated reserves, future net cash flows and fair value. No impairment of
proved property was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015. The calculation
of expected future net cash flows in impairment evaluations are mainly based on estimates of
future oil and natural gas prices, proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable reserve quantities,
and estimates of future production and capital costs associated with our proved and risk-adjusted
reserves. The Company's estimates for future oil and natural gas prices used in the impairment
evaluations are based on observable prices for the next three years, and then held constant for
the remaining lives of the properties. It is reasonably possible that oil and natural gas prices used
in future impairment evaluations may decline, which would result in the need to further impair the
carrying value of the Company's properties.
Unproved property costs and related leasehold expirations are assessed quarterly for potential
impairment and when industry conditions dictate an impairment may be possible. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016, impairment expense of unproved property was $3.4 million, which
primarily related to management's expectation that certain leasehold interests would expire and
not be renewed, along with certain leasehold interests that may expire or be sold in the future. No
impairment of unproved property was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Asset Retirement Obligation
 
The Company records AROs related to the retirement of long-lived assets at the time a legal
obligation is incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. AROs are recorded as long-
term liabilities with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Subsequently, the asset retirement cost included in the carrying amount of the related
asset is allocated to expense through depletion of the asset. Changes in the liability due to
passage of time are generally recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability
and as corresponding accretion expense.
The Company estimates a fair value of the obligation on each well in which it owns an interest by
identifying costs associated with the future down-hole plugging, dismantlement and removal of
production equipment and facilities, and the restoration and reclamation of the surface acreage to
a condition similar to that existing before oil and natural gas extraction began.
In general, the amount of ARO and the costs capitalized will be equal to the estimated future cost
to satisfy the abandonment obligation using current prices that are escalated by an assumed
inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date which is then discounted back to the date that
the abandonment obligation was incurred using an estimated credit adjusted rate. If the
estimated ARO changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the ARO and the long-lived asset.
Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to
estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment.
After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using the same
assumed credit adjusted rate and the associated capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-
production basis.
The ARO consisted of the following for the period indicated:

Income Tax Benefit$ (4,438
 
Deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between
the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, given the provisions of enacted tax
laws. Tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more-likely-than-not threshold, and
those tax positions requiring recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is
greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority
that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company’s policy is to record interest and
penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. At June 30, 2016, the
Company did not have any accrued liability for uncertain tax positions and does not anticipate
recognition of any significant liabilities for uncertain tax positions during the next 12 months.
 
The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2011 and beyond, and its Texas franchise tax
returns for 2010 and beyond, remain subject to examination by the taxing authorities. No other
jurisdiction’s returns are significant to the Company’s financial position.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard
Update ("ASU") 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation Topic 718: Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," which simplifies several aspects of the
accounting for share-based payment award transactions. These simplifications include the
income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. Public entities are required to apply ASU 2016-09
for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of this guidance on its consolidated
financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)," which requires all lease
transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) to be recognized on the balance sheet as lease
assets and lease liabilities. Public entities are required to apply ASU 2016-02 for annual and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of this guidance on its
consolidated financial statements.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for
Measurement-Period Adjustments," which requires the acquirer in a business combination
recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period
in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Public entities are
required to apply ASU 2015-16 for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs." which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of the debt obligation, similar to debt discounts. The
Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016. Accordingly, debt issuance costs in
the amount of $12.1 million which were formerly classified as long-term assets at December 31,
2015 have been reclassified as a deduction from the carrying amount of our senior notes in the
consolidated balance sheet.
In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and
Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)," which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items in US
GAAP. An entity is required to apply ASU 2015-01 for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. An entity may apply ASU 2015-01 prospectively or
retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements. The adoption of this guidance
in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” which requires a company’s management to evaluate
whether there are conditions and events that raise
11
Table of Contents
substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after
the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued when applicable). An entity is
required to apply ASU 2014-15 for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of its pending adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606),” which provides a comprehensive revenue recognition standard for contracts with
customers that supersedes current revenue recognition guidance including industry specific
guidance. An entity is required to apply ASU 2014-09 for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. An entity can apply ASU 2014-09 using either a full
retrospective method, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a
modified retrospective method, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is
recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of this guidance on its consolidated
financial statements.
NOTE 3—ACQUISITIONS OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTY INTERESTS
Recent Acquisitions
In the first six months of 2016, the Company closed on acquisitions of mostly undeveloped
acreage for an aggregate total of approximately $43.5 million. The acquisitions included
additional working interests in properties where we owned existing interests as well as other
properties in our core areas, some of which we took over operations. These acquisitions were
funded with cash on hand.
WPR Acquisition
 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company acquired undeveloped acreage and oil and gas
producing properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $137 million, subject to
certain purchase price adjustments, from Wolfberry Partners Resources LLC ("WPR"), an entity
partly owned by affiliates of the Company.  Approximately $41.0 million was recorded as proved
oil and gas properties. The acquisition included 4,100 largely contiguous net acres, in the core of
the Midland Basin with production of approximately 1,900 Boe/d and 86 net horizontal drilling
locations as of the effective date.
Glass Ranch Acquisition
 
In the third quarter of 2015, the Company acquired undeveloped acreage and oil and gas
producing properties located in Martin and Glasscock counties for an aggregate purchase price
of approximately $313 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments.  The aggregate
acquisitions include 6,548 net acres in our core focus area with an average royalty burden of
approximately 23%, with production of approximately 1,680 Boe/d and 191 net horizontal drilling
locations as of the effective date.
NOTE 4—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Commodity Derivative Instruments
The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to cash-flow variability from
commodity-price risk inherent in its crude oil and natural gas production. These include collar
contracts and deferred premium put options. The derivative instruments are recorded at fair value
on the consolidated balance sheets and any gains and losses are recognized in current period
earnings.
 
Each collar transaction has an established price floor and ceiling, and certain collar transactions
also include a short put as well. When the settlement price is below the price floor established by
these collars, the Company receives an amount from its counterparty equal to the difference
between the settlement price and the price floor multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When
the settlement price is above the price ceiling established by these collars, the Company pays its
counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the price ceiling
multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is below the short put price,
the Company pays its counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement
price and the short put price.
Each deferred premium put option has an established floor price. When the settlement price is
below the floor price, the Company receives the difference between the floor price and the
settlement price multiplied by the hedged contract volume less the cost of the premium for the
option. When the settlement price is at or above the floor price, the Company receives no
12

proceeds and pays the cost of the premium for the option. In either case, whether the settlement
price is below or above the floor price, the Company pays the premium for the option at the
expiration of the option.

NOTE 5—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
$ (3,994
)  $ 3,994
$—
14
Table of Contents
The book values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.  The
book value of the Company’s credit facilities approximate fair value as the interest rates are
variable.  The book value of the Company's senior notes approximates the fair value as the
current trading value of the notes was slightly above par value. If the Company recorded the
notes at fair value they would be Level 1 in our fair value hierarchy as they are traded in an active
market with quoted prices for identical instruments. The fair value of derivative financial
instruments is determined utilizing industry standard models using assumptions and inputs which
are substantially observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments. These
include market price curves, contract terms and prices, credit risk adjustments, implied market
volatility and discount factors.
 
The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities measured at fair value, based on the
priority of inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized
based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:
 
•Level 1—Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value for which values are based on unadjusted
quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that management has the ability
to access. Active markets are considered to be those in which transactions for the assets or
liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing
basis.
•Level 2—Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value for which values are based on quoted
prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or
indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Substantially all of these inputs are
observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the price risk management instrument
and can be derived from observable data or supported by observable levels at which
transactions are executed in the marketplace.
•Level 3—Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value for which values are based on prices or
valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall
fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. These
inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would
use in pricing the asset or liability.
 
Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and
liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair
value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities
within the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

2015.
 
Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities
 
Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are recorded at their fair value on the
date of acquisition. Significant Level 3 assumptions associated with the calculation of future cash
flows used in the analysis of fair value of the oil and natural gas property acquired include the
Company’s estimate of future commodity prices, production costs, development expenditures,
production, risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. Additionally, fair value is used to
determine the inception value of the Company’s AROs. The inputs used to determine such fair
value are primarily based upon costs incurred historically for similar work, as well as estimates
from independent third parties for costs that would be incurred to restore leased property to the
contractually stipulated condition. Additions to the Company’s AROs represent a nonrecurring
Level 3 measurement.
 
The Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment purposes by
comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the
unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. Significant assumptions associated with the
calculation of future cash flows used in the impairment analysis include the estimate of future
commodity prices, production costs, development expenditures, production, risk-adjusted
discount rates and other relevant data. As such, the fair value of oil and natural gas properties
used in estimating impairment represents a nonrecurring Level 3 measurement.

Credit Agreement
On August 24, 2015, the Company amended the revolving credit facility to increase the
borrowing base to $600 million along with other updates.
The Company's revolving credit facility requires it to maintain the following three financial ratios:
•a working capital ratio, which is the ratio of consolidated current assets (includes unused
commitments under its revolving credit facility and excludes restricted cash and derivative
assets) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long-term debt under
the credit facility and derivative liabilities), of not less than 1.0 to 1.0;
•a leverage ratio, which is the ratio of the sum of all of the Company’s debt to the consolidated
EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) for the four fiscal quarters then ended, of not
greater than 4.5 to 1.0; and
•a senior secured leverage ratio, which is the ratio of the sum of all the Company's debt that is (i)
secured and (ii) not subordinated to obligations under the revolving credit facility to the
consolidated EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) for the four fiscal quarters then
ended, of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0.
 
The Company's revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit its ability to,
among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make loans to others, make investments,
enter into mergers, make or declare dividends, enter into commodity hedges exceeding a
specified percentage or its expected production, enter into interest rate hedges exceeding a
specified percentage of its outstanding indebtedness, incur liens, sell assets or engage in certain
other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.
16
Table of Contents
The Company was in compliance with such covenants and ratios as of June 30, 2016.
 
Principal amounts borrowed are payable on the maturity date, and interest is payable quarterly
for base rate loans and at the end of the applicable interest period for Eurodollar loans. The
Company has a choice of borrowing in Eurodollars or at the alternate base rate. Eurodollar loans
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate (equal to the quotient of: (i) the
LIBOR rate divided by (ii) a percentage equal to 100% minus the maximum rate on such date at
which the Administrative Agent is required to maintain reserves on “Eurocurrency Liabilities” as
defined in and pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System) plus an applicable margin ranging from 100 to 200 basis points, depending on the
percentage of its borrowing base utilized. Alternate base rate loans bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the greatest of: (i) the agent bank’s referenced rate; (ii) the federal funds effective
rate plus 100 basis points; and (iii) the adjusted LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, plus an
applicable margin ranging from 0 to 100 basis points, depending on the percentage of its
borrowing base utilized, plus a facility fee of 0.50% charged on the borrowing base amount. At
June 30, 2016, the prime borrowing rate of interest under the Company’s revolving credit facility
was 3.50%. RSP LLC may repay any amounts borrowed prior to the maturity date without any
premium or penalty other than customary LIBOR breakage costs. As of June 30, 2016, the
revolving credit facility has a margin of 1.00% to 2.00% plus LIBOR, plus a facility fee of 0.50%
charged on the borrowing base amount. As of June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings and $0.6
million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $599.4 million of
borrowing capacity.
The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing
base that is re-determined semiannually each May and November and depends on the volumes
of proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimated cash flows from these reserves and
commodity hedge positions. The borrowing base under the Company’s amended and restated
credit agreement is $600 million as of June 30, 2016, with lender commitments of $1 billion. The
maturity date of the Company's revolving credit facility is August 29, 2019.
    
Senior Notes Due 2022
On September 26, 2014, the Company issued $500.0 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes
at par through a private placement. On August 10, 2015, the Company issued an additional
$200.0 million of these notes at 99.25% of the principal amount through a private placement. The
notes will mature on October 1, 2022. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank
equally with all of our future senior indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to all our existing
and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such
indebtedness, including borrowings under RSP LLC's revolving credit facility, and will rank
senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. Interest on these notes is
payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1. On or after October 1, 2017, the Company may
redeem some or all of the notes, with certain restrictions, at a redemption price, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, of 104.969% of principal, declining in twelve-month intervals to 100% in 2020
and thereafter. In addition, prior to October 1, 2017, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the
principal amount of the notes with the net proceeds of qualified offerings of our equity at a
redemption price of 106.625% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest.
The Company incurred approximately $11.3 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2014
note issuance and $2.4 million related to the 2015 note issuance, which are a reduction to “Long-
term debt” on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized to interest
expense, net, over the life of the notes using the effective interest method. In the event of certain
changes in control of the Company, each holder of notes will have the right to require us to
repurchase all or any part of the notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. RSP LLC, our 100% owned
and only subsidiary, has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. RSP Inc. does not have
independent assets or operations. The terms of the notes include, among other restrictions,
limitations on our ability to repurchase shares, incur debt, create liens, make investments,
transfer or sell assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or transfer all
or substantially all of our assets. In June 2015, the Company exchanged $500.0 million of these
notes for registered notes with the same terms. In March 2016, the Company exchanged an
additional $200.0 million of these notes for registered notes with the same terms. The Company
was in compliance with the provisions of the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes as
of June 30, 2016.
    
NOTE 7—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Legal Matters
 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may at times be subject to claims and legal
actions. Management believes it is remote that the impact of such matters will have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Environmental Matters
 
The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment. These laws, which are often changing, regulate the discharge of
materials into the environment and may require the Company to remove or mitigate the
environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various
sites. Environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred. The Company has established
procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental
exposures and to comply with regulatory policies and procedures.
 
The Company accounts for environmental contingencies in accordance with the accounting
guidance related to accounting for contingencies. Environmental expenditures that relate to
current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or future revenue
generation, are expensed.
 
Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or clean-ups are probable and the
costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are generally undiscounted unless the timing
of cash payments is fixed and readily determinable. At

both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no environmental matters
requiring specific disclosure or requiring the recognition of a liability.
Contractual Obligations
 
The Company had no material changes in its contractual commitments and obligations from
amounts listed under "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity -
Contractual Obligations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.
 
NOTE 8—EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
 
Equity-based compensation expense, which was recorded in general and administrative
expenses, was $4.2 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. This equity-based compensation expense was $7.3 million and $4.5 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Restricted Stock Awards
In connection with the IPO, the Company adopted the RSP Permian, Inc. 2014 Long Term
Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”) for the employees, consultants and directors of the Company and its
affiliates who perform services for the Company.
 
Equity-based compensation expense for awards under the LTIP was $2.2 million and $1.6
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This same expense
was $4.1 million and $3.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2016, the vesting for certain shares was accelerated and resulted in $0.3
million of additional equity-based compensation expense.
The Company views restricted stock awards with graded vesting as single awards with an
expected life equal to the average expected life and amortize the awards on a straight-line basis
over the life of the awards.
 
The compensation expense for these awards was determined based on the market price of the
Company’s common stock at the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that were
anticipated to fully vest. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had unrecognized compensation
expense of $12.2 million related to restricted stock awards which is expected to be recognized
over a weighted average period of 2.1 years.

In June 2014, performance-based restricted stock awards were granted containing
predetermined market conditions with a cliff vesting period of 2.75 years. We granted 134,400 of
these shares at a 100% of target payout while the conditions of the grants allow for a payout
ranging between no payout and 200% of target. In March 2015, an additional grant of
performance-based restricted stock awards were granted containing predetermined market
conditions with a cliff vesting period of 2.83 years. We granted 159,932 of these shares at a
100% of target payout while the conditions of the grants allow for a payout ranging between no
payout and 200% of target. In February 2016, an additional grant of performance-based restricted
stock awards were granted containing predetermined market conditions with a cliff vesting period
of 2.92 years. We granted 484,650 of these shares at a 100% of target payout while the
conditions of the grants allow for a payout ranging from no payout and 100% of target payout.

Table of Contents
Equity-based compensation for these awards was $2.0 million and $0.8 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This equity-based compensation expense
was $3.2 million and $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2016, the vesting for certain shares was accelerated and resulted in $0.4
million of additional equity-based compensation expense.
The compensation expense for these performance based awards is based on a per share value
using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The payout level is calculated based on actual total shareholder
return performance achieved during the performance period compared to a defined peer group of
comparable public companies. The unrecognized compensation expense related to these shares
is approximately $9.2 million as of June 30, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over the next
1.97 years.

NOTE 9—EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
The Company’s basic earnings per share amounts have been computed using the two-class
method based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the
period.  Because the Company recognized a net loss for each period presented below, all
unvested restricted share awards were not recognized in diluted earnings per share calculations
as they would be antidilutive.  A reconciliation of the components of basic and diluted earnings
per common share is presented in the table below:

Item 2.                                 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.
 
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in
“Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements.”  The following discussion and analysis contains forward-
looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies,
objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Please see “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and
“Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
 
Our Predecessor and RSP Inc.
 
RSP Inc. was formed in September 2013 and, prior to the consummation of our IPO, did not have
historical financial operating results. The historical results of RSP LLC and Rising Star Energy
Development Co., L.L.C. , our predecessor, have been consolidated for all periods presented
prior to the IPO date. In connection with the IPO, pursuant to the terms of a corporate
reorganization, RSP LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of RSP Inc. RSP LLC was formed
in 2010 to engage in acquisition, exploration, development, and production of unconventional oil
and associated liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin of West Texas. See “Part
II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations: The IPO and Related Transactions - Corporate Reorganization” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information. Also in
connection with the IPO, Rising Star contributed to RSP Inc. certain assets that represent
substantially all of Rising Star’s production and revenues for each of the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012 in exchange for shares of RSP Inc.’s common stock and cash. See
“Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations: The IPO and Related Transactions - The Rising Star Acquisition” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information.
 
Overview and Outlook
Our financial and operating performance and significant events in 2016 include the following
highlights:
•
Increased our average daily production rate 33% for the second quarter of 2016 as compared to
the same period in 2015, and 7% as compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Decreased our cash operating costs on a per Boe basis 26% from $13.58 to $9.99 for the
second quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, and these costs were flat as
compared to the first quarter of 2016. These costs include lease operating expense, production
and ad valorem taxes, and general and administrative expense excluding equity based
compensation expense.
•Reaffirmed our borrowing base under the credit facility at $600.0 million in May 2016.
Acquired (with cash on hand) approximately $43.5 million of additional oil and gas properties in
the Midland Basin.
•
•
Our average daily production rate during the second quarter of 2016 was 26,407 Boe/d, a 33%
increase from our second quarter 2015 average daily production of 19,879 Boe/d, and a 7%
increase from our first quarter 2016 average daily production of 24,615 Boe/d. Oil production was
73% of total production on a volumetric basis and 92% of our total revenues in the second quarter
of 2016.
During the second quarter of 2016, we participated in the drilling of 20 horizontal wells (10
operated) and participated in the completion of 17 horizontal wells (11 operated). Two of the
drilled operated horizontal wells noted above were included in a second quarter acquisition, in
which we purchased and took over operations on these wells which were drilled but
uncompleted. In our vertical drilling program, we completed 1 operated vertical well.
•
How We Evaluate Our Operations
 
We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our
operations, including:
 
•production volumes;
revenues on the sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas, including the effect of our commodity
derivative contracts on our production;
•operating expenses; and
•capital efficiency
  
Due to the inherent volatility in commodity prices, we have historically used commodity derivative
instruments, such as collars, swaps and puts, to hedge price risk associated with a significant
portion of our anticipated production. Our hedging
21
Table of Contents
instruments allow us to reduce, but not eliminate, the potential effects of the variability in cash
flow from operations due to fluctuations in commodity prices and provide increased certainty of
cash flows for our drilling program and debt service requirements. These instruments provide
only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices and may partially limit our
potential gains from future increases in prices. None of our instruments are used for trading
purposes. We do not speculate on commodity prices but rather attempt to hedge a portion of our
physical production in order to protect our returns. Our revolving credit facility limits our ability to
enter into commodity hedges covering greater than 85% of our reasonably anticipated projected
production volume.
 
We will continue to use commodity derivative instruments to hedge our price risk in the future.
Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined at our discretion and
may be different than what we have done on a historical basis. We are not under an obligation to
hedge a specific portion of our production.
Our open positions as of June 30, 2016 were as follows:

The Company's updated capital budget for drilling, completion, and infrastructure for 2016 is
approximately $285 to $315 million which anticipates operating three horizontal rigs for the
second half of the third quarter and through the end of 2016. In addition, we plan on operating
one dedicated completion crew for the rest of 2016. We will continue to monitor commodity
prices, our cash flow and returns to determine any adjustments to our capital budget. We intend
to complete a majority of our drilled but uncompleted well inventory in 2016, which will enable us
to have a higher completion count than typically associated with our 2016 rig program.
Our 2016 capital budget excludes acquisitions and additions to leasehold and is subject to
change depending upon a number of factors, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil,
NGLs and natural gas, results of horizontal drilling and completions, economic and industry
conditions at the time of drilling, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling
prospects, our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on
reasonable terms.

The following table shows the relationship between our average realized oil price as a
percentage of the average NYMEX price and the relationship between our average realized
natural gas price as a percentage of the average NYMEX price for the periods indicated.
Management uses the realized price to NYMEX margin analysis to analyze trends in our oil and
natural gas revenues. The NYMEX WTI futures price is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of
domestic and imported oil in the United States. The actual prices realized from the sale of oil
differ from the quoted NYMEX WTI price as a result of quality and location differentials. For
example, the prices we realize on the oil we produce are affected by the ability to transport crude
oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma transport hub and the Gulf Coast refineries. The NYMEX Henry
Hub price of natural gas is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United

States. Similar to oil, the actual prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted
NYMEX Henry Hub price as a result of quality and location differentials. For example, depending
on pricing, liquids‑rich natural gas with a high Btu content may sell at a premium to low Btu
content dry natural gas because it yields a greater quantity of NGLs. Location differentials to
NYMEX Henry Hub prices result from variances in transportation costs based on the natural gas’
proximity to the major consuming markets to which it is ultimately delivered. Also affecting the
differential is the processing fee deduction retained by the natural gas processing plant generally
in the form of percentage of proceeds.

Our average realized oil price as a percentage of the average NYMEX price was 93% for both
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. All of our oil contracts are impacted by the
Midland-Cushing differential, which was a negative $0.17 per Bbl for the second quarter of 2016
and a negative $0.60 per Bbl in the comparable 2015 period.
 
Oil revenues increased 1% to $74.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $73.9
million for the 2015 period as a result of an increase in oil production volumes of 383 MBbls, or
28%, partially offset by an $11.18 per Bbl decrease, or 21%, in our average realized price for oil.
 
Natural gas revenues increased 25% and were $2.5 million and $2.0 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Natural gas production volumes increased by 696
MMcf, or 68%, which was partially offset by prices decreasing by $0.50 per Mcf, or 25%.
 
NGL revenues increased 65% to $4.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $2.5
million for the 2015 period as a result of a $2.00 per Bbl increase, or 21%, in our average realized
NGL price and an increase in NGL production volumes of 95 MBbls, or 37%.

Lease Operating Expenses.  Lease operating expenses decreased 4% to $14.1 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 from $14.7 million for the 2015 period. The decrease was
primarily attributable to increased operating efficiencies and cost reduction efforts in 2016. On a
per Boe basis, lease operating expense, excluding gathering and transportation costs,
decreased from $7.63 per Boe in 2015 to $5.37 per Boe in 2016. Gathering and transportation
costs, which are included in lease operating expenses, were $1.2 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and $0.9 million for the 2015 period. On a per Boe basis, our gathering and
transportation costs were $0.49 for both the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Production and Ad Valorem Taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased 8% to $5.0
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $5.4 million for 2015, and decreased 31%
on a per Boe basis to $2.06 per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2016 mainly due to
lower revenues per Boe.
 
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”)
expense increased 19% to $47.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $39.6
million for the 2015 period mainly due to increased production.  The DD&A rate decreased 10%
to $19.68 per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $21.90 per Boe for the 2015
period. The decrease in depletion per Boe in 2016 was due to an increase in our reserve
volumes over the last year from acquisitions as well as successful drilling activities, somewhat
offset by an increase in capitalized costs in proved property over the last year from these same
activities.
 
Impairment of Unproved Properties. We incurred $3.2 million of impairment expense on our
unproved property for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The impairment related to
upcoming acreage lease expirations that the Company does not intend to develop. We may incur
additional unproved property impairments in the future due to acreage expirations and
25
Table of Contents
changes in development plans. We may incur proved property impairments in the future if
commodity prices remain low. The possibility and amount of any future impairment is difficult to
predict, and will depend, in part, upon future oil and gas prices, estimates of proved reserves and
future capital expenditures and production costs.
Exploration Expense. Exploration expense decreased from $0.9 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 to $0.4 million for the 2016 period due to less expenditures on geological
and geophysical activity in 2016.
 
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $9.1
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $6.9 million for the 2015 period primarily
due to increases in employee headcount and related expense including equity-based
compensation. Equity-based compensation expense, which was recorded in general and
administrative expenses, was $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and $2.4
million for the 2015 period. In the second quarter of 2016, the vesting on certain shares was
accelerated which resulted in $0.7 million of additional equity-based compensation expense.

Net Loss on Derivative Instruments. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded
a $3.7 million net loss as compared to a $13.0 million net loss in the 2015 period. The change
was a result of expiring contracts on derivative positions over the last year and the future
commodity price outlook as of June 30, 2016 as compared to June 30, 2015.
 
Interest Expense. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $13.0 million of
interest expense as compared to $9.4 million in the 2015 period. We expect our interest expense
to remain higher than the prior-year period as a result of the issuance of additional senior notes in
August 2015.
Income Tax Benefit. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $4.4 million of
income tax benefit compared to $6.0 million of income tax benefit in the 2015 period. The
increase is a result of a larger pre-tax loss in the 2016 period.

Table of Contents
The following table shows the relationship between our average realized oil price as a
percentage of the average NYMEX price and the relationship between our average realized
natural gas price as a percentage of the average NYMEX price for the periods indicated.
Management uses the realized price to NYMEX margin analysis to analyze trends in our oil and
natural gas revenues. The NYMEX WTI futures price is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of
domestic and imported oil in the United States. The actual prices realized from the sale of oil
differ from the quoted NYMEX WTI price as a result of quality and location differentials. For
example, the prices we realize on the oil we produce are affected by the ability to transport crude
oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma transport hub and the Gulf Coast refineries. The NYMEX Henry
Hub price of natural gas is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United
States. Similar to oil, the actual prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted
NYMEX Henry Hub price as a result of quality and location differentials. For example, depending
on pricing, liquids‑rich natural gas with a high Btu content may sell at a premium to low Btu
content dry natural gas because it yields a greater quantity of NGLs. Location differentials to
NYMEX Henry Hub prices result from variances in transportation costs based on the natural gas’
proximity to the major consuming markets to which it is ultimately delivered. Also affecting the
differential is the processing fee deduction retained by the natural gas processing plant generally
in the form of percentage of proceeds.

Our average realized oil price as a percentage of the average NYMEX price was 92% and 93%
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. All of our oil contracts are impacted by the
Midland-Cushing differential, which was a negative $0.01 per Bbl for the first six months of 2016
and a negative $1.29 per Bbl in the comparable 2015 period.
 
Oil revenues increased 4% to $126.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $121.2
million for the 2015 period as a result of an increase in oil production volumes of 1,008 MBbls, or
41%, partially offset by a $12.85 per Bbl decrease, or 26%, in our average realized price for oil.
 
Natural gas revenues increased 16% and were $4.9 million and $4.3 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Natural gas prices production volumes increased
by 1,201 MMcf, or 60%, partially offset by a decrease in natural gas prices of $0.59 per Mcf, or
28%.
 
NGL revenues increased 35% to $5.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $4.4
million for the 2015 period as a result of an increase in NGL production volumes of 190 MBbls, or
42%, partially offset by a $0.46 per Bbl decrease, or 5%, in our average realized NGL price.
Our higher production volumes for all products were primarily a result of increased production
from our drilling program, along with the full period impact of our acquisitions closed in 2015.

Lease Operating Expenses.  Lease operating expenses remained flat at $27.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 from $27.3 million for the 2015 period despite a significant increase
in production. On a per Boe basis, lease operating expense, excluding gathering and
transportation costs, decreased from $7.89 per Boe in 2015 to $5.45 per Boe in 2016. The
decrease was primarily attributable to higher production, increased operating efficiencies, and
cost reduction efforts in the 2016 period. Gathering and transportation costs, which are included
in lease operating expenses, were $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and $1.7
million for the 2015 period. On a per Boe basis, our gathering and transportation costs were
$0.40 and $0.53 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Production and Ad Valorem Taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased 5% to $9.1
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $9.6 million for 2015, and decreased 34% on
a per Boe basis to $1.96 per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2016 mainly due to lower
revenues per Boe.
 
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. DD&A expense increased 29% to $91.9 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 from $71.1 million for the 2015 period mainly due to increased
production.  The DD&A rate decreased 10% to $19.79 per Boe for the six months ended June 30,
2016 from $21.92 per Boe for the 2015 period. The decrease in depletion per Boe in 2016 was
due to an increase in our reserve volumes over the last year from acquisitions as well as
successful drilling activities, somewhat offset by an increase in capitalized costs in proved
property over the last year from these same activities.
 
Impairment of Unproved Properties. We incurred $3.4 million of impairment expense on our
unproved property for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The impairment related to upcoming
acreage lease expirations that the Company does not intend
29
Table of Contents
to develop. We may incur additional unproved property impairments in the future due to acreage
expirations and changes in development plans. We may incur proved property impairments in the
future if commodity prices remain low. The possibility and amount of any future impairment is
difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon future oil and gas prices, estimates of proved
reserves and future capital expenditures and production costs.
Exploration Expense. Exploration expense decreased from $2.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to $0.5 million for the 2016 period due to less expenditures on geological and
geophysical activity in 2016.
 
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $17.1
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $13.2 million for the 2015 period primarily
due to increases in employee headcount and related expense including equity-based
compensation. Equity-based compensation expense, which was recorded in general and
administrative expenses, was $7.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and $4.5
million for the 2015 period. In 2016, the vesting on certain shares was accelerated which resulted
in $0.7 million of additional equity-based compensation expense.

Interest Expense. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $25.9 million of
interest expense as compared to $18.7 million in the 2015 period. We expect our interest
expense to remain higher than the prior-year period as a result of the issuance of additional
senior notes in August 2015.
Income Tax Benefit. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $13.7 million of
income tax benefit compared to $6.3 million of income tax benefit in the 2015 period. The
increase is a result of a larger pre-tax loss in the 2016 period.
Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity
 
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from equity offerings,
borrowings under the revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes, and
cash flows from operations. To date, the Company’s primary use of capital has been for the
acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. At June 30, 2016, we
had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our borrowing base was
$600 million.
During the second quarter of 2016, we spent approximately $56.5 million on drilling and
completion activities, $1.1 million of infrastructure and other, and $14.4 million on oil and natural
gas property acquisitions. In the first six months of 2016, we incurred approximately $122.1
million on drilling and completion activities, $3.4 million on infrastructure and other, and $43.5
million on oil and natural gas property acquisitions.
We operate a high percentage of our acreage; therefore, the amount and timing of these capital
expenditures are largely discretionary. We may elect to defer a portion of planned 2016 capital
expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including: returns generated by our drilling
program, the level of our expenditures in relation to our cash flow, the success of our drilling
activities; prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas; the availability of
necessary equipment,
30
Table of Contents
infrastructure and capital; the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals;
drilling, completion and acquisition costs; and the level of participation by other working interest
owners.
Based on current expectations, we believe we have sufficient liquidity through our existing cash
balances, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility
to execute our current capital program excluding any acquisitions we may enter into. However,
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas
production and prices, and additional capital expenditures may be required to more fully develop
our properties. In the event we make additional acquisitions and the amount of capital required is
greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to
reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we require
additional capital for that or other reasons, we may seek such capital through borrowings under
our revolving credit facility, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, asset
sales, offerings of debt and equity securities or other means. We cannot be assured that needed
capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain funds when
needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our current drilling program, which
could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations. In addition, we may not be able to
complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary
to maintain our production or replace our reserves.
 
Working Capital
 
Our working capital, which we define as current assets minus current liabilities, totaled $4.9
million and $110.1 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our collection
of receivables has historically been timely, and losses associated with uncollectible receivables
have historically not been significant. Our cash balances totaled $32.9 million and $142.7 million
at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Due to the amounts that accrue related to
our drilling program, we may incur working capital deficits in the future. We expect that our cash
flows from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient
to fund our working capital needs excluding any acquisitions we may enter into. We expect that
our pace of development, production volumes, commodity prices and differentials to NYMEX
prices for our oil, NGL and natural gas production will be the largest variables affecting our
working capital.
 
Contractual Obligations
 
We had no material changes in our contractual commitments and obligations from amounts listed
under "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations - Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity - Contractual Obligations" in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
As of June 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources and would be considered material to investors.

by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the 2015 period,
was primarily due a reduction in amounts received from our settled derivative contracts in the
2016 period.
 
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $172.7 million and $249.1 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

the six months ended June 30, 2015. The 2015 period included $147.0 million of capital
contributions received in follow-on stock offering.
 
Our Revolving Credit Facility
Our credit agreement has a borrowing base of $600 million, lenders’ maximum facility
commitments of $1.0 billion, and a maturity date of August 29, 2019. The credit agreement
permits RSP LLC to make payments to the Company to enable it to pay principal, premium (if
any) and interest on our existing notes, provided no default has occurred, and to allow RSP LLC
to guarantee the existing notes.
The amount available to be borrowed under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing
base that is redetermined semiannually each May and November and depends on the volumes
of our proved oil and natural gas reserves, estimated cash flows from these reserves and our
commodity hedge positions. Our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for
November 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings and $0.6 million of letters of credit
outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $599.4 million of borrowing capacity. In the
event of any future offerings of senior unsecured notes issued or guaranteed by RSP LLC, the
borrowing base under our revolving credit facility will be automatically reduced by an amount
equal to 0.25 multiplied by the aggregate principal amount of notes issued or guaranteed on the
date of such issuance.
Our revolving credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our properties and
guarantees from our subsidiaries other than any subsidiary that we have designated as an
unrestricted subsidiary.
Our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other
things:
•incur additional indebtedness;
•make loans to others;
•make investments;
•enter into mergers;
•make or declare dividends;
•enter into commodity hedges exceeding a specified percentage or our expected production;
•enter into interest rate hedges exceeding a specified percentage of our outstanding
indebtedness;
•incur liens;
•sell assets; and
•engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.
Our revolving credit facility also requires us to maintain the following three financial ratios:
•
•
•
a working capital ratio, which is the ratio of consolidated current assets (includes unused
commitments under our revolving credit facility and excludes restricted cash and derivative
assets) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long term debt under
the credit facility and derivative liabilities), of not less than 1.0 to 1.0;
a leverage ratio, which is the ratio of the sum of all of the Company's debt to the consolidated
EBITDAX (as defined in our revolving credit facility) for the four fiscal quarters then ended, of not
greater than 4.5 to 1.0:
a senior secured leverage ratio, which is the ratio of the sum of all the Company's debt that is (i)
secured and (ii) not subordinated to obligations under the revolving credit facility to the
consolidated EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) for the four fiscal quarters then
ended, of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0.
We were in compliance with such covenants and ratios as of June 30, 2016.
Principal amounts borrowed are payable on the maturity date, and interest is payable quarterly
for base rate loans and at the end of the applicable interest period for Eurodollar loans. The
Company has a choice of borrowing in Eurodollars or at the adjusted base rate. Eurodollar loans
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate (equal to the quotient of: (i) the
LIBOR Rate; divided by (ii) a percentage equal to 100% minus the maximum rate on such date at
which the Administrative Agent is required to maintain reserves on “Eurocurrency Liabilities” as
defined in and pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System) plus an applicable margin ranging from 100 to 200 basis points, depending on the
percentage of its borrowing base utilized. Alternate base rate loans bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the greatest of: (i) the agent bank’s referenced rate; (ii) the federal funds effective
rate plus 100 basis points; and (iii) the

adjusted LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0 to 100
basis points, depending on the percentage of our borrowing base utilized, plus a facility fee of
0.50% charged on the borrowing base amount. At June 30, 2016, the prime borrowing rate of
interest under the Company's revolving credit facility was 3.50%. RSP LLC may repay any
amounts borrowed prior to the maturity date without any premium or penalty other than customary
LIBOR breakage costs. As of June 30, 2016, the revolving credit facility has a margin of 1.00% to
2.00% plus LIBOR, plus a facility fee of 0.50% charged on the borrowing base amount.
Regulations
In June 2016, the SEC adopted a final rule that requires resource extraction issuers (“REIs”) to
disclose information relating to any payment made by the REI to foreign governments or the U.S.
government for the purpose of commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. REIs will
be required to comply with the final rule for fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2018,
and will be required to file a Form SD with the SEC within 150 days of a company's fiscal year-
end. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this final rule on its consolidated financial
statements.
Item 3.         Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
We are exposed to market risk, including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and
interest rates as described below. The primary objective of the following information is to provide
quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term
“market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices
and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future
losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. All of our market risk sensitive
instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading.
 
Commodity Price Risk
 
Our revenues are subject to market risk and are dependent on the pricing we receive for our oil,
NGLs and natural gas production. Pricing for oil, NGLs and natural gas has been volatile and
unpredictable for several years, and this volatility is expected to continue in the future. Our
realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing prices for oil and the prevailing spot prices
for NGLs and natural gas. We use derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to the changes in
the prices of these commodities. Pursuant to our risk management policy, we engage in these
activities as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated with projected production
levels. We do not use these instruments to engage in trading activities, and we do not speculate
on commodity prices.

The fair value of our derivative contracts as of June 30, 2016 was a net liability of $1.8 million.
For information regarding the terms of these hedges, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements."
 
Counterparty and Customer Credit Risk
 
Our commodity derivative contracts expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties. While we do not require counterparties to our derivative contracts to post
collateral, we do evaluate the credit standing of such counterparties as we deem appropriate.
The counterparties to our derivative contracts currently in place have investment grade ratings.
 
Our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables arising from joint operations and
receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production due to the concentration of our oil
and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. The inability or failure of our
significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may
adversely affect our financial results. However, we believe the credit quality of our customers is
high.
 
Joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells
we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases
on which we intend to drill. We have little ability to control whether these entities will participate
in our wells.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
At June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding that are subject to interest rate risk. We
currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity.
Item 4.         Controls And Procedures.
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), we
have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2016. Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in
reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.
Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016 at the
reasonable assurance level.
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There were no changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
