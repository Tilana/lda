<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This second report of the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to Council 
resolutions 15/21 and 21/16. This report describes the activities carried out by the mandate 
holder over the period 1 May 2012 to 28 February 2013, and addresses two key issues 
repeatedly evoked during the interactive dialogue with Council&#8217;s Member States in June 
</p>
<p>2012, namely, funding of associations and holding peaceful assemblies. In the light of 
Council resolution 21/16, specific attention is also paid to the importance of freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association to the work of civil society actors, including with 
respect to the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>2. In the preparation of this report, the Special Rapporteur convened a two-day expert 
meeting on 8 and 9 December 2012 in Mombasa, Kenya. He also took into account relevant 
elements of work available within the Council1  
</p>
<p>3. As already highlighted in his first thematic report, the Special Rapporteur underlines 
that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are interrelated and 
interdependent, but they are also two separate rights. The present report will therefore cover 
the right to freedom of association and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Communications  
</b></p>
<p>4. A total of 170 communications were sent by the Special Rapporteur from 1 May 
2012 to 28 February 2013. Observations on communications addressed throughout the year 
are contained in an addendum of the present report (A/HRC/23/39/Add.2). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits  
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur conducted a country mission from 14 to 23 January 2013 to 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He thanks the Government of 
the United Kingdom for its exemplary collaboration prior to and throughout his visit (see 
A/HRC/23/39/Add.2). He further thanks Azerbaijan, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, the 
Kyrgyz Republic, the Maldives, Rwanda and Tunisia for extending invitations to him, and 
hopes to honour these invitations in the near future.

</p>
<p><b> III. Ability of associations to access financial resources: a vital 
part of the right to freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definition of concepts  
</b></p>
<p>8. The ability to seek, secure and use resources is essential to the existence and 
effective operations of any association, no matter how small. The right to freedom of 
association not only includes the ability of individuals or legal entities to form and join an 
association but also to seek, receive and use resources &#8211; human, material and financial &#8211; 
from domestic, foreign, and international sources. 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See Joint recommendation put forward by United Nations and African Commission on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights special procedures mandate holders, available at 
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12524&amp;LangID=E.  </p>


<p>9. Legal frameworks and policies related to resources have a significant impact on the 
freedom of association; they can strengthen the effectiveness and facilitate the sustainability 
of associations or, alternatively, subjugate associations to a dependent and weak position. 
Moreover, for associations promoting human rights, including economic, social and cultural 
rights, or those involved in service delivery (such as disaster relief, health-care provision or 
environmental protection), access to resources is important, not only to the existence of the 
association itself, but also to the enjoyment of other human rights by those benefitting from 
the work of the association. Hence, undue restrictions on resources available to associations 
impact the enjoyment of the right to freedom of association and also undermine civil, 
cultural, economic, political and social rights as a whole. 
</p>
<p>10. The term &#8220;resources&#8221; encompasses a broad concept that includes financial transfers 
(e.g., donations, grants, contracts, sponsorships, social investments, etc.); loan guarantees 
and other forms of financial assistance from natural and legal persons; in-kind donations 
(e.g., contributions of goods, services, software and other forms of intellectual property, 
real property, etc.); material resources (e.g. office supplies, IT equipment, etc.); human 
resources (e.g. paid staff, volunteers, etc.); access to international assistance, solidarity; 
ability to travel and communicate without undue interference and the right to benefit from 
the protection of the State.  
</p>
<p>11. Due to word limit constraints, this section will primarily deal with the issue of 
financial resources, including monetary transfers, in-kind donations and other forms of 
financial assistance (hereinafter &#8220;funding&#8221;). The report covers financial resources provided 
by natural and legal persons, whether domestic, foreign or international, including 
individuals; associations, whether registered or unregistered; foundations; governments; 
corporations and international organizations (including United Nations funds and 
programmes). 
</p>
<p>12. In recent years, civil society actors have been facing increased control and undue 
restrictions in relation to funding they received, or allegedly received. Combined with the 
global financial crisis that has compelled some donors to reduce funding, this situation has, 
in many instances, led to a decline in the number of associations and a decrease in or 
readjustment of the activities of existing ones, or in worst cases, to the extinction of some 
associations. This problem is not isolated and exists in all parts of the world, usually as a 
result of undue restrictions occurring when an association: (a) seeks; (b) secures; or (c) uses 
financial resources; and these measures aim, in many cases, to silence the voices of dissent 
and critics.  
</p>
<p>13. This does not mean that associations do not have any obligations. Associations have 
to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended and that they are transparent and 
accountable to their donors, according to the terms of their funding agreements. It is crucial 
that associations &#8211; like other sectors in society &#8211; work with integrity and ethically as a way 
of generating trust within the sector. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur refers to a 
number of civil society-led initiatives, such as the International Non-Governmental 
Organisations (INGO) Accountability Charter, which are valuable examples of the sense of 
responsibility shown by civil society actors. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur believes domestic, foreign and international donors also 
have responsibilities. Donors should pay due attention to the local political, social and 
economic context in which associations operate, particularly associations working with 
grassroots communities, marginalized and vulnerable peoples, and on &#8220;unpopular&#8221; or 
cutting-edge issues. Donors should also respect the autonomy of civil society organizations 
so that associations can address the needs and concerns of the population. The Special 
Rapporteur deeply regrets that some domestic public donors exclusively fund associations 
which support Government policies, despite the fact that the right to freedom of association, 
which is an essential component of democracy, underlies a pluralism of views. The Special </p>


<p>Rapporteur also invites donors to diversify funding beneficiaries, and when applicable, take 
appropriate action to support associations facing undue restrictions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International legal framework related to the ability to access financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources  
</b></p>
<p>15. Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereafter the 
Covenant) affirms that &#8220;everyone shall have the right to freedom of association with others, 
including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.&#8221; Article 
6 (f) of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief (General Assembly resolution 36/55) explicitly 
refers to the freedom to access funding, stating that the right to freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion or belief shall include, inter alia, the freedom &#8220;to solicit and receive 
voluntary financial and other contributions from individuals and institutions.&#8221; On 21 March 
</p>
<p>2013, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 22/6, in which it called upon States to 
ensure that reporting requirements &#8220;do not inhibit functional autonomy [of associations]&#8221; 
</p>
<p>and &#8220;do not discriminatorily impose restrictions on potential sources of funding.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. In communication No. 1274/2004, the Human Rights Committee observed that &#8220;the 
right to freedom of association relates not only to the right to form an association, but also 
guarantees the right of such an association freely to carry out its statutory activities. The 
protection afforded by article 22 extends to all activities of an association [&#8230;].&#8221;3 
Accordingly, fundraising activities are protected under article 22 of the Covenant, and 
funding restrictions that impede the ability of associations to pursue their statutory activities 
constitute an interference with article 22. Other United Nations treaty bodies have 
emphasized the obligation of States to allow civil society to seek, secure, and utilize 
resources, including from foreign sources. The Committee on Economic, Social, and 
Cultural Rights highlighted this issue when it expressed &#8220;deep concern&#8221; with Egypt&#8217;s Law 
No. 153 of 1999, which &#8220;gives the Government control over the right of NGOs to manage 
</p>
<p>their own activities, including seeking external funding.&#8221;4 
</p>
<p>17. The Declaration on Human Rights Defenders5 constitutes another relevant frame of 
reference: article 13 states that &#8220;everyone has the right, <i>individually and in association with 
others</i>, to solicit, receive and utilize <i>resources</i> for the express purpose of promoting and 
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms through peaceful means, in accordance 
with article 3 of the present Declaration&#8221; (emphasis added). This provision is important 
</p>
<p>because it makes no distinction between the sources of funding, be it from domestic, 
foreign or international sources. It is also essential because it makes clear that not only 
legally registered associations, but also individuals &#8211; and therefore associations which have 
no legal status, such as unregistered associations &#8211; are eligible to access funding. Although 
the Declaration is not a binding instrument, it must be recalled that it was adopted by 
consensus by the General Assembly and contains a series of principles and rights that are 
based on human rights standards enshrined in other international instruments which are 
legally binding. It is clear from this standpoint that the guiding principles it sets forth 
notably emanate from the provisions of article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and can therefore be applied to other forms of associations, regardless

<p>of the goals they pursue. In the light of this reasoning, and taking due consideration of the 
provisions of the Covenant, which make no distinction between registered and unregistered 
associations, the Special Rapporteur underlines that legislation limiting foreign funding to 
registered associations only, as is the case in existing and draft legislation in Bangladesh, 
violate international human rights norms and standards pertaining to freedom of 
association. Furthermore, he recalls that the formation of associations should not be subject 
to a prior authorization procedure, but rather regulated by a system of notification that is 
simple, easily accessible, non-discriminatory and non-onerous or free of charge.6  
</p>
<p>18. Despite these clear legal obligations that not only call upon States to avoid placing 
restrictions, but also to facilitate access to funding, civil society actors are in too many 
instances subject to regulations put in place to control, rather than enable access to funding. 
The Special Rapporteur underlines that freedom of association may be subject to certain 
restrictions only, which need to meet the provisions of article 22, paragraph 2, of the 
Covenant. He underscores again that freedom should be the rule, and restrictions the 
exception.7 He also underlines that one of the key principles of freedom of association is the 
presumption that the activities of associations are lawful. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Meeting international human rights norms and standards  
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern laws and practices that constrain civil 
society organizations from seeking, receiving or utilizing foreign funding. As will be 
detailed in the following section of the report, most of the justifications put forward by 
States to restrict foreign funding do not comply with article 22, paragraph 2, of the 
Covenant, which states that &#8220;no restrictions may be placed on the exercise of [the right to 
freedom of association] other than those which are prescribed by law and which are 
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, 
public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the 
rights and freedoms of others.&#8221; As will be repeatedly emphasized in this section, the 
conditions for any restriction are cumulative, that is, motivated by one of the above limited 
interests, have a legal basis and &#8220;necessary in a democratic society&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. Under international law, problematic constraints include, inter alia, outright 
prohibitions to access funding; requiring CSOs to obtain Government approval prior to 
receiving funding; requiring the transfer of funds to a centralized Government fund; 
banning or restricting foreign-funded CSOs from engaging in human rights or advocacy 
activities; stigmatizing or delegitimizing the work of foreign-funded CSOs by requiring 
them to be labeled as &#8220;foreign agents&#8221; or other pejorative terms; initiating audit or 
inspection campaigns to harass CSOs; and imposing criminal penalties on CSOs for failure 
to comply with the foregoing constraints on funding. The ability of CSOs to access funding 
and other resources from domestic, foreign and international sources is an integral part of 
the right to freedom of association, and these constraints violate article 22 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other human rights instruments, 
including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur also warns that the political environment, where for instance 
patriarchy, sexism and authoritarian regimes are structural challenges, can also unduly 
undermine access to funding to civil society.8 Furthermore, criminalization in certain 
countries of peaceful activities, such as protection of human rights, non-discrimination and 
</p>
<p>

 7 Ibid., para. 16.  
 8 A/66/203, para. 73.  </p>


<p>equality or promotion of gender equality, can also make it difficult, if not impossible, for 
associations working on these issues to raise funds.9  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Financing terrorism  
</b></p>
<p>22. One of the most common reasons used by governments to limit access to funding 
relate to security measures, including protection against terrorism and prevention of money-
laundering. The crime of terrorism, which aims at the &#8220;destruction of human rights, 
fundamental freedoms and democracy, threaten[s] territorial integrity and security of States 
and destabiliz[es] legitimately constituted Governments&#8221;,10 has devastating consequences 
and has caused tragic human suffering. The Special Rapporteur is aware that States have an 
interest in protecting &#8220;national security or public safety&#8221;, which are legitimate grounds for 
restricting freedom of association, but he underscores that there is also need for States to 
comply with international human rights law while countering terrorism.    
</p>
<p>23. Under the Covenant, any limitation must not only pursue a legitimate interest but 
also be &#8220;necessary in a democratic society.&#8221; It is only when groups engage in the 
aforementioned confined activities that they can be labelled as a terrorist group. It is 
therefore a violation of international law for counter-terrorism or &#8220;anti-extremism&#8221; 
measures to be used as a pretext to constrain dissenting views or independent civil society.  
As highlighted by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights 
while countering terrorism, &#8220;[s]tates shall not invoke national security as a justification for 
measures aimed at suppressing opposition or to justify repressive practices against its 
population. The onus is on the Government to prove that a threat to one of the grounds for 
limitation exists and that the measures are taken to deal with the threat.&#8221;11 In order to meet 
the proportionality and necessity test, restrictive measures must be the least intrusive means 
to achieve the desired objective and be limited to the associations falling within the clearly 
identified aspects characterizing terrorism only. They must not target all civil society 
associations, as is regrettably the case in a new law against organized crime in Venezuela. 
Laws drafted in general terms limiting, or even banning funding under the justification of 
counter-terrorism do not comply with the requisites of &#8220;proportionality&#8221; and &#8220;necessity&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur also calls for sectoral equity, noting that commercial 
companies and other entities have been abused for terrorist purposes. He calls on States to 
avoid measures that disproportionately target or burden civil society organizations, such as 
imposing onerous vetting rules, procedures or other CSO-specific requirements not applied 
to the corporate sector writ large. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur notes a set of standards developed by the Financial Action 
Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body established in 1989, which specifically 
addresses the issue of money-laundering and terrorist financing. FATF Recommendation 8 
(formerly Special Recommendation VIII) on non-profit organizations recommends that 
&#8220;countries review the adequacy of laws and regulations [to ensure] entities are not abused 
</p>
<p>for the financing of terrorism.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur underlines &#8211;as does an instructive 
World Bank working paper analysing FATF&#8217;s response towards financing terrorism &#8211;, that 
very few, if any, instances of terrorism financing have been detected as a result of CSO-
specific supervisory measures; &#8220;rather it is financial intelligence that is essential.&#8221;12 
</p>
<p>  
 9 See for instance, the opinion adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 
</p>
<p>communication No. 39/2012 addressed to Belarus (A/HRC/WGAD/2012/39), para. 47. 
 10 Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/80, preambular para. 11.  
 11 See A/61/267, para. 20. 
 12 Emile van der Does de Willebois, <i>Nonprofit Organizations and the Combatting of Terrorism 
</i></p>
<p><i>Financing: A Proportionate Response</i>, World Bank Working Paper No. 208 (Washington D.C., 
 </p>


<p>Recommendation 8 does not adequately take into account that States already have other 
means, such as financial surveillance and police cooperation, to effectively address the 
terrorism financing threat. Moreover, FATF fails to provide for specific measures to protect 
the civil society sector from undue restrictions to their right to freedom of association by 
States asserting that their measures are in compliance with FATF Recommendation 8. The 
Special Rapporteur insists on the need to combat terrorism, but he warns against the 
implementation of restrictive measures &#8211; such as FATF Recommendation 8 &#8211; which have 
been misused by States to violate international law. 
</p>
<p>26. Fundamentally, the Special Rapporteur believes civil society organizations play a 
significant role in combatting terrorism. By their direct connections with the population and 
their prodigious work in, inter alia, poverty reduction, peacebuilding, humanitarian 
assistance, human rights and social justice, including in politically complex environments, 
civil society plays a crucial role against the threat of terrorism. Unduly restrictive measures, 
which can lead donors to withdraw support from associations operating in difficult 
environments, can in fact undermine invaluable CSO initiatives in the struggle against 
terrorism and extremism, and ultimately have adverse consequences on peace and security.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. State sovereignty against foreign interference 
</b></p>
<p>27. In recent years, the protection of State sovereignty or of the State&#8217;s traditional values 
against external interference has also been increasingly invoked to restrict foreign funding 
or to launch slander offensives against those receiving foreign funding. Foreign funding to 
civil society has been deliberately depicted as a new form of imperialism or neo-
colonialism and recipients have been subject to defamation, stigmatization and acts of 
harassment. This tendency has a serious impact on the work of civil society actors, not to 
mention their ability to access funding as it deters them from seeking foreign funding. This 
situation is particularly alarming for associations promoting human rights and democratic 
reforms who have been accused of &#8220;treason&#8221; or of &#8220;promoting regime change&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>28. For instance, in the Russian Federation, a new law adopted in July 2012 requires 
foreign-funded non-commercial organizations engaging in &#8220;political activities&#8221; &#8211; which is 
broadly defined as attempts to influence official decision-making or to shape public opinion 
for this objective &#8211; to register as organizations &#8220;performing the functions of foreign 
agents&#8221;, which in Russian is synonymous with &#8220;foreign spy&#8221;. The adoption of this law has 
been followed up by a series of audits of organizations, including prominent human rights 
organizations. In Egypt, the State-owned press has campaigned against civil society 
organizations, branding them as foreign agents due to foreign funding that some of them 
allegedly received. In Ethiopia, legislation not only prohibits associations working in rights-
based areas from receiving more than 10 per cent of their funding from foreign sources, but 
also requires associations to allocate at least 70 per cent of their budget to programme 
activities and no more than 30 per cent to administrative costs, which are broadly defined. 
The enforcement of these provisions has a devastating impact on individuals&#8217; ability to 
form and operate associations effectively, and has been the subject of serious alarm 
expressed by several United Nations treaty bodies.13 In the same vein, a law on 
associations, adopted in January 2012 in Algeria, prohibits associations from receiving 
funding from legations and foreign non-governmental organizations, unless a &#8220;cooperative 
relation duly established with the foreign entity&#8221; &#8211; subject to prior authorization from the 
relevant authorities &#8211; is in place. Serious concerns about this legislation were notably

<p>expressed by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression further to his mission to Algeria.14 
</p>
<p>29. It is paradoxical that some of the States stigmatizing foreign-funded associations in 
their own countries are receiving foreign funding themselves (in the form of loans, 
financing or development assistance), often in substantially greater amounts than that 
flowing to CSOs in their country. Others are the very same States providing funding to 
associations abroad, while rejecting foreign funding for associations in their own countries. 
But what is clear is that these new trends have a dramatic effect on civil society as they 
have not only resulted in restrictions to the enjoyment of freedom of association, but also 
led to further human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>30. In order to analyse whether the limitation motivated by the protection of State 
sovereignty complies with international human rights law, it must first be explored whether 
it falls within one of the limited legitimate grounds for restrictions. The protection of State 
sovereignty is not listed as a legitimate interest in the Covenant. The Special Rapporteur 
emphasizes that States cannot refer to additional grounds, even those provided by domestic 
legislation, and cannot loosely interpret international obligations to restrict the right to 
freedom of association. In his view, such justification cannot reasonably be included under 
&#8220;the interests of national security or public safety&#8221; or even &#8220;public order&#8221;. Affirming that 
</p>
<p>national security is threatened when an association receives funding from foreign source is 
not only spurious and distorted, but also in contradiction with international human rights 
law.  
</p>
<p>31. Human Rights Council resolution 22/6 calls upon States to ensure that &#8220;that no law 
should criminalize or delegitimize activities in defence of human rights on account of the 
origin of funding thereto.&#8221; Article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights requires States to &#8220;take steps, individually or through international 
assistance and co-operation [&#8230;] to the maximum of their available resources, with a view 
to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present 
Covenant&#8221;. Coupled with article 11 of the same Covenant, which provides for States to 
&#8220;take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of this right, recognizing to this effect the 
essential importance of international co-operation <i>based on free consent</i>&#8221; (emphasis added), 
this means that States have the obligation to mobilize resources that are available within the 
society as a whole, but also to gather those that are available from the international 
community.15 Hence, restrictions on foreign funding under the guise of preservation of 
State sovereignty arguably constitute a violation of States&#8217; obligation to respect, protect and 
fulfil these rights, as it amounts to failure on the part of the State to maximize resources 
through international assistance and cooperation. This is also the sense of the Maastricht 
Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which stipulate that 
violations of these rights notably include: &#8220;the adoption of legislation or policies which are 
</p>
<p>manifestly incompatible with pre-existing legal obligations relating to these rights [&#8230;]; the 
adoption of any deliberately retrogressive measure that reduces the extent to which any 
such right is guaranteed.&#8221;16  
</p>
<p>32. Protection of State sovereignty is not just an illegitimate excuse, but a fallacious 
pretext which does not meet the requirement of a &#8220;democratic society&#8221;. The expression

</p>

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1986), para. 72. </p>


<p>&#8220;democratic society&#8221; places the burden on States imposing restrictions to demonstrate that 
the limitations do not harm the principles of &#8220;pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness&#8221;.17 
Associations, whether domestic- or foreign-funded, should therefore be free to promote 
their views &#8211; even minority and dissenting views, challenge governments about their human 
rights record or campaign for democratic reforms, without being accused of treason and 
other defamatory terms. Dissenting views should be seen by the authorities as an 
opportunity for dialogue and mutual understanding. The European Court of Human Rights 
in affirming this principle ruled that &#8220;an organisation may campaign for a change in the 
legal and constitutional structures of the State if the means used to that end are in every 
respect legal and democratic and if the change proposed is itself compatible with 
fundamental democratic principles.&#8221;18  
</p>
<p>33. In addition to the fact that justification on the grounds of State sovereignty violates 
international norms and standards related to freedom of association, the Special Rapporteur 
is extremely concerned about increased denigration and unfounded accusations against 
individuals and organizations receiving foreign funding. Special procedures mechanisms 
have expressed their particular dismay about cases of vicious verbal attacks, intimidation, 
property damage, physical assaults and even criminalization against activists accused of 
having ties to a foreign entity, on the sole ground that they had allegedly received foreign 
funding (e.g. Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan). Allowing or inciting public discredit on individuals&#8217; 
or organizations&#8217; honour and reputation or inciting nationalist and xenophobic sentiment is 
likely to cause associations to engage in self-censorship and, more gravely, to incite hatred 
and fuel further human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>34. Finally, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that in most cases, States which restrict 
or stigmatize foreign funding under the guise of preservation of sovereignty are also those 
which limit access to domestic funding or which subject associations to discriminatory 
treatment due to the thematic area they focus on. Where domestic funding is scarce or 
unduly restricted, it is critical for associations to be free to rely on foreign assistance in 
order to carry out their activities. The Special Rapporteur recalls again that &#8220;governments 
</p>
<p>must allow access by NGOs to foreign funding as a part of international cooperation to 
which civil society is entitled, to the same extent as Governments&#8221;.19 He believes that States 
must demonstrate a change in mentality by highlighting that funding associations contribute 
to the development of a flourishing, diversified and independent civil society, which is 
characteristic of a dynamic democracy.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Transparency and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>35. Restrictions to funding are also regularly justified by the need to ensure greater 
transparency and accountability within the civil society sector. Combatting fraud, 
embezzlement, corruption, money-laundering and other modes of trafficking is legitimate, 
and may qualify as being in the &#8220;interests of national security, public safety, or public 
order&#8221;. Nevertheless, it is not sufficient to simply pursue a legitimate interest, limitations 
need also to be prescribed by law and &#8220;be necessary&#8221; in a democratic society. In this regard,  
limitations must be proportionate to the interest to be protected and must be the least 
intrusive means to achieve the desired objective. In this respect, several legislations or 
practices unduly restrict the ability of associations to access funding since other less 
intrusive measures exist to mitigate the risk.  
</p>
<p>  
 17 European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), <i>Handyside v.</i> <i>the United Kingdom</i>, application No. 
</p>
<p>5493/72, judgement of 7 December 1976, para. 49.   
 18 ECtHR, <i>Zhechev v. Bulgaria</i>, application No. 57045/00, judgement of 21 June 2007, para. 47.  
 19 A/59/401, para. 82.  </p>


<p>36. For instance, the obligation for associations to route funding through state channels; 
to report on all funds received from foreign sources and how these are allocated or used 
(e.g. Kyrgyz Republic); to obtain authorization from the authorities to receive or use funds 
(e.g. Jordan, Sudan) all constitute human rights violations. In some cases, not only does 
legislation providing for an authorization procedure not comply with international law, but 
the implementation of such strict provisions is also problematic For example, in 
Bangladesh, a human rights association encountered arbitrary delays greatly in excess of 
the legal 45-day period before receiving a response to an application for project approval 
from the NGO Affairs Bureau; in Egypt, a women rights association was granted approval 
for funding seven months after its request, which was far beyond the 60 days prescribed by 
law. In some other cases (e.g. Azerbaijan, Uganda, Zimbabwe), activists were subject to 
intimidation and sometimes physical assault aimed at forcing them to provide the names of 
their funding partners.  
</p>
<p>37. Fundamentally, the Special Rapporteur believes that associations should be 
accountable to their donors, and at most, subject by the authorities to a mere notification 
procedure of the reception of funds and the submission of reports on their accounts and 
activities. 
</p>
<p>38. The transparency and accountability argument has, in some other cases, been used to 
exert extensive scrutiny over the internal affairs of associations, as a way of intimidation 
and harassment. The Special Rapporteur warns against frequent, onerous and bureaucratic 
reporting requirements, which can eventually unduly obstruct the legitimate work carried 
out by associations. Controls need therefore to be fair, objective and non-discriminatory, 
and not be used as a pretext to silence critics. Composition of the supervisory body also 
needs to be independent from the executive power to ensure its decisions are not arbitrary. 
The Special Rapporteur is of the view that if an association fails to comply with its 
reporting obligations, such minor violation of the law should not lead to the closure of the 
association (e.g. Belarus) or criminal prosecution of its representative (e.g. Egypt); rather, 
the association should be requested to promptly rectify its situation. Only this approach 
corresponds to the spirit and the letter of freedom of association. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Aid effectiveness and funding control 
</b></p>
<p>39. International development cooperation between States has greatly increased in 
recent years and has allowed for advancing global development. To ensure the quality of 
aid, more collaborative approaches have now emerged. The Aid Effectiveness Agenda of 
the Paris Declaration (2005), the Accra Agenda for Action (2008) and the Busan 
Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (2011) are implementation frameworks 
aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of aid. They have gradually required harmonization of 
donor initiatives and accountability of development partners, but also required partner 
States to take ownership of aid initiatives. Nevertheless, in some cases, the principles 
identified within this framework (namely, ownership, alignment, harmonization, results and 
mutual accountability) have been interpreted by some States as giving them the sole power 
to determine priorities and subsequently control the plans of CSOs, thereby justifying 
limitations over the activities of civil society actors, including their right to seek and use 
foreign funding. While an inclusive and participatory process towards aid is to be 
welcomed, a rights-based approach is needed to ensure civil society&#8217;s access to funding is 
not unduly restricted.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur highlights that coordination of aid is not listed as a 
legitimate ground for restrictions under the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Furthermore, he underlines that barriers in the name of aid effectiveness have little 
in common with &#8220;the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre </p>


<p>public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and 
freedoms of others&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur stresses that even if the restriction were to pursue a 
legitimate objective, it would not comply with the requirements of &#8220;a democratic society&#8221;. 
In particular, deliberate misinterpretations by Governments of ownership or harmonization 
principles to require associations to align themselves with Governments&#8217; priorities 
contradict one of the most important aspects of freedom of association, namely that 
individuals can freely associate for any legal purpose. Hence, Governments which restrict 
funding in the name of aid effectiveness violate the key democratic principles of 
&#8220;pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness&#8221; and therefore unduly restrict freedom of 
</p>
<p>association.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight that there is an inherent contradiction in 
States restricting funding to associations, while at the same time receiving increased 
funding through international cooperation. He believes that instead of aiming to limit the 
participation of civil society actors, aid effectiveness rather aims to provide all relevant 
stakeholders, including associations, with greater influence to contribute to, inter alia, 
poverty reduction, strengthening of democratic reforms and human rights promotion. For 
example, in Busan, Republic of Korea, assurances were made to &#8220;implement fully 
respective commitments to enable CSOs to exercise their roles as independent development 
actors, with a particular focus on an enabling environment, <i>consistent with agreed 
international rights</i>, that maximizes the contributions of CSOs to development&#8221; (emphasis 
added). The independence of the civil society sector, including in terms of access to 
funding, should therefore be guaranteed. In the context of ongoing discussions related to the 
post-2015 Millennium Development Goals, the Special Rapporteur believes that civil 
society involvement and contributions to development are paramount, and that States 
should exert all efforts to support, rather than inhibit, their work.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Ability to hold peaceful assemblies: an integral component of 
the right to freedom of peaceful assembly  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>43. The ability to hold peaceful assemblies is a fundamental and integral component of 
the multifaceted right to freedom of peaceful assembly, which shall be enjoyed by 
everyone. Such ability is of utmost importance to the work of civil society actors, including 
those promoting the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, as it enables them to 
publicly voice their message, which ultimately benefits the realization of the right(s) they 
strive to promote and protect, especially in the context of the ongoing dire economic crisis. 
This is all the more relevant for groups most at risk of violations and discrimination, such 
as women, youth, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, persons belonging to 
minority groups, groups at risk because of their sexual orientation and gender identity and 
non-nationals. 
</p>
<p>44. However, in far too many instances, the ability to hold peaceful assemblies has been 
denied or  restricted by authorities in violation of international human rights norms and 
standards. As a consequence, the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, as 
recognized in article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Affairs, has 
been narrowed. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur wishes to refer once again to the 
Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 25 (1996) on participation in public 
affairs and the right to vote, which considers that &#8220;citizens also take part in the conduct of 
public affairs by exerting influence through public debate and dialogue with their </p>


<p>representatives or through their capacity to organize themselves. This participation is 
supported by ensuring freedom of expression, assembly and association&#8221;.20  
</p>
<p>45. As repeatedly stressed by the Human Rights Council, &#8220;peaceful protests should not 
be viewed as a threat, and therefore encourage[s] all States to engage in an open, inclusive 
and meaningful dialogue when dealing with peaceful protests and their causes&#8221;.21 
</p>
<p><b> B. Procedural and practical measures for holding peaceful assemblies 
</b></p>
<p>46. Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the 
right to freedom of peaceful assembly to be enjoyed by everyone, as provided for by article 
2 of the Covenant and resolutions 15/21 and 21/16 of the Human Rights Council. Article 15 
of the Convention of the Rights of the Child recognizes this right for persons below 18 
years of age. Unregistered associations should equally be able to enjoy this right. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly can be subject to certain restrictions only, &#8220;which are prescribed by law and 
which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public 
safety, public order (<i>ordre public</i>), the protection of public health or morals or the 
protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&#8221;22 In this connection, he stresses once again 
that freedom is to be considered the rule and its restriction the exception.  
</p>
<p>48. He further reminds that whenever authorities decide to restrict an assembly, they 
should provide assembly organizers, in writing, with &#8220;timely and fulsome reasons&#8221; which 
should satisfy the strict test of necessity and proportionality of the restrictions(s) imposed 
on the assembly pursuant to legitimate aims.23  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur has already stressed in his first thematic report to the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/20/27), that States have a positive obligation under international 
human rights law not only to actively protect peaceful assemblies, but also to facilitate the 
exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly (para. 27). The law only protects 
assemblies that are not violent and where participants have peaceful intentions, and that 
shall be presumed. Acts of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others 
do not deprive peaceful individuals of their right to freedom of peaceful assembly (para. 
25). 
</p>
<p>50. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur highlights again the existence of 
&#8220;presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies,&#8221; as was first stressed by the OSCE 
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) Panel of Experts on 
Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and the Council of Europe&#8217;s European Commission for 
Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission)24. This means that an assembly should 
be presumed lawful and deemed as not constituting a threat to public order. Such 
presumption should apply to everyone, without any discrimination, and should be &#8220;clearly 
and explicitly established in the law, enshrined either in constitutions or in laws governing

<p>peaceful assemblies&#8221; (A/HRC/20/27, para. 26). The Special Rapporteur believes that 
unclear legal provisions should be clarified, and that in the absence of clarity, such 
provisions should be interpreted in favour of those wishing to exercise their right to 
freedom of peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Notification procedure and decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>51. The aforementioned presumption further means that, in a free and democratic 
society, no authorization should be required to assemble peacefully. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur stresses again that the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly, should be &#8220;governed at most by a regime of prior notification whose rationale is 
to allow State authorities to facilitate this exercise and to take measures to protect public 
safety and order and the rights and freedoms of others&#8221; (A/HRC/20/27, para. 28). The 
notable exception to this principle is that of spontaneous peaceful assemblies where 
organizers are unable to comply with the requisite notification requirements or where there 
is no existing or identifiable organizer. Fundamentally, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
that &#8220;should the organizers fail to notify the authorities, the assembly should not be 
dissolved automatically and the organizers should not be subject to criminal sanctions, or 
administrative sanctions resulting in fines or imprisonment&#8221; (para. 29). 
</p>
<p>52. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that notification should be 
required only for large assemblies or for assemblies where a certain degree of disruption is 
anticipated.25 In his view, such notification should be submitted a maximum of, for 
example, 48 hours prior to the day the assembly is planned to take place. The organizers 
should send a single notification to a designated primary authority, and not to multiple 
authorities (e.g one or several municipal authorities, as is sometimes done in the case of 
parades, and/or law enforcement agencies).26 The primary authority should communicate 
the details of the notification to all relevant bodies.27 
</p>
<p>53. In this regard the Special Rapporteur believes that the organizers should be able to 
notify the designated primary authority of the holding of a peaceful assembly in the 
simplest and fastest way, by filling, for instance, a clear and concise form, available in the 
main local language(s) spoken in the country, preferably online to avoid uncertainties and 
possible delays in postage. The notification should merely contain information regarding 
the date, time, duration and location or itinerary of the assembly, and the name, address and 
contact details of the organizer. 
</p>
<p>54. By contrast, as in the view of the OSCE/ODIHR Panel of Experts,28 a notification 
should be considered as unduly bureaucratic if any of the following requirements is 
imposed on the organizers: that there be more than one named organizer; that only 
registered organizations are considered as legitimate organizers; that formal identity 
documents, such as passports or identity cards, be produced; that identification details of 
others involved in the event, such as stewards be provided; that reasons for holding an 
assembly, bearing in mind the principle of non-discrimination, be given; and that the exact 
number of participants, which is difficult to predict, be given. In this connection, the 
authorities should not punish organizers if the number of participants does not match the 
anticipated number, as stipulated by domestic legislation (as has occurred in the Russian 
Federation).  
</p>

 28 Based on consultation with members of the OSCE/ODIHR Panel of Experts. </p>


<p>55. The Special Rapporteur further echoes the views of the Panel of Experts that the 
authorities should be flexible in cases of (a) late notification, if there is a good reason; (b) 
incorrect completion of form; or (c) failure to provide all necessary information. The 
notification timeline should not restart from the beginning and there should be some 
flexible means of correcting minor omissions or errors.29  
</p>
<p>56. Another inappropriate requirement attached to the notification process is informally 
or formally imposing on the organizers the expectation to negotiate the time and place of 
the assembly with the authorities. Such requirement would be tantamount to restricting the 
planned assembly and would need to pass the strict test of necessity and proportionality, as 
defined in article 21 of the Covenant, which is applicable to restrictions. The Special 
Rapporteur also warns against authorities proposing an alternative time and place for an 
assembly, when processing a notification, as this would also be imposing restrictions on the 
right to freedom of peaceful assembly and should satisfy the aforementioned test. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is also of the opinion that the notification procedure should 
at all times be free of charge so as not to financially deter organizers from exercising their 
right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Similarly, the cost of protecting and facilitating the 
assembly (such as deploying security barriers, medical services or temporary sanitary 
facilities) should not be borne by the organizers. 
</p>
<p>58. Once the organizers have notified the designated primary authority of their intention 
to hold an assembly, a receipt acknowledging that timely notification has been submitted 
should be provided in an expeditious manner. Should the organizers not hear from the 
authority prior to the designated time for holding the assembly, it should be assumed that 
said assembly does not present any problem. The Special Rapporteur warns against any 
possible abuse of the receipt system.30 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur is mindful of States&#8217; obligation to guarantee law and order, 
but restrictions on peaceful assembly in relation to its &#8220;time, place and manner&#8221;31 should be 
limited to the extent that such restrictions meet the aforementioned strict test of necessity 
and proportionality. Any restriction imposed on the nature or content of the message the 
organizers and participants want to convey, especially in relation to criticism of 
Government policies, should be proscribed, unless the message constitutes &#8220;incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence&#8221;, in conformity with article 20 of the Covenant. In this 
connection, he stresses the recommendation that he has already put forward to States to 
&#8220;provide individuals exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association with the protection offered by the right to freedom of expression&#8221;.32 
</p>
<p>60. Should the assembly be restricted in compliance with international human rights 
norms and standards, the authorities should provide reasonable alternatives to the 
organizers to hold peaceful assemblies, which fundamentally should always be facilitated 
within &#8220;sight and sound&#8221; of the target audience so that the message they (organizers and 
participants) want to convey reaches this target audience.33  
</p>
<p>61. In far too many instances, authorities in many countries fail to apply the 
aforementioned strict test of necessity and proportionality when reviewing the imposition of 
a possible restriction to the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Peaceful assemblies

<p>have been prohibited or repressed because the message conveyed do not please the 
authorities, as has been done in Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, China, Cuba, Egypt, 
the Iran (Islamic Republic of), Indonesia, Russian Federation, Syrian Arab Republic and 
Zimbabwe. Organizers and participants have been charged with, inter alia, &#8220;sedition&#8221; and 
&#8220;rioting&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>62. This has also been the case for peaceful protestors advocating economic, social and 
cultural rights, such as indigenous peoples protesting the exploitation of a coal mine 
(Bangladesh), local residents denouncing the health impact of nuclear power plants (India), 
students protesting university reforms (Chile), employees protesting the closure of a mine 
(Myanmar), activists criticizing the increase in fuel prices (Sri Lanka) or students 
supporting an ethnic group forcibly displaced by the construction of a dam (Sudan).  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur is particularly troubled by the imposition of blanket bans in 
many States, such as Azerbaijan and Bahrain, typically in the interests of national security, 
public safety or public order. He firmly believes that such blanket bans, are intrinsically 
disproportionate and discriminatory measures as they impact on all citizens willing to 
exercise their right to freedom of peacefully assembly. States have also resorted to pre-
emptive measures to quash peaceful assemblies, including by preventing participants from 
reaching assembly points, as in Sri Lanka and Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>64. Finally, organizers should be given the possibility of an expedited appeal procedure, 
with a view to obtaining a judicial decision by an independent and impartial court prior to 
the notified date of the assembly. The decision of the regulatory authority and of the appeal 
court should be published for the purposes of transparency and fairness, possibly on a 
specific website.34 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Access to public space 
</b></p>
<p>65. A key measure with regard to facilitating the holding of peaceful assemblies is to 
make public space available for organizers and participants. The Special Rapporteur deems 
it useful to refer again to an important decision of the Spanish Constitutional Court which 
stated that &#8220;in a democratic society, the urban space is not only an area for circulation, but 
</p>
<p>also for participation&#8221;. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) also 
stressed that although the exercise of the right of assembly can sometimes be disruptive to 
the normal routine of daily life, or may even cause problems or affect the exercise of other 
rights that the State has an obligation to protect and ensure, such as freedom of movement, 
&#8220;such disruptions are part of the mechanics of a pluralistic society in which diverse and 
sometimes conflicting interests coexist and find the forums and channels in which to 
express themselves&#8221;.35 Furthermore, the Human Rights Council in its resolution 22/10 
urged States to facilitate peaceful protests by providing protestors with access to public 
space and protecting them, where necessary, against any forms of threats, and underlined 
the role of local authorities in this regard.36 The issue of access to public space is all the 
more important in light of the increased privatization of public space in many States, where 
peaceful assemblies have been curtailed through the use by private bodies, both companies 
and individuals, of civil injunctions, which can be difficult to challenge, coupled with the 
issue of aggravated trespass, as in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland, for example.

<p> 36 Human Rights Council resolution 22/10, para. 4.  </p>


<p>66. Access to public space means concretely that organizers and participants should be 
able to use public streets, roads and squares to conduct (static or moving) peaceful 
assemblies. The Special Rapporteur believes that spaces in the vicinity of iconic buildings 
such as presidential palaces, parliaments or memorials should also be considered public 
space, and peaceful assemblies should be allowed to take place in those locations. In this 
regard, the imposition of restrictions on &#8220;time, place and manner&#8221; should meet the 
aforementioned strict test of necessity and proportionality. In Kenya, protesters have been 
temporarily prohibited from gathering around the Supreme Court as they awaited a 
decision, as well as from other public places.   
</p>
<p>67. In this connection, the IACHR stressed that &#8220;the competent institutions of the State 
have a duty to design operating plans and procedures that will facilitate the exercise of the 
right of assembly,.[including] rerouting pedestrian and vehicular traffic in a certain area&#8221;.37 
An assembly causes only a temporary obstruction to traffic, that is, a temporary interference 
with the rights and activities of others. The Special Rapporteur finds it troubling that in 
some States, street protests are forbidden under domestic legislation (Malaysia); it is 
prohibited for street marches to impede the movement of traffic and pedestrians (Belarus);  
mass gatherings are prohibited and subject to a heavy fine as they may, inter alia, disrupt 
traffic and transportation (Russian Federation); application to hold a peaceful assembly to 
celebrate International Peace Day was rejected by the authorities, allegedly because it 
would have, inter alia, disrupted traffic (Myanmar); women human rights defenders have 
repeatedly been arrested and detained for disrupting traffic during peaceful street marches 
(Zimbabwe). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Pre-event planning 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur considers pre-event planning, including risk assessment, by 
law enforcement officials, together with organizers of peaceful assemblies and, if possible, 
local authorities, as a good practice which may contribute to the success of the assembly. 
However, participation of organizers in such planning should never be made compulsory. 
</p>
<p>69. Possible issues for discussion include an estimate of the number of participants 
expected; itinerary of the assembly, if it is not static; specific needs of persons with 
disabilities and groups at risk, such as women, indigenous peoples and groups who, due to 
their sexual orientation and/or gender identity may be in need of greater protection by the 
authorities; need to deploy properly trained and clearly identified stewards whose role is to 
provide assistance to organizers by, inter alia, informing and orienting the public during the 
event, but who should not be used to palliate deficiencies in the security apparatus. 
Importantly, when organizers cannot be identified due to the nature of certain assemblies 
(such as those convened through the Internet), the authorities must undertake such planning 
and be prepared to the same extent. 
</p>
<p>70. Law enforcement authorities should be prepared and properly trained to handle the 
presence of agents provocateurs and counter-demonstrators aiming to disrupt or disperse 
the assembly, and to extract them from the assembly or contain them effectively. The 
authorities should also be prepared to handle simultaneous demonstrations, which should be 
facilitated and protected when possible.   
</p>
<p>71. Fundamentally, law enforcement authorities should always be forthcoming and 
genuinely cooperate with organizers, bearing in mind their duty to facilitate and protect 
peaceful assemblies.

<p><b> 5. New communication technologies  
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur stresses again the utmost importance of new communication 
technologies, including the Internet and mobile phones, in organizing peaceful assemblies. 
Such technologies allow organizers to mobilize a large group of people in a prompt and 
effective manner, and at little cost. This importance was highlighted by both panelists and 
delegations during the Human Rights Council panel discussion on the promotion and 
protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests.38 It should be noted that 
individuals who post on social media organizers&#8217; calls for assemblies should not be 
considered as organizers, as has regrettably been the case in Malaysia, for instance. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that organizers and participants of peaceful 
assemblies should be allowed access to the Internet and other new technologies at all times, 
as made clear by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, who also stated that &#8220;any determination on what 
[website] content should be blocked must be undertaken by a competent judicial authority 
or a body which is independent of any political, commercial, or other unwarranted 
influences&#8221;.39 In this connection, the OSCE/ODIHR Panel of Experts recommended that 
&#8220;States should ensure that efforts to disseminate information to publicize forthcoming 
</p>
<p>assemblies are not impeded in any way&#8221;.40 Finally, the Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 20/8, recognized the global and open nature of the Internet as a driving force in 
accelerating progress towards development in its various forms (para. 2) and &#8220;called upon 
all States to promote and facilitate access to the Internet and international cooperation 
aimed at the development of media and information and communications facilities in all 
countries&#8221; (para. 3). 
</p>
<p>74. Likewise, new communications technologies, in particular the Internet, should be 
seen by the authorities as an excellent opportunity to interact with a large and diversified 
audience prior to and during peaceful assemblies, with a view to sensitizing them on their 
role and functions, and ultimately building or reinforcing trust among the population. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that access to new communications 
technologies, in particular the Internet, or to specific websites, has allegedly been 
temporarily blocked prior to, during or after peaceful assemblies (e.g., in Algeria, China 
and Egypt).  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur also warns against possible abusive use of laws governing 
the prevention and fight against offences linked to information and communications 
technologies, which &#8220;should be applied only as an exception to the general norm of 
</p>
<p>permitting the open and free use of the Internet, like all other forms of communication; only 
very few qualified and clearly legislated exceptions should be permitted&#8221;.41 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Responsibility of organizers 
</b></p>
<p>77. Whenever organizers have deliberately not respected a legitimate restriction 
imposed on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, sanctions should be proportionate to 
the offence with a view to not dissuading the holding of future assemblies. In many 
countries where a regime of authorization is in place, exorbitant fines are often in place in 
case organizers do not request authorization to demonstrate or do not respect the content of 
the authorization. Such fines are in many cases disproportionate, and have a chilling effect

<p>on the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of expression, as in the 
legislations of Azerbaijan, Russian Federation and (Canton of Geneva) Switzerland.  
</p>
<p>78. Furthermore, as stated previously, organizers of peaceful assemblies should never be 
held liable for the unlawful behaviour of others.42 The principle of individual liability of 
participants should be upheld, notably due to the presumption of peacefulness of the 
assembly. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that organizers have sometimes been 
brought to court for the violent behaviour of others, as in Malaysia. He is similarly 
concerned about legal provisions criminalizing organizers for the violent conduct of others, 
as in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland.43  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers the two issues discussed in the present report 
to be critical for the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association. He expresses serious concern that undue barriers to funding are put in 
</b></p>
<p><b>place, especially in a climate of harassment and exclusion of civil society actors on one 
</b></p>
<p><b>hand, and in the context of a global financial crisis on the other. It is crucial that civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society not bear any more restrictions and obligations than private corporate bodies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>for instance, in these areas. In a framework of ongoing democratic reforms in several 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries across the world and of discussions related to the post-2015 Millennium 
</b></p>
<p><b>Development Goals Agenda, he believes States have the obligation to facilitate, not 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrict, access for associations to funding, including from foreign sources, so that they 
</b></p>
<p><b>can effectively take part in the democratic process and enrich post-Millennium 
</b></p>
<p><b>Development Goals talks, and ultimately contribute to development.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Moreover, the Special Rapporteur believes that the </b>&#8220;<b>Arab Spring</b>&#8221;<b>, and the 
</b>&#8220;o<b>ccupy movement</b>&#8221;<b> which subsequently flourished in many parts of the world, have 
</b></p>
<p><b>opened a door which will never be closed. They provide a non-violent alternative for 
</b></p>
<p><b>change as well as give authorities a chance to understand the views and feelings of 
</b></p>
<p><b>citizens. These events indelibly confirmed that holding peaceful assemblies is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate and powerful means to make calls for democratic change; greater respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>for human rights, including economic, social and cultural ones; and accountability for 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations and abuses. The ability to hold such assemblies has proven 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly crucial for groups most at risk of violations and discrimination enabling 
</b></p>
<p><b>them to address their often desperate plight in a meaningful manner. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>As general recommendations, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To create and maintain, in law and in practice, an enabling environment 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To ensure that any restriction complies with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>norms and standards, in particular in line with the strict test of necessity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>proportionality in a democratic society, bearing in mind the principle of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To ensure that a detailed and timely written explanation for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>imposition of any restriction is provided, and that said restriction can be subject to an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent, impartial and prompt judicial review; 
</b></p>
<p>  
 42 A/HRC/20/27, para. 31.  
 43 As of April 2013, the law is still the subject of an appeal before the Swiss Federal Tribunal. </p>


<p><b>(d) To ensure that sanctions for the non-respect of restrictions complying 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international human rights norms and standards are proportionate and not set at 
</b></p>
<p><b>a level that would deter individuals from exercising their right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association and/or of peaceful assembly; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To ensure that those who violate and/or abuse the rights of individuals to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of association and of peaceful assembly are held fully accountable by an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent and democratic oversight body and by the courts of law. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>In relation to freedom of association, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To adopt a regime of notification for the formation of associations, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to allow for the existence of unregistered associations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To ensure that associations </b>&#8211;<b> registered and unregistered </b>&#8211;<b> can seek, 
</b></p>
<p><b>receive and use funding and other resources from natural and legal persons, whether 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic, foreign or international, without prior authorization or other undue 
</b></p>
<p><b>impediments, including from individuals; associations, foundations or other civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society organizations; foreign Governments and aid agencies; the private sector; the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations and other entities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To recognize that undue restrictions to funding, including percentage 
</b></p>
<p><b>limits, is a violation of the right to freedom of association and of other human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To recognize that regulatory measures which compel recipients of 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign funding to adopt negative labels constitute undue impediments on the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>seek, receive and use funding; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To adopt measures to protect individuals and associations against 
</b></p>
<p><b>defamation, disparagement, undue audits and other attacks in relation to funding they 
</b></p>
<p><b>allegedly received. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In relation to freedom of peaceful assembly, the Special Rapporteur calls upon 
States:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To establish in law, in a clear and explicit manner, a presumption in 
</b></p>
<p><b>favour of holding peaceful assemblies, and to facilitate and protect peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assemblies;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To ensure that peaceful assemblies are governed at most by a regime of 
</b></p>
<p><b>notification regarding the holding of peaceful assemblies, in lieu of a regime of 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorization. The notification procedure, where introduced, should be as simple and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expeditious as possible; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To provide organizers, whenever an assembly is restricted in compliance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international human rights norms and standards, with reasonable alternatives to 
</b></p>
<p><b>hold their peaceful assemblies, which should be facilitated within </b>&#8220;<b>sight and sound</b>&#8221;<b> of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the target audience; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To ensure access to public space, including public streets, roads and 
</b></p>
<p><b>squares, for the holding of peaceful assemblies, with the consequence of rerouting 
</b></p>
<p><b>pedestrian and vehicular traffic when necessary;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To ensure and facilitate at all times access to the Internet and other new 
</b></p>
<p><b>communications technologies, and to further ensure that any restriction on such 
</b></p>
<p><b>access or on the content of websites is reviewed by a competent judicial court; </b></p>


<p><b>(f) To guarantee that assembly organizers are never held responsible and 
</b></p>
<p><b>liable for the unlawful behaviour of others.
