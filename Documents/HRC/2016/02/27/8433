<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur visited Mozambique from 26 August to 4 September 2010 
and from 6 to 10 December 2010, at the invitation of the Government. The mission was 
facilitated by the United Nations Resident Coordinator ad interim, the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Food Programme (WFP) and included 
visits to the capital, Maputo; the cities of Beira and Nampula and to Meconta District in 
Nampula Province.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with the President of the Parliament and 
parliamentarian members of the Commissions of Petitions, Constitutional Affairs and 
Social Affairs; the President of the Supreme Court of Justice; the Minister of Justice and 
Government officials from the Institute for Legal Assistance and Representation (IPAJ); the 
National Prisons Service (SNAPRI); the Technical Unit for Legal Reform (UTREL); the 
Department for the Promotion and Development of Human Rights; the National Directorate 
of Registries and Notaries; and the Centre for Legal and Judicial Training (CFJJ). She also 
met with the regrettably now deceased Deputy Minister of Planning and Development and 
her legal adviser; the Minister of Finance and senior ministry officials.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also held consultations with the President of the 
Constitutional Council; the President of the Administrative Tribunal; magistrates of the 
High Council of the Judiciary; the Attorney General; the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
Cooperation (MINEC) and the Permanent Secretary of his cabinet. She was not able to 
meet with the Minister of the Interior despite her repeated requests. 
</p>
<p>4. In Beira, the Special Rapporteur met with the Municipal Council; judges and 
members of the Provincial Commission for Legality and Justice.  In Nampula, she met with 
the Provincial Commission for Legality and Justice, including the Provincial Director for 
Justice (Ministry of Justice); the President of the Provincial Tribunal; the Provincial 
Prosecutor; the Provincial Commander of the National Police; the Provincial Director of 
SNAPRI; the Provincial Director of IPAJ; the Provincial Director of the Criminal 
Investigation Police (PIC); and a representative of the provincial chapter of the 
Mozambican Bar Association. She also held consultations with the legal director of the 
provincial tribunal and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>5. In the district of Meconta, the Special Rapporteur met with community judges from 
the following administrative posts: Nancompala; Nacavala; Corrane; Meconta Sede and 
Nomialo. She also visited the district tribunals of Meconta and met the administrator of the 
district, as well as members of the District Commission of Legality and Justice, including 
the Presiding Judge; the District Prosecutor; a representative of the Police (PRM) and a 
legal assistant of IPAJ. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur also held consultations with the United Nations Resident 
Coordinator <i>ad interim</i>; representatives of the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF); 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM, now the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women)); the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO); the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), 
UNDP and WFP.  
</p>
<p>7. In Maputo, the Special Rapporteur had extensive consultations with other 
stakeholders, including civil society and community-based organizations; grass-roots 
leaders from different sectors of the population; representatives of the donor community; 
the Mozambican Bar Association (OAM); professional and elected judges; lawyers; 
prosecutors; magistrates; legal technicians; researchers and academics so as to obtain the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>most complete and balanced vision of the situation of the judiciary in the country. She 
visited the Maximum Security Prison and the headquarters of IPAJ. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her appreciation to the Government for its 
cooperation in the exercise of her mandate. She also expresses appreciation to all 
stakeholders and interlocutors for their cooperation and time. She hopes to continue 
engaging them in dialogue and cooperation on all issues related to her mandate. 
</p>
<p>9. The last three days of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit in September 2010 coincided 
with major public disturbances related to significant increases in the prices of some basic 
products. The disturbances resulted in an estimated 10 deaths and approximately 149 
people injured, according to information provided by the Mozambican Police. The Special 
Rapporteur deeply regrets the loss of human life during these events. Given the detrimental 
impact of this highly volatile situation on her programme of work, she left the country, and 
returned, at the invitation of the Government, in December 2010. 
</p>
<p>10. This report presents the major findings of the totality of the mission and concludes 
with some recommendations for strengthening the judicial system. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General political and socio-economic background 
</b></p>
<p>11. Following centuries of colonialism, Mozambique gained independence from 
Portugal in 1975. A prolonged civil war (1977-1992) thereafter hampered Mozambique's 
capacity to bring about sustainable development and adequate socio-economic conditions 
for its population. In 2003, the World Bank estimated that 55.2 per cent of the population 
was below the poverty line. The 2009 Human Development report ranked Mozambique 
172nd (out of 182 countries) for economy and inequality and estimated Mozambique's 
human development index at below 0.500.  
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution defines Mozambique as an independent, sovereign and democratic 
State of social justice (art. 1); governed by the rule of law; based on pluralism of expression 
and democratic political organization and on the respect for, and guarantee of, fundamental 
human rights and freedoms (art. 3). Mozambique is a State with a decentralized 
administration. It is divided into 10 provinces, 128 districts and 43 municipalities, including 
Maputo. The Constitution was revised on 16 November 2004 by the Assembly of the 
Republic. 
</p>
<p>13. The current President of Mozambique came into power in 2005 and was re-elected 
in 2009 for a second term from the beginning of 2010. Mozambique is a young democracy 
with a strong one-party tradition. The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) 
is currently in power. Other political parties include the Mozambican National Resistance 
(RENAMO); the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) and several smaller 
political parties. According to the Population Census of 2007, Mozambique has a 
population of 21,397,000. Information available at the United Nations Population Division 
indicates that the total population of Mozambique amounted to 22,894,000 in 2009.  
</p>
<p>14. Mozambique is a multilingual State. Information received indicates that Portuguese 
is spoken by approximately 40 per cent of the population. Other local languages spoken in 
Mozambique include three main groups of similar languages: the Macua/Lomue group, in 
the North of the country; the Sena/Ndau group in the central region and the Tsonga group 
in the South.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. International and regional framework 
</b></p>
<p>15. Mozambique has been a member of the United Nations since 1975. The State has 
ratified a number of major international human rights instruments1 and is a party to the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) (ratified on 
11 December 2002) and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (ratified on 26 
December 2006), which contain provisions requiring or encouraging measures of protection 
for witnesses of offences sanctioned under those treaties.  
</p>
<p>16. Mozambique is one of the founding members of the African Union. On 2 August 
2006 it became a party to the 2006 African Union Convention on Preventing and 
Combating Corruption. It has ratified major legal instruments adopted within the 
framework of the African Union, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights and the Protocols thereto on the Rights of Women in Africa and the Court of Justice 
of the African Union. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The country&#8217;s legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Constitution is considered the superior norm (Constitution, art. 2 (4)).  It 
provides that approved and ratified international treaties enter into force once they are 
officially published (art. 18 (1)). They then have the same legal force as legislative acts of 
the Assembly of the Republic and the Government (art. 18 (2)). The independence of the 
judiciary; the separation and interdependence of powers; the right of access to justice and 
the rights to effective judicial protection and equality before the courts, are explicitly 
recognized by the Constitution of Mozambique. 
</p>
<p>18. The legal framework includes the Law of the Organization of the Judiciary (Law 
24/2007 of 20 August 2007); the Magistrates&#8217; Statute (Law 10/92 of 30 July 1992); the 
Regulations for Judicial Inspection (resolution 6/CSMJ/P/95 of 20 November 1995) and 
merit assessment systems for judges (resolution 8/CSMJ/P/2001 of 12 December 2001); the 
Correctional System (Decree 7/2006 and Ministerial Diploma No. 43/2003) and the Code 
of Court fees (Decree 48/89, modified by Decree 14/96). 
</p>
<p>19. The policy framework regulating the administration of justice and the judiciary 
includes several national policies. Agenda 2025 is a long-term policy that sets out the 
vision, strategies and national priorities of Mozambique to be achieved by 2025. Mid-term 
policies regulating the administration of justice include the Five-Year Government Plan, 
which establishes the priorities for democratic governance for the period 2010-2014.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. Short-term policies include the Economic and Social Plan for 2010, which seeks to 
operationalize economic and social objectives in line with the Medium Term Fiscal 
Scenario (2010-2012).  In 2002, the Government adopted the Integrated Strategic Plan for 
the Justice Sector, which delineates Mozambique&#8217;s strategic vision for the justice sector.  
This plan was complemented by the Justice Sector component of the Five-Year 
Government Plan (2010-2014).

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. The independence of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The administration and oversight of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Higher Judicial Magistrates&#8217; Council (CSMJ) is the organ responsible for the 
management and discipline of the judiciary in accordance with the Constitution and other 
laws.2  It supervises and regulates the corps of judicial magistrates and court officials and is 
mandated, inter alia, to nominate, appoint, transfer, promote, exonerate and evaluate 
professional merit; take disciplinary action and, in general, carry out all acts of a similar 
nature in relation to members of the judiciary; evaluate professional merit and take 
disciplinary action in relation to officers of justice, without prejudice to the disciplinary 
powers assigned to judges; propose extraordinary inspections, inquiries and investigations 
to the courts; give opinions and make recommendations on the policy of the judiciary, at its 
own initiative or at the request of the President of the Republic, the President of the 
Assembly of the Republic or the Government.  
</p>
<p>22. CSMJ is composed of 16 members, which include the President and Vice-President 
of the Supreme Court (both of whom are nominated by the President of the Republic); two 
members appointed by the President of the Republic; five members elected by the 
Assembly of the Republic, according to principles of proportional representation; and seven 
members of the judiciary in different categories, all of whom shall be elected by their peers 
under the terms of the Magistrates&#8217; Statute.  
</p>
<p>23. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur observed that CSMJ has found it difficult to 
exercise its mandate in an effective and independent manner, due to a number of factors: it 
is understaffed and has not adopted internal statutes governing its functioning, thus leaving 
its effective control in the hands of its President, who is also the President of the Supreme 
Court. CSMJ should undertake planning processes, including determining staffing and 
budgeting needs. It should also publish its activities. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, 
these factors, together with the nomination process of its members, seriously undermine the 
functioning of CSMJ, which is crucial to ensuring the independence of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judicial budget 
</b></p>
<p>24. Budget allocations are used in some instances to undermine the independence of the 
judiciary. Several interlocutors inquired how judges and prosecutors could carry out their 
mandates independently and impartially, when the same judges and prosecutors often need 
to negotiate the budget for their respective offices. The possibility of making concessions to 
obtain suitable budget allocations was mentioned.   
</p>
<p>25. In accordance with the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and 
Legal Assistance in Africa, adequate resources to enable the judiciary to properly perform 
its functions must be assigned. The judiciary must actively participate in drafting its own 
budget, in cooperation with the Ministries of Finances and Justice. The judiciary must have 
the recognized right to participate in deliberations on its budget in the legislature. 
Budgetary allocations to fund the courts in the current fiscal year, or in the next financial 
year, may be reduced solely with the consent of the judiciary, or of an independent body 
representing it.  Adequate safeguards should be established in this regard.  
</p>
<p>26. Entrusting the administration of its funds directly to the judiciary, or to an 
independent body responsible for the judiciary, may reinforce its independence and help to 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See Constitution of Mozambique, arts. 220-222, and law on the organization of the administration of 
</p>
<p>justice. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>prevent financial dependency, as well as avoid tensions between the judicial and other 
branches of power. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Court fees, judicial salaries, allowances and remuneration 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the general perception of lack of clarity 
on the calculation of court fees and of the absence of oversight mechanisms to ensure 
accountability for the management and destination of the income resulting from the 
collection of such court fees. She was also informed about an alleged margin of discretion, 
which allows magistrates and judges to decide on the imposition of court fees, as a 
percentage of such fees are emoluments added to the salaries of judges and court officials.   
</p>
<p>28. The system of emoluments emanating from court fees creates inequality among 
judges who follow judicial careers in criminal matters, as criminal tribunals and judges 
working on criminal affairs are excluded from benefits enjoyed by civil and labour judges, 
for example. The system of emoluments also constitutes a strong disincentive for court 
officials in criminal tribunals, as the general budget of the tribunals, which includes the 
salaries of court officials, increases proportionally to the income resulting from court fees.  
</p>
<p>29. Determining with more objectivity and equality the salaries and allowances of 
judicial officers and the remuneration of magistrates is of high importance. The system of 
emoluments based on court fees appears to conflict with the right to equal pay for work of 
equal value. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur received allegations of lack of 
transparency and accountability concerning the management of the income resulting from 
court fees and justice taxes. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The assignment of court cases 
</b></p>
<p>30. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed of practices of allocation of 
court cases which hampered the independence of judges. It was alleged that the assignment 
of cases was at the discretion of the court Chair, and that the adjudication of cases 
disregarded jurisdictional competence (ratione materiae, loci and personae). 
</p>
<p>31. In her view, a method for assigning cases within the judiciary should be established 
in line with the Basic Principles on the Independence of the judiciary (&#8220;the Basic 
Principles&#8221;). Such assignments are an internal matter of judicial administration that should 
be free from internal and external interference. The use of mechanisms that allow the 
objective allocation of court cases, such as drawing of lots, systems for automatic 
distribution by alphabetical order, or pre-determined court management plans incorporating 
objective criteria, may contribute to preventing instances of manipulation and therefore to 
increasing the independence and transparency of the judicial system. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Other factors impacting the independence of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur heard from many stakeholders that the concentration of 
powers in the President of the Republic is a major factor having a detrimental impact on the 
independence of the judiciary. The Constitution contains provisions granting to the 
President of the Republic powers to, inter alia: dissolve the Assembly of the Republic (art. 
188.1); appoint the President of the Supreme Court (which is also the President of the 
Higher Judicial Magistrates Council), the President of the Constitutional Council, the 
President of the Administrative Court and the Vice-President of the Supreme Court (art. 
159 (g)); appoint, exonerate and dismiss the Prime Minister (art. 160.1(b)); appoint, 
exonerate and dismiss the Ministers and Deputy Ministers; the Provincial Governors; the 
principles and vice-principles of State universities and the Secretaries of State (art. 160.2) 
as well as the Attorney-General of the Republic and the Deputy Attorney General of the 
Republic (art. 159 (h)). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>33. Many stakeholders are concerned about &#8220;the natural and unwritten loyalty&#8221; that 
high-ranking officials may consider they owe to those who nominated them and hold the 
power to dismiss them without justification. This concern is exacerbated by the unclear 
distinction between the powers and prerogatives of the Government and those of 
FRELIMO (the political party headed by the President of the Republic). 
</p>
<p>34. A number of controversial cases, some of which are awaiting a final decision by the 
Supreme Court, illustrate major concerns raised regarding the independence of the judiciary 
when FRELIMO is involved. An illustrative case relates to the dispute between the Beira 
Municipality and FRELIMO over the office space occupied by the Municipality. 
</p>
<p>35. Without entering into the substance of the case, steps have to be taken to prevent and 
sanction any possible interference by political parties in the judiciary. CSMJ has an 
important role to play in this regard, particularly in monitoring the conduct of judicial 
officials and advocating for the adoption of a code of conduct for magistrates, judges and 
other judicial officers proscribing their participation in political activities.  
</p>
<p>36. Thorough and prompt independent and impartial investigations should be conducted 
into all allegations of interference in judicial affairs and perpetrators should be prosecuted 
and punished. Such investigations are a crucial element to prevent the reoccurrence of 
further interference and to detect systemic problems hampering the independence of the 
judiciary.  The independence of judges requires that appropriate structures and conditions 
be put in place to avoid the overturn of judgments by higher judicial bodies including a 
sanction on the lower-level judges who made the rulings, as this would result in a lessening 
of the independence of individual judges. 
</p>
<p>37. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Central Office for Combating 
Corruption, which is crucial to the current efforts to build a culture of accountability in 
Mozambique, to redouble its efforts to investigate and bring to justice persons found guilty 
of corruption. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The recognition of equal access to the courts and the provision of legal 
assistance and representation 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Constitution recognizes the right of all persons to have access to the courts. This 
recognition reinforces the guarantees related to the due process of law, namely the 
presumption of innocence; the right to defence and to be assisted by counsel; the right to 
prior and detailed notice of the charges; the right to appeal a judgment before a higher court 
and the prohibition of double jeopardy. This also helps to reinforce the protection of the 
fundamental rights to liberty and to security (art. 59); fair trial guarantees (arts. 59 and 70) 
and the right to equality before the courts (art. 70).  
</p>
<p>39. The Constitution recognizes the importance of, and the need for, mechanisms to 
facilitate free legal assistance, in both criminal and civil cases, for persons who, for 
economic reasons, are unable to engage their own defence attorney (art. 62).  
</p>
<p>40. In order to provide legal aid and services for those who cannot access justice for 
financial reasons, the Government established IPAJ3 as a public agency. Services provided 
</p>
<p>  
 3 The main legal instruments governing the provision of legal aid and services in Mozambique are: 
</p>
<p>Law 6/94 (creating IPAJ); Decree No. 54/95 (organizing IPAJ). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>by IPAJ include three main components: general legal consultation for the public at IPAJ 
offices; representation of clients at courts; and representation of clients at police stations 
and PIC offices.  
</p>
<p>41. In order to benefit from IPAJ representation services, potential clients are required to 
present a declaration of poverty (<i>atestado de pobreza</i>), issued by the City Council. If 
eligible, the client&#8217;s case is assigned to an IPAJ officer and is handled free of charge. 
</p>
<p>42. IPAJ officers are either legal technicians or legal assistants and therefore have a 
limited jurisdiction for representation of their clients (see section V on the legal profession).  
Only legal technicians and legal assistants who are members of IPAJ may provide legal aid 
services. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur commends the important work undertaken by IPAJ and 
encourages it to develop oversight mechanisms for ethics and discipline and to make its 
technicians and legal assistants accountable, as required.  
</p>
<p>44. Despite progress made, IPAJ has yet to achieve effective representation throughout 
the Mozambican territory. Information updated to the first trimester of 2010 indicates that 
IPAJ has covered the 10 provinces of Mozambique and is functional in 109 (out of 128) 
districts, with established offices in 89 districts and 20 itinerant offices in the others. In 
some instances, inmates have had to rely on ad hoc<b> </b> legal representation, provided by 
persons without any type of legal training; in others, people with financial means were 
unduly benefiting from IPAJ legal services.   
</p>
<p><b> B Knowledge barriers  
</b></p>
<p>45. Making justice accessible to all starts with an adequate knowledge of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, and the functions and services provided by the system of 
administration of justice.  
</p>
<p>46. Despite some efforts to raise awareness on human rights, fundamental freedoms, 
democracy and rule of law by the Government and other stakeholders with the assistance of 
the international community, the majority of the population do not know about the 
functioning of the administration of justice in Mozambique; the role of the judiciary; the 
importance of the principle of separation of powers; the distinction between the role of the 
Government and that of the political party to which those in power belong; the importance 
of an independent judiciary, and of an independent body to oversee and manage the 
judiciary. Addressing knowledge barriers to the access to justice and to understanding the 
functioning of the justice sector is of paramount importance, given the prevalence of the<b> </b><i>ignorantia juris non excusat</i> principle within the legal system. Furthermore, the large 
backlog of cases encourages people to seek alternatives to formal justice mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Financial barriers  
</b></p>
<p>47. Financial barriers to access to justice include court fees and the high cost of both 
legal advice and legal representation. Court fees in Mozambique are regulated by the Code 
of Court Costs,4 and are due at different stages of legal proceedings. Court fees also include 
a number of taxes.  
</p>
<p>48. Information received indicated at least five different instances where fees are to be 
paid by users of the justice system: an &#8220;initial fixed fee&#8221; and the justice tax (<i>imposto de 
</i></p>
<p>  
 4 Decree No. 48/89, updated by Decree No. 14/96. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p><i>justi&#231;a</i>), both of which are compulsory to start legal proceedings; a &#8220;defence fee&#8221; to ensure 
that the principle of equality of arms is observed; a &#8220;processing fee&#8221; to cover the costs of 
preparing the case for submission; and an &#8220;additional processing fee&#8221; to cover notifications 
and postage costs, if applicable.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the imposition of penalties on the ground 
of non-payment of court fees. In criminal matters, it has entailed in some instances de facto 
indefinite detention, despite the fact that the law does not allow detention to be extended as 
a consequence of the lack of payment of court fees. Information received indicates that the 
exemption of payment of court fees to those with proven indigent status (<i>atestado de 
pobreza</i>) only applies for the initial fixed fee. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Other barriers 
</b></p>
<p>50. Discrimination in the right to access justice is felt most acutely by those segments of 
the population which are already in vulnerable situations owing to factors such as 
geographical location, poverty, gender, age, administrative situation, immigration, 
indigenous or minority status and disability. The supply of services may not be 
discriminatory but the demand is unequal.  
</p>
<p>51. Difficulties encountered with accessing justice on the ground of a person&#8217;s 
administrative situation, including immigration status, are of particular concern to the 
Special Rapporteur, who was informed that asylum-seekers and migrants are often deprived 
of their right to access to justice. Although asylum-seekers receive support for six months 
while the determination of their status is pending, in practice these procedures last up to 
three years.  As a result, asylum-seekers are left undocumented and without any type of 
financial, social or psychological support. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
recall that access to justice is crucial for asylum-seekers in order to uphold their human 
rights, including the principle of non-refoulement. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of a large percentage of Mozambicans 
lacking any type of identification, and the excessive cost that the population has to bear to 
obtain such identification, given the conditions of poverty prevailing in most of the country 
(170 meticais per adult and 90 meticais per child (approximately five and three US$ 
respectively)). Information received suggested that 70 per cent of the population is yet to be 
registered and issued with an identification document. In 2008, an estimated 51 per cent of 
all children under the age of 18 in Mozambique were yet to be registered.5 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the lack of cultural sensitivity and 
language assistance to ensure the right to access to courts. Mozambique has 18 national 
languages and at least 60 other derived languages. Approximately 40 per cent of the 
population speaks Portuguese. Although article 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
requires courts to appoint an interpreter for non-Portuguese-speakers, there are still many 
challenges to overcome in this regard. Translation services are not usually provided by the 
courts and are ad hoc or provided through informal arrangements.   
</p>
<p>54. The lack of infrastructure and large geographic distances are also obstacles to both 
the speed of judicial proceedings, and the physical access to justice by the majority of the

<p>population. Transportation expenses for court attendance were reported to be an 
insurmountable burden for most citizens. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The court system 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Constitution recognizes three main categories of tribunals: the Supreme Court, 
the administrative tribunal and the judicial tribunals, whose general characteristics are 
presented below.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The Supreme Court of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Supreme Court is the supreme judicial body exercising general jurisdiction. It is 
entrusted with ensuring the uniform application of the law and adequate administration of 
justice. Based in Maputo, it is composed of professional and elected judges6 appointed for 
an initial five-year term, with the possibility of successive reappointments.  
</p>
<p>57. The Supreme Court is currently composed of five professional judges (instead of a 
minimum of seven as provided by the Law of Judicial Organization of 2007)7 and 17 
elected judges (including eight alternate judges). Those judges are appointed by the 
President of the Republic on the basis of a list proposed by CSMJ, after public tender and 
curriculum evaluation. 
</p>
<p>58. The lack of human resources has made it impossible for the Supreme Court to cope 
with its workload. Several stakeholders mentioned to the Special Rapporteur excessive 
delays in deciding cases and often referred to this as a &#8220;graveyard of cases&#8221;.   
</p>
<p><b> B. The Administrative Court 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Administrative Court8 is the highest body in the hierarchy of administrative, 
customs and fiscal courts. It controls the legality of administrative acts and application of 
rules and regulations issued by the Public Administration.9 It also scrutinizes public 
expenditure, the enforcement of liability for financial offences and supervises the 
implementation of the State Budget, together with the Assembly of the Republic. It is 
composed of nine judges of appeal and the presiding judge (instead of 12 as stipulated by 
the Law). The administrative court is autonomous and is not a part of the judicial system. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The courts of justice 
</b></p>
<p>60. The courts of justice have a common jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters and 
exercise their jurisdiction over all areas not assigned to other jurisdictions, according to 
constitutional provisions.10 The general system of the courts of justice consists of 
community tribunals; provincial and district tribunals; other specialized tribunals and 
superior tribunals of appeal.

 7 See Law No. 24/2007, art. 42 (2). 
 8 The Administrative Court is governed by articles 131; 159 (g); 179 (2) (h) and 228-231 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution of Mozambique.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Community tribunals 
</b></p>
<p>61. Community tribunals11 are non-judicial mechanisms for settling conflicts in 
application of the principle of equity and on the grounds of the social and cultural values of 
Mozambican society. They do not belong, strictly speaking, to the judicial system of 
Mozambique. However, their functions are analogous to those of courts of common 
jurisdiction. Appeals to community tribunals&#8217; decisions are decided primarily by provincial 
or district courts. Criminal matters are outside the jurisdiction of traditional and customary 
tribunals. 
</p>
<p>62. Community tribunals are linked with the formal justice system through referrals and 
appeals. The Government has undertaken various efforts to harmonize customary law 
applied in community tribunals and the formal justice system. 
</p>
<p>63. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, while strengthening traditional and customary 
justice will certainly provide meaningful access to justice, the justice sector should not rely 
exclusively on these courts to ensure access to justice by specific demographic and socio-
economic groups. These groups typically rely upon community tribunals by reasons of 
proximity, low cost, tradition, political affiliation, barriers to accessing the formal system 
and pressure from social settings. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. District and provincial tribunals 
</b></p>
<p>64. District tribunals act as courts of first instance in nearly 100 out of a total of 128 
districts.   Provincial tribunals are specialized in civil, criminal and labour matters. They act 
as courts of first instance at the provincial level and as courts of appeal for district tribunals 
in each of the 10 provinces and in the city of Maputo. Provincial tribunals are headed by a 
clerk of court and may be composed of one or more judges. 
</p>
<p>65. As a court of first instance, on civil matters, the provincial tribunal takes cognizance 
of cases that do not fall within the competence of other courts. They take cognizance and 
decide on claims for damages and losses caused by judges in lower courts and Public 
Ministry agents in the exercise of their functions. As a court of first instance, on criminal 
matters, the provincial tribunal: adjudicates criminal offences that should not be cognized 
by other courts; and takes cognizance of criminal proceedings in which professional judges 
of district Courts and Public Ministry agents are accused. 
</p>
<p>66. As a court of second instance, the provincial tribunal: takes cognizance of appeals to 
district courts&#8217; decisions, conflicts of jurisdiction between district courts, and habeas corpus 
applications in accordance with the rules of procedure. It also adjudicates appeals against 
decisions by courts of arbitration or other conflict mediation organs. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Other specialized courts 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Constitution mentions the establishment of specialized courts (administrative 
court, fiscal courts, the Customs Court, the Maritime Courts, arbitration courts). This 
constitutional provision is yet to be implemented, as only one customs court has been 
operational since 2002 in the capital, Maputo. Provincial courts include an operational 
labour section but labour courts are yet to be established due to resource constraints. 
</p>
<p>  
 11 The creation of community courts is mentioned in the Constitution of Mozambique, article 223 (2), 
</p>
<p>and developed by Law 6/92. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Constitution mentions that martial courts may only be established at time of war 
to try military and police personnel.12 In practice, they are generally judged by common 
non-military jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p>69. Juvenile courts are set up to try children under 16 years of age involved in criminal 
cases and to address parenting disputes and issues involving dependents. Currently, there is 
only one functional juvenile court in the city of Maputo. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Superior Tribunals of Appeal  
</b></p>
<p>70. The Superior Tribunals of Appeal,13 organized in general sections or sometimes in 
specialized sections, act as courts of first and second instance. They were established to 
assist the Supreme Tribunal to cope with the backlog of cases. The appointment of judges 
for the Superior Tribunal of Appeal (called <i>desembargadores</i>) is still pending, although 29 
such judges have already been nominated. 
</p>
<p>71. The responsibilities of the superior tribunals of appeal, as courts of first instance, 
include: to adjudicate criminal proceedings against elected judges of provincial courts, 
professional judges of provincial courts and Public Ministry agents for acts related to the 
exercise of their functions; take cognizance and decide on claims for damages caused by 
professional judges of provincial courts and Public Ministry judges for acts related to the 
exercise of their functions; take cognizance of habeas corpus<b> </b> applications; and exercise any 
other functions provided at law. 
</p>
<p>72. As courts of second instance, the superior tribunals of appeal are responsible for the 
adjudication of the appeals of provincial courts&#8217; decisions under procedural laws; conflicts 
of jurisdiction between judicial courts and other entities within their jurisdiction; conflicts 
of jurisdiction between provincial courts within their jurisdiction; and exercising any other 
functions provided by the law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The courts&#8217; management and fiscal control 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the importance of a court 
registry or a court clerk to manage non-judicial aspects of the courts&#8217; administration, such 
as the receipt, filing and safekeeping of documents to ensure smooth information flow, 
while preventing the disclosure of documents, personal data and other sensitive 
information, except when authorized by law or court order. Regular auditing of records is 
essential to ensure integrity and accountability. Audits could be strengthened, inter alia, 
through training to prevent malfeasance.  
</p>
<p>74. Management of court records (i.e. case information, summaries of court 
proceedings, verdicts, docket entries indicating the receipt of files) should be strengthened, 
as these are not automated in Mozambique. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
international community to provide technical assistance and support to Mozambique to 
undertake a thorough assessment of information management needs, including a possible 
automation plan for the justice sector, which requires the strengthening of human and 
financial resources and technical and audit capacity.

</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b> V. The legal profession 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal education 
</b></p>
<p>75. Legal education in Mozambique began in 1975 with the opening of the Law Faculty 
of the Louren&#231;o Marquez University.14 As private legal practice was forbidden at that time, 
legal education was centred in public law. From 1983 to 1987, the Faculty of Law was 
closed. Once reopened, it remained the sole institution providing legal education in the 
country until 1996. Legal studies are currently taught in public and private universities. 
There is no centralized curriculum and the principles of academic freedom and professorial 
autonomy are upheld.  
</p>
<p>76. In Mozambique, a law degree is obtained following four years of university studies, 
and a mandatory internship, consisting of a probationary period of technical and legal 
practice. Internships also include legal aid practice to indigents, with wages paid by the 
State. Stakeholders drew the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention to financial constraints as a 
common obstacle to the successful completion of the internship conducive to obtaining the 
title of lawyer, as there is no legislation that guarantees budget allocation to paid interns.  
After a successful internship, candidates are admitted to pass a practical examination to 
receive the professional title. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the current disagreements between OAM 
and IPAJ in connection with the content and modalities of the internship, and invites both 
institutions to explore avenues for cooperation and partnership with a view to building a 
stronger legal profession in Mozambique. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The organization of the legal profession 
</b></p>
<p>78. Shortly after independence, private legal practice was made illegal in Mozambique. 
In 1986, the need for an organized system of legal representation became increasingly 
apparent and the National Institute for Legal Aid (INAJ) was established to channel the 
provision of all legal services. The 1990 Constitution and the reorientation of the economy 
allowed the recognition of a modern bar association, OAM, established by Law No. 7/94.15  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these developments, which are in accordance 
with international standards.16 She wishes to underscore the importance of an organized 
legal profession, including an independent and self-regulated association to safeguard the 
professional interests of lawyers, while protecting and strengthening ethics and the integrity 
and independence of the legal profession. She invites the international and regional 
community to explore ways of cooperating with OAM so that it can implement its Strategic 
Plan 2009-2014 and continue performing its important functions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other categories of officials related to the legal profession 
</b></p>
<p>80. To fill the shortage of lawyers in the country, IPAJ has promoted, and in some 
instances trained, other categories of officials (who are not accredited by OAM) to provide 
</p>
<p>  
 14 Since 1976 Louren&#231;o Marques University has been called Eduardo Mondlane University. 
 15 Law no. 28/2009 is the new statute of OAM. 
 16 See principles 23 and 25 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers.  See also Principles and 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>legal services. These officials are legal technicians and legal assistants. There is a separate 
category of officials related to the legal profession known as paralegals.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Legal technicians and legal assistants 
</b></p>
<p>81. Information provided by the Government indicates that legal technicians are persons 
admitted to IPAJ who have a Bachelor of Laws degree or have attended three years (or at 
least two years, according to other sources) in a law faculty and concluded all legal 
proceedings courses. Legal assistants are persons who have undertaken special training (not 
necessarily legal education) provided by the Ministry of Justice. They are assigned to police 
stations, prisons, associations, courts and the PIC Office. They may practise before courts 
in a similar way to a lawyer admitted to the Bar, but only in areas where the number of 
lawyers is insufficient. 
</p>
<p>82. OAM determines whether the number of lawyers in any given place is sufficient. In 
criminal cases and outside the capital (and even in district tribunals on the periphery of 
Maputo), clients in court are almost exclusively represented by legal technicians and legal 
assistants. 
</p>
<p>83. IPAJ is an agency subordinated to the Ministry of Justice and its members (legal 
technicians and legal assistants) are civil servants, paid from the general State budget funds. 
However, in practice, not all members have a formal contractual relationship with IPAJ, 
and some do not receive any salary from the State budget. This is the case for law students 
undertaking their legal clinic at IPAJ, and who have therefore been certified by this body.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Paralegals 
</b></p>
<p>84. Due to<b> </b>the<b> </b>lack of lawyers and legal professionals, an increasing number of citizens 
rely on legal aid provided by representatives of civil society organizations accredited by 
IPAJ as paralegals. These individuals do not have law degrees, and possess only a basic 
knowledge of law to mediate daily conflicts in communities. Among the organizations 
providing legal assistance are the Mozambican Human Rights League (LDH) and the 
Women&#8217;s Association for Law and Development (MULEIDE). While the Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the important contribution made by civil society in providing legal 
aid, she notes that it is necessary to have a clear definition of paralegals and of their level of 
instruction in order to preserve a harmonious application of the law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Capacity-building of legal professionals and other categories of officials 
related to the legal profession 
</b></p>
<p>85. According to both the Basic Principles and the Regional Standards for Africa,17 
appropriate training is one of the preconditions for selection for judicial office. In this 
connection, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the existence of CFJJ, which 
comes under the Ministry of Justice. It was created in 1997 to train legal professionals; 
manage a legal and judicial documentation centre; publish scholarly work; and promote 
legal research.18 Since its inception, the CFJJ has trained approximately 115 new court 
staff, including 52 women, constituting 44.8 per cent of the total trainee population. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue to strengthen this 
programme, keeping the balance between the quality of the courses and their duration.  She 
notes with appreciation that it has inspired developments beyond Mozambique, notably in 
</p>
<p>  
 17 Principles and guidelines in Africa, A 4 ( i) and (k). 
 18 See Decree No. 34/1997, art. 2, of 21 October 1997. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>other Portuguese-speaking countries. However, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern 
the current limitations to the functioning of CFJJ, including the apparent shortage of 
qualified applicants to participate in some of its general training courses. She welcomes the 
establishment of baselines and expected accomplishments at CFJJ, such as the 100-
candidate project, and invites it to include both qualitative and quantitative performance 
evaluation indicators in its strategic management and planning efforts. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underscore the importance of training at all stages 
of the judicial career, including pre-service and initial training, but also continuing learning 
opportunities for judges as a way to constantly increase their knowledge and build their 
capacity to resist internal and external influences. She praises the CFJJ provision of both 
general and specialized courses for legal professionals and encourages it, together with its 
cooperation partners, to study the possibility of further expanding its efforts at the 
provincial and district levels.<b> </b></p>
<p><b> E. Lawyers </b></p>
<p>88. With the exception of provinces where the number of lawyers is either insufficient 
or non-existent, the exercise of advocacy by legal professionals has been restricted to those 
registered with OAM. However, IPAJ will also be able to provide accreditation to lawyers, 
which could possibly lead to conflict with OAM. 
</p>
<p>89. Strict and clear admission procedures for mandatory membership are paramount to 
preserving the integrity of the legal profession and gaining credibility among the public and 
the relevant branches of government. 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur was made aware of the shortage of qualified lawyers outside 
the capital: some provinces such as Gaza or Niassa did not have a resident advocate. 
Currently, only Maputo City, Maputo Province and Beira are considered to have sufficient 
lawyers. 
</p>
<p>91. The categories of legal professionals in Mozambique include judges, prosecutors 
and lawyers (see sections I, J and K).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Judges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The selection and appointment of judges 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the disadvantages associated 
with judicial appointment procedures which rely heavily on political considerations. In 
some jurisdictions, judges are popularly elected, rather than appointed on the basis of merit. 
She wishes to insist on the importance of an appointment system based on a career of 
promotion and successful applications based on merit. Increased security of tenure helps to 
protect judges from outside pressures. Appropriate systems of selection, appointment and 
promotion, and disciplinary measures that are transparent, predictable and objective, are the 
best protection for achieving independence and impartiality.  
</p>
<p>93. Information received indicated that, in numerous cases, membership of the ruling 
party (in power since 1975) is a de facto prerequisite for access to public administration, 
including the judiciary, as well as for career advancement and job security. This situation 
and the lack of an effective system of checks and balances constitute considerable obstacles 
to the development of a truly independent judiciary. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Classification and promotion of judges </b></p>
<p>94. Judges may be classified at the A, B, C and D levels at the district and provincial 
courts according to their seniority, with salary implications. Many judges highlighted that 
they considered that there was an environment of competition and inequality among them 
due to this classification and emphasized the need to establish mechanisms to ensure that 
classification corresponds to the actual level of their legal education and experience. 
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur also received information on instances where judicial 
decisions had a direct impact on the classification and promotion of judges, clearly 
undermining the independence of the judiciary. Also, a number of stakeholders alleged 
undue influence in the classification of judges and its detrimental implications for the 
independence and transparency of the judicial system. 
</p>
<p>96. However, the Special Rapporteur observes with appreciation efforts undertaken by 
the Government to ensure objective criteria for the classification and promotion of judges, 
such as the establishment of quality commissions for assessing the merits of judges to be 
promoted to magistrates.19 She wishes to stress the importance of final decisions on 
promotions being taken by an independent body in charge of the process of promotion, 
composed of a majority of judges. While adequate professional experience is an essential 
prerequisite for promotion, it should not be the only factor taken into account in such 
decisions. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, promotion, like initial selection and 
appointment, should continue to be merit-based, having due regard to integrity, 
qualification, ability and efficiency. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Tenure and removability of judges 
</b></p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the prominence given to the irremovability and 
irrevocability of judges by the Constitution (arts. 217 (3) and 218 (2)), which is one of the 
main pillars guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary. As only in exceptional 
circumstances may the principle of irremovability be transgressed, the Special Rapporteur 
wishes to recall the importance of laws providing detailed guidance on judicial malpractice 
triggering disciplinary measures, including the gravity of the misdeed, which determines 
the kind of disciplinary measure to be applied in the case at hand. Disciplinary measures to 
be adopted must be proportional to the gravity of the misdeed committed by the judge; 
hence a well-defined scheme of available disciplinary measures should be adopted. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to highlight the importance of the existence of 
an independent body or mechanism with responsibility for disciplining judges through a 
procedure in compliance with due process and fair trial guarantees, including guaranteeing 
an independent review of the decision. Temporary or provisional judges, when they exist, 
must have the same guarantees as those with a life or fixed-term tenure, given that they 
perform similar judicial tasks. The discretionary dismissal of temporary judges puts the 
independence of the judiciary at stake. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Immunity of judges 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Basic Principles stipulate that judges should enjoy personal immunity from civil 
suits for monetary damages for improper acts or omissions in the exercise of their judicial 
functions. According to the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal 
Assistance in Africa, judicial officers shall not be criminally liable for such acts or 
omissions. The Constitution states that &#8220;judges may be held responsible in civil, criminal, 
</p>
<p>  
 19 See High Council of the Judiciary, resolution 8/CSMJ/P/2001, art. 1. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>and disciplinary proceedings for acts committed in the discharge of their duties only in 
cases specified by law&#8221; (art. 218 (1). 
</p>
<p>100. In order to protect judges from unwarranted prosecution, the Special Rapporteur 
considers it essential that judges be granted criminal immunity, with exceptions clearly 
determined by law. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>101. The Public Prosecution Service is hierarchically subordinate to the Attorney-General 
of the Republic. It represents the State and defends such interests as the law may determine. 
Prosecutors enjoy their own statute and autonomy. They are charged by the Constitution 
with the control of the legality and duration of the detention. They also conduct criminal 
proceedings, exercise penal authority, and provide legal defence of minors and absent 
persons. 
</p>
<p>102. The Office of the Attorney-General (headed by the Attorney-General and composed 
of his deputy and a group of Assistant Attorneys-General) is based in Maputo. The 
Constitution provides that the Attorney-General should report annually to the Parliament, 
and is accountable to the Head of State. The Assistant Attorneys-General are responsible 
for representing the Public Prosecution Service in the Supreme and Administrative Courts. 
Whilst Assistant Attorneys-Generals are present in all provincial courts, a number of 
district courts are yet to be provided with prosecution services. 
</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the need to strengthen the 
independence of the Office of the Attorney-General, including reviewing the constitutional 
provision on nomination and dismissal (art. 239) and ensuring its financial autonomy. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Other aspects of the administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>104. The administration, management and appropriate functioning of the justice system 
involves different institutions, some directly related to major goals in the justice sector, 
such as ensuring access to justice and legal aid for all. Some of the key institutions that 
have not yet been mentioned in this report are the Constitutional Council,20 the Ministry of 
Interior,21 the Ministry of Justice22 and the Parliament, in particular its Commission on 
Petitions. The National Human Rights Commission of Mozambique, which is being 
established (Law 33/2009), has the potential to contribute to an effective and independent 
national system of administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>  
 20 The Constitutional Council, created in 2004 (art. 241 of the Constitution) determines the 
</p>
<p>constitutionality of legal acts and norms. 
 21 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for policing, national security and immigration affairs. It 
</p>
<p>manages the police forces, including PIC. It therefore plays an important role in the administration of 
justice, particularly regarding the correctional system. It is mainly governed by Presidential Decree 
No. 18/2000 (establishing its attributions and competences); Ministerial Diploma No. 68/2001 
(estatuto org&#226;nico) 
</p>
<p> 22 The Ministry of Justice is responsible for managing the justice sector. It provides technical advice to 
the Government, including for law and policymaking. It is also charged with, inter alia, supervising 
the correctional system; ensuring the quality of the legal profession and ensuring the right to a legal 
defence. It is governed, inter alia, by Presidential Decree No. 5/95 (defining its objectives and  
functions); Ministerial Diploma No. 201/2004 (establishing its internal regulations); Ministerial 
Diploma No. 43/2003 (unifying the correctional system); and Decree No. 7/2006 (organizing the 
correctional system). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 
</b></p>
<p>105. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur commends efforts undertaken by the 
Government to ensure adequate coordination among the various governmental actors 
involved in the administration of justice. She welcomes the establishment of courthouse 
complexes (<i>pal&#225;cios de justi&#231;a</i>), which illustrates the steps taken to ensure better 
coordination between tribunals, prosecutors, IPAJ and PIC, and to speed up judicial 
proceedings and facilitate access to justice for all. 
</p>
<p>106. The Coordinating Council for Legality and Justice (CCLJ) informally functions at 
national, provincial and district levels. Composed of representatives of the relevant 
Government ministries, the Prosecutor-General and the courts, it was established in 2001 
but was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Council for lack of compliance with 
the principle of separation of powers. However, it is informally functioning at the 
provincial and district levels, meeting monthly to exchange views and evaluate the conduct 
of business. The Special Rapporteur encourages the establishment of a systematic dialogue 
between the various organs responsible for ensuring the effective delivery of justice in 
Mozambique. In Nampula and Beira, she was informed about the positive impact that 
efforts of coordination and cooperation among justice sector institutions have had on the 
ground.  
</p>
<p>107. Many institutional challenges remain which relate to the effective administration of 
justice. The Supreme Court has been partially operating for several years without the 
minimum number of judges required by law. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to take all necessary steps to nominate judges for the Supreme Court so that it can start to 
address its backlog. It urges the Government to create the conditions to enable the Superior 
Tribunals of Appeals and its judges to begin to perform their duties with efficiency and 
impartiality, as measures to address the severe congestion of appeals in the judicial system. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The correctional system and fair trial guarantees  
</b></p>
<p>108. Within the framework of earlier reforms, the National Service for Prisons 
(SNAPRI)23 was established within the organizational structure of the Ministry of Justice to 
manage the correctional system. Headed by a General-Director appointed by the Prime 
Minister, its main responsibilities include supervising the management of prison 
establishments and the execution of security measures; the security and protection of the 
prison establishments; the execution of penalties; the promotion and management of 
employment contracts; and the design and implementation of draft policies and strategies 
oriented to prisoners&#8217; social reintegration. 
</p>
<p>109. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur heard allegations of lack of respect for the 
principle of the presumption of innocence, access to legal assistance and the right to a 
lawyer; prolonged and de facto indefinite detention; lengthy trials, the excessive use of 
preventive detention and the inadequate implementation of the principle of equality before 
the law. Slightly more than 30 per cent of detainees were in preventive detention, which is a 
figure close to that of many other countries worldwide. However, the specificity of 
Mozambique is that many detainees who may only have received minor sentences are 
currently in preventive detention. 
</p>
<p>110. The Government is aware of this and other pitfalls in the correctional system and has 
adopted a new integrated approach to improve conditions in detention facilities, including 
granting inmates access to justice. Revision of the legislation is under way. The draft 
legislation is almost complete and is to be submitted to the Council of Ministers and the 
</p>
<p>  
 23 See Decree No. 7/2006. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>Parliament in 2011. The new legislation should include the permanent presence of a 
minimum of one IPAJ member of staff per facility. Furthermore, correctional authorities 
should work to ensure that all consultations between lawyers or IPAJ officials and detainees 
are confidential. To guarantee the application of this constitutional right (art. 63.4), 
detention facilities should identify venues where such consultations could take place. The 
Ministry of Justice is also preparing new legislation to introduce alternatives to prison 
detention, with the support of UTREL and UNDP. 
</p>
<p>111. After her visit to the Maximum Security Prison in Maputo and her consultations 
with a wide variety of actors, it became clear to the Special Rapporteur that in order to 
expedite trials and avoid situations of unlawful detention, resources should be allocated to 
facilitate the transportation of detainees to and from courts and ensure the systematization 
of records on cases. Efforts to ensure the application of the principle of<b> </b><i>nulla p&#339;na sine 
lege </i>should also be redoubled<b><i>.</i></b>  The Special Rapporteur wishes to invite the international 
community to accompany Mozambique in this important process, which entails the 
modernization and automation of the justice sector. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Gender and the justice sector 
</b></p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to cultural practices that may be 
detrimental to the human rights of women and in some instances of children, including in 
relation to their rights to access to justice and to an effective remedy. According to a 
number of stakeholders, women are at times prevented from resorting to legal avenues in 
cases of violence and divorce on the basis that their husbands must be informed or called to 
solve the problem. Other examples include practices that can make widows and orphaned 
children more vulnerable, such as those of mourning rituals for the &#8220;cleansing of the 
widow&#8221; (called <i>pita-kufa</i> or <i>kutxinga</i>) and those of depriving widows and orphan children 
of inheritance, practised for example in Zambezia and other provinces.  
</p>
<p>113. In light of the above, the Special Rapporteur recommends that efforts to disseminate 
laws aimed at, and mechanisms available for, the protection of women and children, 
including those related to specialized sections in the tribunals as well as measures against 
domestic and other types of gender and age-based violence, be redoubled. In this regard, 
she welcomes Law 29/09 against domestic violence as an important addition to the 
establishment of Cabinets on Violence against Women and Children, and encourages the 
Government to continue expanding their coverage and equipping them with adequate 
resources for the psychological, medical and legal support and assistance of victims. 
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur learned that there was a dearth of data on women&#8217;s 
representation in the legal profession and their participation in training and capacity-
building efforts in the justice sector. This includes law schools and other institutions, which 
are yet to mainstream a gender approach. She also received information indicating that 
national legislation establishing gender quotas or the undertaking of parity reforms within 
the judiciary is not envisaged in the near future. However, she was pleased to learn that 
gender parity is effectively applied as a general rule for the selection and appointment of 
judges and that it is taken into consideration in the appointment of community judges in the 
district of Meconta. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the efforts carried out by Mozambique to 
develop judicial institutions that are independent and impartial. The challenge now at 
hand is the establishment of a fully independent judiciary, composed of independent </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22 
</b></p>
<p><b>magistrates and judges, assisted by impartial prosecutors and lawyers who may 
develop and exercise their profession in a totally independent and professional 
manner. Regarding the judiciary, the colonial heritage should be left behind as a 
modern and efficient judiciary becomes one of the components of a modern, 
democratic State governed by the rule of law. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>The constitutional, legal and policy framework regulating the judiciary in 
Mozambique gives a prominent place to its independence and recognizes the 
principles of the separation of powers and supremacy of the rule of law. The 
independence and strengthening of the judiciary have been incorporated as objectives 
within the pillar on good governance in key documents for the country, such as 
Agenda 2025; the Five-Year Government Plan; the Plan for the Reduction of Extreme 
Poverty and the Economic and Social Plan. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Despite the encouraging constitutional, legal and policy framework, several 
obstacles remain to the institutional independence and impartiality of the judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Based on her findings, and with a view to contributing to the development of an 
effective system of administration of justice that ensures independence, impartiality, 
integrity, equality and transparency, as a prerequisite for guaranteeing the enjoyment 
of human rights for all in Mozambique, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the 
following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Strengthening the independence of the judiciary 
</i></p>
<p>119. <b>The Government of Mozambique should redouble its efforts to uphold the 
independence of the judiciary and to that end, the Government should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Consider undertaking constitutional and legal reforms aimed at 
strengthening the principles of the separation of powers and checks and 
balances, inter alia, by reducing the concentration of power in the hands 
of the President of the Republic and the role of the Executive organ in 
judicial affairs; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) As a way to address the need to make a clear distinction between the 
political party in power and the Executive and in order to avoid undue 
influence, including in judicial affairs, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends the adoption of a code of ethics for all civil servants 
(excluding those who are popularly elected), which should proscribe the 
holding of any office in a political organization and the soliciting of funds 
for, or the making of contributions to, a political organization or 
candidate, as well as a caution to refrain, whenever possible, from 
attending political gatherings and engaging in political activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Create all the necessary conditions for the High Council of the Judiciary 
to be fully operational, facilitating the undertaking of planning 
processes, including budgeting and staffing needs, and establishing a 
system for the dissemination of its activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Establish safeguards to ensure the budgetary allocations for the 
judiciary and the financial autonomy of the courts at all levels, the Office 
of the Attorney-General and IPAJ; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>23</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(v) Consider reviewing the system of emoluments emanating from court fees 
and adopt mechanisms to allow the determination, with more objectivity 
and equality, of the salaries of judicial officials and the remuneration of 
magistrates. One such mechanism could be the adoption of pay scales for 
judicial officers and magistrates specifying the annual salary rate to 
which holders of a judicial office are entitled; the circumstances in which 
any adjustment of the salaries takes effect in respect of a financial year 
and the allowances to which judicial officers and magistrates are 
entitled; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Consider establishing mechanisms to allocate court cases in an objective 
manner such as drawing of lots; systems for automatic allocation by 
alphabetical order; or predetermined court management plans 
incorporating objective criteria, and to monitor the adjudication of cases 
in accordance with the jurisdictional competence of tribunals (<i>ratione 
materiae, ratione loci and ratione personae</i>). 
</b></p>
<p><i> (b) Access to justice and strengthening the legal profession   
</i></p>
<p>120.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Mozambique, 
with the assistance of the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Provide all required support to IPAJ to enable it to achieve effective 
representation throughout the territory and obtain the administrative 
and financial autonomy necessary for carrying out its functions with 
more efficiency; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Provide free legal aid to asylum-seekers throughout the period taken to 
determine their status as refugees, including interpretation services; as 
well as forensic, psychological and medical services, as required; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Undertake the necessary steps to provide Mozambicans with national 
identification cards to allow them to be fully recognized as persons 
before the law and to resort to the justice system, if necessary. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Increase efforts to raise awareness on human rights and the rule of law, 
particularly on the justice administration system, the mechanisms 
available to seek legal redress, and the role of an independent judiciary.  
</b></p>
<p><i> (c) Gender and the justice sector  
</i></p>
<p>121. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Continue expanding coverage of the cabinets on violence against women 
and children and equip them with technical and human resources, 
including psychological and social support and other care for victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Provide gender- and age-specific training to police and other officials 
providing assistance to women and children in the above-mentioned 
cabinets and make available IPAJ representatives to provide the 
required legal advice for the victims, to allow them access to mechanisms 
of compensation and redress under employment legislation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Strengthen awareness programmes on the existence and services 
provided by the cabinets on violence against women and children, on the 
rights of both women and children and on the mechanisms available in 
the judicial system to seek redress and compensation for domestic and 
other types of violence. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>24 
</b></p>
<p><i> (d) Other recommendations  
</i></p>
<p>122. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the international community, including the 
United Nations and the donor community, to continue assisting the Government of 
Mozambique to strengthen good governance and justice. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Mozambique to avail 
itself of the technical cooperation and assistance of the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the United Nations Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
to complement ongoing efforts to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Assist in conducting a comprehensive assessment of the justice system to 
identify further areas of technical assistance and cooperation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Assist agencies in the design of interventions (including capacity-building 
efforts) in the justice sector to integrate human rights standards and 
norms, particularly in the system of criminal justice;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Undertake a thorough joint assessment of information management 
needs, including a possible automation and modernization plan for the 
justice sector.
