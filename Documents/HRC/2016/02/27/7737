<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 22/3, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a study on the right of 
persons with disabilities to education, in consultation with States and other relevant 
stakeholders, including the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), regional organizations, the 
Special Rapporteur on disability of the Commission for Social Development, civil society 
organizations, including organizations of persons with disabilities, and national human 
rights institutions. The resolution also requested that the study be made available on the 
OHCHR website, in an accessible format, prior to the twenty-fifth session of the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. To this end, OHCHR invited contributions from Member States, UNICEF, 
UNESCO, regional organizations, civil society organizations and organizations of persons 
with disabilities, the Special Rapporteur on disability of the Commission for Social 
Development, and national human rights institutions, transmitting a set of questions related 
to education of persons with disabilities. As a result, OHCHR received 39 responses from 
States, 12 from national human rights institutions and 31 from civil society organizations 
and other stakeholders. The full texts of all submissions received are available on the 
OHCHR website.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. The right to inclusive education as a human right 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Inclusion as a fundamental principle of education 
</b></p>
<p>3. The right to education is a universal right recognized by international human rights 
law and, as such, applies to all persons, including persons with disabilities. Several 
international instruments, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, affirm the core principles of universality and non-discrimination in the 
enjoyment of the right to education.2 Inclusive education has been acknowledged as the 
most appropriate modality for States to guarantee universality and non-discrimination in the 
right to education. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes 
that, for persons with disabilities to exercise this right, inclusive education systems must be 
in place and, consequently, the right to education is a right to inclusive education. 
</p>
<p>4. School systems have typically adopted one of three different approaches to persons 
with disabilities: exclusion, segregation and integration. Exclusion occurs when a student is 
kept away from school on the basis of the existence of an impairment, without another 
educational opportunity on equal terms with other students being provided. Through this 
approach, a student with disabilities is prevented from joining the education system on the 
basis of age, development or diagnosis and is placed in a social welfare or health-care 
environment without access to education. Segregation occurs when such a student is sent to 
a school designed to respond to a particular impairment, usually in a special-education 
school system. Finally, integration is when a student with an impairment is placed in a

<p>mainstream school,3 so long as he or she can adjust to fit the standardized requirements of 
the school. The integration approach focuses solely on enhancing the ability of the student 
to comply with the established standards.4 
</p>
<p>5. Approaches that exclude, segregate and integrate on the basis of the existence of an 
impairment may be taken at the same time in the same country, and may affect others in 
addition to persons with disabilities. The inclusive education approach has emerged as a 
response to these discriminatory approaches. According to its preface, the Salamanca 
Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education (&#8220;Salamanca Statement&#8221;) 
is informed by the &#8220;recognition of the need to work towards &#8216;schools for all&#8217; &#8212; institutions 
which include everybody, celebrate differences, support learning, and respond to individual 
needs&#8221;. On the basis of the Salamanca Statement, inclusive education5 systems are those 
with schools using &#8220;a child-centred pedagogy capable of successfully educating all 
children, including those who have serious disadvantages and disabilities&#8221; (Framework for 
Action, para. 3). The Statement also calls for a change in social perspective. As stated by 
the former Special Rapporteur of the Commission for Social Development for monitoring 
the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons 
with Disabilities, &#8220;all children and young people of the world, with their individual 
strengths and weaknesses, with their hopes and expectations, have the right to education. It 
is not our education systems that have a right to certain types of children. Therefore, it is 
the school system of a country that must be adjusted to meet the needs of all children.&#8221;6 
</p><p>6. The shift towards an inclusive approach to education was reflected at the 1990 
World Conference on Education for All, with which the problem of the exclusion of 
students with disabilities from school systems was acknowledged. The need for integration 
in mainstream schools was recognized in the Warnock Report as early as 1978.7 The 
adoption in 1993 of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons 
with Disabilities provided for integration, but it was not until 1994 that the Salamanca 
Statement, signed by 92 Governments, called for inclusive education. The Statement 
required mainstream schools to provide quality education to all students, including students 
with disabilities, without discriminating on the basis of the higher requirements of support 
that they may need (p. viii). The Dakar Framework for Action on Education for All of 2000 
stressed that education systems must be inclusive and respond flexibly to the circumstances 
and needs of all learners.8 The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) Guidelines for Inclusion of 2005 emphasize that at the core of 
inclusive education is the human right to education.9 In 2006, building on these precedents, 
in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities legally binding status was 
given to the concept of &#8220;inclusive education systems&#8221;, which were recognized as the only 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
  The terms &#8220;mainstream schools&#8221;, &#8220;general education&#8221;, &#8220;regular schools&#8221; and &#8220;ordinary schools&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>commonly used to refer to schools systems that receive students with or without impairments as 
opposed to &#8220;special schools&#8221; that only receive students with impairments. In the present report, the 
first terms will be used interchangeably to refer to &#8220;general education&#8221;, as these schools are referred 
to in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

<p>means to ensure the right to education to all students, including persons with disabilities, 
without discrimination and on equal terms with others. In other words, in the Convention it 
was underscored that the right to education is in fact the right to inclusive education. 
</p>
<p>7. Inclusion is a process that recognizes: (a) the obligation to eliminate barriers that 
restrict or ban participation, and (b) the need to change culture, policy and practice10 of the 
mainstream schools to accommodate the needs of all students, including those with 
impairments. An inclusive education implies transforming the school system and ensuring 
interpersonal interactions based upon core values which allow for the full learning potential 
of every person to emerge. It also implies effective participation, individualized instruction 
and inclusive pedagogies. Some key values of inclusive education are equality, 
participation, non-discrimination, celebrating diversity and sharing good practices. The 
inclusive approach values students as persons, respects their inherent dignity and 
acknowledges their needs and their ability to make a contribution to society. It also 
acknowledges difference as an opportunity for learning, and recognizes the relationship 
between the school and the wider community as grounds for creating inclusive societies 
with a sense of belonging (not only for students but for teachers and parents too). 
</p><p>8. Inclusive education is socially important because it provides a sound platform for 
countering stigmatization and discrimination. A mixed learning environment that includes 
persons with disabilities allows their contributions to be valued, and prejudices and 
misconceptions to be progressively challenged and dismantled. Inclusive education also 
enhances quality education for all by leading to wider-ranging curricula and instructional 
strategies which contribute to the overall development of capacities and skills. This nexus 
of learning and development &#8212; when inclusive of a diversity of participants with varying 
abilities &#8212; introduces new perspectives for achieving objectives and self-esteem, and 
empowering individuals to build a society based on mutual respect and rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The realization of the right to education is a precondition for social and economic 
inclusion, and full participation in society. The right to education has, therefore, been 
recognized as an example of the indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights on 
account of its key role in the full and effective realization of other rights.11 Formal 
education facilitates formal certification, which is increasingly required by the open job 
market today. This makes it necessary for persons with disabilities to obtain educational 
degrees and certificates equally with others in order to compete and be part of the 
workforce. This becomes all the more important considering that persons with disabilities 
suffer from disproportionally higher rates of unemployment due to discrimination.12 
Furthermore, the improved employability of persons with disabilities reduces welfare costs 
and contributes to economic growth. The negative impact of the unemployment of persons 
with disabilities on gross domestic product13 could be reduced by guaranteeing access to 
inclusive education systems.

<p><b> B. Normative evolution of the right to inclusive education 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Inclusive education in international human rights treaties and legal instruments 
</b></p>
<p>10. The right to education is recognized as a fundamental human right in article 26 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequently classified by a number of 
legal instruments that expanded its scope and clarified State obligations. This process 
eventually led to the acknowledgment in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities that inclusive education is the best modality to comply with the universality of 
this right. The Convention against Discrimination in Education, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights were all advances towards this.  
</p>
<p>11. The right to education, as stated in article 13 of the Covenant, entails: (a) free and 
compulsory primary education for all; (b) secondary education &#8211; including technical and 
vocational education &#8211; and higher education available and equally accessible to all by the 
progressive introduction of free education; (c) the encouragement of fundamental education 
for adults who have not received or not completed primary education; and (d) the 
development of a school system, the establishment of a fellowship system, and programmes 
for the continuing improvement of the working conditions of teachers. In the Covenant, the 
right of parents or guardians to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their 
children is recognized, provided it conforms to the minimum educational standards.  
</p>
<p>12. Education in all of its forms and at all levels should exhibit four interrelated and 
essential features, namely, availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability14 (often 
referred to as the &#8220;4 As&#8221;). Availability means that an adequate number of functioning 
educational institutions are available; accessibility requires them to be accessible &#8211; both 
physically and economically &#8211; to everyone without discrimination; acceptability means that 
the form and content of education must be relevant, culturally appropriate and of good 
quality, hence acceptable to students and, wherever appropriate, to parents. And finally, 
adaptability requires education to be flexible in order to adapt to the changing realities and 
needs of the students within their diverse social and cultural settings. Adaptability is also a 
need to develop schools capable of successfully educating all children, and is therefore a 
core principle of inclusive education. 
</p>
<p>13. While in the Covenant progressive realization is provided for and the constraints 
placed by limited available resources recognized, there are general and specific legal 
obligations contained in article 13 thereof that take immediate effect, including the 
elimination of discriminatory provisions and the provision of primary education for all. The 
failure to comply with these obligations constitutes a direct violation of the right to 
education.15 Under the non-discrimination provision in the Covenant, a reduction of 
structural disadvantages is required and the achievement of effective participation and 
equality for all persons with disabilities is given as an aim. This provision recognizes that 
persons with disabilities can be best educated within the general education system, and 
there is an implicit call in the Covenant to States to include persons with disabilities in 
mainstream education and lifelong training.16

<p>of the Child and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, have looked at the specific implications of the 
enjoyment of the right to education for specific groups.17 The right to education was also 
recognized in international legal instruments pertaining to refugee law and international 
humanitarian law, and in several conventions of the International Labour Organization. 
</p>
<p>15. Regional human rights systems have also recognized the right to education, 
including the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the American Convention on 
Human Rights and the first Additional Protocol thereto in the area of Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms and the Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>16. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has advanced the right to inclusive 
education by adopting as core principles the maximum inclusion of children with 
disabilities in society (and in education), and their right to education without any 
discrimination, and on the basis of equal opportunity.18 Discrimination undermines the 
capacity of children with disabilities to benefit from educational opportunities and 
compromises the goal to develop their personality, talents and mental and physical abilities 
to their fullest potential.19 Consequently, assistance to ensure access to education in a 
manner conducive to achieving these goals must be provided. The resources allocated 
should be sufficient to cover all relevant needs, including programmes aimed at including 
children with disabilities in mainstream education.20  
</p>
<p>17. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has endorsed the concept of inclusive 
education as a set of values, principles and practices that seeks meaningful, effective and 
quality education for all students, and that does justice to the diversity of learning 
conditions and requirements not only of children with disabilities, but for all students.21 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>18. In article 24 of the Convention, the right to education of persons with disabilities is 
reaffirmed and inclusive education recognized as the means to make the universal right to 
education effective for persons with disabilities. The Convention is the first legally binding 
instrument to contain an explicit reference to the concept of inclusive education. Similar to 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities does not establish a new right, but rather clarifies the specific implications for 
persons with disabilities of enjoying the right to education &#8220;without discrimination and on 
the basis of equal opportunities&#8221;. In this article, it is stipulated that States parties should 
ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and lifelong learning (para. 1). 
Paragraphs 2&#8211;5 of article 24 contain guidance on the measures required to establish an 
inclusive education system.22 It is important to note that the provisions contained within the 
articles must be considered in their entirety and not separately. Article 24 is connected to 
</p>

<p>of education.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>22
  The obligation for States to establish inclusive education systems does not imply any limitation on the 
</p>
<p>right of parents to decide the education strategy for their children, including home schooling, as long 
as it provides for quality education in line with the goals and requirements arising from human rights 
law. </p>


<p>and dependent on all the others articles of the Convention and must be read under the 
general principles adopted in article 3. Article 24 should be read in conjunction with 
article 19 (living independently and being included in the community), the requirement of 
an inclusive education system also being a prerequisite for the full inclusion and 
participation in a community, and for countering the isolation and segregation, of persons 
with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>19. The goals of education as referred to in article 24, paragraph 1, are neither disability-
specific nor disability-related. The article echoes the general objectives as proclaimed in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and reflected in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, namely, the development of human potential and 
sense of dignity (article 24 also refers to a sense of &#8220;self-worth&#8221;), respect for human rights 
(article 24 adds &#8220;human diversity&#8221;), the development of personality, talent and abilities to a 
person&#8217;s fullest potential, and effective participation in a free society.  
</p>
<p>20. Article 24, paragraph 2, provides for ensuring that persons with disabilities are not 
excluded from the general education system, which implies that students should not be 
rejected by mainstream schools on the basis of any impairment (art. 24, para. 2 (a)). States 
are also required thereby to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to an inclusive, 
quality and free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others. 
The concepts of accessibility and adaptability are particularly relevant in this regard. 
Accessibility is reinforced by article 9 of the Convention, in which State parties are 
required to take appropriate measures to ensure access to persons with disabilities.23 
Adaptability is an essential feature in a comprehensive review of the education system in 
order to make schools inclusive.  
</p>
<p>21. In article 24, paragraph 2 (c), States parties are required to provide reasonable 
accommodation, which, as defined in article 2 of the Convention, is based on an individual 
assessment to ensure the enjoyment of human rights. It is important to highlight that, under 
the Convention, the denial of reasonable accommodation is discrimination on the basis of 
disability and hence prohibited with immediate effect. Under article 24, paragraph 2 (d) and 
(e), States parties are obliged to provide the necessary support, including individualized 
support measures. 
</p>
<p>22. Article 24, paragraph 3, focuses on the equality of opportunities for persons with 
disabilities with special attention given to the needs of persons sharing a common form of 
impairment. It requires States parties to enable persons with disabilities to acquire life and 
social development skills to facilitate their full and equal participation in education and in 
their communities. This includes facilitating the learning of Braille, sign language, and 
other means and formats of communication, as well as of orientation and mobility skills. In 
the case of the deaf community, the promotion of the linguistic identity is required. This 
provision is aimed at ensuring that persons facing communication barriers are not excluded 
from the general education system and that they receive instruction in the appropriate 
languages, modes and means of communication in environments which maximize their 
development, not only academic but also social. 
</p>
<p>23. In article 24, paragraph 4, it is indicated that for general education systems to be 
inclusive teachers who are qualified in sign language and/or Braille must be employed. 
Furthermore, professionals and staff who work at all levels of education must be trained in 
disability awareness and in the use of appropriate communication, educational techniques 
and materials.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23
  Schools are explicitly referred to in article 9, paragraph 1 (a).  </p>


<p>24. Article 24, paragraph 5, refers to access to general tertiary education, vocational 
training, adult education and lifelong learning. In it, the right of persons with disabilities to 
access these opportunities without discrimination and on an equal basis with others is 
reaffirmed. This implies both a general accessibility requirement and the provision of 
reasonable accommodation.  
</p>
<p>25. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has called for States 
parties to guarantee and implement the right to inclusive education in its concluding 
observations.24 The Committee has encouraged a gender approach in the implementation of 
article 24.25 It has also recommended the inclusion in mainstream schools of Roma 
children,26 persons of African descent,27 indigenous people and those living in rural areas.28 
The Committee has on various occasions expressed an opinion on favouring mainstream 
schools over special schools.29 
</p>
<p><b> III. The right to inclusive education of persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. No-rejection clause 
</b>26. The right of persons with disabilities to receive education in mainstream schools is 
included in article 24, paragraph 2 (a), which states that no student can be rejected from 
general education on the basis of disability. As an anti-discrimination measure, the &#8220;no-
rejection clause&#8221; has immediate effect and is reinforced by reasonable accommodation. It is 
advised that education laws explicitly state a &#8220;no-rejection clause&#8221;, forbidding the denial of 
admission into mainstream schools and guaranteeing continuity in education. Impairment-
based assessment to assign schools should be discontinued and support needs for effective 
participation in mainstream schools assessed. For examples, New Brunswick, Canada, has a 
school policy that provides for non-rejection of students from mainstream education30 by 
guaranteeing inclusive education. 
</p>
<p>27. The legal framework for education should require every measure possible to avoid 
exclusion. Some education systems establish specific mechanisms that have the effect of 
excluding students for instance by setting age limits on the completion of grades.

contained programs or classes for students with learning or behavioural challenges, either in school or 
in community-based learning opportunities. 2) Alternative education programs for students enrolled 
in kindergarten to grade eight&#8221;. </p>


<p>Legislation supporting these systems and those that openly exclude students from education 
on the basis of having an impairment should be amended. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to inclusive, quality and free education 
</b></p>
<p>28. An inclusive education system does not imply a lower quality of education; on the 
contrary, establishing quality education is at the core of the recommended measures. 
Quality education is related to the concept of acceptability (4 As), and UNESCO has 
recommended five dimensions to further advance this goal: respect for rights, equity, 
relevance, pertinence, and efficiency and efficacy.31 
</p>
<p>29. The human right to education brings to the fore the principles of free and obligatory 
primary education, and progressively free secondary and higher education accessible to all 
without discrimination. Non-discrimination can eliminate exclusion and expulsion in 
education by promoting participation in decision-making.  
</p>
<p>30. In the context of education, equity means that each student can benefit from the 
opportunities offered by the system. Education systems must therefore provide for 
substantive equality linked to outcomes. Equity needs to be ensured in access, process and 
results. 
</p>
<p>31. Education must be relevant, in accordance with the objectives ascribed to it by 
society, and must serve the purposes explicitly recognized in article 24, paragraph 1, of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In highlighting the need for 
education to be relevant, UNESCO recommends the four pillars outlined in the Delors 
Report (learning to know, to do, to be and to live together).32 
</p><p>32. Pertinent and meaningful education should allow for the development of autonomy, 
self-government and identity by adapting to the needs of the student. This implies moving 
away from homogeneity to the pedagogy of diversity. 
</p>
<p>33. Efficacy and efficiency are attributes of quality education. Education must be 
efficacious in translating the right to quality education into meaningful practice, and 
efficient in recognizing and honouring the efforts made by students, not only the results.  
</p>
<p>34. Inclusive education calls for inclusive testing methods. Cognitive learning is an 
indicator of quality education, but not the only one. Testing methods should be based on the 
proposed goals of education, taking into account the different dimensions that define 
quality education. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Accessibility and eradication of barriers 
</b></p>
<p>35. Ensuring accessibility is an overarching obligation for States parties to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as detailed in article 9. Persons with 
disabilities often face barriers in physical access and communication, and owing to 
socioeconomic factors and attitudes. This in turn may have an adverse impact on their 
access to the physical environment, knowledge, educational material and information. 
Addressing and eliminating these barriers is a prerequisite to inclusive education. 
</p>

</p>
<p>(Paris, UNESCO, 1996), chap. 4. </p>


<p>36. Measures to eradicate physical and communication barriers have generally focused 
on the modification of infrastructure, the provision of accessible transportation and 
communication tools, as well as the promotion of universal design. 
</p>
<p>37. To respond to socioeconomic barriers, States may provide financial assistance or 
incentives for students with disabilities. It is important to note that free primary education 
for all implies that accessibility measures should also be free of charge. The Finnish Basic 
Education Act provides a good example of this, stating that a pupil with disability has, 
additionally, the right to free interpretation and assistance services in order to participate in 
education. 
</p>
<p>38. Barriers arising from the attitudes of teachers, fellow students and families can be 
considerable and are often difficult to surmount. It is important to note that, in Norway, for 
example, the Education Act recognizes that accessibility efforts shall apply to both the 
physical and the psychosocial environment. Measures to raise public awareness under 
article 8 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities can help overcome 
barriers of this nature. 
</p>
<p>39. The requirement to guarantee accessibility should be established by legislation and 
supported with adequate funding. In addition, schools may receive higher budget 
allocations per student for pupils with disabilities (e.g. in Mongolia it is three times higher) 
to cover expenses related to accessibility. There are good examples of interventions of 
different scales, from larger projects (the National &#8220;700 Schools&#8221; Programme in Argentina) 
to pilot projects, as in Georgia.33 While the implementation of accessibility measures is 
often assigned to local administrations, standards need to be developed at the national 
level.34 
</p>
<p>40. Accessibility means that adequate measures are taken so that all students can 
participate meaningfully. Accessibility should also inform the design of education policies. 
If respected, accessibility will progressively lead to more inclusive schools. Some school 
systems establish indicators to measure progress on the implementation of accessibility 
measures. These indicators should also cover challenges related to access to 
communication. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Reasonable accommodation in education 
</b></p>
<p>41. Reasonable accommodation as defined in the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities is an anti-discrimination measure to be realized with immediate effect.35 
The purpose of this measure is to ensure that a person with disability has access to 
education in the existing system on an equal basis with others. Denial of reasonable 
accommodation constitutes a violation of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>42. Inclusive education systems are designed to provide for a diverse constituency of 
students. However, even the most advanced inclusive education system may have gaps in 
its design because of the specific individual needs of students. In such an instance, an 
inclusive system would respond by reviewing its practice to determine whether the gaps 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33
  Under a project to introduce inclusive education in 10 public schools in Tbilisi, 10 schools were made 
</p>
<p>accessible between 2006 and 2008 in accordance with article 9 of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>34
  See also article 9, paragraph 2 (a), of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 
</p>
<p>minimum standards and guidelines for accessibility. 
 
</p>
<p>35 
 See, for example, Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, concluding observations on 
the initial report of Spain, CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1, para. 44. </p>


<p>might be addressed systemically or through a reasonable accommodation measure. A 
reasonable accommodation fund should be set up to address the gaps. 
</p>
<p>43. Reasonable accommodation is a common concept in certain legal systems. 
&#8220;Reasonableness&#8221; is understood as the result of an objective test that involves an analysis of 
the availability of resources, as well as the relevance of the accommodation, and the 
expected goal of countering discrimination. Such testing standards are yet to be developed 
in jurisprudence by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p><p>44. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued guidance on the 
obligation to take steps towards the implementation of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to encompass the maximum availability of 
resources,36 including for the right to education. This guidance on the &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; 
standard may be relevant for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities until 
such time as the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities develops its own 
guidance for specific reasonable accommodation standards under the Convention. It is also 
advisable for States to engage in interparliamentary cooperation to progress with legislation 
and judicial guidance to directly apply the non-discrimination clause of reasonable 
accommodation. Examples of good practices can be found in countries such as: Australia, 
Canada, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the 
United Kingdom, the United States of America and Zimbabwe, as well as the European 
Union.37 
</p>
<p><b> E. Support 
</b></p>
<p>45. The availability of adequate support is an essential feature of inclusive education. 
It is expressly referred to in article 24, paragraph (d) and (e), of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and is mentioned in other articles thereof. Adequate 
support is also complementary and connected to accessibility measures.  
</p>
<p>46. Support can be articulated in different ways, while always considering individual 
needs. Some education systems use the concept of Universal Design Learning in their 
inclusive policies to address both structural and individual support. This is the case in New 
Brunswick, Canada. However, integration systems can also use individualized plans. 
Individualized attention should be considered a central feature of inclusive education. The 
Finnish Basic Education Act is a case in point, granting the right to an individualized 
learning plan to all pupils who need regular support in learning. 
</p>
<p>47. The core element of individualized education plans is the involvement of 
professionals, parents and the student.38 These plans aim at enabling each student to live, 
study and act autonomously, with adequate support, taking into account individual 
capacities. Headmasters in Belgium have called for a &#8220;support panel&#8221;, when needed, to

</p>
<p>under an optional protocol to the Covenant, E/2008/22, annex VIII, pp. 146&#8211;147. The Committee said 
that the compliance with that obligation should be assessed by considering a number of elements, 
which may include the deliberate intention to fulfil economic, social and cultural rights by the 
measures taken, a non-discrimination approach in taking such measures and the time frame. Resource 
constraint should be looked through a careful analysis of the context.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>37
  As noted in a background conference document for the Ad Hoc Committee on a Comprehensive and 
</p>
<p>Integral International Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of 
Persons with Disabilities prepared by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs on the concept 
of reasonable accommodation in selected national disability legislation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>38
  UNICEF, <i>The Right of Children with Disabilities to Education</i>, p. 70. </p>


<p>evaluate the individual situation before deciding on the support measures required. 
Individual plans should be regularly updated, based on achievable targets and expressed in 
clear language.  
</p>
<p>48. There may be numerous support measures based on individual education plans, 
ranging from the provision of compensatory aids, special learning aids, assistive and 
information technology and the application of special education procedures. One of the 
most important measures is the use of a learning support assistant, either shared or on a 
one-to-one basis, depending on the needs of the student. It is important to stress that this 
non-exhaustive list is a continuum of support measures reflected in article 24, paragraph 2 
(d) and (e), of the Convention.  
</p><p>49. All of these measures should be sustained by adequate allocation of resources in the 
State budget. In Ireland, 15 per cent of the entire education budget is allocated to provide 
support in mainstream schools. Even when financial constraints have impeded full-fledged 
options, States have found creative solutions. In Guatemala, teams of itinerant pedagogical 
advisers visit mainstream schools to provide orientation and advice. The transformation of 
special schools into resource centres, as part of the process of moving from a segregated to 
inclusive education system, can be extremely useful in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Equalization of opportunities 
</b></p>
<p>50. Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
refers to a series of measures necessary for persons with disabilities, and particularly certain 
groups of persons with disabilities, to participate in the education system and in society. 
States parties must facilitate access to Braille, other alternative scripts, augmentative and 
alternative modes, diverse means and formats of communication, orientation and mobility 
skills, peer support and mentoring, as well as the learning of sign language, and promotion 
of the linguistic identity of the deaf community. Chile and the Czech Republic have 
frameworks that allow for many of these measures, while Cuba and Norway provide for 
sign-language interpreters in regular schools.  
</p>
<p>51. In article 24, paragraph 3, it is also underlined that States must ensure appropriate 
languages and modes and means of communication for the individual and environments 
which maximize academic and social development for students. Current education systems 
must develop an inclusive approach to education to convert mainstream schools into 
suitable learning environments for all students, including students who are blind, deaf and 
deaf-blind. Enhanced inclusive measures must be adopted, promoting bilingual teaching, 
not only to provide for the integration of deaf students but also for the hearing-abled 
students so that they can be part of the inclusive process. &#8220;Environments which maximize 
academic and social development&#8221; should not be read as equating to segregated 
environments, but as an obligation on States to improve the process of inclusion into 
mainstream schools. Placing students in mainstream schools is not enough; adequate 
support is needed and effective participation too.39 For example, deaf students must have 
access to signing communities to communicate properly. All students in mainstream 
schools should have access to sign-language education to improve inclusion of the deaf 
community. At the same time, students with visual or other impairments require 
accessibility measures and support appropriate to their needs.

Rights-Report.pdf. </p>


<p><b> G. Professional training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>52. Teachers are an important resource in establishing an inclusive education system. In 
article 24, paragraph 4, the need to train teachers to be supportive of students with 
disabilities and an active resource for quality education is highlighted. Integrative education 
systems have already started to provide a framework for integration training with a focus on 
inclusion. Australia and Cuba have training programmes in place to facilitate the access of 
students with disabilities in school.  
</p>
<p>53. Pre-service training on the inclusive approach to education is fundamental to prepare 
new teachers for teaching a diverse group of students and to use diversity as an opportunity 
to teach and learn. In-service training is not only necessary to provide for the requirements 
of students who are (or could be) in the school system but also for the positive 
transformation of the system. France and Colombia provide for such pre-service and in-
service training to teachers. 
</p>
<p>54. Teaching barriers need to be properly addressed. Support should be provided to 
teachers to teach all students, including those with disabilities. Training on instructional 
strategies to manage courses with students from different backgrounds and characteristics 
should be made available. Teachers should be able to reflect on their experiences and 
practices to enable them to review their methodologies and course designs for enhanced 
inclusion. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Lifelong learning 
</b></p>
<p>55. Lifelong learning is an element for ensuring the right to education. In article 24, 
paragraph 5, contains a call for tertiary and adult education, vocational training and lifelong 
education on equal terms with others. This provision is important as it highlights the need 
for higher education to respond in an age-appropriate manner to the educational needs of 
students. This provision underscores that persons with disabilities cannot be restricted in 
their progress with regard to their right to education on the basis of the medical diagnosis of 
an impairment. To reinforce this provision, the obligation to provide reasonable 
accommodation to guarantee this right is reiterated elsewhere in the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. National implementation 
</b></p>
<p>56. Inclusive education systems are the result of complex processes that need to be 
addressed systemically. A systemic transformation of the education system should include: 
(a) adopting an inclusive education law with a clear definition of inclusive education, 
including a &#8220;no-rejection&#8221; clause providing for non-discrimination, and reasonable 
accommodation; and (b) creating a transformation plan in order to generate the necessary 
conditions for inclusiveness to be realized. Barriers at the legal and policy levels must be 
addressed as a first step. The innovative character of the human rights-based approach to 
disability and the inclusive approach to education needs to be promoted as education 
systems invest in practices contributing to the development of inclusive education systems.  
</p>
<p>57. The process of drafting an inclusive education law can be enriching, especially when 
it is participatory. It is advisable to create partnerships between all relevant actors to 
formulate the design, and facilitate the implementation of, an inclusive education system. 
To ensure the participation of those who have little information on the human rights 
approach to education, capacity-building should be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>58. Centralization of education under the ministry of education is worthwhile. The 
transformation process to inclusive education needs central coordination to maximize </p>


<p>existing resources, adapt rules and procedures, and ensure that the role of relevant 
ministries is compliant with a rights-based approach, rather than charity or medical-based 
approaches. Centralization does not exclude local jurisdictions, as their involvement 
provides for better participation for those directly affected, as required in article 4, 
paragraph 3, of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>59. Some systems provide for differential budgets for mainstream schools and special 
schools. Merging budgets under one inclusive strategy is a useful tool to accompany the 
move towards an inclusive education system. Serious political will and authority is needed 
to overcome institutional resistance to such change.  
</p>
<p>60. The transformation of special schools into resource centres for inclusion is 
important. Some integration systems already have this measure enshrined in their 
legislation. In Chile, Norway and Spain, special education resources can support 
mainstream schools in the integration process. Georgia and Costa Rica have projects to 
provide integration services with a view to moving towards inclusion. It is desirable that 
resource centres are a part of an inclusive framework under the control of the ministry of 
education. 
</p>
<p>61. The best way to learn how to include is by including. Students with disabilities 
should be transferred into mainstream schools to enhance the understanding that inclusive 
education systems need, and should be a key part of, a transformation plan. Belgium and 
Georgia have progressively implemented transfer programmes into general education for 
students with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>62. Implementation requires both measurable goals with a human rights focus and 
adequate data collection processes. In order to measure progress on the full realization of 
the right to inclusive education, developing monitoring frameworks with structural, process 
and outcome indicators, and specific benchmarks and targets for each indicator is 
advisable.40 Structural indicators should measure barriers to inclusive education and not be 
limited merely to collecting data disaggregated by impairment.41 Process indicators allow 
for a better grasp of the progress of the transformation, including by measuring the number 
of teachers trained on inclusive instructional strategies, the number of accessible schools 
and the number of students with disabilities transferred from special schools to regular 
schools. Outcome indicators should also be established. These may include: the percentage 
of students with disabilities in mainstream schools that started basic education and obtained 
their final certification, and the percentage of students admitted to secondary education. 
The quality of education should also be measured in the light of the different elements 
mentioned in paragraph 28 above. It is furthermore advisable to measure affirmative 
measures, such as quotas or incentives. 
</p>
<p>63. Remedies and reparation in cases of violations are important components of the 
national implementation process. Relevant laws should include effective remedies or other 
adequate complaints procedures. The Flemish Parliament laws on primary and secondary 
education foresee mediation when admission in mainstream schools is denied, allowing for 
appeals if the mediation fails. Ultimately, sanctions could be applied. Belgian anti-
discrimination law includes criminal sanctions for intentional refusal of reasonable 
accommodation, which is mandatory in the area of education. A prerequisite for seeking a 
remedy or reparations constitutes the full implementation of article 13 of the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on access to justice. States that are not yet part of the

Geneva, 2012) 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>41
  Portugal, for example, has established inclusive structural indicators. </p>


<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention should consider ratifying it, to allow for the possibility 
of individual communications.  
</p>
<p>64. The monitoring and implementing system of article 33 of the Convention is a 
fundamental resource in advancing the agenda on inclusive education. National human 
rights institutions and mechanisms designated to monitor the Convention have collected 
data on the denial to mainstream education, produced studies and surveys on exclusions and 
barriers, promoted quality education and recommended legislative and policy reforms.42 
Civil society groups, including organizations of persons with disabilities, have been 
effective in influencing a move towards inclusive education.43 The role of civil society is 
crucial in implementation, including international monitoring, such as reporting the 
situation in China,44 promoting regulatory flexibility as in Buenos Aires,45 contributing to 
policy design as in Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic,46 campaigning for inclusion47 or 
sign-language teaching. 
</p>
<p><b> V. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities includes a stand-alone 
article on the role of international cooperation (art. 32) in realizing the rights of persons 
with disabilities.48 The contributions of States to the present report offer a number of 
examples where international cooperation has been effective in supporting the change to 
inclusive education systems. In Georgia, the first inclusive education project implemented 
by the Ministry of Education and Sciences was funded by the Norwegian Ministry of 
Education and Research. The Government of Denmark supported the introduction of new 
methods of teaching in some schools of Nepal, which allowed children with sensory and 
intellectual impairments to be integrated into mainstream education. In Cambodia, funds 
channelled through a national non-governmental organization supported the teaching of 
Braille and sign language in 150 public schools, the translation of the school curriculum 
into Braille and sign language, and provided financial support to Braille and sign-language 
teachers in mainstream schools. 
</p>
<p>66. Inclusive education is one of the areas of cooperation funded through the United 
Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In the Republic of 
Moldova, the aim is to support the Government&#8217;s 2011 national programme of inclusive 
education and the focus on improving access of persons with disabilities to mainstream 
education and targeted services. Steps have already been taken towards creating psycho-
pedagogical assistance services to support the inclusive education of children with 
disabilities, the training of relevant personnel (teachers, inspectors, local representatives) on

<p>67. The outcome document of the 2013 General Assembly&#8217;s High-level Meeting on 
Disability and Development (General Assembly resolution 68/3), which reaffirmed the 
international community&#8217;s commitment to advance the rights of all persons with disabilities 
and work together for a disability-inclusive development agenda, also embraced inclusive 
education as one of the priorities for the post-2015 agenda (para. 4 (d)). 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>68. <b>Inclusive education is essential to achieving universality of the right to 
education, including for persons with disabilities. Only inclusive education systems 
can provide both quality of education and social development for persons with 
disabilities. Inclusive education implies more than placing students with disabilities in 
mainstream schools; it means making them feel welcome, respected and valued. 
Inclusive education is built on values that enhance a person&#8217;s ability to achieve their 
goals and embrace diversity as an opportunity to learn. Students with disabilities need 
adequate support to participate on equal terms with others in the education system. 
Mainstream schools must provide for an environment that maximizes academic and 
social development. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Persons with disabilities face various forms of discrimination in educational 
settings. The most serious barriers to participation in schools arise from prejudice and 
misconceptions that lead to deliberate exclusion and segregation. Students with 
disabilities are stigmatized as people who cannot be educated in regular schools, or at 
all. This results in education systems in which persons with disabilities are denied the 
right to education as enshrined in article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Convention provides for two-pronged implementation of that right: firstly, 
non-discrimination in mainstream schools for students with disabilities, reinforcing 
this right with reasonable accommodation; secondly, a systemic change that requires 
progressive realization and a transformation plan to counter exclusion and 
segregation. Meaningful implementation is based upon a complex change process that 
requires a transformation of the existing legislative and policy framework and the full 
involvement of all relevant stakeholders, particularly persons with disabilities and 
their representative organizations.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Through inclusive education laws, States should establish an inclusive 
education system under the aegis of their respective ministries of education that 
prohibits rejection from mainstream schools on the basis of disability and provides for 
reasonable accommodation. A transformation plan should provide the framework for 
the implementation of an inclusive education system with measurable goals. States 
should put in place training programmes for teachers, create reasonable 
accommodation funds, provide for accessible materials, promote inclusive 
environments, improve testing methods, promote the transfer from special schools to 
mainstream schools, promote monitoring through indicators on inclusive education, 
provide adequate support to students, and use appropriate communication means and 
formats. Schools need to be properly funded, while at the same time availability of </b></p>


<p><b>resources should not be a basis for denying access to the right to education for a 
student with disability.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Integration has provided a wealth of good practices that could constitute a 
starting point for developing inclusive education systems. International cooperation 
has contributed to this process. The recognition of inclusive education systems as a 
priority in the High-level Meeting on Disability and Development can contribute to 
further strengthening the process through the adoption of an inclusive education goal 
with adequate targets and indicators for the post-2015 development agenda.
