APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 18 OF 2001
(Labasa Mag. Ct. Crim. Case No. 187 of 2001)

Between:

PENI RAVULOLO
Appellant

And

STATE
Respondent

Appellant in person
Mr. J. Rabuku for the State

JUDGMENT

The appellant was on his own plea convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months for the offence of toolroom breaking entering and larceny contrary to section 300 of the Penal Code Cap.17.

The appeal is against severity of sentence. He prays for the reduction of his sentence as he says it is harsh.

The State opposes the appeal stating that he has 5 previous convictions all being for kindred offence of larceny and that he has not learnt his lesson from sentences passed on him.

I agree with the learned State Counsel that the appeal is devoid of merits. The sentence is neither harsh nor excessive.

The appeal is dismissed.
