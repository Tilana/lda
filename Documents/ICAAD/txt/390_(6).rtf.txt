You waived right to legal counsel and pleaded guilty on your own free will. You admitted the statement of facts. You have submitted your mitigation which this Court has considered. 

The Maximum Penalty 

The Maximum Penalty for Obtaining Financial Advantage By Deception, contrary to Section 318 of the Crimes Decree is 10 years imprisonment. 

The Tariff

Previously under the Penal Code the maximum punishment for the offence of Obtaining Money by False Pretence was 5 years. Now the Crimes Decree 2009 has maximum punishment as 10 years imprisonment. In State v Atil Sharma Criminal Case No. HAC 122 of 2010L, Justice Madigan has set the tariff for obtaining Financial Advantage by Deception as between 2 years to 5 years. 

Justice Madigan further stated and this Court notes: "...The tariff for obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception should now be between 2 years and 5 years with 2 years being reserved for minor offences with little and spontaneous deception . The top end of the range will obviously be reserved for fraud of the most serious kind where a premeditated and well planned cynical operation is put in place."

Starting Point

In view of the above-mentioned observations and the relevant provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. This Court takes 2 years (24 months) as an appropriate starting point (for each Count) for the offence that you have committed. 

Guilty Plea

For your guilty plea this Court will give you 8 months discount. You have saved everyone's time with an early guilty plea. You are now to serve 16 months) imprisonment. 

Mitigation

For your total mitigation this Court gives you a further 6 months discount. 

Gloriyah Tehillah your sentence for Obtaining Financial Advantage By Deception, contrary to Section 318 of the Crimes Decree is 10 months imprisonment.

This Court has carefully considered the issue of suspending your sentence. In considering it this Court has noted the comments of Justice Shameem in State v Raymond Roberts ( HAA0053 of 2003S), where Shameem J held that " the principles that emerge from these cases are that a custodial sentence is inevitable where the accused pleaded not guilty and makes no attempt at genuine restitution. Where there is a plea of guilty, a custodial sentence may still be inevitable where there is a bad breach of trust, the money stolen is high in value and the accused shows no remorse or attempt at reparation". 

Gloriyah Tehillah having noted the law on suspended sentences this Court notes that you are not a young person, however you are a 1st Offender. Full restitution has not been made. The total sum involved is $7005.04. This Court notes that you have spent about 3 weeks in custody. Having taken consideration of the fact that you have 7 chidlren ranging from 13 years to 5 months, this Court will partially suspend your sentence. The message must go out to the members of our community and people who think like you, that anyone who is deceitful and obtains financial advantage by deception will not get any mercy from the Court and get immediate custodial sentence.

Gloriyah Tehillah your sentence for each count of Obtaining Financial Advantage By Deception, contrary to Section 318 of the Crimes Decree is 4 months imprisonment. The balance period of 6 months is suspended for 18 months (meaning of suspended term explained to accused). For each count you will serve 4 months concurrently and balance term will be suspended concurrently as well. 

4 month for each count (concurrent)

Balance 6 months suspended for 18 months (concurrent). 

Right of Appeal

You have 28 days to appeal to the High Court.
