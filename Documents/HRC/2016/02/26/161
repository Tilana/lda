<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background and mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. Ensuring access to effective remedy for those affected by business-related human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses is one of the three pillars of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (A/HRC/17/31, annex), which were endorsed by the Human Rights Council in June 
</p>
<p>2011. The right to a remedy for victims of human rights abuses is a core tenet of the 
</p>
<p>international human rights system. In the Guiding Principles, it is recognized that ensuring 
</p>
<p>access to effective remedy is part of the duty of all States to prevent human rights abuses 
</p>
<p>from being committed within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including 
</p>
<p>business enterprises. Guiding Principle 26 provides that States should take appropriate steps 
</p>
<p>to ensure the effectiveness of domestic judicial mechanisms when addressing business-
</p>
<p>related human rights abuses, including considering ways to reduce legal, practical and other 
</p>
<p>relevant barriers that could lead to a denial of access to remedy.  
</p>
<p>2. In the commentary to Guiding Principle 26, the challenges faced by individuals 
</p>
<p>seeking remedies in cases of business-related human rights abuses are highlighted. 
</p>
<p>Extensive research by civil society organizations and others into the accessibility and utility 
</p>
<p>of judicial mechanisms as a means of obtaining remedy in cases of business-related human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses have confirmed that those adversely affected by such abuses frequently 
</p>
<p>struggle to access effective remedies. Particular problems have been noticed in cases that 
</p>
<p>may amount to gross human rights abuses and international crimes, in which the combined 
</p>
<p>effect of factors such as a lack of adequately functioning domestic judicial mechanisms, a 
</p>
<p>lack of clarity about the relevant legal standards and fears of reprisals against victims and 
</p>
<p>witnesses will often prevent victims from obtaining any redress at all. 
</p>
<p>3. In 2013, as part of its core mandate to advance the protection and promotion of 
</p>
<p>human rights globally and of its ongoing work to advance the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR) commissioned an initial study into the effectiveness of domestic judicial 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in cases of alleged business involvement in gross human rights abuses.1 
</p>
<p>Reviewing empirical evidence from 11 different jurisdictions and around 40 legal cases, the 
</p>
<p>study concluded that the present system of domestic law remedies for these kinds of cases 
</p>
<p>is &#8220;patchy, unpredictable, often ineffective and fragile&#8221;.2 It outlined a number of areas 
</p>
<p>where further clarification of policy and principle may help improve access to remedy for 
</p>
<p>victims, and also called for more attention to be paid to the reasons behind the apparently 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Jennifer Zerk, &#8220;Corporate liability for gross human rights abuses: towards a fairer and more effective 
</p>
<p>system of domestic law remedies&#8221;, study prepared for OHCHR in February 2014 
</p>
<p>(http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Pages/OHCHRstudyondomesticlawremedies.aspx). The 
</p>
<p>author notes that, in its <i>Interpretive Guide to the Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights</i>, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR writes that there is no uniform definition of gross human rights abuses in international law 
</p>
<p>and she does not seek to establish her own definition. However, also according to the <i>Interpretive 
</i></p>
<p><i>Guide</i>, the following practices would generally be included: genocide, slavery and slavery-like 
</p>
<p>practices, summary or arbitrary executions, torture, enforced disappearances, arbitrary and prolonged 
</p>
<p>detention, and systematic discrimination. Other kinds of human rights violations, including violations 
</p>
<p>of economic, social and cultural rights, can also count as gross violations if they are grave and 
</p>
<p>systematic, for example if they take place on a large scale or are targeted at particular population 
</p>
<p>groups. The <i>Interpretive Guide</i> is available from  
</p>
<p>  www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/HR.PUB.12.2_En.pdf.  
</p>

<p>very low number of business enterprises prosecuted in national courts for involvement in 
</p>
<p>gross human rights abuses. After the study was published in February 2014, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>invited all stakeholders to respond to the key findings.3 This public consultation process 
</p>
<p>took place in the first half of 2014. On the basis of the study&#8217;s findings and the submissions 
</p>
<p>received from stakeholders, OHCHR drew up plans for further work that underwent a 
</p>
<p>process of expert review in September 2014. The OHCHR expert review group comprised 
</p>
<p>representatives of States, United Nations agencies, business organizations, trade union 
</p>
<p>representatives, law firms, barristers&#8217; chambers, academic institutions and civil society 
</p>
<p>groups. 
</p>
<p>4. Recognizing the need for greater international focus on the issue of access to remedy 
</p>
<p>and for additional guidance on the implementation of the pillar on access to remedy of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles, the Human Rights Council, in paragraph 7 of its resolution 26/22, 
</p>
<p>requested the High Commissioner to continue work to facilitate the sharing and exploration 
</p>
<p>of the full range of legal options and practical measures to improve access to remedy for 
</p>
<p>victims of business-related human rights abuses, in collaboration with the Working Group 
</p>
<p>on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, 
</p>
<p>to organize consultations with experts, States and other relevant stakeholders to facilitate 
</p>
<p>mutual understanding and greater consensus among different views. The Council also 
</p>
<p>requested the High Commissioner to publish a progress report on that work before its 
</p>
<p>twenty-ninth session and to present a final report for consideration at its thirty-second 
</p>
<p>session. 
</p>
<p>5. In November 2014, in response to the issues identified in the initial study and in 
</p>
<p>subsequent submissions and expert meetings, and pursuant to the mandate from the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, OHCHR launched the accountability and remedy project to contribute to 
</p>
<p>making domestic legal responses fairer and more effective for victims of business-related 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses, particularly in cases of severe abuses. In accordance with Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 26/22, OHCHR will submit a report on the outcomes and findings of the project 
</p>
<p>at the Council&#8217;s thirty-second session. The present report provides an overview of the 
</p>
<p>project, its scope and methodology, progress to date and key findings emerging from 
</p>
<p>various preparatory research activities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Aims and scope 
</b></p>
<p>6. The overall aim of the accountability and remedy project is to develop 
</p>
<p>recommendations and guidance for States on how to achieve a fairer and more effective 
</p>
<p>system of domestic law remedies in cases of business-related human rights abuses, 
</p>
<p>particularly in cases of severe abuses.  
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR understands a &#8220;fairer and more effective system of domestic law remedies&#8221; 
</p>
<p>to be one in which all victims, without discrimination, have access to an effective remedy 
</p>
<p>and no one is denied access to justice because of his or her location; in which victims are 
</p>
<p>able to seek justice irrespective of their financial resources; that is based on clear standards 
</p>
<p>of corporate behaviour; and in which enforcement and sanctions ensure accountability and 
</p>
<p>contribute to preventing future harm. 
</p>
<p>8. To this end, the project has two key aims: 
</p>
<p>(a) To clarify standards and tests for corporate legal liability under domestic law; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>(b) To develop credible and workable recommendations and guidance for States 
</p>
<p>in relation to each of the six project components (see sect. II.A) to enable a stronger and 
</p>
<p>more consistent implementation of the Guiding Principles, particularly in so far as business 
</p>
<p>involvement in severe human rights abuses is concerned. 
</p>
<p>9. The decision to focus on cases of severe abuse in the first instance has been taken 
</p>
<p>for strategic, substantive and methodological reasons. First, this prioritization is justified by 
</p>
<p>the severity of impacts for victims. Second, as noted above, business involvement in gross 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses poses a particular set of challenges in respect of access to remedy. 
</p>
<p>Third, the steps already taken by many States to ensure that international crimes are 
</p>
<p>punishable at the domestic level make it likely that focusing on the severest forms of human 
</p>
<p>rights abuse will be the most useful and revealing starting point for close comparative 
</p>
<p>analysis. However, this in no way implies that severe business-related human rights abuses 
</p>
<p>should be the sole focus of States&#8217; regulatory action. On the contrary, mindful that the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles address the full range of business-related human rights impacts, and that 
</p>
<p>in many contexts it is impossible or undesirable to carve out specialist regimes for a 
</p>
<p>particular class of human rights abuses, OHCHR will be examining the outcomes of the 
</p>
<p>accountability and remedy project for lessons of relevance for access to remedy not only in 
</p>
<p>the severest cases. 
</p>
<p>10. The accountability and remedy project will focus on judicial mechanisms for gaining 
</p>
<p>access to remedy. This is not to diminish the importance of non-judicial mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>which, as noted in Guiding Principle 27, are part of a comprehensive State-based system for 
</p>
<p>the remedy of business-related human rights abuse. However, given the project&#8217;s focus on 
</p>
<p>the severest cases, which by their very nature may raise issues of possible criminal 
</p>
<p>behaviour, it is appropriate to focus on domestic mechanisms responsible for enforcing 
</p>
<p>criminal law. Data on the use of non-judicial mechanisms will be collected (see sect. II.B), 
</p>
<p>as OHCHR recognizes the role that such mechanisms can play in reducing the costs of 
</p>
<p>dispute resolution and in creating more opportunities for victims to access effective 
</p>
<p>remedies. In order for States to effectively hold businesses to account and to ensure access 
</p>
<p>to remedy in the severest cases, however, non-judicial mechanisms must be backed up by 
</p>
<p>effective judicial mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>11. Finally, although the project focuses on access to remedy issues, there is a need for 
</p>
<p>both States and businesses to make concerted and increased efforts to develop better 
</p>
<p>preventive practices and policies with respect to business-related human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>While the development of preventive practices and policies are beyond the scope of the 
</p>
<p>project, the methodology recognizes the relationships that can exist between the preventive 
</p>
<p>efforts of a business enterprise and its legal risks and culpability. As part of the project, 
</p>
<p>input will be gathered from many different jurisdictions on issues such as the bearing that 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence may have on legal liability and sanctioning, in order to better 
</p>
<p>explore the linkages that exist between prevention and legal liability. This will be done to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the practical recommendations arising from the project address, to the extent 
</p>
<p>possible, the need for prevention as well as remedy.  
</p>
<p>12. The mandate of the accountability and remedy project is separate from, but 
</p>
<p>potentially complementary to, the decision made by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 26/9 to establish an open-ended intergovernmental working group on human 
</p>
<p>rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises to elaborate an 
</p>
<p>international legally binding instrument. The project is not linked to the negotiations on that 
</p>
<p>instrument. However, if the intergovernmental working group so decides, it could draw 
</p>
<p>upon material emerging from the project in its discussions. </p>


<p><b> II. Accountability and remedy project  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview of project components 
</b></p>
<p>13. The accountability and remedy project comprises six distinct but interrelated 
</p>
<p>components. Each component has been chosen based on issues identified in research and 
</p>
<p>consultations as requiring further clarification in terms of policy and principles. The 
</p>
<p>components have also been selected for their strategic value and the potential they have to 
</p>
<p>result in outcomes that can make a practical difference for affected stakeholders in the 
</p>
<p>short-to-medium term. Each component is distinct and has its own methodology, but is 
</p>
<p>linked in important ways to the others. In all cases, the methodology is based on inclusive 
</p>
<p>multi-stakeholder and expert inputs and consultations. The six project components are the 
</p>
<p>following: 
</p>
<p>(a) Project component 1, on domestic law tests for corporate accountability. This 
</p>
<p>component will clarify how different domestic legal systems attribute and assess corporate 
</p>
<p>legal liability for serious human rights abuses. It will identify good practices to guide States 
</p>
<p>in deciding which factors need to be taken into account in assessing corporate liability in 
</p>
<p>cases of alleged involvement in serious human rights abuses. Information will be gathered 
</p>
<p>primarily through the global online consultation and the detailed comparative process 
</p>
<p>described below (see sect. II.B); 
</p>
<p>(b) Project component 2, on the roles and responsibilities of interested States. 
</p>
<p>This component will explore State practices and attitudes with respect to the appropriate 
</p>
<p>use of extraterritorial jurisdiction and domestic measures with extraterritorial implications. 
</p>
<p>It will identify good practices to guide States in managing cross-border cases and explore 
</p>
<p>possible models of international and bilateral cooperation. Analyses will primarily take 
</p>
<p>place through face-to-face work with government representatives, which will be 
</p>
<p>complemented by multi-stakeholder consultations and discussions. Preparatory studies of 
</p>
<p>State practice have been carried out in relation to labour rights issues and current State 
</p>
<p>practices and attitudes with respect to the use of extraterritorial jurisdiction, examples of 
</p>
<p>which are provided through amicus curiae briefs by sovereign States in cases involving the 
</p>
<p>alien tort statute in the courts of the United States of America. The findings of these 
</p>
<p>preparatory studies will be used to inform future work and discussions (see sects. III.B-C); 
</p>
<p>(c) Project component 3, on overcoming financial obstacles to legal claims. This 
</p>
<p>component will look at strategies and practices to assist claimants who would otherwise be 
</p>
<p>prevented from accessing judicial mechanisms owing to legal costs, and result in guidance 
</p>
<p>on &#8220;minimum steps&#8221; and &#8220;good-practice options&#8221; for States. Information will be gathered 
</p>
<p>primarily through the global online consultation and the detailed comparative process 
</p>
<p>described below (see sect. II.B). To complement these processes, OHCHR has also 
</p>
<p>conducted a review of recent comparative research in relation to the costs of bringing legal 
</p>
<p>claims under private law (see sect. III);  
</p>
<p>(d) Project component 4, on criminal sanctions. This component will survey 
</p>
<p>current and emerging State practice in relation to criminal sanctioning of corporations for 
</p>
<p>serious human rights abuses and identify &#8220;good-practice models&#8221; for States, taking into 
</p>
<p>account innovations from other areas of criminal law. Information will be gathered 
</p>
<p>primarily  through the global online consultation and the detailed comparative process 
</p>
<p>described below (see sect. II.B); 
</p>
<p>(e) Project component 5, on civil law remedies. This component will survey 
</p>
<p>current and emerging State practice in relation to civil law (private law) damages in cases 
</p>
<p>of serious corporate human rights harm, explore the role of domestic judicial mechanisms 
</p>
<p>in relation to the supervision and implementation of settlements and awards, and identify </p>


<p>possible &#8220;good-practice models&#8221; for States, taking into account innovations from other 
</p>
<p>areas of private law. Information will be gathered primarily  through the global online 
</p>
<p>consultation and the detailed comparative process described below (see sect. II.B); 
</p>
<p>(f) Project component 6, on practices and policies of domestic prosecution 
</p>
<p>bodies. This component aims to investigate the reasons behind the apparently very low 
</p>
<p>levels of activity by domestic criminal law enforcement agencies in relation to alleged 
</p>
<p>business involvement in gross human rights abuses. It will seek to identify challenges faced 
</p>
<p>by domestic prosecutors in such cases and to develop a set of recommendations for States 
</p>
<p>on ways to begin addressing those challenges. Information will be gathered and analysis 
</p>
<p>will be conducted primarily through face-to-face work with prosecutors and other experts 
</p>
<p>from law enforcement, regulatory bodies and academic institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Global online consultation and detailed comparative process 
</b></p>
<p>14. The accountability and remedy project research process has been designed to make 
</p>
<p>sure that any recommended action is well-directed and capable of improving access to 
</p>
<p>justice for victims at a practical level. Whether legal, practical or technological 
</p>
<p>interventions are called for, they must be capable of responding to local needs, structures 
</p>
<p>and contexts. Local knowledge and insight is needed to ensure that proposals are capable 
</p>
<p>both of being implemented and of producing the desired results. This requires engagement 
</p>
<p>with experts in a wide range of jurisdictions,  across different geographical areas, legal 
</p>
<p>systems and traditions and stages of economic development. 
</p>
<p>15. To maximize the time and resources available, information for four of the six 
</p>
<p>projects is being gathered through two complementary research processes: the global online 
</p>
<p>consultation, which consists of a global online survey; and the detailed comparative 
</p>
<p>process, which consists of a focused, in-depth research process into 25 focus jurisdictions.  
</p>
<p>16. The information from both processes will be reviewed and analysed by independent 
</p>
<p>expert academic reviewers who have agreed to contribute their time and expertise to the 
</p>
<p>project. The methodology aims to include a wide range of stakeholders in the research and 
</p>
<p>information-gathering process and to subject all findings to thorough multi-stakeholder 
</p>
<p>consultations. Both processes will continue until August 2015, at which point OHCHR will 
</p>
<p>begin project-specific analysis in collaboration with stakeholders and academic experts.  
</p>
<p>17. At the time of submitting the present report, the global online consultation was being 
</p>
<p>prepared for launch at the end of April 2015. The consultation consists of a global online 
</p>
<p>survey in English, French and Spanish through which all stakeholders with relevant 
</p>
<p>knowledge of a jurisdiction may submit information. The survey covers tests for assessing 
</p>
<p>corporate legal liability under criminal, quasi-criminal and civil law; funding options for 
</p>
<p>legal claims; criminal and quasi-criminal law sanctions; civil law remedies; and issues 
</p>
<p>related to the work of domestic prosecution bodies in bringing cases against business 
</p>
<p>enterprises. The consultation will remain open until 1 August 2015.  
</p>
<p>18. OHCHR encourages all relevant stakeholders, in particular States, to contribute to 
</p>
<p>the project by submitting information through the global online consultation. Gathering 
</p>
<p>information on a wide range of jurisdictions is critical to helping to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>recommendations for each project take into account the realities on the ground. The global 
</p>
<p>online consultation seeks to ensure that data is collected from the widest possible range of 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions, with the aim of ensuring that the eventual outputs and findings take account of 
</p>
<p>a broad range of legal traditions and systems, respond to the actual situations encountered 
</p>
<p>in different States and are fit-for-purpose for all States. It is also an opportunity for all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to provide comments about opportunities and challenges and information 
</p>
<p>about relevant cases and situations they have encountered.  </p>


<p>19. The detailed comparative process is a focused, in-depth research process comprising 
</p>
<p>legal research done by legal experts in relation to 25 focus jurisdictions, the results of 
</p>
<p>which will be used for comparative analysis. The 25 jurisdictions have been carefully 
</p>
<p>chosen to reflect geographical and regional diversity, as well as a diversity of legal systems 
</p>
<p>and traditions and levels of economic development. The process comprises two tracks, the 
</p>
<p>first of which focuses on legal research into the current laws in the focus jurisdictions and 
</p>
<p>the second of which focuses on gathering practical experiences and perspectives from 
</p>
<p>public interest lawyers and others who represent victims of business-related human rights 
</p>
<p>abuses before the courts.  
</p>
<p>20. At the time of submitting the present report, the detailed comparative process had 
</p>
<p>commenced for most of the selected focus jurisdictions. After reports on the results arising 
</p>
<p>from the two tracks have been submitted, OHCHR will work with academics to review the 
</p>
<p>information received and help contextualize it with reference to the overall legal system and 
</p>
<p>broader social and economic issues of each focus jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Future consultations and next steps 
</b></p>
<p>21. Subject to obtaining sufficient resources, OHCHR plans to hold expert meetings and 
</p>
<p>consultations for each of the six projects starting in September 2015 and to be completed by 
</p>
<p>the first quarter of 2016. In collaboration with the Working Group on the issue of human 
</p>
<p>rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, initial findings and 
</p>
<p>analysis from the projects under the accountability and remedy project will be presented at 
</p>
<p>the Forum on Business and Human Rights to be held in Geneva from 16 to 18 November 
</p>
<p>2015, to enable multi-stakeholder discussion in a public format.  
</p>
<p>22. Initial findings and areas for further inquiry arising from the activities undertaken to 
</p>
<p>date are outlined in section III below. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Preliminary research: key outputs and issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Preparatory work relating to project component 2: roles and 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities of interested States 
</b></p>
<p>23. As noted above, project component 2 of the accountability and remedy project will 
</p>
<p>explore State practice and attitudes with respect to the appropriate use of extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction and domestic measures with extraterritorial implications. It will identify good 
</p>
<p>practices to guide States in managing cross-border cases and explore possible models of 
</p>
<p>international and bilateral cooperation.  
</p>
<p>24. Not all cases involving allegations of business-related human rights abuses raise 
</p>
<p>cross-border issues. In cases where those involved are all located in and the relevant facts 
</p>
<p>have all taken place in a single jurisdiction, questions of extraterritorial jurisdiction and 
</p>
<p>international cooperation may not arise. However, cases of business involvement in serious 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses do frequently involve a cross-border element. In many cases, this is 
</p>
<p>because those involved are located in more than one jurisdiction or because other 
</p>
<p>connecting factors to a prosecution or dispute (such as material actions or decisions) are 
</p>
<p>alleged to have occurred or been made in different jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p>25. Cross-border cases give rise to a particular set of difficulties for domestic law 
</p>
<p>enforcement bodies, prosecutors and victims. Extensive research by civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and others has documented the many challenges involved in accessing 
</p>
<p>judicial remedy in these kinds of cases. These comprise legal challenges (such as </p>


<p>establishing personal and subject-matter jurisdiction, identifying the correct set of legal 
</p>
<p>rules to apply to the case and problems relating to enforcement) and many practical and 
</p>
<p>logistical issues associated with gathering information and the availability of witnesses. 
</p>
<p>26. The current debate about the appropriate use of extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect 
</p>
<p>of cases of business-related human rights abuses takes place against this background. A key 
</p>
<p>aim of project component 2 will be to find ways to build on existing State practice, 
</p>
<p>including from other regulatory areas, to propose practical solutions to challenges that are 
</p>
<p>frequently encountered in cross-border cases. 
</p>
<p>27. Project component 2 takes, as its starting point, Guiding Principle 2, which calls 
</p>
<p>upon States to set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their 
</p>
<p>territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations. In the 
</p>
<p>commentary to the Principle, it is noted that States have adopted a range of approaches in 
</p>
<p>this regard, including the establishment of criminal regimes that allow for prosecutions 
</p>
<p>based on the nationality of the perpetrator no matter where the offence occurs. It is also 
</p>
<p>noted that various factors may contribute to the perceived and actual reasonableness of 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; actions, for example whether they are grounded in multilateral agreement. A 
</p>
<p>number of the treaty bodies that monitor the implementation of the core international 
</p>
<p>human rights treaties have also taken the view that the responsibilities of State parties under 
</p>
<p>the conventions include taking appropriate steps to ensure that the actions of enterprises 
</p>
<p>domiciled in their territory or jurisdiction do not infringe on human rights in other 
</p>
<p>countries.4 
</p>
<p>28. Further important context for project component 2 is provided by Guiding Principle 
</p>
<p>7, which states that because the risk of gross human rights abuses is heightened in conflict-
</p>
<p>affected areas, States should help ensure that business enterprises operating in those 
</p>
<p>contexts are not involved with such abuses, including by ensuring that their current policies, 
</p>
<p>legislation, regulations and enforcement measures are effective in addressing the risk of 
</p>
<p>business involvement in gross human rights abuses. Furthermore, Guiding Principle 26 
</p>
<p>stipulates that States should consider ways to reduce legal, practical and other relevant 
</p>
<p>barriers that could lead to a denial of remedy. In the commentary to Principle 26, it is noted 
</p>
<p>that legal barriers can arise, for example, , where claimants face a denial of justice in a host 
</p>
<p>State and cannot access to the home State courts regardless of the merits of the claim.  
</p>
<p>29. Previous research into State practice in other regulatory areas has helped to shed 
</p>
<p>light on the use by States of extraterritorial jurisdiction and domestic measures with 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial implications in practice.5 In recent years, States have been increasingly 
</p>
<p>prepared to use direct extraterritorial jurisdiction in relation to criminal activity such as 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 15 and the 
</p>
<p>Committee&#8217;s statement on the obligations of States parties regarding the corporate sector and 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights (E/C.12/2011/1) and the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 16. A number of treaty bodies have recommended that States take appropriate 
</p>
<p>measures to regulate the extraterritorial conduct of enterprises domiciled in their territory or 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction (see, for example, CERD/C/AUS/CO/15-17, para. 13; CRC/C/AZE/CO/3-4, para. 29; 
</p>
<p>CRC/C/BHR/CO/2-3, para. 21; CRC/C/ITA/CO/3-4, para. 25; and CRC/C/KOR/CO/3-4, para. 27). A 
</p>
<p>number of human rights advocates and experts have also endorsed the Maastricht Principles on 
Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including 
</p>
<p>in the context of non-State actors. While these principles have not been endorsed or adopted by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system, they provide information about the views of many human rights experts on 
</p>
<p>the issue of extraterritorial responsibilities under human rights treaties.

<p>terrorism, money-laundering, corruption, grave human rights abuses and sexual offences 
</p>
<p>against children. Looking at these different areas, certain patterns can be identified in 
</p>
<p>relation to the uses of and reactions to extraterritorial jurisdiction and domestic measures 
</p>
<p>with extraterritorial implications. For instance, these measures are more likely to be viewed 
</p>
<p>by affected States as reasonable if the regulation is authorized under a bilateral or 
</p>
<p>multilateral regime, is designed to deal with an issue of international concern (rather than 
</p>
<p>primarily domestic interests), has been developed in consultation with and takes account of 
</p>
<p>the interests of other States and includes procedures for the resolution of competing 
</p>
<p>jurisdictional claims. 
</p>
<p>30. This research has also highlighted the various options that may be open to States to 
</p>
<p>help overcome the practical problems that are commonly encountered in cross-border cases. 
</p>
<p>In relation to bribery and corruption, for instance, law enforcement bodies of different 
</p>
<p>States have carried out joint investigations and have entered into case-specific agreements 
</p>
<p>as to appropriate enforcement strategies and the sharing of financial penalties. 
</p>
<p>31. Following up on the recommendations emerging from the initial study 
</p>
<p>commissioned by OHCHR in 2013 into the effectiveness of domestic judicial mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>project component 2 will consider the extent to which models of international cooperation 
</p>
<p>and lessons on the use of extraterritorial jurisdiction from other regulatory areas can be 
</p>
<p>applied to help overcome challenges in relation to cross-border cases concerning severe 
</p>
<p>business-related human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>32. At the time of submitting the present report, two separate preliminary studies for 
</p>
<p>project component 2 had been completed. While they dealt with very different subject 
</p>
<p>matters, they had a common underlying aim, namely to gather empirical evidence with the 
</p>
<p>potential to shed light on State practice and attitudes with respect to the appropriate use of 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial jurisdiction and domestic measures with extraterritorial implications. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Review of State interventions in respect of assertions of extraterritorial 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdiction by United States courts in alien tort statute cases 
</b></p>
<p>33. The alien tort statute (United States Code, Title 28, sect. 1350) grants jurisdiction to 
</p>
<p>United States federal district courts in respect of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, 
</p>
<p>committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States. In recent 
</p>
<p>decades, plaintiffs have sought to use the statute to bring claims in United States courts for 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights committed overseas, including in cases alleging abuses by 
</p>
<p>business enterprises domiciled outside the United States. While the number of successful 
</p>
<p>cases is small, victims and their representatives have seen the statute as an important means 
</p>
<p>for redress where claimants are not able to obtain remedy through the courts of the State in 
</p>
<p>which the alleged abuse occurred. By their nature, these cases invoke questions about the 
</p>
<p>appropriate assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction. In a number of cases involving the 
</p>
<p>statute, States and State agencies have intervened in the litigation by way of letter, 
</p>
<p>declaration or (most commonly) amicus curiae briefs expressing views about the 
</p>
<p>appropriate limits of jurisdiction in the particular case or, more generally, as a matter of 
</p>
<p>policy. The aim of this study was to review as many of these State interventions as possible 
</p>
<p>and to consider what they might reveal about past and current State practices and views 
</p>
<p>with respect to the use of extraterritorial jurisdiction in cases involving allegations of 
</p>
<p>business involvement in serious human rights abuses. In particular: 
</p>
<p>(a) What are the main arguments used for and against the use of extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction in human rights cases? 
</p>
<p>(b) How do these arguments differ from arguments for and against 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial jurisdiction in other regulatory areas? </p>


<p>(c) To what extent is there already consensus between States as to the 
</p>
<p>circumstances in which the use of extraterritorial jurisdiction should be prohibited, tolerated 
</p>
<p>or encouraged in human rights cases and the limits that should be observed? 
</p>
<p>(d) What do States view as the best safeguards against &#8220;excessive&#8221; claims of 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial jurisdiction and how can jurisdictional conflicts best be resolved? 
</p>
<p>34. The review was carried out in April 2015. Information contained in legal databases 
</p>
<p>revealed that State interventions in relation to jurisdictional issues, numbering around 30, 
</p>
<p>had been made in at least 10 separate legal cases. These briefs and submissions (originating 
</p>
<p>in 12 different jurisdictions) were then reviewed; arguments for and against extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction and case-specific comments and concerns were also noted. It is recognized that 
</p>
<p>these amicus curiae briefs and other interventions were filed and made in a legal context 
</p>
<p>that predates the landmark 2013 decision of the United States Supreme Court in <i>Kiobel v. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Royal Dutch Petroleum</i>. However, this does not diminish the significance of these 
</p>
<p>documents as evidence of past and current State practice and attitudes with respect to the 
</p>
<p>use of extraterritorial jurisdiction in civil cases raising allegations of business involvement 
</p>
<p>in serious human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p>35. Only a small number of States have made interventions in cases involving the alien 
</p>
<p>tort statute on jurisdictional matters. Of these, the United States is the State that has 
</p>
<p>intervened most frequently by far, followed by States that have been States of domicile for 
</p>
<p>defendant companies in specific cases. Only a tiny number of States have ever sought to 
</p>
<p>intervene in cases involving the alien tort statute concerning activities and alleged abuses 
</p>
<p>taking place in their own territories. This means that it is impossible to draw definite 
</p>
<p>conclusions about the extent to which there may be a consensus about the use of 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights cases from this data alone. It should also be 
</p>
<p>recognized these briefs cover several decades, and that views and attitudes within a State 
</p>
<p>may have shifted, especially where administrations have changed. However, the study 
</p>
<p>findings do help to shed light on the kinds of case scenarios in relation to which 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial jurisdiction has been opposed, the degrees of opposition which have existed 
</p>
<p>in different kinds of cases and the case scenarios in which exercises of extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>subject-matter jurisdiction were more likely to have been accepted.  
</p>
<p>36. Based on the State amicus briefs and other interventions reviewed in the course of 
</p>
<p>this study, the figure below is an attempt to plot where various kinds of cases may sit on a 
</p>
<p>spectrum of possible State attitudes to exercises of extraterritorial subject-matter 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction in cases of allegations of corporate involvement in serious human rights abuses, 
</p>
<p>from &#8220;prohibited&#8221; at one extreme to &#8220;required&#8221; at the other. The study did not uncover any 
</p>
<p>evidence of State practice to suggest that there may be business-related human rights cases 
</p>
<p>in relation to which the exercise of extraterritorial subject-matter jurisdiction is required as 
</p>
<p>a matter of customary international law, or even encouraged as a matter of policy. 
</p>
<p>However, there are a number of other possible scenarios that fall elsewhere on the 
</p>
<p>spectrum, between &#8220;prohibited&#8221; and &#8220;tolerated&#8221;. </p>


<p><b>  Illustration of the possible spectrum of State attitudes to exercises of extraterritorial 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdiction in different scenarios, as indicated by the content

<p><b>of State interventions in alien tort statute cases 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Note</i>: The figure has been prepared for discussion purposes only. It is based on the indications 
</p>
<p>provided by the content of State interventions in alien tort statute cases, which, as acknowledged 
</p>
<p>above, have been made only by a small number of interested States. It does not represent, and should 
</p>
<p>not be taken as representing, the views of OHCHR as to the legality or desirability (or otherwise) of 
</p>
<p>exercises of extraterritorial jurisdiction in different scenarios, or of the criteria that should be applied 
</p>
<p>to determine legality. In the figure above the term &#8220;F-cubed&#8221; is used for cases where the claim is 
</p>
<p>brought by foreign plaintiffs, against foreign defendants, in relation to foreign business activities.  
</p>
<p>37. In addition, the review of amicus curiae briefs highlights several areas of uncertainty 
</p>
<p>and possible differences of approach between States in relation to key issues such as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;universal civil jurisdiction&#8221;, the applicability of a doctrine of &#8220;exhaustion of legal 
</p>
<p>remedies&#8221;, the extent to which a factual nexus is required between the claim and the State 
</p>
<p>in which the dispute is litigated (i.e. the &#8220;forum State&#8221;) for the courts of the forum State to 
</p>
<p>be able to exercise jurisdiction at all and, finally, the extent to which the nature and severity 
</p>
<p>of the abuse may have a bearing on the way that jurisdictional rules are applied. The 
</p>
<p>questions arising from this study in relation to these specific issues, as well as the broad 
</p>
<p>study findings, will be explored more fully in the interactive sessions with government 
</p>
<p>representatives due to take place later in 2015 (subject to OHCHR obtaining sufficient 
</p>
<p>funds), as part of the planned programme of work under project component 2. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Survey of key provisions and State practice under selected 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Labour Organization instruments  
</b></p>
<p>38. As part of its preparatory work for project component 2, OHCHR identified a need 
</p>
<p>to better understand the extent to which States already cooperate with respect to business-
</p>
<p>related human rights abuses, and the different forms this cooperation may take. To this end, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR conducted a review of the terms of and State practice pursuant to selected </p>


<p>International Labour Organization (ILO) treaties and protocols, aimed at combating two 
</p>
<p>specific areas of business-related human rights abuses, namely forced labour and the worst 
</p>
<p>forms of child labour.<footnote name="6">The full study is available from 
 
 www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Pages/OHCHRstudyondomesticlawremedies.aspx. </footnote> The aims of the study were: 
</p>
<p>(a) To examine the approach of certain ILO treaties to cross-border issues and 
</p>
<p>problems, in particular the extent to which States parties are required to regulate foreign 
</p>
<p>parties and conduct and cooperate in respect of the identification, investigation and 
</p>
<p>enforcement of offences; 
</p>
<p>(b) To clarify the geographical scope of treaty provisions relating to access to 
</p>
<p>remedy;  
</p>
<p>(c) To gather information relating to State practice under these treaty provisions 
</p>
<p>in order to gain an insight into how States parties are interpreting their treaty obligations 
</p>
<p>with respect to regulation, enforcement and access to remedy in practice. 
</p>
<p>39. OHCHR carried out the project in February and March 2015 as a desk review, with 
</p>
<p>inputs from ILO. The review of international instruments focused on key treaties and ILO 
</p>
<p>recommendations relating to forced labour and the worst forms of child labour. In addition, 
</p>
<p>given that migrant workers and members of indigenous communities are at particular risk 
</p>
<p>of such abuses, the review also covered ILO treaties relating to these groups. To gain a 
</p>
<p>better understanding of State practice in relation to the two focus areas, the review was 
</p>
<p>followed by an analysis of the most recent comments of ILO treaty monitoring bodies in 
</p>
<p>relation to a sample group of 35 jurisdictions (which included the 25 focus jurisdictions 
</p>
<p>selected for the purposes of the detailed comparative process). 
</p>
<p>40. The results of the preliminary study suggest that, even where States parties are 
</p>
<p>strongly encouraged to consider the use of extraterritorial jurisdiction to combat serious 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses by its own nationals, this is a regulatory method that is resorted to 
</p>
<p>rarely in practice and then only in relation to a narrow range of offences. The measures 
</p>
<p>implemented by States parties with respect to business enterprises seem to focus almost 
</p>
<p>entirely on cases affecting human rights within the national territory. No examples of 
</p>
<p>measures aimed specifically at addressing extraterritorial impacts of business enterprises 
</p>
<p>were identified in the course of the study, although examples of &#8220;domestic measures with 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial implications&#8221;, such as public information campaigns that are delivered 
</p>
<p>through foreign diplomatic missions and the close monitoring of recruitment organizations, 
</p>
<p>were identified. In addition, the study identified many and varied examples of international 
</p>
<p>and regional cooperation initiatives. These included information-gathering and information-
</p>
<p>sharing initiatives to aid the detection of crimes, technical assistance, capacity-building and 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising projects, bilateral and regional agreements covering operational matters 
</p>
<p>and initiatives aimed at informing people of their rights and victims of abuse of where to 
</p>
<p>get help. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Preparatory work relating to project component 3: overcoming 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial obstacles to legal claims 
</b></p>
<p>41. Successive investigations into barriers to accessing remedy, including the initial 
</p>
<p>study commissioned by OHCHR in 2013, confirm that financial obstacles to legal claims 
</p>
<p>can be among the most difficult to overcome in practice. This is also recognized in the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles. In the commentary to Principle 26, it is noted that practical and 
</p>
<p>procedural barriers to accessing judicial remedy can arise where the costs of bringing 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>claims go beyond being an appropriate deterrent to unmeritorious cases and/or cannot be 
</p>
<p>reduced to reasonable levels through government support, &#8220;market-based&#8221; mechanisms 
</p>
<p>(such as litigation insurance and legal fee structures) or other means. 
</p>
<p>42. The initial study commissioned by OHCHR in 2013 highlighted many differences 
</p>
<p>between jurisdictions with respect to the extent to which States have taken steps to reduce 
</p>
<p>financial obstacles to legal claims and the availability and operation of various options to 
</p>
<p>reduce costs and financial risks in practice. These differences, (together with other factors 
</p>
<p>identified in the study), are contributing to a number of structural problems in the overall 
</p>
<p>domestic remedial system, including inequalities in levels of legal protection and, arguably, 
</p>
<p>distortions in patterns of use of judicial mechanisms which may have implications for legal 
</p>
<p>development and access to justice in the longer term. Because of the short-, medium- and 
</p>
<p>long-term strategic significance of legal funding issues, overcoming financial obstacles to 
</p>
<p>legal claims has emerged as a key theme for future work by OHCHR and, as such, will be 
</p>
<p>addressed through a dedicated work stream in the OHCHR accountability and remedy 
</p>
<p>project. Project component 3 will look at strategies and practices to assist claimants who 
</p>
<p>would otherwise be prevented from accessing judicial mechanisms owing to legal costs, 
</p>
<p>and result in guidance on &#8220;minimum steps&#8221; and &#8220;good-practice options&#8221; for States. 
</p>
<p>43. OHCHR has identified the need for further research to be carried out, not just in 
</p>
<p>respect of the efficacy of different regulatory options but also in respect of the packages of 
</p>
<p>options that, taken together, are most likely to produce optimal outcomes and the feasibility 
</p>
<p>of the options against the background of different legal structures and conditions and levels 
</p>
<p>of economic development. Detailed information (relating to matters such as the availability 
</p>
<p>of government support in business and human rights cases, other third-party funding 
</p>
<p>sources, pro bono help, conditional and contingency fee arrangements, cost shifting rules 
</p>
<p>and other methods and rules that have implications for the costs of litigation to individual 
</p>
<p>claimants) will be collected from as many different jurisdictions around the world as 
</p>
<p>possible through the global online consultation and, in respect of the 25 focus jurisdictions, 
</p>
<p>through the detailed comparative process. As part of these processes, stakeholders will be 
</p>
<p>asked for their views as to the efficacy of different measures and groups of measures, and 
</p>
<p>how these may be improved. This feedback will be taken into account in the development 
</p>
<p>of the practical guidance referred to above. 
</p>
<p>44. The research methodology used by OHCHR for project component 3 has been 
</p>
<p>informed by past and ongoing investigations into the costs of civil and criminal procedures 
</p>
<p>at the domestic level. Preparatory work for the component included a review of the data and 
</p>
<p>research findings compiled by researchers from the University of Oxford during 2009 
</p>
<p>following a study of the costs and funding of civil litigation in more than 30 jurisdictions 
</p>
<p>around the world.7 
</p>
<p>45. The Oxford study highlights a number of trends of relevance for future work on the 
</p>
<p>accountability and remedy project. These include the significant contraction in the 
</p>
<p>availability of legal aid that is taking place in many States, the growing interest in 
</p>
<p>contingency fees (including in States that have traditionally shown strong cultural 
</p>
<p>resistance to the idea of lawyers being paid a percentage of civil damages), developments in 
</p>
<p>litigation insurance markets and the arrival of third party litigation funders. Other insights 
</p>
<p>from the Oxford study have implications for the project more generally, including the 
</p>
<p>unintended consequences that can result from piecemeal regulatory reform and the need for 
</p>
<p>a proper understanding of the linkages between different access to justice measures that 
</p>
<p>affect their efficacy in practice. Finally, the Oxford study provides a reminder that issues 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 Christopher Hodges, Stefan Vogenauer and Magdalena Tulibacka, eds., <i>The Costs and Funding of 
</i></p>
<p><i>Civil Litigation: a Comparative Perspective</i> (Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2010). </p>


<p>relating to financial obstacles to legal claims cannot be divorced entirely from wider 
</p>
<p>questions about the structure and efficiency of civil redress systems. This is because there 
</p>
<p>are many aspects of civil procedure and legal principle, covered in other work streams of 
</p>
<p>the project (see sect. II.A),that will have implications for the legal costs and levels of 
</p>
<p>financial risk faced by claimants. 
</p>
<p>46. While this potentially raises many more issues than the accountability and remedy 
</p>
<p>project can realistically cover, OHCHR recognizes the importance of efficiency and cost-
</p>
<p>reduction measures as part of an overarching strategy to address financial obstacles to legal 
</p>
<p>claims. Therefore, OHCHR will be gathering information and feedback on domestic 
</p>
<p>initiatives to improve the efficiency and functioning of judicial mechanisms specifically in 
</p>
<p>the context of cases concerning business-related human rights abuses, in addition to 
</p>
<p>information relating to different funding options. The information sought includes 
</p>
<p>information about how judicial mechanisms are presently making use of, or considering 
</p>
<p>making use of, technological and other advances to streamline and simplify judicial 
</p>

<p><b> IV. Concluding observations  
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>In recognition of the need for a greater international focus on the issue of access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to remedy in cases of business-related human rights impacts, and in response to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council resolution 26/22, OHCHR has launched the accountability and 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedy project. The project aims to contribute to making domestic legal responses 
</b></p>
<p><b>fairer, more accessible and more effective for victims of business-related human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuses, particularly in cases of severe abuse. In accordance with its mandate from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council, OHCHR will present the conclusions and findings arising from the project in 
</b></p>
<p><b>a final report for consideration by the Council at its thirty-second session. The present 
</b></p>
<p><b>report contains an overview of the scope, aims and progress of the project.  
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>Much of the information for the accountability and remedy project will be 
</b></p>
<p><b>gathered through two overarching processes: a global online consultation, which takes 
</b></p>
<p><b>the form of a global online survey, and a detailed comparative process, which is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>more focused in-depth research process into 25 focus jurisdictions. The global online 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation will be open until 1 August 2015 and can be accessed through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>OHCHR website. OHCHR encourages all States to complete the survey in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>help ensure that the project findings will have the broadest possible research basis 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that the eventual findings and outputs are appropriate to a wide range of 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdictions. OHCHR also encourages all other relevant stakeholders, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers, academic researchers, trade union representatives, civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, stakeholders, businesses and business organizations and others to 
</b></p>
<p><b>complete the survey.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>An online information hub has been established for the accountability and 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedy project through a dedicated portal hosted by the Business and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resources Centre.</b>8<b> This website and the OHCHR website contain essential 
</b></p>
<p><b>information about the project that will be updated as progress is made. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The findings of the preparatory work carried out under project component 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>(see paras. 33-40) will be used to help inform preparations for, and give practical 
</b></p>
<p><b>context to, interactive workshop discussions on the cross-border regulatory and 
</b></p>

<p><b>enforcement issues and challenges posed by business involvement in gross human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights abuses. These discussions are scheduled to take place in the latter half of 2015, 
</b></p>
<p><b>subject to OHCHR obtaining sufficient funds. The aims of these workshops will be: 
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>To clarify the legal and practical problems that can arise in cross-border 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases; 
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> To understand the ways in which existing views of roles and 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities are likely to shape State responses; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> To draw from experience from other regulatory fields in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider ways that States can work together cooperatively to address the challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>that arise in cross-border cases; 
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> To test and give participants the opportunity to react to different possible 
</b></p>
<p><b>models of international cooperation;  
</b></p>
<p>(e)<b> To identify the possible elements of a principled basis for appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>action in relation to jurisdictional matters. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The preparatory work relating to project component 3 (see paras. 41-46) will 
</b></p>
<p><b>enable that part of the project to progress effectively and efficiently and in a way that 
</b></p>
<p><b>builds on previous academic study. As noted above, insights from the Oxford study 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been valuable in helping to shape the relevant parts of the detailed comparative 
</b></p>
<p><b>process and the global online consultation. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The accountability and remedy project comprises six distinct work streams (see 
</b></p>
<p><b>para. 13), each of which has been selected based on issues identified in previous 
</b></p>
<p><b>OHCHR research as requiring further clarification in terms of policy and principle, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and for its strategic value. Each project is distinct and has its own methodology, but 
</b></p>
<p><b>there are important interrelationships between them. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Findings from all six work streams, and any recommendations and guidance 
</b></p>
<p><b>arising from this work, will be subject to stakeholder consultation between September 
</b></p>
<p><b>2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In addition, initial findings and analysis from these 
</b></p>
<p><b>projects will be presented at the Forum on Business and Human Rights to be held in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Geneva from 16 to 18 November 2015 to enable multi-stakeholder consultation in an 
</b></p>
<p><b>open format.
