Convention, 
</p>
<p> <i>Highlighting</i> the fact that the majority of persons with disabilities live in conditions 
of poverty and, in this regard, recognizing the critical need to address the negative impact 
of poverty on persons with disabilities, bearing in mind that an estimated 80 per cent of 
persons with disabilities live in developing countries, including least developed countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of international cooperation and its promotion in 
support of national efforts for the realization of the purpose and objectives of the

disabilities, including by ensuring that: 
</p>

Commissioner on the decisions taken regarding focal points, coordination mechanisms and

disabilities;
