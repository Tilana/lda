<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner  
for Human Rights on the situation of human rights 
in Afghanistan and on the achievements of technical

</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The human rights situation in Afghanistan in 2014 has been negatively affected by 
</p>
<p>the contested security, political and economic transitions. Anti-Government elements 
</p>
<p>sought to exploit the uncertainty by increasing their offensives, resulting in more ground 
</p>
<p>engagements and a rising toll in civilian casualties. In the first 11 months of 2014, civilian 
</p>
<p>deaths and injuries from conflict-related violence increased by 19 per cent compared with 
</p>
<p>the same period in 2013. 2014 has become the year with the highest number of civilian 
</p>
<p>deaths and injuries recorded by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 
</p>
<p>(UNAMA) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR) since 2009. 
</p>
<p>Unaddressed pervasive violence against women and girls and impunity for abusive 
</p>
<p>detention practices, including torture, continued. 
</p>
<p>Despite the worsening conflict and continuing human rights violations, with the 
</p>
<p>formation in September 2014 of the National Unity Government committed to a reform 
</p>
<p>agenda, there is a genuine opportunity to consolidate and expand human rights protections. 
</p>
<p>For reforms to take root, they must be reinforced by accountability for those who commit 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR have continued to pursue an overall strategy of &#8220;embedding 
</p>
<p>human rights in Afghanistan&#8221; in support of all Afghans. Through targeted research and 
</p>
<p>documentation, reporting, advocacy and engagement in strategic partnerships and dialogue 
</p>
<p>with government, national institutions and civil society actors and communities as well as 
</p>
<p>international partners across Afghanistan. 
</p>

<p>UNAMA/OHCHR have prioritized four areas: protection of civilians in armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, including children; elimination of violence against women; prevention of torture 
</p>
<p>and arbitrary detention; and human rights aspects of peace and reconciliation processes. In 
</p>
<p>addition, UNAMA/OHCHR is providing support and advocacy to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness and independence of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission. These priorities reflect the UNAMA mandate and highlight the main human 
</p>
<p>rights concerns of the Afghan people. These priorities also serve as key areas for the newly 
</p>
<p>elected Afghan Government to focus upon, as part of their reform agenda following the 
</p>
<p>transfer of security and other responsibilities from international actors.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113 of 
</p>
<p>27 November 2006 and its resolution 14/15 of 18 June 2010, and has been prepared in 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). Since 
</p>
<p>the previous report (A/HRC/25/41), the human rights situation in Afghanistan has been 
</p>
<p>negatively affected by the contested security, political and economic transitions that 
</p>
<p>concluded in 2014. 
</p>
<p>2. Presidential elections took place on 5 April, in which no candidate won more than 
</p>
<p>50 per cent of the vote, and a second-round run-off was held on 14 June between the two 
</p>
<p>leading candidates. The determination displayed by millions of Afghans to cast their ballots 
</p>
<p>and the performance of the Afghan security forces in the face of insurgency threats were 
</p>
<p>welcomed within the country and internationally. Although civilian casualties on the 
</p>
<p>election days were high (532 in total), the insurgency did not cause significant disruption to 
</p>
<p>the process.  
</p>
<p>3. In the weeks after the vote, political tensions over allegations of fraud led to a 
</p>
<p>serious political impasse, with grave destabilizing consequences for the political, security, 
</p>
<p>economic and social environment. The situation was resolved following mediations by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and the international community, and agreement by the two contenders to 
</p>
<p>an internationally observed audit. This resulted in the inauguration of Asraf Ghani as 
</p>
<p>President and in the formation of a government of national unity committed to a reform 
</p>
<p>agenda, with Abdullah Abdullah as Chief Executive Officer. These political developments 
</p>
<p>give reasons for cautious optimism amid the persistent insecurity. 
</p>
<p>4. Of grave concern is the significant increase in the number of civilian casualties from 
</p>
<p>the already elevated numbers of 2013. From January to November 2014, civilian deaths and 
</p>
<p>injuries from conflict-related violence increased by 19 per cent compared with the same 
</p>
<p>period in 2013. This is the highest number of civilian casualties recorded by 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR since 2009. While three-quarters of all civilian deaths and injuries were 
</p>
<p>caused by anti-Government elements, a rise in civilian casualties caused by Afghan 
</p>
<p>Government forces was also documented. For the first time, ground engagements became 
</p>
<p>the leading cause of civilian casualties, with civilians increasingly killed or injured in the 
</p>
<p>crossfire. This increase in civilian casualties disproportionately affected children: child 
</p>
<p>casualties were 33 per cent higher than those recorded in 2013. From January to November 
</p>
<p>2014, at least 44 children were killed or injured every week in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>5. Phase II of the Afghan People&#8217;s Dialogue on Peace, which was launched in April 
</p>
<p>2013, was completed in 2014. The project promotes an inclusive, rights-based approach to 
</p>
<p>peace and reconciliation efforts by enabling Afghans to express their views on prospects for 
</p>
<p>peace, reconciliation, security, economic development, human rights, justice and the rule of 
</p>
<p>law. UNAMA/OHCHR has supported civil society to lead in delivering this project. Phase 
</p>
<p>II led to the development of 34 provincial road maps, which are being used as an advocacy 
</p>
<p>tool by civil society. The People&#8217;s Dialogue steering committee has requested to present the 
</p>
<p>findings and recommendations of the report to President Ghani. 
</p>
<p>6. The prevalence of violence against women and girls and a lack of accountability in 
</p>
<p>that regard continued to be of serious concern. The Government released its latest report on 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women, indicating a 
</p>
<p>20 per cent increase in the recorded incidents of violence against women (5,406 incidents), 
</p>
<p>of which 3,715 constituted acts that could be prosecuted under the Law. In the report, the 
</p>
<p>Government noted that mediation of cases of violence against women &#8212; including for 
</p>
<p>serious crimes &#8212; was prevalent. Over the course of 2014, the Ministry of Interior has made </p>


<p>significant progress in developing policies and directives aimed at enhancing protection of 
</p>
<p>policewomen in the workplace.<b> </b>Afghan women&#8217;s participation in the 2014 Presidential and 
</p>
<p>Provincial Council elections was strong. However, women&#8217;s political representation 
</p>
<p>decreased owing to the 2013 amendments to the Electoral Law, which reduced the number 
</p>
<p>of seats reserved for female representatives in the Provincial Council. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>7. Conflict-related violence increasingly affected civilians in 2014, with an increase in 
</p>
<p>the number of civilian casualties from the already elevated numbers of 2013. Attacks by 
</p>
<p>anti-Government elements (Taliban and other armed opposition groups) against Afghan 
</p>
<p>National Security Forces increased as insurgents sought to exploit uncertainty surrounding 
</p>
<p>the presidential election and assert control as transition of security responsibilities from 
</p>
<p>international military forces to Afghan forces concluded. Increasing pressure from anti-
</p>
<p>Government elements and a high number of casualties experienced by Afghan National 
</p>
<p>Security Forces caused Afghan forces to concentrate on force protection and recovering 
</p>
<p>disputed territory, which limited their primary role in protecting civilians from conflict-
</p>
<p>related violence. 
</p>
<p>8. From January to November 2014, civilian deaths and injuries from conflict-related 
</p>
<p>violence increased by 19 per cent compared with the same period in 2013. 2014 thus 
</p>
<p>became the year with the highest number of civilian deaths and injuries recorded by 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR since 2009. Between 1 January and 30 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR documented 9,617 civilian casualties (3,188 civilians killed and 6,429 
</p>
<p>injured). UNAMA attributed 75 per cent of civilian casualties to anti-Government elements, 
</p>
<p>11 per cent to pro-Government forces, consisting of Afghan National Security Forces and 
</p>
<p>international military forces, and 9 per cent to ground engagements between pro-
</p>
<p>Government forces and anti-Government elements in which attribution was not possible. 
</p>
<p>Four per cent of civilian casualties were unattributed, resulting mainly from explosive 
</p>
<p>remnants of war, while the remaining one per cent resulted from by cross-border shelling. 
</p>
<p>9. A new trend in 2014 was an increase in civilian casualties from ground engagements 
</p>
<p>between Afghan National Security Forces and anti-Government elements, particularly in 
</p>
<p>civilian populated areas. These caused the most civilian casualties. In previous years, 
</p>
<p>improvised explosive devices used by anti-Government elements consistently caused the 
</p>
<p>highest number of civilian casualties. The increased focus by the conflicting parties on 
</p>
<p>asserting control on the ground gave rise to larger numbers of armed clashes between anti-
</p>
<p>Government elements and pro-Government forces, particularly in the eastern, south-eastern 
</p>
<p>and southern regions.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Anti-Government Elements 
</b></p>
<p>10. Seventy-five per cent of all civilian casualties during 2014 were attributed to anti-
</p>
<p>Government elements (which includes a range of armed opposition groups) &#8212; the same 
</p>
<p>number recorded in the same period in 2013. The Taliban also claimed responsibility for an 
</p>
<p>increased number of incidents which caused a total of 1,700 civilian casualties, 88 per cent 
</p>
<p>higher than in the same period in 2013, although, as in previous years, for the majority of 
</p>
<p>incidents that UNAMA/OHCHR attributed to anti-Government elements, there has been no 
</p>
<p>claim of responsibility. 
</p>
<p>11. Between 1 January and 30 November 2014, improvised explosive devices and 
</p>
<p>suicide/complex attacks by anti-Government elements together accounted for 46 per cent of 
</p>
<p>all civilian deaths and injuries. Improvised explosive devices alone accounted for 800 </p>


<p>civilian deaths and 2011 injured (2,811 civilian casualties), up five per cent from the same 
</p>
<p>period the previous year. After a decrease of 44 per cent in civilian casualties from 
</p>
<p>pressure-plated devices in 2013, the number of civilian casualties from those devices 
</p>
<p>increased again in 2014 by nine per cent. In a particularly grave incident on 23 November 
</p>
<p>2014, in Yahyakhel district of Paktika province, a suicide attacker detonated a body-borne 
</p>
<p>improvised explosive device among a large crowd at a local volleyball tournament. The 
</p>
<p>suicide bomber was allegedly targeting members of the Afghan Local Police among the 
</p>
<p>crowd. Fifty-eight civilians were killed, including 21 children, and 85 were injured, 
</p>
<p>including 26 children. The anti-Government element group responsible for this attack has 
</p>
<p>not been determined. 
</p>
<p>12. Throughout 2014, anti-Government elements continued to target and kill civilians 
</p>
<p>who worked for or were perceived to support the Government or Afghan and international 
</p>
<p>military forces. Between 1 January and 30 November, UNAMA/OHCHR documented 
</p>
<p>967 civilian casualties (649 civilian deaths and 318 injured) from targeted killings &#8212; a 
</p>
<p>decrease of 11 per cent as compared with the same period in 2013. In many cases, which 
</p>
<p>led to 63 per cent of the casualties, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the targeted 
</p>
<p>killings on their website. On 30 August 2014, for example, the Taliban claimed 
</p>
<p>responsibility for having killed 12 labourers and injured five in Farah Province, alleging 
</p>
<p>that they were members of a pro-Government militia. 
</p>
<p>13. Anti-Government elements attempted to disrupt both rounds of the 2014 presidential 
</p>
<p>election by threatening and targeting civilians involved in the electoral process. On the 
</p>
<p>weekend of the first round of the election (held on 4 and 5 April), 211 conflict-related 
</p>
<p>incidents caused 208 civilian casualties (45 killed and 163 injured). Most of the incidents 
</p>
<p>(91 per cent) directly targeted voters, candidates, employees of the Independent Elections 
</p>
<p>Commission or police officers providing security to polling centres. On the weekend of the 
</p>
<p>second round of the elections (on 13 and 14 June), violence increased, with 169 conflict-
</p>
<p>related incidents affecting civilians, causing 324 civilian casualties (82 deaths and 242 
</p>
<p>injured). Again, most of the incidents (85 per cent) directly targeted participants in the 
</p>
<p>election. In a serious incident on 14 June in Herat, the Taliban cut off the fingers of 12 men 
</p>
<p>after they had cast their vote. The attacks by anti-Government elements did not result in 
</p>
<p>significant disruption to the electoral process.  
</p>
<p>14. Anti-Government elements increasingly threatened and targeted religious leaders. 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR documented 24 incidents in which religious leaders or places of worship 
</p>
<p>were directly threatened or attacked, resulting in 58 civilian casualties (18 deaths and 
</p>
<p>40 injured). The total number of casualties caused by attacks against religious leaders and 
</p>
<p>places of worship grew by 57 per cent over the same period in 2013. The majority of the 
</p>
<p>attacks targeted mullahs performing funeral ceremonies for deceased members of Afghan 
</p>
<p>security forces and religious figures who had expressed public support for the Government. 
</p>
<p>In the first 11 months of 2014, the number of incidents of punishments, including 
</p>
<p>executions, amputations and beatings by &#8220;parallel courts&#8221; operated by anti-Government 
</p>
<p>elements also doubled and the number of resulting civilian casualties quadrupled to a total 
</p>
<p>of 92, with 77 civilians killed and 15 injured. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Pro-Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>15. From 1 January to 30 November 2014, UNAMA/OHCHR documented 1,085 
</p>
<p>civilian casualties (446 civilian deaths and 639 injured) attributed to pro-Government 
</p>
<p>forces, a 21 per cent increase from 2013. The rise is attributed to an increase in offensive 
</p>
<p>operations and counter-attacks by Afghan National Security Forces against anti-
</p>
<p>Government elements in contested areas. For example, on 18 August, 14 civilians, </p>


<p>including four women and four children, were killed, and 14 others injured in an Afghan 
</p>
<p>National Army operation in Kunduz city. 
</p>
<p>16. With the conclusion of the security transition in 2014, UNAMA/OHCHR highlights 
</p>
<p>the lack of a permanent structure in relevant bodies of the Afghan National Security Forces 
</p>
<p>to systematically investigate allegations of civilian casualties, initiate remedial measures 
</p>
<p>and take follow-up action. The Civilian Casualties Tracking Team in the Presidential 
</p>
<p>Information Coordination Centre, which was established in May 2012, does not receive 
</p>
<p>complaints from individuals or organizations, and only records reports of civilian casualties 
</p>
<p>received from security bodies. UNAMA/OHCHR has not observed any improvement in the 
</p>
<p>accountability of Afghan National Security Forces as incidents in which they have caused 
</p>
<p>civilian casualties have not been investigated or led to prosecutions. The new Government 
</p>
<p>has pledged to make the mitigation of civilian casualties a priority, with operational 
</p>
<p>procedures related to night raids and the use of mortar fire in civilian populated areas under 
</p>
<p>revision.  
</p>
<p>17. Human rights violations attributed to the local police were documented by 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR in several regions. From 1 January to 30 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR documented 89 civilian casualties caused by the local police (44 deaths 
</p>
<p>and 45 injured), a 20 per cent decrease compared with 2013. However, the number of 
</p>
<p>civilian deaths attributed to the local police increased by 42 per cent. In most cases, the 
</p>
<p>deaths and injuries resulted from members of the local police committing human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, including punishments and revenge killings. The current mechanism for 
</p>
<p>accountability &#8212; the monitoring and investigations section of the Directorate of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Interior for the local police &#8212; has shown limited results in 2014. There have 
</p>
<p>been only a small number of prosecutions and convictions for human rights violations 
</p>
<p>committed by the local police, and the Directorate is not mandated to monitor and follow-
</p>
<p>up on prosecutorial steps, which limits its effectiveness in promoting accountability within 
</p>
<p>the local police. 
</p>
<p>18. Explosive remnants of war continued to pose a serious hazard to civilians, 
</p>
<p>particularly children. Civilian casualties from remnants increased by 10 per cent, which was 
</p>
<p>attributed to the growing number of ground engagements. Following sustained advocacy by 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR, the  International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the 
</p>
<p>international community continued to take significant steps to ensure that firing ranges no 
</p>
<p>longer in use were cleared of unexploded ordnance. ISAF conducted surface clearance of 
</p>
<p>more than 20 ranges and pledged to complete the surface clearance of all firing ranges early 
</p>
<p>in 2015 (ahead of December 2015, as initially proposed). In October 2014, the Congress of 
</p>
<p>the United States of America approved $250 million to carry out subsurface clearance 
</p>
<p>where required on high-explosive firing ranges. With the sharp rise in ground engagements 
</p>
<p>in 2014 and the associated risk of unexploded ordnance, it is imperative that Afghan 
</p>
<p>National Security Forces be fully supported to mark hazardous areas, ensure clearance of 
</p>
<p>unexploded ordnance from the battlefield and continue awareness-raising programmes to 
</p>
<p>educate children on the dangers of unexploded ordnance. UNAMA/OHCHR condemned 
</p>
<p>the killing by anti-Government elements of 11 Afghan deminers and the wounding of 
</p>
<p>another 6 in an attack in Helmand province on 13 December. 
</p>
<p>19. Civilian casualties from aerial operations followed the downward trend observed by 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR in 2013; the total civilian casualties caused by aerial operations 
</p>
<p>decreased by 21 per cent from January to November 2014, with 92 killed and 54 injured. 
</p>
<p>Civilian deaths and injuries from remotely piloted aircraft (drones) decreased by 10 per 
</p>
<p>cent, killing 31 civilians and injuring 22. On 26 August, a drone strike in Kunduz province 
</p>
<p>killed two civilians and injured six, including two children. More than 10 civilian houses 
</p>
<p>were also damaged. UNAMA/OHCHR has urged international military forces to review </p>


<p>thoroughly pre-engagement targeting criteria and take the required precautionary measures 
</p>
<p>to prevent civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the reporting period, the changing nature of the conflict had a 
</p>
<p>disproportionate impact on children. Child casualties reported and verified between 
</p>
<p>1 January 2014 and 30 November 2014 were 33 per cent higher than those recorded during 
</p>
<p>the same period in 2013. Between 1
 
January and 30 November 2014, the United Nations-
</p>
<p>led country task force on monitoring and reporting verified 925 incidents of killing and 
</p>
<p>maiming out of a total of 995 reported incidents. The verified incidents indicate that at least 
</p>
<p>597 children (442 boys, 131 girls and 24 gender unknown) were killed and a further 1,501 
</p>
<p>children (1,075 boys, 374 girls and 52 genders unknown) were injured. Between January 
</p>
<p>and November 2014, at least 44 children were killed or injured every week in Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>21. Ground engagements caused the highest number of child casualties &#8212; 1,014 killed 
</p>
<p>or injured. Improvised explosive devices were the second leading cause of child deaths and 
</p>
<p>injuries, amounting to 568 casualties &#8212; all attributed to anti-Government elements. 
</p>
<p>Explosives remnants of war caused 264 child casualties &#8212; including 226 boys &#8212; during 
</p>
<p>the period under review. Suicide attacks by anti-Government elements resulted in 198 child 
</p>
<p>casualties, with the highest numbers recorded in the southeast region. Air strikes by 
</p>
<p>international forces killed and injured 31 children during the period under review. Anti-
</p>
<p>Government elements were responsible for 56 per cent of the total child casualties reported 
</p>
<p>and verified, and international and Afghan security forces were responsible for 15 per cent. 
</p>
<p>The remaining 27 per cent of the casualties remained unattributed.  
</p>
<p>22. From January to November 2014, the task force documented 203 reports of attacks 
</p>
<p>against schools and related personnel or school occupation. The 155 verified incidents 
</p>
<p>represent a sharp increase compared with the same period in 2013, when 73 such incidents 
</p>
<p>were reported. Attacks against schools included both deliberate targeting as well as 
</p>
<p>incidents that impeded access to education, including crossfire, improvised explosive 
</p>
<p>device placement or detonations on the premises of schools, abduction of staff, intimidation 
</p>
<p>and harassment of education personnel. At least 79 of the verified incidents in 2014 resulted 
</p>
<p>from the direct targeting of schools used as polling centres during the presidential elections.  
</p>
<p>23. During the period under review, 45 incidents of underage recruitment, involving 
</p>
<p>53 boys and 2 girls, were reported to the task force, of which it was only possible to verify 
</p>
<p>14 incidents. The children were recruited allegedly to carry out different types of military 
</p>
<p>activities, such as planting improvised explosive devices, transporting explosives, carrying 
</p>
<p>out suicide attack, spying and for sexual purposes. At least eight recruited boys lost their 
</p>
<p>lives and six boys were injured while planting or assembling improvised explosive devices 
</p>
<p>or carrying out suicide attacks. Of the verified incidents, anti-Government element groups 
</p>
<p>were responsible for the recruitment of 15 boys, while 1 boy was recruited by the Afghan 
</p>
<p>local police and one by a pro-Government militia in the northeast region. A decrease was 
</p>
<p>noted in the number of child recruitment compared to 2013, when the recruitment and use 
</p>
<p>of 79 children was reported.  
</p>
<p>24. Members of armed groups and armed forces in Afghanistan continued to abduct 
</p>
<p>children. During the period under review, 20 incidents of abduction were reported, 
</p>
<p>involving 35 children (34 boys and a girl), of which the task force was able to verify 
</p>
<p>14 incidents affecting 21 boys and a girl. Anti-Government elements, mostly the Taliban, 
</p>
<p>were responsible for 12 verified incidents. The abduction of a boy and a girl was attributed 
</p>
<p>to pro-Government forces.  </p>


<p>25. Anti-Government elements, including the Taliban, also continued to deny 
</p>
<p>humanitarian access to children in the areas under their control. UNAMA/OHCHR was 
</p>
<p>able to verify 66 such incidents out of 74 reported. Verified incidents included abduction, 
</p>
<p>intimidation, killing and injury of humanitarian staff, mostly of deminers, denying access to 
</p>
<p>vaccinators and causing damage to facilities run by humanitarian organizations. 
</p>
<p>26. Despite progress made by the Government, information gathered by the task force 
</p>
<p>highlights that many challenges remain in the full implementation of the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>action plan for the prevention of underage recruitment, including limited age-determination 
</p>
<p>procedures and reports of under-18s recruited, both by the Afghan National Police and the 
</p>
<p>local police. As such, in the most recent report of the Secretary-General on children and 
</p>
<p>armed conflict (A/68/878&#8211;S/2014/339) the national police and the local police remained 
</p>
<p>listed for underage recruitment. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Government, with support from UNAMA/OHCHR and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s Fund, developed a road map towards compliance of the action plan for the 
</p>
<p>prevention of underage recruitment. This was endorsed by the Interministerial Steering 
</p>
<p>Committee on Children and Armed Conflict and progress has been made in its 
</p>
<p>implementation. As part of the road map, UNAMA/OHCHR provided technical support for 
</p>
<p>drafting of a presidential decree to criminalize underage recruitment. It was adopted by the 
</p>
<p>lower house on 1 November and was pending approval by the upper house of Parliament at 
</p>
<p>the time of finalizing the present report. Age assessment practices are being strengthened 
</p>
<p>through the development of national guidelines. Another milestone, which can contribute to 
</p>
<p>reducing underage recruitment, was endorsement by the Minister of Interior of the national 
</p>
<p>birth registration strategy.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Protection from arbitrary detention and respect  
for fair trial rights 
</b></p>
<p>28. Over the past year, Afghanistan&#8217;s prison population decreased from 32,157 adult and 
</p>
<p>juvenile detainees and prisoners in 2013 to 27,859 (as at 22 October 2014). These figures 
</p>
<p>comprise 12,221 detainees and 15,638 prisoners housed in Central Prisons Directorate 
</p>
<p>facilities and the juvenile corrections and rehabilitation centres across Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>29. The prison population included 7,555 persons detained or imprisoned in connection 
</p>
<p>with the armed conflict, but excluded persons held by the national police or the National 
</p>
<p>Directorate of Security in pretrial custody. In the majority of cases, conflict-related 
</p>
<p>detainees are held arbitrarily for extended time periods, in violation of legally prescribed 
</p>
<p>time limits and due process guarantees under Afghan law, in particular the 2014 Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure Code. Most of these detainees do not have access to defence counsel, have not 
</p>
<p>been informed of the charges against them and have not been brought before a tribunal 
</p>
<p>while in the custody of the national police and National Directorate of Security.  
</p>
<p>30. Treatment of conflict-related detainees while in the custody of the national police 
</p>
<p>and National Directorate of Security remains a major human rights concern. In 2014, as in 
</p>
<p>previous years, torture usually took the form of coercive interrogation techniques in which 
</p>
<p>Afghan officials inflicted severe pain and suffering on detainees during interrogations 
</p>
<p>aimed mainly at obtaining a confession or information. A newly identified trend is to 
</p>
<p>outsource torture to small and remote detention facilities to which detention-monitoring 
</p>
<p>organizations have no access owing to the prevailing insecurity in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR is due to issue its third major report on human rights concerns regarding 
</p>
<p>the treatment of conflict related detainees in early 2015. 
</p>
<p>31. One key recommendation of the UNAMA/OHCHR 2013 detention report, still 
</p>
<p>unimplemented almost two years on, is the creation of an independent national preventive </p>


<p>mechanism on torture in line with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
</p>
<p>and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment &#8212; which Afghanistan 
</p>
<p>has not yet ratified &#8212; which could be located within the Afghanistan Independent Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission, with authority and enhanced capacity to inspect all detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR also encourages the Government to invite the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to visit Afghanistan 
</p>
<p>so that he can provide advice on efforts to address the issue of torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>32. Throughout 2014, the monitoring activities of UNAMA/OHCHR mainly focused on 
</p>
<p>the Government&#8217;s implementation of Presidential Decree No. 129, which former President 
</p>
<p>Karzai had issued on 16 February 2013 in response to a Government fact-finding 
</p>
<p>delegation&#8217;s report that had validated UNAMA findings in its January 2013 report. This 
</p>
<p>decree ordered the National Directorate of Security, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court to investigate 
</p>
<p>allegations of torture, prosecute alleged perpetrators, release detainees and prisoners in 
</p>
<p>arbitrary detention, increase access of defence lawyers and medical personnel to detainees 
</p>
<p>to prevent torture and arbitrary detention, and ensure accountability, and report back to the 
</p>
<p>President&#8217;s Office every three months. UNAMA/OHCHR findings indicate that, despite the 
</p>
<p>2013 developments, torture and ill-treatment of conflict-related detainees persist in some 
</p>
<p>detention facilities, with few allegations of torture investigated, prosecuted or subjected to 
</p>
<p>disciplinary action. Measures taken by the Government, such as internal investigations and 
</p>
<p>the establishment of a cadre of National Directorate of Security human rights officers are 
</p>
<p>not robust enough to prevent and end torture. Presidential Decree No. 129 alone is not an 
</p>
<p>effective deterrent to torture; greater accountability is needed to end impunity and bring 
</p>
<p>perpetrators to justice.  
</p>
<p>33. The only prosecution, trial (in mid-April 2014) and subsequent imprisonment of 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of torture known to UNAMA/OHCHR has been of two National Directorate of 
</p>
<p>Security officers in the province of Uruzgan. In a few other cases, Directorate personnel 
</p>
<p>who committed torture or ill-treatment were reassigned to other functions or simply had to 
</p>
<p>pledge not to re-offend. No national police officials were found to have been investigated or 
</p>
<p>prosecuted on allegations of torture or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>34. Defence lawyers have access to provincial National Directorate of Security 
</p>
<p>detention facilities, but can usually access detainees only after the investigation phase has 
</p>
<p>been concluded. The Legal Aid Department of the Ministry of Justice lacks capacity and 
</p>
<p>cannot address the current shortfall of legal aid defence lawyers alone. Most medical 
</p>
<p>personnel working in detention facilities lack independence as they report directly to the 
</p>
<p>Directorate and the Ministry of Interior, and fear that they will face reprisals if they endorse 
</p>
<p>findings of physical abuse or torture.  
</p>
<p>35. The Supreme Court has issued instructions to judges reminding them to reject 
</p>
<p>confessions obtained through torture and to dismiss cases that rely solely on evidence thus 
</p>
<p>obtained. However, these obligations are not respected in practice, and prosecutors or 
</p>
<p>judges routinely disregard or dismiss allegations of forced confessions. These confessions 
</p>
<p>constitute the primary basis for proving a case and justifying a conviction in court. 
</p>
<p>36. In response to the findings of the UNAMA/OHCHR report of 20 January 2013,1 
</p>
<p>ISAF suspended transfers of detainees it had captured to 35 Afghan detention facilities and 
</p>
<p>redesigned its detainee certification review process to include inspections, extended training 
</p>
<p>and capacity-building of all national police and National Directorate of Security 
</p>
<p>

<p>interrogators and detention staff on human rights principles and non-coercive interrogation 
</p>
<p>techniques, and mentoring. In 2014, UNAMA/OHCHR did not document incidents in 
</p>
<p>which detainees arrested by international forces were tortured following their transfer to an 
</p>
<p>Afghan facility. UNAMA/OHCHR did, however, record incidents in which detainees were 
</p>
<p>arrested by Afghan security forces in operation that had international military support, and 
</p>
<p>were subsequently tortured by Afghan detaining authorities. The North Atlantic Treaty 
</p>
<p>Organization (NATO) Resolute Support Mission, due to start in 2015 as a successor 
</p>
<p>mission to ISAF, does not include a detention monitoring component. In 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Government of Afghanistan continued to invest attention and resources into the 
</p>
<p>development of the State party report to the Committee Against Torture. Between 
</p>
<p>September 2013 and November 2014, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted one 
</p>
<p>conference at the provincial level and three at the national level to engage government 
</p>
<p>officials from 13 institutions, including security, judiciary and civil society, in the reporting 
</p>
<p>process. In November 2014, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also released a compilation of 
</p>
<p>written works on torture in Afghanistan by celebrated academics. In October 2014, 
</p>
<p>President Ghani visited the Kabul central prison and directed authorities to continually 
</p>
<p>monitor and report on the situation of detainees. 
</p>
<p>37. Five men convicted of armed robbery and gang rape in Paghman were executed on 8 
</p>
<p>October. Prior to their executions, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights wrote to President Ghani, requesting him to stay the carrying out of the death 
</p>
<p>sentences, in order to allow time for a judicial review to ensure that the rights to fair trial of 
</p>
<p>the accused individuals had been upheld. There was no question this had been an appalling 
</p>
<p>crime. However, the High Commissioner expressed grave concerns that the legal process 
</p>
<p>that had led to the convictions had failed to comply with national and international fair trial 
</p>
<p>standards. UNAMA/OHCHR had received credible allegations that the convicted men had 
</p>
<p>been ill-treated while in pretrial detention, denied adequate legal representation and, during 
</p>
<p>the legal proceedings, the legal basis for the prosecution had been unclear. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner urged the Government to establish a moratorium on executions and to ratify 
</p>
<p>the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. In mid-October, President Ghani announced 
</p>
<p>that the Government would review all the cases where the convict had been sentenced to 
</p>
<p>death by the courts. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violence again</b>st women and promotion of women&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. The prevalence of violence against women and a corresponding lack of 
</p>
<p>accountability continued to be of serious concern during 2014. Insecurity, cultural beliefs 
</p>
<p>and victims&#8217; fears of retaliation or stigmatization led to continued underreporting of 
</p>
<p>incidents of violence against women, a major obstacle to a comprehensive analysis of 
</p>
<p>trends.  
</p>
<p>39. Building on the findings and recommendations of the December 2013 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR report entitled &#8220;A Way to Go: An Update on Implementation of the Law 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Violence against Women in Afghanistan&#8221;, 2  UNAMA/OHCHR 
</p>
<p>continued to monitor, report and advocate on issues related to violence against Afghan 
</p>
<p>women and girls. From January to November 2014, field teams documented 302 alleged 
</p>
<p>cases of violence against women across the country, including 91 murders, 29 cases of 
</p>
<p>forced immolation, 27 rapes, 135 cases of battery and laceration, and 52 forced and 21

<p>underage marriages. UNAMA/OHCHR urged the authorities to comply with the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>international and national obligations and provided technical support to members of the 
</p>
<p>provincial commissions on the elimination of violence against women. Overall, the 
</p>
<p>functioning of such commissions varies widely across the country. In many provinces, the 
</p>
<p>mechanism faces challenges such as absenteeism, lack of technical expertise and the 
</p>
<p>reluctance of the relevant authorities to convene them. Some progress was observed, with 
</p>
<p>the prosecution units on the elimination of violence against women under the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Office increasing their field presence from 8 to 18 provinces in 2014.  
</p>
<p>40. On 1 March 2014, the Government released its first report on implementation of the 
</p>
<p>2009 Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women, based on data it had gathered 
</p>
<p>from 32 of the country&#8217;s 34 provinces between March 2012 and March 2013. A second 
</p>
<p>report was released on 24 November 2014, covering the period March 2013 to March 2014, 
</p>
<p>based on data from all 34 provinces. With the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality 
</p>
<p>and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), UNAMA/OHCHR provided significant 
</p>
<p>support to the Government in preparation of the reports. The first report recorded 4,505 
</p>
<p>incidents of violence against women, of which 3,396 constituted acts that could be 
</p>
<p>prosecuted under the Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women. The second 
</p>
<p>report indicated a 20 per cent increase in recorded incidents of violence against women 
</p>
<p>(5,406 incidents) of which 3,715 constituted acts that could be prosecuted under the law. 
</p>
<p>Both reports noted that mediation of cases of violence against women, including for serious 
</p>
<p>crimes, was prevalent. The second report also found that very few cases involving violence 
</p>
<p>against women were resolved through a criminal justice process that resulted in sanctions 
</p>
<p>against perpetrators or acquittals. The reports proposed a range of remedial actions, 
</p>
<p>including establishing a comprehensive database, strengthening national and provincial 
</p>
<p>commissions on the elimination of violence against women, and increasing awareness of 
</p>
<p>the related Law, which are consistent with UNAMA/OHCHR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. The Government initiated discussions on the use of mediation of cases of violence 
</p>
<p>against women by State institutions. With the technical support of UNAMA/OHCHR, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs and the Ministry of Finance held a national conference on 
</p>
<p>16 September 2014, which resulted in the establishment of a drafting committee charged 
</p>
<p>with drawing up detailed instructions outlining the methodology and criteria, including 
</p>
<p>what specific acts can be mediated, as well as minimum requirements and follow-up 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to regulate mediation. As mediation continues to be widespread, the 
</p>
<p>development of standardized guidelines is imperative to ensure that mediation processes 
</p>
<p>and outcomes are used only for specific offences and not for serious crimes and are fair, 
</p>
<p>safe, voluntary, confidential, free from any form of intimidation or discrimination and in 
</p>
<p>full respect of the rights and dignity of victims. 
</p>
<p>42. Over the course of 2014, the Ministry of Interior made significant progress in 
</p>
<p>developing policies and directives aimed at enhancing protection of policewomen in the 
</p>
<p>workplace. Serious concerns had been raised in 2013 about high levels of sexual violence 
</p>
<p>and harassment, and the undermining of female police officers&#8217; authority by male officers 
</p>
<p>in the national police. In January 2014, the Minister of Interior endorsed a strategy for the 
</p>
<p>integration of women in the police force intended to create a protective environment for 
</p>
<p>women employed in the national police. The strategy incorporated a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>definition of sexual harassment and reinforced its prohibition. Moreover, on 10 March 
</p>
<p>2014, an interministerial commission was established and tasked with drafting an action 
</p>
<p>plan to implement the strategy, to which UNAMA/OHCHR provided technical support. 
</p>
<p>Adopted by the Minister of Interior on 13 August 2014, the final plan outlines measures to 
</p>
<p>improve the participation, protection and professionalization of women in the national 
</p>
<p>police. As a result of advocacy to strengthen accountability, the plan includes the 
</p>
<p>establishment of an independent and effective complaints and monitoring unit to investigate 
</p>
<p>misconduct and abuse. The swift implementation of the action plan across the country is </p>


<p>critical. The overall presence of policewomen in the national police remains very low: as at 
</p>
<p>October 2014, women comprised approximately 1.5 per cent of the national police &#8212; 2,334 
</p>
<p>of a total force of over 153,000. President Ghani has declared addressing sexual harassment 
</p>
<p>in Afghanistan as one of his priorities and, upon his request, UNAMA/OHCHR submitted a 
</p>
<p>briefing note on this issue, proposing recommendations based on international standards 
</p>
<p>and best practices. 
</p>
<p>43. In terms of legislative developments, the 2009 Law on the Elimination of Violence 
</p>
<p>against Women remained enacted by presidential decree and was not brought back before 
</p>
<p>Parliament for ratification for fear it would be rejected. As at December 2014, discussions 
</p>
<p>were ongoing within the Ministry of Justice-led Criminal Law Reform Working Group 
</p>
<p>(Penal Code reform subcommittee) to propose the incorporation of criminal provisions of 
</p>
<p>the Law into the revised Penal Code, which would help consolidate the previous gains 
</p>
<p>made under the Law. 
</p>
<p>44. Encouraging developments were observed regarding the participation of women in 
</p>
<p>the 2014 Presidential and Provincial Council elections as voters, candidates, election staff 
</p>
<p>and observers. During the two rounds of voting held in April and June, their participation as 
</p>
<p>voters constituted 36 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively, in the face of intimidation, 
</p>
<p>logistical constraints and deep-rooted conservative social norms discouraging women&#8217;s role 
</p>
<p>in public life. The number of women running for elections was unprecedented, representing 
</p>
<p>9 per cent of the overall candidates in the presidential race, and 11 per cent for provincial 
</p>
<p>council elections. However, at final count, due to the 2013 amendments to the Electoral 
</p>
<p>Law that reduced the number of seats reserved for female representatives in the Provincial 
</p>
<p>Councils from 25 to 20 per cent, women won 97 seats out of 458 seats (21 per cent), which 
</p>
<p>constituted a sharp decrease compared with the 132 seats out of 458 (29 per cent) they had 
</p>
<p>won in the 2009 elections. With fewer women represented, concerns arise over their ability 
</p>
<p>to effectively promote gender equality within the national political agenda. 
</p>
<p>45. To underscore the Government&#8217;s commitment to the participation of women in 
</p>
<p>political, peace and security processes, the national action plan on the implementation of 
</p>
<p>Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) was endorsed by a steering committee in October 
</p>
<p>2014. The Government of Afghanistan, in cooperation with civil society, submitted to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations its second report on the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Platform for Action in May 2014.3 To mark the annual 16-day campaign of activism to end 
</p>
<p>gender violence, held globally from 25 November to 10 December, UNAMA/OHCHR, in 
</p>
<p>collaboration with other partners, supported outreach activities across the country, such as 
</p>
<p>debates, radio programmes and workshops, to raise awareness on the imperative to act 
</p>
<p>against violence perpetrated against women and girls. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Peace and reconciliation, including accountability 
and transitional justice  
</b></p>
<p>46. In 2014, UNAMA/OHCHR continued to support the Afghan People&#8217;s Dialogue on 
</p>
<p>Peace initiative. The project promotes a rights-based approach to peace and reconciliation 
</p>
<p>efforts by enabling Afghans to express their views on prospects for peace, reconciliation, 
</p>
<p>security, economic development, human rights, justice and the rule of law. The project has 
</p>
<p>been implemented in two phases: phase I, from October to December 2011; and phase II, 
</p>
<p>from April 2013 to December 2014. In line with the principle of Afghan leadership and

<p>ownership of peacebuilding initiatives, UNAMA/OHCHR has played a facilitation role, 
</p>
<p>supporting civil society to lead this inclusive, rights-centred process that enables the voices 
</p>
<p>of Afghans to be heard and considered by the new Government and policymakers. As an 
</p>
<p>integral part of the initiative, 34 provincial road maps have been completed and are being 
</p>
<p>used an advocacy tool by local civil society groups. 
</p>
<p>47. On 10 June, UNAMA assisted Afghan civil society by coorganizing a press 
</p>
<p>conference to launch the summary report of phase II of the Afghan People&#8217;s Dialogue on 
</p>
<p>Peace, entitled &#8220;Building the Foundations for an Inclusive Peace Process&#8221;.4 The 40-page 
</p>
<p>report summarises the views of the 4,648 Afghan men, women and young people from all 
</p>
<p>34 provinces of the country who participated in phase II of the Dialogue. In the report, it is 
</p>
<p>stated that disarming and disempowering local militias, tackling widespread corruption and 
</p>
<p>impunity among the police and judiciary, resolving ethnic tensions, tribal disputes and 
</p>
<p>factional conflicts that fuel broader armed conflict, respecting human rights and providing 
</p>
<p>equitable development assistance and service delivery across the country were essential to 
</p>
<p>achieving lasting peace. The report also contains a 10-point national road map for peace on 
</p>
<p>the basis of these findings. On 12 October, the People&#8217;s Dialogue steering committee sent 
</p>
<p>an open letter to the Office of the President, requesting a discussion of the national road 
</p>
<p>map for peace. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Support to national institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>48. On 28 January 2014, the findings of the five-yearly accreditation review of the 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission by the Subcommittee on 
</p>
<p>Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the 
</p>
<p>Promotion and Protection of Human Rights were published, with a decision on its status 
</p>
<p>deferred for one year. The decision was accompanied by a statement of concern regarding 
</p>
<p>the selection and appointment process for Commissioners, the dependence of the 
</p>
<p>Commission on international donor funding, and the disparity in the ratio of female to male 
</p>
<p>staff members.  
</p>
<p>49. Since then, the Commission has made efforts to address the concerns raised. These 
</p>
<p>include obtaining a presidential order to amend the selection and appointment process, in 
</p>
<p>order to establish a transparent, participatory and pluralistic process more in line with the 
</p>
<p>principles relating to the status of national institutions (Paris Principles); implementing a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive gender policy to improve female representation of the staff; and obtaining 
</p>
<p>the Government&#8217;s commitment to increase its 2014 budget allocation to the Commission. 
</p>
<p>The Commission was reviewed for re-accreditation by the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
</p>
<p>from 27 to 31 October 2014. The outcome was pending at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>UNAMA/OHCHR urges the new Government to ensure the Commission&#8217;s continued 
</p>
<p>independence, credibility and effectiveness. UNAMA/OHCHR also reiterates its 
</p>
<p>recommendation to publicly release the Commission&#8217;s conflict-mapping report as a way of 
</p>
<p>promoting peace and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>50. The Commission, supported by the United Nations Development Programme and in 
</p>
<p>consultation with UNAMA/OHCHR, developed a new five-year strategic action plan for 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>%20Afghan%20Peoples%20Dialogues.pdf. </p>


<p>the period 2014-2019, which was published on 10 December 2014. The plan defines five 
</p>
<p>strategic objectives: to encourage and empower government, individuals and civil society 
</p>
<p>institutions to promote, protect and respect human rights; to lead the Afghan human rights 
</p>
<p>movement and advocate for change; to monitor the Government&#8217;s compliance with national 
</p>
<p>and international human rights obligations; to defend and protect the rights of victims of 
</p>
<p>human rights abuse; and to ensure the Commission&#8217;s effectiveness and impact of its 
</p>
<p>interventions. UNAMA/OHCHR remains committed to strengthening this critical national 
</p>
<p>institution and supporting implementation of its strategic action plan.  
</p>
<p>51. On 20 August, the Commission released the report of its national inquiry into the 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences of <i>Bacha Bazi</i> (&#8220;playing with boys&#8221;), a practice that involves the 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation and often the sexual enslavement of boys by men in positions of power 
</p>
<p>in Afghanistan. The Commission interviewed perpetrators, victims, local elites and 
</p>
<p>witnesses in 14 provinces across the country and called on the Government to put an end to 
</p>
<p>this abuse by amending the law to specifically criminalize the practice, to address the 
</p>
<p>culture of impunity and to identify and protect victims. The report blamed the practice on 
</p>
<p>factors such as weak rule of law, corruption, poverty and the presence of illegal armed 
</p>
<p>groups in the country. The Commission is currently drawing up a follow-up advocacy 
</p>
<p>strategy and action plan that UNAMA/OHCHR will support. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review held its eighteenth session 
</p>
<p>from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of Afghanistan was held at the 2nd 
</p>
<p>meeting, on 27 January 2014. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 January 2014, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group adopted the report on Afghanistan. In its opening statement, the delegation of 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan acknowledged the challenges that had slowed its progress in human rights, 
</p>
<p>such as terrorism, extremism, narcotics and insecurity in some parts of the country. The 
</p>
<p>delegation noted that women&#8217;s rights and gender equality remained a top priority for the 
</p>
<p>Government, highlighting the enactment of the Law on the Elimination of Violence against 
</p>
<p>Women, the establishment of special prosecution offices for the elimination of violence 
</p>
<p>against women, and the establishment of 16 protection centres/shelters for female victims 
</p>
<p>of domestic violence; it also highlighted the Government&#8217;s success in increasing access to 
</p>
<p>education and improving health-care provision, and stressed that Afghanistan had become 
</p>
<p>party to most of the core international human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>53. In response, the issues raised by the Working Group related, inter alia, to the failure 
</p>
<p>to respond effectively to increasing violence against women; the prevalence of arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrests and detention by the police, cases of torture and other ill-treatment in detention 
</p>
<p>facilities; the human rights situation of internally displaced persons; the high percentage of 
</p>
<p>employed children; and the considerable outstanding challenges with regard to the fragile 
</p>
<p>security situation. There were 224 recommendations made by 89 States covering a wide 
</p>
<p>range of human rights issues, of which the Government accepted 189, rejected 12 and noted 
</p>
<p>23 for further consideration. UNAMA/OHCHR will work with partners to assist the 
</p>
<p>Government in its implementation of the accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. From 4 to 12 November, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, conducted a mission to Afghanistan, during 
</p>
<p>which she met with senior Government officials, the Chairperson of the Afghanistan 
</p>
<p>Independent Human Rights Commission, representatives of civil society and the diplomatic 
</p>
<p>community in Kabul, Herat and Jalalabad. In her public statement at the end of her visit, 
</p>
<p>she noted that positive legislative and institutional developments had taken place since the 
</p>
<p>visit of her predecessor in 2005. However, she urged state institutions to address &#8212; among 
</p>
<p>others &#8212; the absence of comprehensive and coherent data collection on violence against </p>


<p>women and the lack of effective interpretation and implementation of laws protecting 
</p>
<p>women and girls from violence, and to allocate adequate resources and support to shelters. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur will present her final report to the Human Rights Council in June 
</p>
<p>2015. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The human rights situation in Afghanistan has been negatively affected by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>contested security, political and economic transitions. Anti-Government elements 
</b></p>
<p><b>sought to exploit the uncertainty by increasing their offensives, resulting in more 
</b></p>
<p><b>ground engagements and a rising toll in civilian casualties. The uncertainty also 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected the economy, threatening sustainable development. At the London 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conference on Afghanistan, held on 3 and 4 December 2014, the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community reaffirmed its commitment to the country's future, in line with priorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and previous funding pledges agreed upon at the Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan, 
</b></p>
<p><b>held in July 2012, and delivered a strong message of political support to President 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ghani</b>&#8217;s<b> administration and his planned reforms. The formation of the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>National Unity provides an opportunity to consolidate and expand human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>protections. For this to happen, there must be accountability for those who commit 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations.  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The strong public statements by the new Government that emphasize the 
</b></p>
<p>importance of human rights, especially women&#8217;s rights, as part of an ambitious social 
</p>
<p><b>reform agenda, are particularly welcome. UNAMA/OHCHR fully supports the 
</b></p>
<p>Government&#8217;s initiatives on combatting sexual harassment, women&#8217;s empowerment, 
</p>
<p><b>addressing concerns over internally displaced people, and focus on the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>detainees. Also, for the first time in many years, there appears to be a possibility for 
</b></p>
<p><b>substantive peace and reconciliation processes and transitional justice. Human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>must not be sacrificed and women must play a full and active role in any negotiations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>both are critical if peace is to be sustainable. OHCHR and the wider United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>system stand ready to play an active and steadfast role in supporting the country to 
</b></p>
<p><b>embed human rights for all Afghans at this important time. 
</b></p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends the

</b></p>
<p><b>addressed through wider legislations and directives; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Establish an independent oversight and accountability mechanism 
</b></p>
<p><b>modelled on the national preventive mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the

</b></p>
<p><b>other institutions holding detainees, as well as prosecutors and courts investigate

</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators; and ensure that prosecutors and courts dismiss evidence obtained 
</b></p>
<p><b>through the use of torture and ill-treatment;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Invite the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</b></p>
<p><b>degrading treatment or punishment to visit Afghanistan to assist in providing a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive response to preventing ill-treatment in detention facilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Fully support the public release of the Afghanistan Independent Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Commission</b>&#8217;s conflict<b>-mapping report as a way of promoting peace and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Establish a moratorium on executions and ratify the Second Optional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>abolition of the death penalty. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Anti-Government elements should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Cease firing mortars, rockets and grenades into civilian-populated areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Cease the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of improvised 
</b></p>
<p><b>explosive devices, particularly in all areas frequented by civilians, and stop using 
</b></p>
<p><b>illegal pressure-plate devices; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Cease the deliberate targeting and killing of civilians and withdraw

<p><b>(e) </b>Apply a definition of &#8220;<b>civilian(s)</b>&#8221;<b> that is consistent with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law and prevent civilian casualties through compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, 
</b></p>
<p><b>proportionality and precautions in the context of attacks;

</b></p>
<p><b>to prevent and avoid civilian casualties and hold accountable those members who

<p><b>(g) Cease practices carried out by parallel judicial structures that impose 
</b></p>
<p><b>unlawful punishments such as killing, amputation, mutilation and beatings. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The international community should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Consider increasing support to the Government for the implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of programmes on the elimination of violence against women, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the recommendations the Committee on the Elimination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Women made in July 2013; and implement a joint monitoring
