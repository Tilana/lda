<p><b>I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, conducted an official visit to 
Bangladesh from 20 to 29 May 2013. The objective of this visit was to examine the 
situation of violence against women in the country, including violence that is perpetrated 
within the family, in the community, in institutional settings and in the transnational arena.  
</p>
<p>2. In Dhaka, the Special Rapporteur met with the Ministers of Information and Law, 
Justice and Parliamentary Affairs and held consultations with high-ranking officials of the 
Ministries of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs, Education, Health and Family Welfare, Home 
Affairs and Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs. She also met with the Chairman of the National 
Human Rights Commission, the Speaker of Parliament, the Chairman of the Bangladesh 
Law Commission and members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of the Ministry 
of Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs. She visited the Dhaka Medical Hospital, which houses 
the One-Stop Crisis Centre and the only burn unit in the country, a Government-run shelter, 
the women&#8217;s ward in the Dhaka Central Jail and a Special Tribunal on Violence against 
Women and Children. 
</p>
<p>3. During her visits to Chittagong, Rangamati, Khulna and Jessore, the Special 
Rapporteur met with local authorities, including the District Commissioner of Jessore and 
the Deputy Commissioner of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as well as police authorities. She 
met with representatives of civil society, including women&#8217;s organizations, and 
representatives of United Nations Agencies and heard testimonies from a number of women 
in Jessore at a shelter run by a non-governmental organization (NGO). 
4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her appreciation to all her interlocutors, 
including State authorities, civil society and United Nations representatives. Most 
importantly, she wishes to acknowledge the individual women who shared their personal 
experiences of violence and survival with her. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to a 
fruitful dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on the implementation of her 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Manifestations of violence against women  
</b></p>
<p>5. Inequality and power imbalances between men and women are among the root 
causes of violence against women in the country. This is underpinned by the persistence of 
patriarchal attitudes towards women, as well as stereotypical views regarding their roles 
and responsibilities. More than one third of men and women in Bangladesh reportedly 
believe that wifebeating is justified in specific circumstances.1 In addition, the 
misinterpretation of religion is also often used to discriminate and/or justify acts of violence 
against women.2   
</p>
<p>6. Many women in Bangladesh face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, 
including women with disabilities, indigenous and minority women, and migrant workers. 
Regrettably, comprehensive disaggregated data on all forms of violence against women is 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>still largely unavailable in Bangladesh,3 despite widespread acknowledgement that violence 
against women is of serious concern across the country. </p>
<p><b> A. Violence against women in the family 
</b></p>
<p>7. Domestic violence in all its manifestations is the most pervasive form of violence 
against women, with an estimated 60 per cent of married women reported having ever 
experienced violence at the hands of a spouse and/or in-laws.4 As part of the Demographic 
and Health Survey5 that was conducted in 2007, women were asked if they had experienced 
one of the following forms of physical or sexual violence by their husbands: being pushed, 
shaken or have something thrown at them; being slapped, having their arms twisted or their 
hair pulled; being punched with a fist or an object; being kicked, dragged or beaten up; 
being choked or burned; being threatened with a gun or a knife; or being physically forced 
to have sexual intercourse. Overall, 24 per cent of respondents reported having experienced 
some of these forms of violence in the 12 months prior to the survey, with 19 per cent 
reporting violence of a physical nature and 10 per cent reporting sexual violence.6 
</p>
<p>8. Dowry-related violence and killings reportedly remain prevalent across Bangladesh. 
During the first eight months of 2013, civil society organizations reported 327 cases of 
dowry-related violence suffered by women and girls. Of this total, 208 included physical 
abuse, 110 were murder cases, and in 9 cases the victims committed suicide. These cases do 
not include instances in which women&#8217;s children or other relatives were the victims of such 
dowry-related violence.7 Dowry demands are usually settled at the time of marriage; 
however, some men and their families continue to make dowry demands throughout the 
marriage. Women who are unable to satisfy those demands suffer threats of abandonment, 
beatings, cigarette burns, deprivation of food and medicine, acid attacks and, in some cases, 
death. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that a majority of the cases on violence 
against women that are brought to court deal with dowry-related violence.   
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur also received information indicating a link between 
women&#8217;s greater access to independent sources of finance, such as paid employment or 
microcredit, and violence against women. Despite the overall benefits of women&#8217;s access to 
these financial resources, it has been argued that microcredit has also worked against 
women&#8217;s solidarity and contributed heavily to the &#8220;inflation&#8221; of dowry. As money has 
become more easily available to brides&#8217; families, women are increasingly sent home by 
their husbands or in-laws to persuade parents to borrow money, either for investment or for 
consumption. While, in theory, microfinance institutions would not lend money for the 
purposes of dowry payment, it is reported that in practice most village families do depend 
on microcredit to meet dowry demands.8   
</p>
<p>10. Despite being outlawed through the adoption of the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 
1929, early marriage remains a major problem. According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF), 66 per cent of Bangladeshi girls are married before the age of 18 and

</b></p>
<p>approximately one third of women aged 20 to 24 were married by the age of 15.9 The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that in rural areas, some parents feel compelled to marry 
off their girl children as a &#8220;protective measure&#8221; against rape, and they resort to obtaining 
fake birth certificates to escape penalties for violating the law.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women in the community 
</b></p>
<p>11. The prevalence of acid attacks remains problematic in the country, and these attacks 
occur within both the family and the community spheres. Civil society organizations 
reported 31 cases of acid violence in Bangladesh between January and August 2013. Of this 
total, 22 attacks were against adult women and 4 against girls. Likewise, in 2012, women 
and girls were the main victims of acid violence, with 58 women and 20 girls being targeted 
out of a total of 105 cases.10 Acid is generally thrown on the face or sexual organs of female 
victims when demands for sex or marriage proposals are refused. The ultimate aim is to 
damage the victim&#8217;s appearance in order to destroy her marriage prospects.    
</p>
<p>12. Rape is currently the second most commonly acknowledged form of violence 
against women and girls in Bangladesh, yet victims seldom seek legal redress. The Special 
Rapporteur received reports referring to 661 cases of rape during the first eight months of 
2013, 281 of which involved adult women victims and 367 cases concerning child victims, 
including girls. Of these, 188 involved gang rape, 49 resulted in the murder of the victim, 
and in 5 cases, the victims committed suicide following the rape.11  
</p>
<p>13. Rape was raised as a major source of concern among women with whom the Special 
Rapporteur spoke. In some cases, rape is also used as a weapon to weaken or harm rival 
communities or groups. The Special Rapporteur heard testimonies of ongoing violence and 
rape of indigenous women by Bengali settlers in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.  
</p>
<p>14. Different forms of sexual harassment prevail in the country. According to 
interviewees, girls are regularly abused or harassed in school or on their way to school. 
Sexual harassment is also commonplace in various working environments and is sometimes 
justified as being &#8220;part of the culture&#8221;, by both State and non-State actors.  
15. Many women seek redress through the traditional justice system, also known as the 
<i>salish</i> system. This may result in double victimization for them, as often they obtain little or 
no remedy for violations. In addition, they may be subjected to beating, whipping and 
stoning following <i>fatwa</i> rulings that are commonly used to subordinate women by 
punishing behaviour that is deemed inappropriate or immoral. Such punishments have 
reportedly led many women to commit suicide. According to one NGO, of 21 cases they 
documented in 2013 of violence against women instigated by <i>salish</i> or <i>fatwa</i>, three cases 
resulted in suicide. These <i>fatwa</i> rulings included punishments such as lashes, &#8220;social 
boycotting&#8221;, and forced marriage/divorce.12 The Special Rapporteur was informed that the 
High Court Division has repeatedly ordered a stop to illegal punishments such as whipping, 
lashing and public humiliations, holding that these types of punishments are cruel,

<p>inhumane and degrading.13 The Court also held that <i>fatwas</i> are not binding and cannot be 
enforced. However, these punishments still persist and many women have been driven to 
commit suicide after being subjected to <i>fatwa</i> punishments. 14 16. The Special Rapporteur also received information indicating high levels of violence 
against women from religious and ethnic minority communities, with Dalits, Hindus and 
indigenous groups most at risk.15 Persecution of minorities includes rape and sexual assault 
of women in these communities.16 The rate of rape is higher for minority women in 
Bangladesh because they are considered &#8220;double infidels&#8221; for being women and also for 
being part of a religious minority.17 They are also commonly victims of <i>salish</i>/<i>fatwa</i>-related 
violence.  </p>
<p>17. Community violence is also reportedly perpetrated against representatives of 
women&#8217;s rights organizations and other human rights organizations working on women&#8217;s 
rights. Women human rights defenders are targeted not only because they defend the rights 
of women, but also because they are women themselves. While reclaiming their rights or 
the rights of their communities, women human rights defenders are commonly perceived as 
challenging accepted sociocultural norms, traditions, perceptions and stereotypes about 
femininity and the role and status of women in society.18 In Bangladesh, human rights 
defenders commonly face harassment and/or slander by the community or by State officials 
because of their activism. The abuse ranges from verbal assaults to slander campaigns in 
the press, administrative harassment and even sexual harassment. The Special Rapporteur 
was informed that most of these violations remain unpunished.19 </p>
<p><b> C. Violence perpetrated and/or condoned by the State 
</b></p>
<p>18. The main manifestations of violence perpetrated and/or condoned by the State 
include custodial violence and violence in militarized zones.   
</p>
<p>19. During the visit to the women&#8217;s ward in the Dhaka Central Jail, the Special 
Rapporteur noted shortcomings in the conditions of detention, especially with regard to 
detainees&#8217; access to health care and hygiene. She was informed that incarcerated women 
did not have adequate legal representation or contact with their families. The lack of 
privacy resulting from the overcrowded facilities, and also the overt scrutiny by the 
authorities, make it difficult to hold confidential meetings, including during the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur. Nevertheless, she heard various testimonies from women, including 
those on death row. In the latter category, the interviews reflect incarceration for crimes 
that do not amount to &#8220;the most serious crimes&#8221; under applicable international standards. 
They also revealed deficiencies in the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of 
those facing the death penalty.

<p>20. The Chittagong Hill Tracts remain a highly militarized region despite the existing 
peace accord of 1997 between the Government and the indigenous peoples&#8217; political party, 
Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti.20 Among other things, the peace accord provides 
for a phased withdrawal of all temporary camps and the transfer of power to civilian 
authorities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. Interlocutors alleged that since 2007, most 
incidents of sexual violence have reportedly been perpetrated by Bengali settlers, who are 
seldom prosecuted for such crimes. The Special Rapporteur sought to examine the 
prevalence of other manifestations of violence against women, particularly intracommunity, 
but she did not receive any information on this issue during her visit. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against women in the transnational sphere 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur received reports of human rights violations, including 
violence against women, occurring in the Kutupalong refugee camp, which houses the 
Rohingya community near Cox&#8217;s Bazar. Regrettably, the Special Rapporteur was denied 
access to the camp by Government authorities, thus preventing her from assessing the 
situation directly, including through interactions with women residents of the camp.  
</p>
<p>22. According to sources, violence against women remains prevalent in the official 
refugee camps, with more than 70 per cent of reported cases relating to domestic violence. 
Other reported cases include rape, attempted rape, child marriage, forced prostitution and 
trafficking. Further, refugee women living in the camps are not allowed to leave home 
without their husbands&#8217; permission and have fewer opportunities than men to participate in 
social activities; many girls who reach puberty are removed from school for marriage 
purposes. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned at the high number of people living 
under adverse conditions in makeshift camps, and notes the lack of data as regards these 
camps.21  
</p>
<p>23. Trafficking in persons continues to be a major problem, with Bangladesh being 
mainly a source country for men, women and children subjected to forced labour and sexual 
exploitation. Given the reluctance of victims&#8217; families to report cases of trafficking, it is 
difficult to access comprehensive data and statistics on the magnitude of the phenomenon.  
Estimates from various sources state that over 200,000 women and children have been 
trafficked during the past decade, with trafficking occurring both internally and across the 
border with neighbouring countries, under the guise of a better life and job opportunities.22  
24.  A conservative estimate reflects that there are approximately 7.7 million 
Bangladeshi migrants worldwide.23 In 2011, it was estimated that 5.4 per cent of the 
migrant population was female.24 Many women migrate to the Middle East through regular 
and irregular channels in search of better employment opportunities, but most of them are 
employed as domestic workers. They suffer various forms of abuse both during the process 
of migration and upon arrival, including domestic servitude, sexual harassment, physical 
mistreatment, withholding of payments and threats of denunciation of their irregular status.

  According to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (<i>Militarization in the Chittagong 
</i></p>
<p><i>Hill Tracts, Bangladesh: the Slow Demise of the Region&#8217;s Indigenous Peoples</i> (Copenhagen, 2012)), 
there are reportedly around 50,000 to 60,000 armed personnel still stationed in the region.

<p>The Special Rapporteur heard testimonies from female migrant workers who had been 
subjected to ill-treatment and corporal punishment in the destination country. Some young 
women were reported to have been sent back home after becoming pregnant as a result of 
sexual violence. Others returned to Bangladesh without receiving their full salaries or 
access to remedies for violations experienced.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Implications of inequality, discrimination and violence for 
the realization of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>25. Throughout Bangladesh, women and girls are prevented from fully enjoying their 
human rights both in law and in practice due to inequality and discrimination. Often, they 
are denied access to effective participation in all spheres of life. They are also denied 
education and employment opportunities and quality health services, and are subjected to 
all kinds of violence and abuse.  
</p>
<p>26. The adoption and/or review of legislation to ensure conformity with international 
human rights principles and standards is a welcome step. Unfortunately, law reforms will 
yield little positive results if the root causes of the diverse manifestations of violence 
against women and persisting stereotypes are not addressed, including through legal, 
political and social transformation efforts.   
</p>
<p> A<b>. Civil and political rights  
</b></p>
<p>27. In Bangladesh, women&#8217;s access to justice and participation in political and public 
life are particularly affected by violence against women.   
</p>
<p>28. Some measures have been put in place towards the empowerment of women and to 
increase women&#8217;s political participation. For example, at the executive and legislative 
levels, the positions of Prime Minister, Speaker of Parliament, Leader of the Opposition 
and Foreign Minister are held by women. A number of mid-level positions in Government 
are occupied by women. Furthermore, the Fifteenth Amendment Act of 2011 increased the 
number of seats reserved for women in Parliament from 45 to 50. However, out of a total of 
350 seats available in Parliament, women only hold 70 seats, a mere 20 per cent. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that women are not sufficiently represented at the district 
and subdistrict levels. Also, once in office, female representatives often face discrimination 
from their male counterparts.  
</p>
<p>29. Personal status and family law, which are core to women&#8217;s citizenship rights 
including their effective participation in public life, continue to discriminate against women 
and girls with respect to marriage, divorce, separation, guardianship, maintenance, adoption 
and succession. These personal status laws include both codified and uncodified rules, 
many of which were inherited from the colonial era.25 There are also a number of 
discriminatory civil laws that are applicable to all religious communities in the context of 
marriage or divorce, such as the Special Marriage Act of 1872, the Child Marriage 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25
  The key codified laws governing marriage and divorce in Bangladesh include, for Muslims:  the 
</p>
<p>Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (1961), the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act (1939) and the 
Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act (1974); for Hindus and Buddhists: the Hindu 
Married Women&#8217;s Right to Separate Residence and Maintenance Act (1946); and for Christians: the 
Christian Marriage Act (1872) and the Divorce Act (1869). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Restraint Act of 1929, the Family Courts Ordinance of 1985 and the Guardian and Wards 
Acts of 1890.26 
</p>
<p>30. Generally speaking, personal status laws in Bangladesh are discriminatory against 
women. Polygamy is allowed within both Muslim and Hindu/Buddhist personal laws. 
Personal laws governing both Christians and Muslims set out unequal divorce criteria for 
men and women, and laws governing Hindus/Buddhists do not allow divorce to take place. 
For women subject to any of these laws, maintenance during marriage is subject to the 
subjective conditions of &#8220;chastity&#8221; and wives being &#8220;dutiful&#8221;. Only Christian personal laws 
refer to maintenance after divorce, yet this is reportedly rarely provided in practice. 
Furthermore, none of the personal laws recognize marital property, regardless of the 
women&#8217;s contribution. For Hindu and Buddhist women, there is no mandatory marriage 
registration, leaving women in a very vulnerable position with regard to proving legitimacy 
of children, establishing rights to maintenance and/or pension, or for immigration 
purposes.27 
</p>
<p>31. As a result of these discriminatory laws, many women stay in violent marriages out 
of fear that their <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> legal status will be negatively impacted, and also that 
they will be denied financial support if they are divorced or separated.28 
</p>
<p>32. The right of access to justice and justice itself is problematic on many levels. The 
judicial system is faced with many challenges that have a negative impact on ensuring 
equal access to justice. Limited resources, poor infrastructure and the limited number of 
trained judges and lawyers, among others, have had a negative effect on women&#8217;s capacity 
to seek redress through the judicial system. Despite constitutional guarantees with regard to 
due process, the Special Rapporteur was informed that law enforcement agencies often fail 
to uphold the relevant legal standards when dealing with cases of violence against women. 
The existence of parallel legal systems such as the <i>salish</i> further compounds the denial of 
effective justice. 
33. While the Constitution stipulates that Islam is the State religion, it also provides that 
&#8220;subject to law, public order, and morality, every citizen has the right to profess, practice, 
or propagate any religion&#8221;.29 Nonetheless, conservative interpretations of religion impact on 
the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s human rights, particularly on equality and non-
discrimination rights. The 13-point demand of the Hefajat-e-Islam, a fundamentalist Islamic 
group, calling for gender segregation is of particular concern. <i>Fatwa</i> rulings also remain 
widespread throughout the country, despite the fact that in 2010, the Supreme Court 
declared that the &#8220;imposition and execution of extra-judicial penalties including those in the 
name of execution of Fatwa, is bereft of any legal pedigree and has no sanction in laws of 
the land&#8221;.30      
</p>
<p>34. Activists who work to defend human rights, including the human right of women to 
be free from discrimination and violence, face particular obstacles, including being 
abducted by members of the Bangladesh Army in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.31 Other

<p>allegations of harassment, arbitrary arrests and detention of activists have been the subject 
of a number of communications sent to the Government over the past two years by different 
Special Procedures mandate holders.32 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic rights and the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>35. Bangladesh ranks as one of the world&#8217;s most disaster-prone countries, with 97.1 per 
cent of its total area and 97.7 per cent of its population at risk of multiple hazards.33  
Despite the challenges, the Government remains committed to alleviating poverty and aims 
to become a &#8220;middle-income&#8221; country by 2021.  The number of people living in poverty in 
Bangladesh has already been reduced by 8 million in five years. 34 
</p>
<p>36. The Government of Bangladesh has taken positive steps towards the empowerment 
of women, including through the 2011 National Women&#8217;s Development Policy that seeks to 
reduce violence; eliminate discrimination; increase access to education, health and 
employment; and address the special needs of older women, women with disabilities and 
women from indigenous and marginalized communities. The Ministry of Women and 
Children is responsible for preparing a work plan for the National Women&#8217;s Development 
policy and for developing laws and policies to ensure economic empowerment and 
participation of women. It has allocated funding in its projected 2013&#8211;2014 budget for the 
policy.35 However, the estimated expenditure from 2013 to 2014 on a national action plan 
for the implementation of the policy is zero, and no portion of the Ministry&#8217;s budget was 
spent on the policy in its 2011&#8211;2012 and 2012&#8211;2013 periods. Moreover, the Ministry&#8217;s 
most recent budget report projects zero expenditure on the policy in the coming years.36  
37. The Government is currently implementing Vision 2021, which aims to make 
Bangladesh a middle-income country by 2021. The outline of the Vision 2021 plan states 
that the Government aims to achieve gender equality by addressing the poverty issues faced 
specifically by women.37 Under Vision 2021, the Government will address women&#8217;s issues 
in health, law and order, food security and economic opportunities, among other 
development areas. It also promotes gender balance in Government by introducing a 
separate quota system for women in Parliament and reserving 100 seats for women in direct 
government elections.38 Moreover, it seeks to incentivize women to pursue vocational, 
primary, secondary and tertiary education and attain the necessary training to compete

</b></p>
<p>equally in the job market.39 In implementing Vision 2021, the Government also plans to 
amend laws that discriminate against women.40 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur noted that existing schemes aimed at empowering women 
economically in Bangladesh seem to be tailored to specific sectors traditionally believed to 
be &#8220;suitable&#8221; for women, thereby perpetuating gender-biased stereotypes in employment. 
Women constitute a high proportion of unpaid family workers. For example, they work on 
family farms, in family businesses or in the household without pay.41 They often use the 
microloans to start garment, agricultural or grocery businesses, areas that are typically 
associated with women.    
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur was informed that women resorting to microcredit loans 
often face problems with regard to timely repayment, thus increasing their vulnerability to 
violence: sources indicated that people in charge of granting loans and collecting weekly 
payments often resort to violence when collecting the loans. It was argued that repayment 
creates an environment of fear and intimidation, and recipients regularly sacrifice basic 
needs to meet a sometimes inflexible repayment schedule.42 
</p>
<p>40. Women make up approximately 36 per cent of the formal labour force in 
Bangladesh.43 The 2006 Labour Act contains several provisions aimed at protecting the 
rights of workers. However, certain categories of workers, including domestic and 
agricultural workers, are not protected under this law. A very high percentage of the 
informal sector labour force is comprised of women who work mainly as domestic workers, 
in the shrimp cultivation sector and in the garment factories. The latter is a multimillion 
dollar business employing around 3 million people, 80 per cent of whom are women. Many 
stakeholders highlighted the poor working conditions under which women work, which are 
exacerbated by the lack of adequate safeguards in labour laws and regulations and which 
increase their vulnerability to abuse and exploitation.  
</p>
<p>41. Sexual harassment at work affects women&#8217;s efforts to secure livelihoods. On 14 May 
2009, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh issued specific guidelines against sexual 
harassment, which have provided a legal basis to address this form of violence until a law 
on the prevention of sexual harassment is adopted.44 The Special Rapporteur was informed 
that a draft law was prepared in 2010 by Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association 
in consultation with the Law Commission, and has been submitted to the relevant 
authorities. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the law has been at the drafting stage 
for the past three years. On 26 January 2011, the Supreme Court also declared the stalking 
of girls and women illegal, and directed the Government to use the term &#8220;sexual 
harassment&#8221; instead of the widely used term of &#8220;eve teasing&#8221;. The Court&#8217;s ruling came 
amid growing instances of stalking that have led to the suicide of many victims. 
</p>
<p>42. The migration of women to foreign countries for domestic and other labour also 
gives rise to exploitation both inside and outside of Bangladesh. It is estimated that between 
January and June 2012 alone, 375,000 workers migrated abroad, including approximately

<p>16,000 female workers.45 Remittances by migrant workers reportedly contribute to around 
13 per cent of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product, moving the Government to place 
overseas employment as one of its priorities to foster economic development. Female 
migrant workers face more problems than their male counterparts when migrating abroad. 
They are frequently abused throughout the process of migration, and continue to struggle 
upon return due to the various challenges of reintegration. They are often unable to receive 
appropriate legal representation and access to justice while abroad, because of language 
barriers among other reasons, and do not receive compensation if their rights are violated.  
</p>
<p>43. The gendered aspects of issue of forced evictions and displacement due to economic 
development projects such as dams, eco- and national parks, and military bases, were raised 
as an issue of concern.    
</p>
<p><b> C. Social and cultural rights   
</b></p>
<p>44. Women&#8217;s enjoyment of human rights is generally impacted by the social and 
cultural constructions of gender. In Bangladesh, women&#8217;s roles and status are marked by 
duties as homemakers, and more specifically as mothers. These stereotypes place women at 
a disadvantage and prevent women from fully enjoying their rights to, among others, health 
and education. They also prevent women from contributing to the overall transformation 
and development of their society.  
</p>
<p>45. The right to health has been recognized in the Constitution as one of most basic 
necessities of citizens. In the last five decades, there has been an increase in the life 
expectancy of Bangladeshi women from 46.7 years in 1960 to 69 years in 2011.46 
Bangladesh Maternal Health Services have also reported a decline in maternal mortality 
rates from 322 in 2001 to 194 in 2010 (a 5.<footnote name="5">5
  See section 375 of the 1860 Penal Code. </footnote> per cent rate of decline per year).47 
Furthermore, the proportion of women delivering in a health facility increased from 9 per 
cent in 2001, to more than 23 per cent in 2010.48 However, the Special Rapporteur remains 
concerned that maternal deaths continue to be responsible for 14 per cent of all deaths 
among Bangladeshi women of reproductive age, mostly due to post-partum haemorrhages 
and eclampsia, and to the lack of access to comprehensive medical care.49 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur notes that Bangladesh has achieved gender parity in primary 
and secondary education at the national level. This was achieved through specific 
interventions focusing on girl students, such as stipends and exemption of tuition fees for 
girls in rural areas, and the stipend scheme for girls at the secondary level. In addition, the 
Government has incorporated issues related to violence against women in its revised 
curricula and textbooks. Nonetheless, one fifth of children of primary school age (6&#8211;10) 
reportedly never attend school as a result of poverty, making them vulnerable to neglect, 
violence and exploitation. The Special Rapporteur notes that the prevailing level of 
violence against girls, including harassment by both teachers and fellow pupils in schools 
or on the way to and from school, early marriages and the absence of suitable toilets for 
girls, continue to result in high dropout rates among girls, especially in rural areas.

<p>47. Bangladesh has one of the highest child marriage rates worldwide.50 Early marriages 
have serious consequences for the health, education and development rights of girls. The 
country also has one of the lowest birth registration rates, which hinders the effective 
implementation of laws against child marriages.  
</p>
<p>48. In addition to their low social and cultural status, the persistence of patriarchal and 
harmful practices, such as the payment of dowry, also negatively impact women&#8217;s 
enjoyment of their social rights and increase their risk of experiencing violence. Dowry 
payment is one of the main sources of economic concern for families, which may force 
daughters to marry young, or to marry elderly/married men to reduce dowry payments. The 
social pressure of marrying women to equally or higher educated grooms, who require a 
higher dowry payment, is sometimes also a deterrent for families to continue with their 
daughters&#8217; education.51 A 2010 study found that the absence of dowry demand in marriages 
lowered the likelihood of physical abuse of wives in rural settings, as well as its frequency 
and severity in both rural and urban settings, compared with marriages where dowry was 
demanded and fully paid. The report also found that the non-payment of dowry increased 
the likelihood of abuse and its frequency and severity in households in which it had been 
demanded.52 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges in fulfilling the State&#8217;s obligation to act with due 
diligence to eliminate violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Government of Bangladesh has committed to protecting and promoting the 
rights of women through its ratification of numerous international human rights instruments 
and has entered reservations to articles 2 and 16.1 (c) of the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which respectively address the core 
obligation of States to eliminate discrimination under law (article 2) and eliminate 
discrimination in marriage and family relations (article 16). During the visit, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the withdrawal of those reservations was under 
consideration. Bangladesh also declared that &#8220;it would not undertake the obligations arising 
out of Articles 8 and 9 of the Optional Protocol&#8221; to the Convention, i.e. the recognition of 
the Committee&#8217;s jurisdiction to investigate &#8220;grave or systemic violations&#8221; of the 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>50. Over the past two decades numerous laws, policies and programmes have been put 
in place to address the needs of women generally, and violence against women specifically. 
These include: the Human Trafficking Deterrence and Suppression Act 2012; the Hindu 
Marriage Registration Act 2012; the National Women&#8217;s Development Policy 2011; the 
Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2010; the Citizenship Amendment Act 
2009; the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006; the Acid Crime Prevention and Acid Crime 
Control Acts 2002; and the Prevention of Women and Children Repression Act 2000. 
Despite these developments, women continue to face discrimination on the basis of sex and 
on other grounds and are unable to effectively enjoy their human rights.  
51. The National Human Rights Commission was established in 2008 under the 
National Human Rights Commission Ordinance. In the absence of an independent national 
commission on women&#8217;s rights, the Commission has a women&#8217;s cell mandated to monitor

<p>the rights of women in Bangladesh. It has launched campaigns to raise awareness on the 
issue of violence against women, and reports such campaigns as being some of their more 
successful ones.53 It has also published an extensive report analyzing the impact of the 
Higher Judiciary&#8217;s decisions on the protection of women&#8217;s rights and how the Court&#8217;s 
decisions measure against international human rights norms.54 In spite of its limited human, 
technical and financial resources, the Commission has been a key institution in shaping the 
country&#8217;s human rights discourse and providing a wide range of training to various 
institutions, state agencies, the media and the population at large. 
</p>
<p>52. Protective and preventative measures require the development of national data 
collection systems. Unfortunately, this does not exist in Bangladesh. At the central level, 
the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs compile 
statistics of cases received through their decentralized units. There is also a database on 
cases of violence against women under the Multi-Sectoral Programme on Violence against 
Women. However, those statistics do not accurately reflect the scale of the problem <i>de 
facto</i>. 
</p>
<p> A<b>. Prevention  
</b></p>
<p>53. Despite the adoption of relevant legislation, there is a general lack of awareness of 
such laws, poor implementation by state agents and a reluctance of women to use the 
justice system as a means to seek redress.   
54. The Dowry Prohibition Act adopted in 1980 prohibits dowry in all its forms and 
makes it punishable by fine, imprisonment of up to one year or both. However, in most 
cases, the perpetrators are not brought to justice for various reasons, including threats to the 
victim or her family, bribing of police officers and lack of forensic evidence. In many 
cases, victims are also persuaded to reach a compromise with the perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>55. As regards acid attacks, the Acid Crime Control Act of 2002 stipulates that the 
punishment for killing a person with acid or injuring a person resulting in the loss of vision, 
hearing, or damage or disfigurement of the face, breasts or sexual organs can result in 
capital punishment or life imprisonment and a fine not exceeding one <i>lakh taka</i> 
(approximately USD 1190). Furthermore, damage for disfigurement to any part of the body 
will result in a 14-year prison sentence or at least 7 years of &#8220;rigorous imprisonment&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>56. As regards provisions in the Penal Code, the Special Rapporteur was concerned that 
marital rape is only recognized as an offence under the Penal Code if the child bride is 
younger than 13 years old.55  
</p>
<p>57. The Suppression of Violence against Women and Children Act came into force in 
February 2000. It is intended to address the need for more effective prosecution of 
perpetrators of violence against women and children than existed previously, and provides 
redress for victims of various manifestations of violence, including trafficking and acid 
throwing. The Act makes provision for compensation for the victim, as well as remedial 
measures for negligence or wilful faults committed by an investigating officer. Other 
features of the Act include provisions for the speedy investigation and trial of cases by the

tribunals for every district town to address related cases. 
</p>
<p>58. The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act was enacted in 2010, and 
reiterates that domestic violence is a matter requiring the intervention of the State. The Act 
includes a broad definition of domestic violence that includes physical, psychological, 
economic and sexual abuse, and refers to persons who are, or have been, in a family 
relationship. The Act includes provisions for shelter homes, as well as medical and legal aid 
services for victims. It also grants Judicial Magistrates the power to award interim orders, 
such as protection orders, residential orders, maintenance orders and safe custody orders. 
The Act also includes provisions regarding the compensation of damages, a 60-day time 
period to have cases heard by a court and specific penalties for perpetrators, including 
prison terms and fines. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the remaining challenges in the 
implementation of the law, mainly the lack of awareness of its existence by both authorities 
and victims. Advocates claim that the number of cases filed under the new law actually 
diminished after the first year of its enactment, and that domestic violence cases are still 
being largely processed under other legislation such as the Penal Code or the Dowry 
Prohibition Act, thus failing to benefit from some of the provisions in the new law. 
Advocates also reiterated the urgency of enacting the rules to carry into effect the 
provisions of the Act. These rules would include practical provisions regarding, <i>inter alia</i>, 
the duties of police officers and courts in domestic violence cases, the coordination between 
different intervening authorities, and adequate case management and data collection.  
</p>
<p>60. A Central Cell on the prevention of violence against women has been set up in the 
Ministry of Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs to coordinate violence-related cases with other 
agencies.56 This Cell receives complaints from the victims, mediates conflict through 
counseling and settles monetary disputes in relation to dowry. Temporary shelters have also 
been arranged to provide support to women who have been victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>61. In terms of awareness-raising campaigns and training, the Ministry of Information&#8217;s 
Press Institute organizes training workshops for journalists on child labour, corporal 
punishment, and children and women&#8217;s development issues through its Advocacy and 
Communication for Women and Children project financed by UNICEF since 1996. The 
National Human Rights Commission has also published various awareness-raising 
materials, including a human rights training manual for the police.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection  
</b></p>
<p>62. Measures by which States can fulfill their due diligence obligation to protect women 
from violence include the provision of services such as telephone hotlines, health care, 
counselling centres, legal assistance, access to shelters, restraining orders and financial aid 
to victims.57 The Government of Bangladesh has put in place several protection measures 
over the past few years, including the One-Stop Crisis Centres, a National Trauma 
Counseling Centre and a Helpline.  
</p>
<p>63. One of the key features of the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 
2010 is the issuance of protection orders. A protection order restrains the respondent from 
committing any act of domestic violence, entering the victim&#8217;s place of employment or 
school and having any personal, written or any form of communication with the victim. In

<p><b>A/HRC/26/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>addition to protection orders, courts can also issue residence and maintenance orders.58 
Although the Act came into force in 2010, victims are often unable to benefit from it due to 
a lack of awareness of its existence; structural, institutional and procedural obstacles that 
the victims may face within the justice system; and the limited forms of services available. 
Under this Act, victims have the right to legal assistance, counselling and shelter, and are 
allowed to file compensation claims. The perpetrators of domestic violence can face up to 
six months&#8217; imprisonment and up to two years in case of multiple offences. Despite these 
provisions, victims of violence are reluctant to seek support through the justice system due 
to several factors, including community pressure and stigma, the lack of responsiveness by 
the justice system, pressure to withdraw complaints by local police and also the length of 
proceedings. The Act remains underutilized and limits the protective value of the law. 
</p>
<p>64. Active steps have been taken to redefine the police force as a service. Gender 
guidelines have been drafted for model police stations through the police reform 
programme. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the police apply a &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; 
policy when dealing with cases of violence against women. The Government has also taken 
measures to promote gender-sensitive policing and improve victim support services through 
its Police Reform Programme. In 2009, the first Victim Support Centre was established at 
Tejgaon Thana Model Police Station. The rehabilitation services are implemented by 10 
NGOs who have signed Memoranda of Agreement with the police. The establishment of 
such a centre within a policing environment has encouraged victims to report crimes to the 
police in a safe and secure environment, while accessing professional services.59 The 
Special Rapporteur was informed by officials in Rangamati that, while attempts to increase 
the recruitment of female officers have been made, there are currently only 5,000 women 
out of 14,000 police officers. The Special Rapporteur was concerned to hear male 
representatives of the police force in Khulna alleging that some victims engage in false 
reporting of incidents of rape or sexual assault in order to punish partners for refusing to 
commit to a relationship. She considers that these attitudes perpetuate stereotypes.   
</p>
<p>65. The Government of Bangladesh co-sponsors two large-scale programmes to address 
violence against women: a Multi-Sectoral Programme on Violence against Women under 
the Ministry of Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs and a Joint United Nations Programme to 
Address Violence against Women. Under the Multi-Sectoral Programme on Violence 
against Women, seven One-Stop Crisis Centres have been established in public hospitals 
where victims receive medical, psychosocial and legal assistance. There is also a National 
Trauma Counselling Centre and Helpline. The Joint United Nations Programme to Address 
Violence against Women was designed in 2008 with a view to address violence against 
women through a three-tier strategy that consists of fostering the adoption and 
implementation of policies aimed at preventing violence and protecting victims, 
encouraging societal transformation to reduce violence against women and providing a 
comprehensive assistance package for victims.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur visited the One-Stop Crisis Centre and shelter run by the 
Ministry of Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs in Dhaka. She was informed that women could 
stay in temporary shelters for a maximum period of six months with two children under 12 
years old. The Special Rapporteur, however, received complaints regarding the living 
conditions, limited freedom of movement and the overall quality of services provided in the 
shelters. The situation of children living with their mothers in these shelters is of great 
concern. The Special Rapporteur was informed of cases where children were forced out of

</p>
<p>67. In Jessore, the Special Rapporteur visited a shelter run by an NGO. She noted the 
limited availability of space to accommodate victims of violence and their families. The 
lack of availability of shelters, both State and non-State, was expressed as a major source of 
concern by a number of NGOs during the visit. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur was also concerned with the lack of guidelines to guarantee 
the protection of victims of violence in safe custody. According to NGO interviewees, in 
some criminal cases, victims are arrested together with the perpetrators and courts may 
issue a &#8220;safe custody&#8221; order through which women are placed in mixed jails. This is also 
due to the fact that at least 20 districts reportedly do not have shelters, so this form of &#8220;safe 
custody&#8221; is often resorted to. Activists indicated that jail officers even make up their own 
rules regarding the condition of these &#8220;safe custody&#8221; provisions, including the allocation of 
rooms and/or the visiting hours.  
</p>
<p>69. Protection for victims of acid attacks is covered by the Acid Control Act of 2002, 
which prescribes, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of treatment and legal aid to victims of acid 
crimes, as well as the establishment of a rehabilitation centre for victims. However, in 
practice, there is only one burn unit located in the capital, which makes it difficult for 
victims living outside of Dhaka to receive appropriate and timely medical care. Most 
victims die as a result of septicaemia caused by severe infections. The ones who survive are 
left with pain, numerous and costly medical procedures, permanent disfigurement and 
social stigma.60  
</p>
<p>70. In an effort to provide better protection for victims of trafficking, the Government 
signed the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] Convention on 
Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution in 200261 
and recently enacted the Human Trafficking Deterrence and Suppression Act of 2012. In 
addition, the Ministry of Home Affairs has set up a task force for the rescue, recovery, 
repatriation and reintegration of victims of trafficking. Although the law provides severe 
penalties for trafficking, impunity is the norm for traffickers because of a lack of 
enforcement of the existing laws and policies.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>71. In Bangladesh, the main challenges relating to the investigation, prosecution and 
punishment of perpetrators for acts of violence against women are due to the lack of: 
coordinated criminal justice response; expertise and adequate mechanisms to conduct 
credible investigations; comprehensive redress mechanisms; and understanding of the root 
causes and consequences of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>72. Corruption was also identified as one of the main obstacles to women&#8217;s access to 
justice, as bribes and/or influence are often required for cases to move through the different 
stages of the criminal justice system. Victims and their families often have to pay bribes or 
use political connections to register a complaint before the police and to have investigations 
conducted. It is not uncommon for perpetrators to have more connections, power or

</p>
<p>resources than victims, which are deployed to influence the police, stall investigations or 
harass and pressure victims to drop charges.62  
</p>
<p>73. There is reportedly also a lack of basic expertise and facilities for the conduct of 
investigations, particularly in crimes relating to sexual violence. Police officers often fail to 
collect necessary evidence or deliberately destroy it. While medical examinations are 
supposed to be completed as soon as possible after an incident of sexual violence is 
reported, delays are common in conducting medical examinations, preparing the medical 
reports and submitting them to the competent courts. Furthermore, it is reported that victims 
have no guarantees that their injuries will be properly documented and reflected in medical 
examination reports, due to factors such as the patriarchal mindset of the police and 
doctors; inefficiency; lack of modern facilities; and corruption throughout the process.63 
</p>
<p>74. In 2002, the Ministry of Health issued a circular that set out guidelines for the 
medical examination of women and children victims of rape. This circular is complemented 
by the provisions set forth in the 2000 Prevention of Women and Children Repression 
Act.64 The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the continued use of the two-finger test, also 
known as virginity testing, despite consensus that this test has no evidentiary value or 
scientific merit. These tests breach international standards on evidence gathering and 
further traumatize victims.65 The Special Rapporteur welcomes the October 2013 directive 
from the Supreme Court urging relevant authorities66 to show cause within four weeks as to 
why this test should not be declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect.   
</p>
<p>75. The coexistence of multiple legal orders also impacts on women&#8217;s access to justice 
and due process. Traditional customary practices and forums of arbitration and sentencing 
(<i>salish</i>) prevail in rural areas as an alternative to the courts, which are seen as highly 
bureaucratic, overburdened with a huge backlog of pending cases67 and costly.68 The 
imposition of punishments through the <i>salish</i> system is often public, arbitrary and 
humiliating for the victims.  
</p>
<p>76. Given the existing challenges of inaccessibility, cost and length of court procedures, 
many victims and their families have opted for alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Some 
civil society organizations have provided valuable support by offering mediation services, 
particularly to rural women who are unlikely to find justice through the criminal justice 
system or the local <i>salish</i> system. While some of these NGOs strive to ensure that ADR 
allows women&#8217;s voices to be adequately heard and their rights to upheld, this cannot be 
guaranteed in all cases, given the prevailing patriarchal and male-biased context, as well as 
the lack of sufficient gender-sensitive mediators/facilitators. Furthermore, it has been noted 
that ADR cannot help diminish domestic violence or demands for dowry, or stop

<p>perpetrators from threatening women.69 The use of ADR does not allow for the 
development of positive jurisprudence for cases of violence against women. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that a revision of the criminal procedure code was underway to 
allow the resolution of disputes through mediation by judges. 
77. A number of Special Tribunals on violence against women were established to 
monitor the implementation of the 2000 Prevention of Women and Children Repression 
Act. During her visit to the Special Tribunal on violence against women in Dhaka, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that one of the judges had been relocated and would not 
be replaced. This has had a significant impact on the number of cases being processed by 
the court. She regrets that she was refused an opportunity to engage with the judges during 
the visit. Nevertheless, she observed flaws in the protection of victims and witnesses as 
regards their right to a fair trial. Furthermore, a recent NGO research report points to major 
obstacles to justice that include stigma, lack of support, fear of reprisals and intrusive or 
discriminatory procedures during investigation and prosecution, including in the existing 
procedures for collecting medical evidence that fall short of recognized standards.70  
</p>
<p>78. As regards the judiciary, problems include a lack of accountability, severe backlogs 
of pending cases, a lack of sufficient number of judges, discriminatory and patriarchal 
attitudes, and the incorrect formulation of cases. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a 
training manual for judges and prosecutors on how to address violence against women, 
which was developed by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs and the 
Judicial Administration Training Institute, in collaboration with the International 
Organization for Migration. The manual was reportedly used by the Institute in 
implementing a number of programmes and training sessions for judges and lawyers, and 
used as a reference document by other relevant stakeholders. The initiative sought to train a 
total of 960 judges and 320 prosecutors from all the courts of Bangladesh by June 2013.71  
</p>
<p><b> D. Provision of effective remedies including reparations 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur notes that the provision of effective remedies involves 
&#8220;ensuring the rights of women to access both criminal and civil remedies and the 
establishment of effective protection, support and rehabilitation services&#8221;.72  
</p>
<p>80. Under existing legislation, compensation can be provided only to the victims who 
use the formal justice system. For instance, the Domestic Violence (Prevention and 
Protection) Act 2010 provides that the Court may &#8220;direct the respondent to return to the 
possession of the victim any immovable property, her stridhan or dower or alimony, or any 
other marital property &#8230; or valuable security to which she is entitled&#8221;. The Act further 
provides that a victim may file a claim for compensation &#8220;if there is any personal injury or 
financial loss or trauma or psychological damage &#8230; as a result of domestic violence&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>81. The involvement of victims in the design of the reparation and rehabilitative 
measures is a crucial aspect of transformative remedies. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that women living in various shelters are neither consulted nor included in the

<p>82. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur noted the extent to which members of civil 
society play a role in ensuring access to justice and to effective remedies for victims of 
violence against women. She commends these efforts, but stresses that the Government, as 
the ultimate duty-bearer, retains responsibility for the fulfilment of due diligence 
obligations.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>83. <b>The Government has undertaken a number of legal and institutional initiatives 
to meet its human rights obligations and address the situation of women and girls in 
the country. However, these have not been translated into concrete improvements in 
the lives of the majority of women who remain marginalized, discriminated against 
and at a high risk of being subjected to violence.  
</b>84. <b>Many programmes and initiatives have been set up with the technical and 
financial support of development partners and donor agencies. Unfortunately, such 
programmes have not reached the majority of the population who live outside the 
capital; and women&#8217;s access to justice and protection is still impeded by generalized 
impunity, limited access to services and shelters, lack of or insufficient legal 
representation and limited awareness of their rights. Other factors include economic 
dependency and societal reluctance to recognize numerous forms of violence against 
women as human rights violations.  
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> It is essential that holistic solutions address both the individual empowerment 
of women and the social, economic and cultural barriers that are a reality in their 
lives. 
</b></p>
