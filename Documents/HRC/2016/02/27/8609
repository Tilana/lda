<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/5 
of 24 March 2010, in which the Council reaffirmed inter alia, that the decision of Israel to 
impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and 
void, and constitute a flagrant violation of international law. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/5 
of 24 March 2010. In this resolution, the Council called upon Israel, the occupying Power, 
to comply with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and 
the Human Rights Council, in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which 
the Council decided, inter alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction 
and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without international 
legal effect, and demanded that Israel rescind forthwith its decision. The Human Rights 
Council also requested the Secretary-General to bring resolution 13/5 to the attention of all 
Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, international and 
regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations, to 
disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on this matter to the Council at its 
sixteenth session. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 August 2010, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note verbale to the Government 
of Israel referring to Human Rights Council resolution 13/5, requesting information on any 
steps taken or envisaged to be taken concerning the implementation of the relevant 
provisions of that resolution. No reply has been received at the time of the preparation of 
the present report. 
</p>
<p>3. Also on 3 August, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note 
verbale to all permanent missions drawing their attention to the same resolution and asking 
the Governments of Member States to provide information on any steps they had taken or 
envisaged taking concerning the implementation of the relevant provisions of Council 
resolution 13/5. 
</p>
<p>4. In a note verbale dated 30 August 2010 addressed to OHCHR, the Permanent 
Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations Office in Geneva strongly 
condemned Israel&#8217;s continued refusal to withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights and to 
comply with the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, particularly 
Council resolution 497 (1981).  
</p>
<p>5. The Syrian Arab Republic further condemns the decisions of the Government of 
Israel to intensify the building of settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, particularly 
the decision of the Golan Regional Council to build new tourist destinations in the occupied 
Golan with the aim of drawing more persons to Golan. Syria denounces the efforts of the 
Israeli tourism agencies to draw more settlers to Golan, in particular under the guise of 
attracting tourists in the Batihah area in the southern part of the occupied Golan Heights, 
and especially to Tall al-Sayyadin on the Eastern shore of Lake Tiberias. Syria also 
condemns the development of infrastructure and expansion of settlements by the 
occupation forces in the settlements of Eliad, Ein Zivan, Natur, Khasfin, Hadnes and Nof. 
Syria believes that such Israeli actions attest to Israel&#8217;s rejection of peace and its disregard 
for Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, the most recent of which, General 
Assembly resolution 63/97 of 5 December 2008, again called for a complete halt to Israeli 
settlement activities. 
</p>
<p>6. In its response, the Syrian Arab Republic condemns Israel&#8217;s exporting of products 
from the occupied Syrian Golan and stresses that such conduct constitutes a flagrant 
violation of Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and General Assembly resolution 
63/201 entitled &#8220;Permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied 
Syrian Golan over their natural resources&#8221;. Syria calls on United Nations Member States to 
reject such products and to put pressure on the Government of Israel to comply with its 
obligations in that regard under international law.  </p>


<p>7. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic emphasizes the responsibility of the 
United Nations to put pressure on Israel to release Syrian detainees in Israeli prisons and 
withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights. Syria calls upon the international community 
to put pressure on Israel to annul its decision barring family visits by citizens from the 
occupied Syrian Golan to Syria through the Qunaitra crossing. In addition to the 
psychological and physical suffering of Syrian citizens, Syria maintains, this also violates 
international humanitarian law. Syria stresses that Israeli practices in the occupied Syrian 
Golan exceed legal and moral boundaries. The most recent example of this is the 
imposition by the Israeli authorities of a two-year house arrest on a two-year-old child, 
Fahid Lu&#8217;ay Shuqeir, who was born outside Israel while his parents were students in the 
Syria. 
</p>
<p>8. Finally, the Syrian Arab Republic underscores its support for the General Assembly 
resolution 63/30, entitled &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221;, and calls upon the international community to put 
pressure on Israel to withdraw from the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including 
Jerusalem, and to comply with Security Council resolution 478 (1980), in which the 
Council determined that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by 
Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status 
of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and, in particular, the &quot;basic law&quot; on Jerusalem, are null and 
void and must be rescinded. 
</p>
<p>9. In a note verbale dated 30 August 2010, the Government of Argentina expressed its 
support for United Nations resolutions concerning the situation in the occupied Golan 
Heights. In this context, it calls for Israel&#8217;s strict observance of international law and 
relevant United Nations resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 497 (1981). In 
addition, Argentina maintains the principle of inadmissibility of annexation of territory by 
force, in accordance with Council resolution 242 (1967). Argentina further expresses the 
view that the conflict between Syria and Israel should be resolved peacefully and calls on 
Israel to fully comply with Human Rights Council resolution 13/5, particularly in light of 
the relevant General Assembly resolutions on this matter. Finally, Argentina affirms that it 
does not recognize legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken 
by Israel that seek to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan.  
</p>
<p>10. On 20 October 2010, the Permanent Mission of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea to the United Nations Office at Geneva replied to the note verbale, denouncing the 
human rights violations in the occupied Syrian Golan and stating that it considers all 
legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel that seek 
to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan to be null and void and 
with no legal effect. The Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea also 
demands the immediate withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Golan Heights.
