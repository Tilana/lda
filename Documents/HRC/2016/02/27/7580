<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. On 13 June 2013, the Human Rights Council adopted its resolution 23/9, in which it 
requested the Advisory Committee to submit a research-based report to the Council, at its 
twenty-sixth session being held in June 2014, on the issue of the negative impact of 
corruption on the enjoyment of human rights, and to make recommendations on how the 
Council and its subsidiary bodies should consider this issue. 
</p>
<p>2. During its eleventh session, on 16 August 2013, the Advisory Committee 
established a drafting group composed of Mr. Saeed Mohamed Al Faihani, Ms. Laurence 
Boisson de Chazournes, Mr. Mario L. Coriolano, Mr. Latif H&#252;seynov, Mr. Alfred 
Ntunduguru Karokora, Mr. Obiora Chinedu Okafor, Ms. Katharina Pabel (Rapporteur), 
Ms. Anantonia Reyes Prado, Mr. Dheerujlall Seetulsingh, Mr. Ahmer Bilal Soofi and 
Mr. Imeru Tamrat Yigezu (Chairperson). The Committee tasked the drafting group with the 
preparation of the said report. 
</p>
<p>3. At the same session of the Advisory Committee, the drafting group developed a 
questionnaire, in accordance with Council resolution 23/9, which was disseminated to 
different stakeholders and had a deadline of 31 October 2013. On 30 October 2013, the 
deadline for submission of responses was extended to 14 November 2013. As at 4 February 
2014, a total of 72 responses had been received: 37 from States, 17 from national human 
rights institutions, 13 from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or civil society, and 5 
from international or regional organizations or academic institutions. 
</p>
<p>4. At its twelfth session, held from 24 to 28 February 2014, the Advisory Committee 
and the drafting group discussed, in both public and private meetings, the &#8220;Preliminary 
research-based report on the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human 
rights&#8221; (A/HRC/AC/12/CRP.3), which had been prepared in the intersessional period by 
Ms. Pabel, the rapporteur of the drafting group. During the public discussion, a number of 
members of the Committee as well as States and other stakeholders made comments on the 
preliminary draft of the report. The Advisory Committee was encouraged to continue its 
work on the draft report, including by providing useful recommendations therein. On the 
basis of the discussions of the thirteenth session of the Committee, the draft report was 
further developed. 
</p>
<p><b> II. What is corruption? 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definition of corruption and scope of the current study 
</b></p>
<p>5. To this day, there is no single, consistent and recognized definition of corruption at 
the international level. Remarkably, even the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption1 does not provide a definition of corruption, even though the purpose of this 
Convention is specifically to promote and strengthen measures to prevent and combat 
corruption more efficiently and effectively, and to promote and support international 
cooperation in the prevention of and fight against corruption.2 One very common approach 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The United Nations Convention against Corruption entered into force in 2005. See 
</p>
<p>http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/Publications/Convention/08-50026_E.pdf. 
 
</p>
<p>2
 See article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. </p>


<p>to the notion of &#8220;corruption&#8221; is the definition proposed by Transparency International.3 
According to that definition, corruption is &#8220;the abuse of entrusted power for private gain&#8221;.4 
On the one hand, this is a rather broad definition which encompasses a wide range of 
different behaviours. Unlike the provisions of criminal law, which determine specific 
offences, the above-mentioned definition is more open. On the other hand, it has been 
argued that the notion of all three elements of the definition, that is to say &#8220;abuse&#8221;, 
&#8220;entrusted power&#8221; and &#8220;for private gain&#8221;, can lead to the exclusion of conducts that should 
be characterized as corruption too. For instance, the use (or abuse) of illegally claimed 
power can lead to corruption. Therefore, even this rather broad definition can be too narrow 
in respect of specific forms of misbehaviour that should also be regarded as corruption. 
</p>
<p>6. The drafting group did not deem it necessary for the purposes of this report to 
develop a clear-cut definition of corruption. Instead, it decided to look at the link between 
corruption and the enjoyment of human rights, for which purpose it focused on the results 
of the conduct. Moreover, the development of a definition of corruption did not fall within 
the scope of the request of the Human Rights Council to the Advisory Committee, which 
was to prepare a report on the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Different categories of corruption 
</b></p>
<p>7. Even though there is no overall agreed definition of corruption, different forms of 
corruption have been recognized. When looking at corruption from a human rights 
perspective, it is interesting to differentiate between corruption by the State (corruption in 
the public sector) and corruption by non-State entities (corruption in the private sector).5 
Corruption in the public sector can occur in government, in administration, in the 
legislature and in the judiciary. In these contexts, it is clear that the State is responsible for 
any violation of human rights resulting from the conduct of persons acting in their public 
capacity. Furthermore, the State can also be responsible for human rights violations caused 
by corruption in the private sector. The duty of States to protect against human rights 
violations obliges States to protect people and consequently requires States to prevent 
human rights violations by third parties. According to this dimension of human rights, 
States must act (and not only refrain from violating human rights) in order to fulfil their 
human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>8. Recognition of these two categories should not obscure the fact that corruption also 
takes place in international or global settings. In parallel to the two above-mentioned 
categories, corruption at the international level occurs in international organizations and in 
transnational business enterprises. In the first case, international organizations and their 
member States are responsible for the conduct of the organization, and especially for any 
resulting violation of human rights. It is more difficult to establish responsibility of specific 
States for corruption occurring within the transnational business sector. On the one hand, 
each State is responsible for fulfilling its obligations resulting from human rights treaties or 
from national constitutional orders. Hence, it has to combat corruption committed by 
transnational business enterprises acting on its territory. On the other hand, it is quite clear 
that combating corruption in transnational business enterprises adequately and effectively

<p>requires transnational and international efforts. The Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; 
Framework,6 which were aimed at ensuring the implementation of human rights in relation 
to business entities, failed to draw the link between business, human rights and corruption. 
Consequently, the human rights approach to corruption established in the present report can 
add a new aspect to the existing guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b> III. In what respect does corruption have a negative impact 
on the enjoyment of human rights? 
</b>9. A link between human rights and corruption can be established in two different 
ways: 
</p>
<p>(a) There can be a violation of human rights through a corrupt act; 
(b) There can be a violation of human rights through anti-corruption measures. 
</p>
<p>10. Although it is important not to forget the second aspect (the violation of human 
rights through anti-corruption measures), especially if instruments of criminal prosecution 
are applied in combating corruption, the report &#8212; in line with the request by the Human 
Rights Council &#8212; focuses on the first aspect. 
</p>
<p>11. As a result of developments over the past years, it has now been clearly established 
that impairment of the enjoyment of human rights is among the negative impacts of 
corruption. For example, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) stated in November 2013: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In recent years, United Nations and regional organizations have increasingly 
recognized the negative impacts of corruption on the enjoyment of human rights.&#8221;7 
</p>
<p>12. As corruption can occur in many forms and contexts, it is nearly impossible to 
identify all of the human rights that can be violated by corruption. To give some examples: 
If there is corruption in the education sector, the right to education can be violated. If there 
is corruption in the judiciary, the right to access to court and the right to a fair trial can be 
violated. If there is corruption in the health sector or the social welfare sector, the right to 
access to medical service or the right to food can be violated (among others). Moreover, the 
principle of non-discrimination can be affected if a person has to bribe someone in order to 
get a public merit or access to a public service. It is difficult to find a human right that 
cannot be violated by corruption. 
</p>
<p>13. This view is supported by many of the responses to the questionnaire, by different 
stakeholders. The responses make it clear that corruption has a negative impact on the 
enjoyment of human rights. They show that a wide range of human rights can be violated 
by corruption. These include economic and social rights, such as the right to work, the right 
to food, the right to housing, the right to health, the right to education, and the right to 
public services; the right to development; and the principle of non-discrimination; as well 
as civil and political rights, such as the right to a fair trial and the right to public 
participation. The responses to the questionnaire indicate that nearly every human right can

<p>issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises (see the annex to 
the final report of the Special Representative to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/17/31)) and were 
endorsed by the Council in its resolution 17/4 of 16 June 2011.

<p>be affected by corruption; this point is highlighted in the OHCHR response to the 
questionnaire. 
</p>
<p>14. As States have different kinds of obligations resulting from their human rights 
commitments, it is useful to classify the possible violations of human rights caused by 
corruption according to the different obligations imposed on States: 
</p>
<p>(a) Firstly, corruption can concern individuals (individual negative impact). 
There is often a direct violation of the human rights of the individual who is affected by 
corruption. Depending on the context in which corruption occurs, a wide range of different 
human rights can be violated. Corruption frequently results in discriminatory access to 
public services.8 The impact on an individual can also be the result of an indirect effect 
from corruption. For example, if public authorities illegally allow the deforestation of land 
in return for a bribe, then the right to food, the right to housing and the right to health of the 
people living in the area concerned may be violated; 
</p>
<p>(b) Secondly, corruption can concern specific, identifiable groups of individuals 
(collective negative impact). This category includes the effects of corruption that not only 
affect individuals but also impact upon groups of individuals. For example, corruption can 
exclude the poor from access to goods and services offered by the administration, or from 
access to justice. Or, coming back to the example mentioned above, illegal deforestation 
may affect specific ethnic minorities living in the areas concerned. It can be concluded that 
marginalized groups such as women, children, persons with disabilities, the elderly, 
the poor or people belonging to ethnic minorities are particularly affected by corruption. 
This is especially true in relation to access to public services and welfare, which is often of 
tremendous importance for people belonging to disadvantaged groups. In its statement 
made in November 2013, OHCHR cites the undermining of access to justice for 
disadvantaged groups as an example of the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment 
of human rights.9 Sometimes, corruption is only one element of a human rights violation or 
one factor aggravating an already existing human rights violation concerning specific 
groups. For example, if the right to education for marginalized groups is already limited 
due to discriminatory access requirements, the demand of an official to pay a bribe 
aggravates the human rights violation. Another example is persons deprived of their liberty 
who can be victims of corruption and at the same time of torture or other inhumane 
treatment; 
</p>
<p>(c) Thirdly, corruption can concern society at large (general negative impact). 
This means that in addition to the effect that corruption has on individuals or groups, there 
are also negative impacts upon society at large, whether this is in a national or an 
international sense. There are two main aspects that are frequently mentioned in discussions 
of the negative impact of corruption on human rights.10 The first aspect relates to the 
financial and economic resources that are affected by corruption. Corrupt practices divert 
funds from development and therefore imply a reallocation of funds that may interfere with 
the effective enforcement of human rights, especially for vulnerable people. Corruption 
reduces the resources available for the progressive realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights (and therefore undermines States&#8217; obligations under article 2 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). The aims of eradicating 
poverty and providing for sustainable development, as general targets of human rights, are

<p>10
 These aspects are also discussed in the OHCHR response to the questionnaire. </p>


<p>on the verge of being missed. The second aspect relates to the realization of democracy and 
the implementation of the rule of law. If the authorities of a State are pervaded by 
corruption, the people&#8217;s confidence in the government, and eventually in the democratic 
order and the rule of law, is undermined. 
</p>
<p>15. Another approach to classifying types of corruption is to differentiate between active 
and passive corruption. This distinction is discussed, for example, in the commentaries on 
the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business 
Transactions,11 which is sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD). Active corruption means spending money or providing other 
benefits to achieve undue advantages, whereas passive corruption refers to the receipt of 
money or other benefits as an undue advantage. The distinction between offering bribes and 
taking bribes is very clear. Nevertheless, it is doubtful that this distinction may be helpful 
from a human rights perspective. The focus of this report is on the negative impact of 
corruption on the enjoyment of human rights and therefore it has a victim-oriented 
approach. In cases of corruption, it can be difficult to determine whether the victim has 
taken part in the corrupt act actively or passively. It is even possible that the victim has 
stood outside the corrupt agreements. For example, where people are forced to pay to 
access public services, those who pay bribes are active in corruption but they are also 
victims. For this reason, the OECD anti-bribery convention does not use the term &#8220;active 
bribery&#8221;, in order to avoid it being misunderstood as implying that the briber has taken the 
initiative and the recipient is a passive victim. It is more useful to determine which party is 
the victim in a corrupt setting. In many cases, this can be determined by examining the 
distribution of power between the parties to the corrupt agreement. Typically, the less 
powerful or even oppressed party will be the victim. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. What is the value in linking corruption and its negative 
impact with the enjoyment of human rights? 
</b>16. Corruption is mainly dealt with in a criminal perspective.12 Anti-corruption measures 
&#8212; in the national and the international contexts &#8212; primarily concentrate on the prosecution 
of the related criminal offences. International anti-corruption treaties encourage or even 
oblige the signing States to undertake efforts within their legal order to criminalize certain 
kinds of behaviour defined as corruption. However the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption and regional conventions against corruption include preventive measures (e.g. 
accountability, transparency, and access to public information) that member States are 
obliged to promote. Without disregarding these efforts, anti-corruption measures are 
focused on consideration of criminal offences, the necessary sanctions and international 
cooperation in prosecution. Situating anti-corruption measures within the criminal law 
narrows the perspective to the perpetrators. The purpose of a criminal proceeding is &#8212; 
roughly speaking &#8212; to determine who the person is who is responsible for the offence. 
Focusing criminal proceedings on the perpetrator can lead to a loss of focus on the victim 
of the corruption. The position of those affected by corruption is not very strong in criminal

vol. 17, pp. 197&#8211;219 (200) (Brill and Nijhoff, 2013). </p>


<p>proceedings. Furthermore, the criminal approach does not offer ways of addressing the 
structural problems caused by corruption. It is concentrated, by its very nature, on the single 
offence, and typically cannot deliver the collective impact and the general impact referred 
to in this report. 
</p>
<p>17. Corruption can also be combated by applying remedies from private law. This 
approach is quite common among States. In international law, the Civil Law Convention on 
Corruption, which was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1999,13 deals, inter alia, with 
compensation for damage, liability, the validity of contracts and the protection of 
employees, and therefore focuses on the consequences of corruption in private law. One 
distinction between the criminal law approach and the private law approach in the fight 
against corruption is that the latter addresses the impact of corruption on the person 
concerned and aims to obtain compensation. 
</p>
<p>18. A human rights perspective on the impact of corruption can add an approach that 
moves the victims to the centre of the fight against corruption. It does so by highlighting the 
negative impacts that corruption brings to the individual concerned, to groups of individuals 
typically affected by corruption (which are very often marginalized groups), and to society 
at large. Linking corruption and human rights can show the social implications &#8212; the 
effects that corruption has on human lives. It can help people to make connections between 
corruption and problems that they suffer from in their lives, and can be an important way of 
making corruption a public issue. In this way, the social impact of corruption is made 
visible; it generates awareness in society about the consequences of this scourge and creates 
new alliances in the fight against corruption. 
</p>
<p>19. Moreover, the human rights perspective on the negative impact of corruption reveals 
that the State bears ultimate responsibility for corruption. This responsibility means, as a 
first step, abstaining from corruption in order to avoid human rights violations. As a second 
step, the State&#8217;s responsibility with regard to human rights means reacting to the negative 
impact of corruption in order to fulfil human rights obligations. In the latter context, 
criminal prosecution is one instrument in combating corruption and its negative impact on 
the enjoyment of human rights. Criminal prosecution is, however, not an effective 
instrument for resolving the negative consequences of corruption for the individual, for 
specific groups or for society in general. Consequently, the human rights perspective on the 
negative impact of corruption emphasizes the State&#8217;s obligation to take measures against 
the negative effects of corruption. Furthermore, preventive measures against corruption are 
strengthened by combining them with human rights. By integrating a human rights 
perspective into anti-corruption strategies, it also becomes an obligation to implement 
preventive policies in areas such as transparency, affidavits, laws on access to public 
information and external controls. 
</p>
<p>20. Corruption can lead to a human rights violation directly or indirectly. Corruption 
may directly violate a human right when a corrupt act is deliberately used as a means to 
violate a right or when a State acts or fails to act in a way that prevents individuals from 
enjoying that particular right. In other situations, corruption will be an essential factor 
contributing to a chain of events that eventually leads to the violation of a right. In this case, 
the right is violated by an act that derives from a corrupt act, and the act of corruption is a 
necessary condition for the violation. This situation will arise, for example, if public 
officials allow the illegal importation of toxic waste from other countries in return for a 
bribe, and that waste is placed in, or close to, a residential area. The rights to life and health 
of residents of that area would be violated, indirectly, as a result of the bribery.14 Another

<p>example is the situation of prisoners who are forced to pay bribes in order to avoid ill-
treatment or to enjoy good conditions of detention; this kind of corruption affects a whole 
group indirectly. 
</p>
<p>21. Furthermore, there are parallels between the main anti-corruption principles (such as 
participation, transparency, access to information, and accountability) and the scope of 
human rights (such as freedom of expression and freedom of the media, access to 
information, and the principle of non-discrimination). Therefore, strengthening the 
enjoyment of human rights in general, and of specific political rights and the principle of 
non-discrimination in particular, is a valuable instrument in combating corruption. Whereas 
combating corruption through criminal law and private law means taking repressive and 
remedial measures, the promoting and strengthening of human rights is a preventative anti-
corruption measure. 
</p>
<p>22. The need to integrate preventative measures into efforts against corruption has been 
clearly emphasized. Furthermore, promoting and strengthening human rights can, in the 
long term, contribute to a well-informed and emancipated civil society that is more and 
more able to reject corruption in every form and in all circumstances. According to 
OHCHR: &#8220;An efficient anti-corruption strategy must be informed by key human rights 
principles. An independent judiciary, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, access to 
information, transparency in the political system and accountability are essential both for 
successful anti-corruption strategies and for the enjoyment of human rights.&#8221;15 
</p><p>23. The linkage between anti-corruption measures and human rights can also promote 
access to human rights mechanisms to combat corruption. A wide range of mechanisms 
exists for monitoring compliance with human rights at the national, regional and 
international levels. By drawing a link between acts of corruption and violations of human 
rights, new opportunities for litigation or monitoring can be identified.16 
</p>
<p>24. Combining strategies from the fight against corruption with strategies for the 
promotion of human rights can have a dual effect. On the one hand, human rights can form 
a part of an anti-corruption strategy via the use of human rights mechanisms. On the other 
hand, combating corruption is, in itself, a way of preventing human rights violations. By 
promoting the elements of good governance (such as political rights, transparency and 
accountability), human rights and anti-corruption efforts can be mutually reinforcing.17 For 
example, the ability to promote and protect civil and political rights rests upon effectively 
combating political and judicial corruption (and vice versa). Transparency and access to 
information empower individuals to make informed decisions &#8212; from exercising their 
voting rights, to monitoring State expenditure. At the same time, creating such openness 
limits opportunities for abuses by politicians, the police and judges. By showing the impact 
of corruption on human rights, the reputational cost to businesses is too high, new risks are 
created, and they are thus provided with incentives to minimize their involvement in 
corruption. When accountability mechanisms are weak or non-existent, it becomes easy for 
corruption and for human rights violations to occur.18

<p><b> V. Are there experiences of integrating a human rights 
perspective into the fight against corruption? 
</b>25. Regarding the questionnaire responses that were received from States, human rights 
and anti-corruption institutions, NGOs and other stakeholders, it is pertinent to consider 
whether there were any experiences of integrating a human rights perspective into the fight 
against corruption. There are different institutional approaches to dealing with corruption. 
In a number of States, independent agencies have been charged with counteracting 
corruption. Other States, in their replies, make reference to agencies or departments of the 
government. The structure and organization of such agencies or other specialized 
institutions varies from State to State. In some States, NGOs are an important instrument in 
combating corruption. In addition, the inspection bodies (supreme audit institutions, for 
instance) play an important role; they are interested in human rights&#8211;based approaches and 
work collaboratively with civil society and human rights organizations. Other States 
mention criminal prosecution or human rights institutions as the main instruments used in 
the fight against corruption. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to the integration of a human rights perspective into the fight against 
corruption via cooperation between anti-corruption institutions and human rights 
institutions, the questionnaire responses from States give a multifaceted picture. In some 
cases, it is established that no cooperation is taking place or that no effective cooperation 
exists. Often, it is said that there is no formal cooperation but that there are informal 
contacts, for example for meetings, workshops, lectures, common trainings, or exchanging 
information. As for cooperation on a more formal basis, inter-institutional working groups 
are mentioned. Some States speak of collaboration between the related institutions 
occurring on a case-by-case basis. In sum, many States emphasize the need for and the 
importance of cooperation between the anti-corruption institutions and human rights 
institutions, but at the moment, this cooperation is informal and ad hoc. This same result is 
seen in the questionnaire responses from national human rights institutions and also in some 
responses from NGOs. 
</p>
<p>27. Regarding the questionnaire responses from NGOs, it is notable that some of them 
quote examples of collaboration between anti-corruption institutions and human rights 
institutions. However, no information is provided about the ways in which this cooperation 
is taking place. The need for and importance of such cooperation is nevertheless stressed in 
some responses. 
</p>
<p>28. In this regard, the response from the Council of Europe should be highlighted. It 
provides an illustrative example of integrating a human rights perspective into the fight 
against corruption. As examples, the Council of Europe listed the Civil Law Convention on 
Corruption (mentioned earlier) and the establishment of the <i>Groupe d&#8217;&#201;tats contre la 
corruption</i>, which invited the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights to share 
his views on the impact of corruption on the effectiveness of human rights. In his view, the 
protection of victims of corruption, as well as of persons who report suspicions of 
corruption, should be seen as important tools in promoting both human rights and ethical 
behaviour. 
</p>
<p>29. The substance of the questionnaire responses from States and other stakeholders 
indicates that human rights play an important role in anti-corruption strategies. What is 
emphasized by some respondents is the importance of a well-informed and participatory 
society in order to combat corruption. This outcome will be aided by human rights 
education, which can raise awareness of corruption.
