<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, undertook a 
mission to Malaysia between 5 and 13 February 2007. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express 
his gratitude both to the Government of Malaysia for the invitation extended to him and to the 
persons whom he met during the course of his visit. 
</p>
<p> In the course of the mission the Special Rapporteur examined the status of the right to 
education, covering all levels: preschool, primary, secondary and tertiary education. The 
Special Rapporteur found that Malaysia has made major efforts to improve its education system 
and intends it to become one of the most important engines of development in the country. He 
observed that as a result of these efforts, Malaysia has achieved high levels of school enrolment 
and gender parity in educational institutions. Further, he was able to confirm that there have been 
significant investments in the areas of infrastructure and teacher training. 
</p>
<p> However, the Special Rapporteur found that Malaysia is still facing some challenges in 
respect of the right to education, and he thus considers that greater efforts need to be made if that 
right is to be fully enjoyed by the entire population of the country. Many people still do not have 
access to any type of education, such as refugee children, asylum-seekers, stateless persons, 
children of migrant workers, undocumented people, street children, and indigenous children who 
mostly live in remote locations. 
</p>
<p> Additionally, the Special Rapporteur ascertained that there is widespread discontent within 
the Chinese and Tamil ethnic communities with respect to education policies, first and foremost 
with regard to the resources allocated to their schools and the languages of instruction. He also 
observed that corporal punishment is a common practice in schools, despite the Government&#8217;s 
stated intention to eliminate the practice. 
</p>
<p> With regard to higher education, the Special Rapporteur found that, in spite of the efforts 
made to widen access to university education, the coverage of public higher education continues 
to be low. Additionally, he expresses his concern regarding the strict rules to which university 
students and faculty members are subject, in particular with regard to their political rights, their 
freedom of expression and their right of assembly. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education undertook a mission to Malaysia 
from 5 to 13 February 2007. He visited the cities of Kuala Lumpur, Kota Bharu (Kelantan) and 
Kuching (Sarawak), and had more than 40 different meetings with officials of the Ministry of 
Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Women, Family and Community 
Development, the Departments of Immigration and Prisons, and SUHAKAM, the Human Rights 
Commission of Malaysia. He also met representatives of non-governmental organizations, 
teachers, parents and students. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets that he was unable to 
have a meeting with the Ministers of Education and of Higher Education. This made it difficult 
to glean important details about how the commitment of the authorities is being manifested in 
activities currently under way and prevented discussion on crucial items of information gathered 
during the mission. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  HISTORICAL, SOCIOCULTURAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General 
</b></p>
<p>2. Malaysia is a federated constitutional monarchy belonging to the Commonwealth. It 
obtained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, and its Constitution was approved 
in the same year. The State religion is Islam, but the Constitution guarantees the freedom to 
practise other religions in any part of the Federation.<b>1</b> The<b> </b>Head of State is the King (the 
<i>Yang di-Pertuan Agong</i>), who is chosen from the Conference of Rulers. The Rulers govern 9 of 
the 13 federal states.<b>2</b> The non-peninsular States of Sabah and Sarawak<b>3</b> enjoy certain 
prerogatives granted by the Constitution, which allow them to exercise greater autonomy in 
various areas.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>3. The Head of Government is the Prime Minister, who is chosen by the King,<b>5</b> and there is a 
bicameral Parliament. The upper chamber, the Senate, has 69 members, 43 of whom are 
appointed by the King and 26 by the federal states. The lower chamber, the House of 
Representatives, comprises 180 members elected by popular suffrage. There are two legal 
systems in Malaysia: one comprising the courts that apply sharia law, which have jurisdiction 
over the Muslim population in family and religious matters; and the civil system with 
jurisdiction over non-Muslims and all other matters affecting Muslims.

</b>  Constitution of Malaysia, Part I, art. 3, para. 1. 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The States of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor 
</p>
<p>and Terengganu have a hereditary Governor. The Governors of the States of Melaka and 
Pulau Pinang (Penang), Sabah and Sarawak are appointed by the Government. 
<b>3
</b>  These are called non-peninsular States, because of their situation on the island of Borneo, 
</p>
<p>contiguous to the peninsula where the other States are located. 
<b>4
</b>  See Constitution of Malaysia, Part VI, Chapter 8 and Part VII, Chapter 2.

</p>
<p>4. Over the past 30 years Malaysia has enjoyed very strong economic growth, becoming a 
manufacturing country and a producer of services. Indeed, between 1970 and 2003, it had 
sustained economic growth equivalent to a 7 per cent annual increase in GDP.<b>6</b> During that 
period, Malaysia planned and implemented its development policies by means of five-year plans, 
which have been systematically carried out. The current plan is the ninth development 
plan (2006-2010). This economic advancement has made it possible for the country to make 
major investments in sectors such as health, infrastructure and education.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Ethnic diversity and multilingualism 
</b></p>
<p>5. According to the Department of Statistics, the total population of the country, as at 2007, 
was 27,170,000.<b>8</b> Approximately 80 per cent of the population live on the peninsula and the 
remaining 20 per cent are divided between the provinces of Sabah and Sarawak.<b>9</b> The population 
is made up of various ethnic groups, the three largest of which are: the <i>Bumiputera </i>(sons of the 
soil), which is the name used to refer to the Malay and indigenous peoples; people of Chinese 
origin and those of Indian origin.<b>10</b> According to official statistics, 61.47 per cent of the 
population are <i>Bumiputera</i>, 23.55 per cent Chinese, 7 per cent Indian and 6.75 per cent of 
foreign origin.<b>11</b> Indians and Chinese are concentrated in the more developed states, with an 
economy based on industry and the production of services. The <i>Bumiputera</i> are distributed 
between the latter states and those, with an agriculture-based economy, in which they are the 
predominant group.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>6. The official language of Malaysia is Bahasa Melayu (Malay), although English is widely 
spoken. Also, various Chinese languages are used, such as Cantonese, Mandarin, Hokkien, 
Hakka, Hainan and Teochew. The communities of Indian origin speak Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, 
Malayalam and Punjabi, amongst others. Various indigenous languages are also spoken by 
peoples that for the most part live on the island of Borneo, the primary ones being Iban and 
Kadazan.<b>13</b>

</p>
<p><b>C.  Legal framework for protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. Part II of the Constitution enshrines the fundamental rights guaranteed in Malaysia, 
including the right to personal liberty (article 5), equality before the law (article 8) and freedom 
of expression, assembly and association (article 10). The right to education is not explicitly 
enshrined in the Constitution, but article 12 prescribes that there shall be no discrimination 
against any citizen on the grounds only of religion, race, descent or place of birth, in the 
administration of any educational institution maintained by a public authority, and, in particular, 
the admission of pupils or students or the payment of fees; or in providing out of the funds of a 
public authority financial aid for the maintenance or education of pupils or students in any public 
or private educational institution. It also prescribes that every religious group has the right to 
establish and maintain institutions for the education of children in its own religion, adding that 
no person shall be required to receive instruction in a religion other than his own. 
</p>
<p>8. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) was established in 1999.<b>14</b> Its 
functions include offering education in human rights, advising the Government on matters 
relating to human rights and making recommendations on measures to be taken, including the 
ratification of international human rights treaties. It is also empowered to receive individual 
complaints relating to violations of human rights. By virtue of its powers and responsibilities, 
SUHAKAM has taken various initiatives in the field of education in human rights, although 
some observers consider that because it has only limited independence, it avoids dealing with 
matters that the Government considers too sensitive.<b>15</b> Nor does it have any mechanism for 
ensuring that its recommendations are implemented, and in the view of some observers, 
SUHAKAM is not taken seriously enough by the senior Government authorities.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>9. In the international arena, Malaysia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women<b>17</b> and the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
in 1995.<b>18</b> However, it has not yet ratified the principal human rights protection instruments, 
despite SUHAKAM&#8217;s recommendation that it do so.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>14
</b>  It is composed of 18 members, appointed by the King on the recommendation of the 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister. See Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999, Act 597. Part II, 5.2.

<p>  Malaysia originally made reservations to articles 2 (f), 5 (a), 7 (b), 9 and 16. 
On 6 February 1998 reservations for the following articles were withdrawn: 2 (f), 9 (1),  
16 (b), 16 (d), 16 (e) and 16 (h). 
<b>18
</b></p>
<p>  Malaysia has made reservations to articles 1, 2, 7, 13, 14, 15, 28, para. 1 (a) and 37. 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  SUHAKAM recommended ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention 
against Torture and the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. See 
SUHAKAM, 2005 Annual Report, 2006, p. 110. </p>

<p><b>II.  PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  National education system 
</b></p>
<p>10. The education system in Malaysia forms part of Vision 2020, which lays down in its first 
challenge the objective of establishing a Malaysian nation that stands as one, ethnically and 
territorially.<b>20</b> This challenge has been implemented by way of a national education policy-based 
on the national education philosophy - that establishes a national education system including a 
national language of instruction, namely Malay, a national curriculum and standardized 
assessments.<b>21</b> The Government has also set out its education policies in a detailed blueprint 
which contains the general guidelines governing those policies and sets forth certain specific 
objectives. 
11. Education is administered centrally, even though Malaysia is a federal State. The Ministry 
of Education bears responsibility for implementing education policies and administering the 
education system. As part of its functions, the Ministry drafts policy implementation guidelines, 
prepares plans and programmes, establishes the curriculum and sets examinations. At the state 
level, the state education departments (14 in all) are the regional arm of the Ministry of 
Education<b>22</b> and are responsible for coordinating implementation of the national plans. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Preschool education and childcare centres 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Education Act 1996 (Act 550) provides that the programmes of kindergarten activities 
must be based on the curriculum guidelines adopted by the Ministry of Education.<b>23</b> 
Additionally, the ninth five-year plan has the objective of extending preschool education to all 
children between the ages of 5 and 6 by the year 2010. However, it is a matter for concern that 
42 per cent of preschool pupils attend private institutions,<b>24</b> from which it may be inferred that 
the coverage of what is offered by the public authorities has to be improved as a matter of 
urgency, in terms of quality, accessibility and availability to this segment of the child population.

Education on 6 February 2007.

Malaysia&#8221;, 31 July 2004, available at http://www.ibe.unesco.org/International/ICE47/

<b>23
</b></p>
<p>  In 2003 a compulsory preschool curriculum was adopted for children between the ages of 4 
and 6. 
<b>24
</b></p>
<p>  See footnote 23. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/8/Add.2

</p>
<p>13. In the case of the childcare centres, there is no Government programme providing for 
generalized access on an equitable basis.<b>25</b> However, there do exist various projects, promoted by 
different Government agencies,<b>26</b> that seek to provide a childcare service, but they are far from 
covering the total population in need. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that the Government needs to redouble its efforts to 
ensure that all children have access both to preschool education and to childcare centres, and 
should bear the cost of both services, in order to prevent certain children being excluded from 
pre-primary education as a result of economic or social inequalities. In particular, special 
attention should be paid to pre-primary schooling of poor children living in the urban areas, who 
seem to have fewer opportunities for access to preschool education. Furthermore, the limited 
access to preschool education for children living in the states of Sabah and Sarawak, particularly 
in rural areas is also of concern.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Primary and secondary schooling 
</b></p>
<p>15. The public primary and secondary education system, governed by the Education Act 1996 
(Act 550), is complex and is divided into three cycles of studies.<b>28</b> The first, the primary level, is 
a six-year cycle of studies for boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 11. This stage is 
subdivided into national schools, type C schools (Chinese national type) and type T schools 
(Tamil national type). The national schools use Malay as the language of instruction and are set 
up and financed entirely by the Government; at present, they number 5,774. The type C schools 
use Mandarin as the language of instruction and number 1,288; while the type T schools use 
Tamil and total 523.<b>29</b> The C and T type schools are totally subsidized by the Government, 
making them Government-aided educational institutions. Parents can choose whether they wish 
to enrol their children in a national school, or in one of type C or T, generally making this choice 
in line with their ethnic origin. According to figures provided by the Ministry of Education, 
the total number of pupils at the primary level in 2006 was 3,143,207.<b>30</b>

<b>30

<p>  The Special Rapporteur has estimated these numbers on the basis of statistical information 
given by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) Malaysia, based on information 
provided by the Department of Statistics. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/8/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>16. The second cycle of studies is the lower secondary or academic secondary, which is taught 
in Malay and is intended for boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 14, who have to complete 
three years of studies. The official number of pupils at this level in 2006 was 1,322,212, 
equivalent to 18.8 per cent of the population of school age. 
</p>
<p>17. The third stage is the upper secondary, which is also taught in Malay. This stage is of 
two years&#8217; duration and intended for boys and girls between 14 and 16. According to figures 
provided by the Ministry of Education, in 2006 there were 751,473 pupils at this level. 
The curriculum of this cycle includes optional subjects which may be technical or 
employment-related, religious, scientific or artistic. At the end of each of the cycles, pupils 
undergo a national assessment in order to progress to the next level of studies.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>18. In addition, there are private schools, including primary and secondary establishments; 
religious schools, which may also be of primary or secondary level; international schools and 
expatriate schools. The Ministry of Education estimates the total number of pupils at private 
schools to be 500,000, or 7.1 per cent of the population of school age. Under the Education 
Act 1966, private primary and secondary schools have to fulfil the requirements of the 
national curriculum and have to prepare their pupils for the standardized examinations. One of 
the most sensitive topics is that of secondary schools administered and financed by the Chinese 
communities. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there are 60 secondary schools of this 
type, with some 55,000 pupils,<b>32</b> which use Mandarin as the language of instruction, unlike all 
the public secondary schools, where the language of instruction is Malay. The Government does 
not recognize the examination that is taken at the end of the programme of studies in these 
schools, notwithstanding the fact that various countries accept its academic validity. In 
consequence, pupils from these schools have to sit two end-of-cycle examinations. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  School enrolment rates 
</b></p>
<p>19. Malaysia has high rates of school enrolment: at the primary level, the differences between 
boys and girls are not very significant,<b>33</b> but the figures differ depending on whether the children 
considered are <i>Bumiputera</i> or not. For <i>Bumiputera</i> in the period 2002-2005 the net enrolment 
rate was 96 per cent. For other groups, it was 92 per cent. This means that approximately 
172,176 children, or 8 per cent of all children in Malaysia, were never enrolled in primary school 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>31
</b>  These exams are the UPSR at grade 6, the PMR at grade 9, the SPM at grade 10 and the 
</p>
<p>STPM at grade 13. 
<b>32
</b></p>
<p>  Information given by the United Chinese School Committees Association of Malaysia - 
<i>Dong Zong</i> - during the meeting on 5 February 2007. 
<b>33
</b></p>
<p>  From 1 to 2 per cent according to different sources of statistics. See for example 
http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=121&amp;IF_Language= 
eng&amp;BR_Country=4580. </p>

</p>
<p>or dropped out at some point. This number, comprising both <i>Bumiputera </i>and <i>non-Bumiputera</i>,<b>34</b> 
is still high despite all the progress made. Furthermore, during this period around 96-98 per cent 
of <i>Bumiputera</i> and <i>non-Bumiputera</i> children completed the sixth grade, which means that 2 to 
4 per cent, equivalent to 21,522-43,000 <i>Bumiputera</i> and <i>non-Bumiputera</i> children, dropped out 
of school.<b>35</b> On this point the Special Rapporteur would like to draw attention to the alarming 
drop in the number of pupils completing primary education in the state of Sabah.<b>36</b> Also, these 
statistics do not cover children enrolled in religious primary schools, or undocumented migrant 
children. He also wishes to stress that, at the time of the visit, there was no available data 
disaggregated by rural and urban areas, and that it is urgently necessary for the authorities to 
compile statistics that include each of these categories. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to secondary schools, there is a more marked gender-based difference. Thus, 
in 2005 the net enrolment rate for girls was 81 per cent and for boys 77 per cent.<b>37</b> </p>
<p><b>B.  Progress and challenges  
</b></p>
<p>21. In this section the Special Rapporteur intends to make an analysis of the progress made, 
and the challenges still facing the right to education in Malaysia, taking as reference points the 
features of availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability, on the basis of which it is 
possible to analyse the level of compliance of States with their international obligations in the 
education field.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Availability 
</b></p>
<p>22. Availability implies that there are sufficient teaching institutions and programmes and also 
that the conditions under which they operate meet certain minimum requirements, including 
sanitation facilities for both sexes, safe drinking water, qualified teachers, teaching materials, 
and so on. The Special Rapporteur recognizes and praises the efforts made by Malaysia in this 
area, since the country has invested considerable resources in the education system on an 
ongoing basis.

</p>
<p><b>(a) Investment 
</b>23. Malaysia invests a high percentage of its national budget in education. For example, 
in 2004 the figure was 25.2 per cent. The same applies to its GDP: in 2004, it invested 
6.2 per cent of GDP in education. Of that amount, 1 per cent went to pre-primary 
education, 29 per cent to primary, 35 per cent to secondary and 35 per cent to tertiary 
education.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p>24. Moreover, as result of substantial investment in the education sector, the country&#8217;s literacy 
level has increased dramatically in recent years. While in 1970 one in every three persons over 
the age of six was illiterate, by the year 2000 the figure had dropped to only 1 in 10 and in 2005 
a literacy rate of 97.3 per cent was recorded.<b>40</b> However, the levels of literacy do vary from state 
to state, with Sabah and Sarawak showing less progress.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Finally, the teacher-pupil ratio is 1 to 17, although this information was not available 
during the visit in disaggregated form for the various states or for rural and urban areas. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Infrastructure 
</b>26. In the course of his mission, the Special Rapporteur visited primary and secondary schools 
and observed that they were equipped with the infrastructure required to meet the needs of the 
pupils, both male and female. He was also informed that there are high numbers of primary and 
secondary schools in the rural areas, accounting for 89 per cent and 58 per cent, respectively, of 
the total number of schools. 
</p>
<p>27. However, he noted that overcrowding in some Chinese schools is placing considerable 
strain on the infrastructure in general. The Special Rapporteur was informed that Chinese 
schools tend to be overcrowded, owing to a ban on the establishment and operation of new 
educational centres for this ethnic group. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of 
infrastructure deficiencies, primarily in remote rural areas, in particular in Sabah and Sarawak. 
The Special Rapporteur also heard complaints concerning a lack of qualified teachers and was 
informed that children who had reached the sixth grade still could not read or write properly. 
Another complaint was that secondary schools are concentrated in the urban areas, which means

</p>
<p>that once children reach the age of 13 they have to leave home. This particularly impacts girls, 
since poor families, rather than sending them to the urban areas to continue their studies, prefer 
that they remain at home to look after their younger siblings.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>28. Likewise, in Sarawak, the differences with regard to infrastructure as between the rural and 
the urban areas is very marked, with the rural schools often lacking electricity or drinking water, 
or access roads. In spite of various measures taken by the authorities to assist the indigenous 
communities, the latter are the ones most seriously affected by the infrastructure shortcomings.<b>43</b> 
Also, the school dropout rate is fairly high, for various reasons, including the lack of 
maintenance and overcrowding in boarding schools which accommodate pupils who live far 
away; the low incomes of families, preventing them from sending their children to school; the 
perception of education as being of little importance; the lack of education of the parents which 
means that they cannot help their children with their school work; the lack of preschool 
education that would better equip the pupils to start school; and the difficult living conditions of 
teachers.<b>44</b> In Sarawak, furthermore, there is a general shortage of secondary schools in urban 
areas. Those that there are have difficulty in meeting demand and find themselves obliged to 
implement multiple teaching shifts. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>29. Accessibility is the requirement that both educational institutions and programmes should 
be accessible to all without discrimination and should be accessible in material terms, which 
includes physical accessibility and economic accessibility. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Cost-free education 
</b>30. Although the Education Act 1996 was amended in 2002, making primary education 
compulsory, cost-free status has not yet been guaranteed. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at 
the fact that enrolment and other education-related costs, such as uniforms, transport, teaching 
materials, etc. are obstacles hampering access to education for all children, especially those of 
limited means. This is all the more true for primary education, the provision of which is

</p>
<p><b>42
</b>  The Government stated that it has enhanced efforts to improve education in rural areas, 
</p>
<p>providing programmes and opportunities for the purpose of bridging the rural-urban gap. See 
also NGO Shadow Report on the Initial and Second Periodic Report of the Government of 
Malaysia, <i>Reviewing the Government&#8217;s Implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</i>, 2005. 
<b>43
</b></p>
<p>  The Special Rapporteur was informed that the <i>Dayak, Iban, Penan and Bidayuh</i> communities 
are considered as equal, despite their cultural differences and the fact that they are situated in 
different areas. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the differences in infrastructure in 
relation to the State-run religious Muslim schools, which have been provided with better 
facilities.

</p>
<p>considered an essential State obligation by various international human rights instruments.<b>45</b> The 
Special Rapporteur endorses the recommendation from the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
to the Government of Malaysia that it should ensure that all boys and girls have equal access to 
quality education at all levels and that their access is not impeded by economic handicaps.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Indigenous communities 
</b>31. The Government has taken a number of initiatives to promote access to education for 
indigenous communities. Thus, in the case of the <i>Orang Asli</i>, it has established a special 
curriculum which takes account of their particular needs. It has also implemented a special 
programme of integration for <i>Orang Asli</i> pupils, established a special school model (<i>Paloh Inai 
Pahang</i>), implemented a programme to improve literacy levels and reduce absenteeism and 
undertaken to provide the necessary infrastructure, including dormitories for pupils living far 
from school, especially secondary school pupils. At the same time, it gives money to some 
families to cover transport costs for travel to school and provides meals during the school day. 
However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that many fathers of limited means have serious 
difficulty in paying their children&#8217;s enrolment fees, even when those fees are low, and sometimes 
withdraw them from school; he was also informed that the criteria for determining which 
children will benefit from financial assistance are not very clear. 
</p>
<p>32. Regarding other indigenous communities, especially those located on the island of Borneo, 
the Special Rapporteur concluded that there are various obstacles impeding their access to 
education. Unlike those living in peninsular Malaysia, these communities do not have their 
affairs taken in hand in the same way, and this impedes the harmonious implementation of 
policies on their behalf. 
</p>
<p>33.  Lastly, one of the most serious problems affecting the access to education of indigenous 
communities is the lack of a register of births. A birth certificate is required, among other things, 
for admission to any school at any level, but many indigenous children do not have one because 
of ignorance of the requirement or because they live in very remote areas. The Government 
states that it has implemented a number of initiatives to ensure that all indigenous children have 
birth certificates, but the indigenous communities consider that the problem is far from being 
resolved.<b>47</b>

</p>
<p><b>(c) Foreign children with unlawful immigration status 
</b>34. The Special Rapporteur considers one of the most serious education-related problems in 
Malaysia to be the lack of access to education, at all levels, for children lacking Malaysian 
citizenship status, including refugee children, asylum-seekers, children of migrant workers, and 
stateless children, possibly as well street children. A problem common to all these children is the 
lack of documentation, which is an insuperable obstacle as regards access to education since, as 
was mentioned previously, no child may be enrolled in any recognized public education 
institution unless he/she has a birth certificate.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p><i>(i) Refugees and asylum-seekers 
</i>35. According to estimates of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), there are approximately 6,000 refugee children in Malaysia.<b>49</b> Most of them 
come from neighbouring countries, particularly Myanmar. Malaysia has no legal framework for 
the protection of these children, since it has not ratified the 1951 Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol thereto, the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of 
Stateless Persons, or the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Nor are the rights 
of these children guaranteed in its internal legislation, since the Immigration Act (Act 1959/63) 
does not differentiate between refugees, asylum-seekers and stateless persons. One of the most 
serious cases is that of the <i>Rohingyas</i> living in Malaysia, who are unable to return to their 
country of origin because the latter does not recognize their citizenship. According to UNHCR 
estimates, there are 12,000 <i>Rohingyas</i> in Malaysia, including 3,000 children, many of whom 
were born in Malaysian territory and most of whom have no access to education.<b>50</b> Along with 
the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Special Rapporteur 
appeals to the Government to strengthen its cooperation with UNHCR,<b>51</b> for example by carrying 
out a study to evaluate the scope and impact of the lack of education of these children. Also, 
cooperation with UNHCR could be improved by enabling that agency to have access to 
immigrant detention centres, so as to improve the means of detecting persons or families who 
could qualify for legalization of their status and thereby be guaranteed the right to education 
which, in the case of children at least, should be recognized independently of whether or not they 
qualify for legalization of their status.

</p>
<p><i>(ii) Migrant workers 
</i></p>
<p>36. Before 1997, all children were entitled to attend primary school, regardless of nationality, 
provided that they held a birth certificate. However, as from that year, the words <i>Daftar Asing</i> 
(foreigner) were written on the birth certificates of children of non-Malaysian parentage even if 
they had a birth certificate and were born in Malaysian territory.<b>52</b> Hence, the children of migrant 
workers, whether legal or illegal, with or without birth certificates, and with or without residence 
permits (IMM13), are not granted access to public education.<b>53</b> Consequently, the only option 
left to them is to attend private schools, but they do not have the means to do so. There are no 
official statistics showing how many children are in this situation. 
</p>
<p>37. Most migrant workers come from the neighbouring countries of Indonesia and the 
Philippines. The Government of Malaysia has concluded an agreement with Indonesia, under 
which Indonesian teachers come to live in Malaysia in order to provide education to children of 
Indonesian origin, following the Indonesian curriculum and system of education.<b>54</b> However, the 
Government of Malaysia accords no academic validity to the training received by these children 
and the system only covers the preschool and primary levels.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>38. As far as Filipinos are concerned, no programme aimed at giving them access to education 
is known to exist. 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Street children 
</b>39. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some 4,000 street children live in the state of 
Sabah;<b>56</b> but there are no official statistics. Many of these children were abandoned by their 
parents when they were detained or deported, pursuant to the Immigration Act<b>57</b> and found 
themselves in the situation of not being recognized as Malaysians, despite the fact that many of 
them had been born in Malaysian territory, nor as Filipinos or Indonesians, because they had not 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>52
</b>  Malaysia does not grant citizenship by birth; in order for a child to be registered as Malaysian, 
</p>
<p>the father must prove his Malaysian citizenship. 
<b>53
</b></p>
<p>  The Rapporteur was informed of the case of children who completed primary education but 
could not, due to the lack of identity documents, present themselves for the final exams. 
<b>54
</b></p>
<p>  In the Humana Schools. 
<b>55
</b></p>
<p>  According to Government data, as of June 2008, the Humana Schools provided education for 
more than 5,000 children. 
<b>56
</b></p>
<p>  Information provided by the non-governmental organization (NGO) 
Tenaganita, 7 February 2007. 
<b>57
</b></p>
<p>  In 2002, the Government reformed the Migration Act, which resulted in a zero-tolerance 
policy towards undocumented migrants. Under the present Act, any person found undocumented 
in Malaysia may be sentenced to up to 5 years of imprisonment, to fines or caning. In addition, 
the Government also initiated a series of round-ups followed by deportations. </p>

</p>
<p>been born in either of those countries. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 
many of these children, when deported to their &#8220;countries of origin&#8221;, are arrested there by the 
police because they are undocumented, for which reason they prefer to return to Sabah, despite 
the total uncertainty of their status.<b>58</b> None of these children have access to education, either in 
Government schools, as they do not have the necessary documentation, or in private schools, as 
they do not have the means to pay for enrolment. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government that the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights provides that every person has the right to education, which must 
be free of charge, at least as regards elementary and basic education. At the same time, he 
appeals to the Government to withdraw the reservations it entered to articles 2 and 28 (1) (a) of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to implement the measures needed to guarantee 
that all children in its territory have access to education.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Children with disabilities 
</b>41. Various State entities have responsibility for providing for the special needs of children 
with disabilities. The Special Education Department attached to the Ministry of Education 
deals with &#8220;single disabilities&#8221; and the Ministry of Women, Family and Community 
Development deals with other types of disability.<b>60</b> A special education programme has been 
implemented to enable various children with disabilities to attend mainstream schools, including 
children with auditory and audiovisual disabilities, who follow the national curriculum. The 
Special Rapporteur noted, however, that special schools continue to operate and that, depending 
on their disability, children attend separate special classes within mainstream schools or only 
take certain subjects together with other children. 
42. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts made by Malaysia, including 
preparation of the plan of action for persons with disabilities, which was to have been adopted at 
the end of 2007.<b>61</b> However, he wishes to repeat what he said in his report on the right to 
education of persons with disabilities,<b>62</b> on the need for more thorough and rapid progress in the 
construction of educational systems in which pupils with special educational needs have access 
to the general education system, that is to say that it is necessary to guarantee the right of such

</b></p>
<p>  The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the Policy and Plan of Action of 
Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) was adopted on 21 November 2007 and the PWD Act 2008 
came into force on 7 July 2008.

</p>
<p>persons to inclusive education, which must be accompanied by genuine structural changes, such 
as the organization of schools, curricula and teaching and learning strategies, so as to ensure that 
the integration is truly inclusive and does not imply exclusion of persons with disabilities within 
mainstream schools. On this topic, the Special Rapporteur considers that a worthwhile starting 
point for guaranteeing the right in question would be to implement the recommendations made at 
the round-table discussion on education for children with disabilities organized by SUHAKAM 
in March 2004, which are consistent with the above-mentioned concept of inclusive education.<b>63</b> 
</p>
<p>43. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur regrets the lack of official statistics from which 
to establish the number of children with disabilities in the country and the lack of data on their 
schooling in public or private institutions. For this reason, he urges the Government to take the 
necessary measures to set up a database containing information on children with disabilities, so 
as to integrate them into policies targeting this sector of the population. 
</p>
<p>44. Finally, with regard to conditions of access, the Special Rapporteur was informed by some 
sources about the difficulties that continue to be faced by teenage and expectant teenage mothers, 
who have to overcome numerous obstacles in order to remain at school. The situation of these 
adolescents must be addressed by the educational authorities, so as to guarantee educational 
opportunities on an equal footing with other students and in the same educational institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Acceptability 
</b></p>
<p>45. Acceptability relates to the good quality and relevance of education, which in turn must be 
consistent with the specific cultural features of each society and with the views of students and, 
where necessary, of parents. 
</p>
<p>46. Malaysia has invested resources in teacher training. It has increased the number of teachers 
with university degrees, offering various options for those who have no degree to obtain one, 
through scholarships, distance learning programmes and the establishment of training institutes. 
It has also increased salary scales in line with the level of training. Incentives are also granted to 
teachers who teach in difficult conditions. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the 
establishment of a quality assessment mechanism under the education blueprint, as well 
as of standards for quality education in Malaysian schools. 
</p>
<p>47. Regarding curricula, in the context of the national education philosophy, a national 
curriculum has been established which seeks to ensure that Malaysians are prepared to meet the 
challenges of the twenty-first century. The curriculum includes programmes directed towards 
their future participation in the country&#8217;s economic development, through technology, science 
and business-oriented courses. Various kinds of extracurricular activities are also offered, 
including student clubs, sports and participation in activities of uniformed bodies. Students are 
obliged to participate in at least one of these activities.<b>64</b>

</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the fact that education is oriented towards 
economic issues and market demands, leaving aside the holistic approach proposed under 
article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. That approach provides for a specific 
orientation of educational processes whereby, in addition to the organizational skills needed to 
live in a consumer society, attention is paid to the building of knowledge, skills and capacities 
that are also necessary to form fully developed, democratic and tolerant individuals.<b>65</b> This is 
reflected in the dearth of humanities-based courses and subjects in the school curriculum. The 
Special Rapporteur considers that vocational activities should also be diversified and that 
students should be given more freedom of choice. </p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur has identified certain areas where the Government faces 
challenges with respect to the acceptability of education. These concern the language of 
instruction, corporal punishment, the gender perspective in education and the lack of 
involvement of students and teachers in the taking of decisions that affect them. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Languages of instruction 
</b>50. As was explained previously, the language of instruction in national schools is Malay. 
However, in type C primary schools it is Mandarin and in type T schools Tamil. In secondary 
schools, the language is Malay; however, in both lower and upper secondary schools it is 
possible to study Mandarin and Tamil, as well as Iban (an indigenous language) as an optional 
subject. Moreover, the language of instruction at all levels for mathematics and science is 
English. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur noted the concern by the Chinese and Tamil communities of the 
fact that their primary schools (type C and type T) receive less funding than national schools. He 
was also informed that, despite the increased population density of some urban areas inhabited 
by people of Chinese origin, it has not been possible to establish new type C schools. He was 
told that a number of Tamil schools have been closed, despite having students in attendance.<b>66</b> In 
this connection, the Special Rapporteur requests the Government to take account of the provision 
in the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the effect that education shall be directed to 
development of respect for the child&#8217;s own cultural identity, language and values.<b>67</b> 
</p>
<p>52. At the same time, with regard to the teaching of mathematics and science in English, the 
Special Rapporteur found that pupils and teachers face serious difficulties, especially in rural 
areas, despite the efforts made to train teachers in that language. He was informed of difficulties 
in learning mathematics and science, particularly for indigenous children and children living in 
rural areas. In many instances, not even the teachers have an acceptable grasp of English, which

</p>
<p><b>65
</b>  Objectives of the National Philosophy System and of the National Education System. 
</p>
<p><b>66
</b>  Between 1999 and 2006, 461 national primary schools were established, of which 4 were 
</p>
<p>Type C and none were Type T (meeting with NGOs on 5 February 2007); in 2008, the 
Government approved building of 6 new type C and one new type T schools.

<p>  Convention on the Rights of the Child, article 29 (c). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/8/Add.2

</p>
<p>makes the learning process even more difficult for these children, who do not have the 
opportunity to practise English either. Similarly, there are learning difficulties for children whose 
mother tongue is different from the language of instruction, i.e. Malay. Cases of secondary 
school pupils experiencing serious learning difficulties are common, firstly because their mother 
tongue is not Malay; secondly because they have to learn mathematics and science, inherently 
complex subjects, in a third language, English, totally alien to their environment. 
53. While the learning of English is important and constitutes a useful tool for students, the 
Special Rapporteur nevertheless urges the Government to analyse the impact of this policy on 
the educational process, so that supplementary measures of support, restriction or promotion, as 
appropriate, may be put into effect.<b>68</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Corporal punishment 
</b>54. Although some Governmental authorities have expressed the intention to cut down on the 
use of corporal punishment,<b>69</b> the Special Rapporteur found that it is still practised extensively in 
schools. He was informed by pupils and teachers themselves that corporal punishment is applied 
by headmasters in serious cases of indiscipline, such as smoking or absenteeism.<b>70</b> Thus, at the 
meeting held with the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education, the latter openly justified 
the use of corporal punishment as a &#8220;last resort&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>55. As the Special Rapporteur was not given the opportunity to meet the Minister of 
Education, it was not possible for him to determine whether the Government&#8217;s intention to 
reduce corporal punishment will really lead to its total elimination, as required by the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to prohibit 
the use of corporal punishment in schools definitively, in compliance with its international 
obligations.<b>71</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Gender perspective in education 
</b>56. As was mentioned earlier, education enrolment levels for boys and girls in Malaysia are 
virtually identical, being slightly higher for girls than for boys. At the same time, the curriculum 
does not differentiate at all between boys and girls. However, some professional careers are 
considered more appropriate for girls, such as nursing, nutrition and education. Although in 
principle girls and young women are encouraged to study for technology or business-oriented 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>68
</b>  The Government informed that the MoE is monitoring this policy since it was implemented 
</p>
<p>in 2003. 
<b>69
</b></p>
<p>  The Government stated that it is at the final stage of amending the Child Act 2001 so as to 
repeal all provisions relating to the punishment of whipping. 
<b>70
</b></p>
<p>  The rules which provide grounds for corporal punishment are contained in the National 
Directives of Discipline of the Ministry of Education.

</p>
<p>careers, they tend to choose jobs in which they can strike a balance between career and family. 
No programme of professional or vocational guidance includes a gender perspective, just as 
there is no gender-based approach in the general education system. 
</p>
<p>57. Similarly, the number of women occupying senior positions in all fields of social and 
political life is very low.<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p>58. Moreover, it was reported that most teachers are women because the profession is 
perceived as a female preserve and there is no social recognition of the profession of educator. 
Nevertheless, senior posts with decision-making powers in the field of education are occupied by 
men, although in 2004 the Government adopted a policy of having at least 30 per cent of women 
in decision-making at all levels in an effort to reduce the gender imbalance in the public sector. 
The Special Rapporteur was also informed that many female teachers contribute to perpetuating 
the perception of roles in society, imposing their own views on the way in which teaching and 
administration are carried out in schools.<b>73</b> 
</p>
<p>59. School textbooks have undergone a number of revisions to prevent any gender-stereotyped 
content. However, there is no clear policy on the criteria used for textbook revision or on the 
frequency of revision. 
</p>
<p>60. Finally, there are still cases of parents refusing to send their daughters to school and 
preferring the modality of home education. The Government has introduced various initiatives 
aimed at reducing the number of school-age children outside the school system, including prison 
sentences and high fines.<b>74</b> The Special Rapporteur recognizes the efforts made by the 
Government, including the decision to make education compulsory; however, he considers that, 
instead of coercive measures, it would be desirable to undertake awareness-raising campaigns on 
the importance of education, especially for low-income populations in remote areas. He also 
wishes to point out that parents are at liberty to choose the education they wish to give their 
children,<b>75</b> provided that it meets the minimum standards laid down by the State, which must be 
in conformity with human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Participation of the educational community 
</b>61. The Special Rapporteur was able to observe that teachers, students and parents have little 
input on decisions concerning them. Their opinions are rarely taken into account in the 
elaboration of public education policies, in curriculum design or in decisions pertaining to 
schooling in general. The Special Rapporteur considers that participation by the educational 
community is a fundamental aspect of the right to education, particularly as regards the design of 
educational programmes and curricula. He therefore urges the Government to take the necessary

to enable them to participate in the design of such programmes, and to give them the opportunity 
to express their opinions on decisions of direct or indirect concern to them in the field of 
education. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Adaptability 
</b></p>
<p>62. Adaptability in education refers to the need for flexibility so that education can adapt to the 
needs of students in diverse cultural and social settings. Education must respond to the 
immediate reality faced by children in their own community, as well as to rapidly changing 
global realities. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur considers that Malaysia faces two major challenges concerning the 
adaptability of its education: sex education on the one hand, and education in human rights on 
the other. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Sex and reproductive health education  
</b>64. Malaysia currently has no formal sex or reproductive health education programme. The 
Special Rapporteur found that the Government and many teachers consider that students&#8217; 
education needs in respect of sexuality and reproductive health are covered by the subject of 
biology. 
</p>
<p>65. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was informed that sex education has been the subject of 
national public debate on various occasions, and that the Government has undertaken to adopt 
measures to incorporate sex education in school curricula.<b>76</b> The Special Rapporteur recognizes 
that the Government has started some initiatives in this field,<b>77</b> but urges it to incorporate a sex 
and reproductive health education programme in curricula without delay, at least at the levels of 
primary and secondary education. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Education in human rights 
</b>66. Act 597 of 1999, by which SUHAKAM was established, gave it the task of promoting and 
providing education in human rights. SUHAKAM has developed numerous activities under this 
mandate. In coordination with the Ministry of Education, it organizes conferences and training 
programmes for teachers at different educational levels, as well as grants and prizes to schools 
that participate in its human rights promotion programme, etc. However, human rights education 
is taught in the context of civic and citizen education.

<b>77
</b></p>
<p>  The Special Rapporteur was briefed that a pilot project on sexual education was being 
implemented in 20 schools and a national policy on reproductive health and social education 
being drafted. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/8/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur observed that neither teachers nor pupils have a clear 
understanding of what human rights are and, in some cases, are not even familiar with the basic 
concepts. He urges the Government to step up its efforts to develop a national strategy aimed at 
establishing a programme of human rights education in the formal education system. While 
recognizing and commending the efforts made by SUHAKAM, education in human rights 
remains an obligation which must be assumed without delay by the State, as it has the 
institutional and economic capacity to institute such programmes which should be accompanied 
by a human rights training programme for teachers. Efforts should also be undertaken to ensure 
that human rights are reflected in each and every one of the aspects of school life. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur has no doubt that a human rights approach to education will be a 
useful tool in achieving the objectives of the national education philosophy, that Malaysian 
children should build a united Malaysia and, furthermore, that they should be intellectually, 
spiritually, emotionally and physically balanced people capable of contributing to the harmony 
and betterment of society and of the Malaysian nation. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  HIGHER EDUCATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Coverage 
</b></p>
<p>69. In the area of higher education, public and private institutions coexist. The disparity 
between the two systems is surprising, given that there are currently 20 public universities and 
more than 500 private higher education institutions, of which 37 are private universities.<b>78</b> These 
institutions provide education to some 800,000 students, which is equivalent to a tertiary 
education rate of 29 per cent.<b>79</b> 
</p>
<p>70. Public higher education is open to all nationals and foreigners possessing the necessary 
academic proficiency for admission, in line with the meritocracy policy promoted by the 
Government. However, given the low level of coverage, students of limited economic and social 
means or those belonging to vulnerable groups are admitted in relatively small numbers. The 
Special Rapporteur was also informed that even many Malaysians with economic means choose 
to pursue higher studies outside the country.<b>80</b> 
</p>
<p>71. The Government has made some efforts to improve university access, such as the 
elimination of quotas and the establishment of scholarship programmes for outstanding students, 
and is investing a high percentage of its budget in tertiary education. Those efforts are 
inadequate, however, bearing in mind that higher education coverage has not reached a level 
of 40 per cent of the population, which the Special Rapporteur was informed is the goal of the 
Government for 2010.

<p><b>B.  Legal framework:  Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 
</b></p>
<p>72. At the time of writing of this report, the 1971 Act governing universities in Malaysia 
remains in force, but the Government has announced publicly that it will be amended by 
Parliament in 2008. Accordingly, the analysis which follows is intended to develop some 
recommendations with a view to the forthcoming review of the Act. 
</p>
<p>73. The current Act provides that no university student may be a member of or in any manner 
associated with any society, political party, trade union or any other organization or group of 
persons, whether or not established by law, within or outside the university, and within or 
outside Malaysia, except as may be approved in writing by the Vice-Chancellor of the university 
to which the student belongs. The same prohibition applies to student groups or organizations. 
University students and any student group or organization are also barred from expressing any 
kind of support, sympathy or opposition to a political party, trade union, or any type of 
organization.<b>81</b> 
</p>
<p>74. The Act also provides for drastic presumptions against students; for example, it is 
presumed that, if certain materials, such as documents, lists of members, insignia, etc., relating to 
any type of organization, are found in the possession of a university student, it shall be 
presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the student is a member of the organization and 
participates directly in its management.<b>82</b> 
</p>
<p>75. Regarding the penalties of suspension and expulsion from a university, the Act provides 
that students who are the subject of a criminal investigation, regardless of whether judicial 
proceedings are pending, shall immediately be suspended from their university studies. Students 
who are detained, including in preventive detention, or convicted, shall be expelled from the 
university. Such students have no possibility of enrolling in any other university within 
Malaysian territory, unless they obtain special authorization at the discretion of the Minister.<b>83</b> 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur urges the Parliament of Malaysia urgently to amend this Act so as 
to recognize and give effect to the freedom of expression and association of university students, 
as required by any modern and humane developed society. He considers that it is time for 
university students to be given back the right to participate actively in the political life of the 
country, and this is moreover in line with the democratization objectives enunciated by the 
Government. It is necessary that their rights within and outside the university be guaranteed and 
that they be given the opportunity to participate fully in the discussion of the reform agenda. 
</p>
<p>77. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was informed that elections of student representatives 
are not conducted in a transparent manner. To stand for election, candidates must meet a very 
high academic threshold and adhere to limits on the scope of their proposals. SUHAKAM has

</p>
<p>requested authorization to monitor university elections, but this has been systematically rejected 
by the Ministry of Higher Education. The Special Rapporteur appeals for reconsideration of the 
way in which such elections are conducted and for the implementation of the necessary 
mechanisms, within the framework of reform of the Act, to ensure that they are conducted in 
accordance with democratic and participatory principles. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>78. The right to education can only be enjoyed if accompanied by the academic freedom of 
staff and students. Academic freedom includes the liberty of individuals freely to express 
opinions about the institution or system in which they work, to fulfil their functions without fear 
of repression by the State or any other institution, to participate in representative academic 
bodies and to enjoy all the recognized human rights applicable to other individuals in the same 
jurisdiction.<b>84</b> 
79. The highest authority in every Malaysian university is the Vice-Chancellor who is elected 
by a committee appointed by the Ministry of Higher Education. The Vice-Chancellor has 
extensive powers over students and teaching staff, and this has a rather negative effect on 
university autonomy. 
</p>
<p>80. The disciplinary rules applicable to students are fairly strict. For example, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that any meeting of more than five students on the campus is 
categorically prohibited unless expressly authorized by the Vice-Chancellor. The disciplinary 
authority has extensive discretionary power to impose penalties on students, which range from a 
warning to expulsion. Students have the possibility of appealing against such decisions to the 
Minister of Higher Education, who may summarily dismiss the appeal.<b>85</b> 
</p>
<p>81. As regards teaching staff, the Special Rapporteur was informed that, at the time of signing 
an employment contract, they are required to sign a declaration in which they undertake to obey 
Government policies, both present and future,<b>86</b> while they are also prohibited, in the same way 
as students, from participating in any kind of political activity.<b>87</b> As a result of all this, the 
academic freedom of university professors is severely curtailed, and their trade union rights are 
also quite seriously restricted. 
</p>
<p>82. In addition, the State exercises control over the management of the budget of all public 
universities.<b>88</b> 
</p>

<p>83. Private universities, for their part, have a little more freedom of activity, but the 
disciplinary rules applicable to students and faculty are very similar to those enforced in public 
universities. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Malaysia has invested a significant proportion of its resources in the education system 
and has achieved high levels of school attendance, particularly in primary schools, partly as 
a result of the enshrinement in law of the principle of compulsory education. It has also 
enabled young girls and adolescents to have full access to education at all levels. However, 
economic obstacles continue to hamper access to education, inasmuch as the cost-free 
principle has not yet been guaranteed. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>There is also another type of difficulty preventing full exercise of the right to 
education for all inhabitants of the country. The Special Rapporteur considers that one of 
the most serious problems is the requirement of a birth certificate as an essential 
precondition for enrolment in recognized educational institutions, particularly if account is 
taken of the extremely strict conditions for obtaining such a certificate, which exclude a 
large part of the population. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Another major challenge facing Malaysia, in the view of the Special Rapporteur, is 
the need to guarantee the rights of students and faculty members, in accordance with the 
principles applied by any modern democratic society and the international standards of 
human rights. Both students and faculty members must have the possibility of full and 
transparent participation in all processes that concern them and, above all, their rights to 
freedom of expression and association must be respected. The Special Rapporteur is 
convinced that this would make it possible to consolidate the democratization process 
which the Government is interested in promoting. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the following action by the Government of 
Malaysia: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ratify at least the basic instruments of international protection of human rights, 
that is to say, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and withdraw its 
reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. At the same time, he 
suggests that Malaysia should ratify the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against Discrimination in 
Education 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Guarantee the principle of cost-free education, irrespective of membership of an 
ethnic group or citizenship, at least in the case of primary education, with gradual 
extension to the secondary level 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Decentralize the education system, so that local authorities and all actors in the 
educational process may have a hand in the design of education policies relevant to 
them </b></p>

origin, gender, disabilities, rural and urban areas, with a view to establishing a 
policy and appropriate measures for including such children in the national 
education system 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Revise the Education Act 1996 so that children who do not have a birth certificate 
may enrol in educational institutions, thereby guaranteeing the right of education
