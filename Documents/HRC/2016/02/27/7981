1987/50, the Commission reiterated its previous calls for the full restoration of all human 
rights to the population of Cyprus, in particular to the refugees; called for the tracing of and 
accounting for missing persons in Cyprus without any further delay; and called for the 
restoration and respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots, 
including freedom of movement, the freedom of settlement and the right to property. It is in 
this light that the present report reflects a variety of human rights-related issues. 
</p>
<p> The annex to this note, prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and covering the period from 1 December 
2011 to 30 November 2012, is herewith transmitted to the Council. It provides an overview 
of human rights concerns in Cyprus, including the right to life and the question of missing 
persons, the principle of non-discrimination, freedom of movement, property rights, 
freedom of religion and cultural rights, freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to 
education. Moreover, it provides an update on activities in Cyprus to promote the 
implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), in which the Council called on 
all actors involved, when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to adopt a 
gender perspective. 
</p>
<p> The present report concludes that the persisting division of the island continues to 
constitute an obstacle to the full enjoyment in mutual confidence by the whole population 
of Cyprus of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. It stresses the importance of 
ensuring that there are no human rights protection gaps and that all persons can effectively 
enjoy their fundamental rights wherever they live.<b> </b>Addressing the underlying human rights 
</p>

<p>issues and causes should be an increasingly important part of peacekeeping efforts and also 
underpin the political dialogue for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.<b> 
</b>Moreover, it is welcome that the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
conducted a mission to Cyprus in March and April 2012, and further visits by special 
procedure mandate holders are encouraged.

<p> <b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 13 February 1975, the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 4 
(XXXI) on the question of human rights in Cyprus, in which the Commission, inter alia, 
called upon all parties concerned to adhere strictly to the principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations, international instruments in the field of human rights and the relevant 
resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council and to take urgent measures 
for the return of all refugees to their homes in safety. In resolution 361 (1974), the Security 
Council had called upon &#8220;all parties to do everything in their power to alleviate human 
</p>
<p>suffering, to ensure the respect of fundamental human rights for every person and to refrain 
from all action likely to aggravate the situation&#8221;. In resolution 3450 (XXX), the General 
Assembly expressed its grave concern about the fate of a considerable number of Cypriots 
who are missing as a result of armed conflict in Cyprus and requested the Secretary-
General to provide the Commission on Human Rights at its thirty-second session with 
information relevant to the implementation of this resolution. The Secretary-General&#8217;s first 
report on this issue (E/CN.4/1186 and Corr.1), prepared in pursuance of Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 4 (XXXI) and of General Assembly resolution 3450 (XXX), was 
submitted on 4 February 1976.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. Subsequently, in resolution 4 (XXXII) of 27 February 1976, the Commission on 
Human Rights, inter alia, recommended that the communities do their utmost to find a just 
and lasting peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem based on respect of the sovereignty, 
independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus, which 
solution would also guarantee the full enjoyment in mutual confidence by the whole 
population of Cyprus of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Commission also 
urged all parties to refrain from unilateral actions in contravention of the relevant United 
Nations resolutions, including changes in the demographic structure of Cyprus.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. Furthermore, in its resolution 1987/50 of 11 March 1987, the Commission on 
Human Rights, inter alia, reiterated its previous calls for the full restoration of all human 
rights to the population of Cyprus, in particular to the refugees; called for the tracing of and 
accounting for missing persons in Cyprus without any further delay; called for the 
restoration and respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots, 
including freedom of movement, the freedom of settlement and the right to property; and 
requested the Secretary-General to provide the Commission, at its forty-fourth session, with 
information relevant to the implementation of resolution 1987/50. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>4. Reports on the question of human rights in Cyprus were presented annually to the 
Commission on Human Rights from 1976 to 2006. In its decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006, 
the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of their activities, in accordance with all 
previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant 
reports and studies&#8221;. Since 2007, OHCHR has submitted reports on the question of human 
</p>
<p>rights in Cyprus to the Council on an annual basis.1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>5. As at 30 November 2012, Cyprus remains divided, with a buffer zone maintained by 
the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). In its resolution 2058 
(2012), adopted on 19 July 2012, the Security Council decided to extend the mandate of 
UNFICYP for a further period ending 31 January 2013. In the same resolution, the Security 
Council welcomed the progress made so far in the fully fledged negotiations to bring the 
Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a comprehensive and durable settlement, and it 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/4/59; A/HRC/7/46; A/HRC/10/37; A/HRC/13/24; A/HRC/16/21; A/HRC/19/22.  </p>


<p>welcomed the leaders&#8217; joint statements, including those of 23 May and 1 July 2008. 
</p>
<p>However, the Security Council also noted that the move towards a more intensive phase of 
negotiations has not yet resulted in an enduring, comprehensive and just settlement based 
on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant 
Security Council resolutions, and it encouraged the sides to proceed with the substantive 
negotiations on the core issues, stressing that the status quo is unsustainable.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>6. With a new Greek Cypriot leader expected to emerge as a result of presidential 
elections in the Republic of Cyprus in February 2013, the sides have been focusing on 
reinvigorating the work of the Technical Committees since April 2012. The Technical 
Committees continue to address issues that affect the daily lives of people on both sides, 
including crime and criminal matters, cultural heritage, health, economic and commercial 
matters, crisis management, humanitarian matters and the environment.2<b> 
</b></p>
<p>7. For the purpose of the report, in the absence of an OHCHR field presence in Cyprus, 
OHCHR has relied on a variety of sources with particular knowledge of the human rights 
situation on the island as well as on recent findings of international and regional human 
rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights concerns  
</b></p>
<p>8. During the reporting period from 1 December 2011 to 30 November 2012, various 
United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures discussed human rights issues in 
Cyprus and addressed relevant recommendations to Cyprus, Turkey and the de facto 
authorities in the northern part of the island, respectively. 
</p>
<p>9. In its concluding observations on Cyprus (CRC/C/CYP/CO/3-4), adopted on 15 
June 2012, the Committee on the Rights of the Child reiterated its previous observation 
&#8220;that the State party, as a consequence of events that occurred in 1974 and that resulted in 
</p>
<p>the occupation of part of the territory of Cyprus, is not in a position to exercise control over 
all of its territory and consequently cannot ensure the application of the Convention in areas 
not under its control&#8221; (para. 6).3 However, the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
remains concerned that &#8220;no information on children living in the occupied territories could 
be provided&#8221; (ibid.).4 
</p>
<p>10. In its concluding observations on Turkey (CCPR/C/TUR/CO/1), adopted on 30 
October 2012, the Human Rights Committee expressed concern that Turkey maintains its 
declarations5 and reservation made at the time of ratification of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol. The Committee voiced particular 
concern &#8220;that one of these declarations appears in fact to be a reservation limiting the effect 
</p>
<p>of the Covenant to the national territory of the State party, which could result in the 
complete non-applicability of the Covenant to persons subject to its jurisdiction in 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Information received from the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus. 
 3 See also concluding observations on the second periodic report of Cyprus, CRC/C/15/Add.205, 
</p>
<p>para. 5. 
 4 Ibid. 
 5 The declarations of Turkey include the following: &#8220;The Republic of Turkey declares that it will 
</p>
<p>implement the provisions of this Covenant only to the States with which it has diplomatic relations. 
The Republic of Turkey declares that this Convention is ratified exclusively with regard to the 
national territory where the Constitution and the legal and administrative order of the Republic of 
Turkey are applied.&#8221; Available from http://treaties.un.org. See also the summary records of the 
Human Rights Committee&#8217;s meetings on 17 and 18 October 2012 (CCPR/C/SR.2927, paras. 17, 28, 
33, 36 and 37; CCPR/C/SR.2928, paras. 5 and 36; CCPR/C/SR.2929, para. 40). </p>


<p>situations where its troops or police forces operate abroad&#8221; (para. 5). The Committee 
recommended that Turkey should consider withdrawing its reservation and declarations, 
noting that in accordance with the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 31 (2004) on the 
nature of the general legal obligation imposed on States Parties to the Covenant &#8220;the State 
party should ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction and effective control are afforded 
the full enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant&#8221; (ibid.).6 
</p>
<p>11. In the report on his mission to Cyprus from 29 March to 5 April 2012 
(A/HRC/22/51/Add.1), the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief addressed 
several practical recommendations to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, to the de 
facto authorities in the northern part and to other stakeholders, reiterating the &#8220;importance 
</p>
<p>of ensuring that there are no human rights protection gaps and that all persons can 
effectively enjoy their fundamental rights, including freedom of religion or belief, wherever 
they live&#8221; (para. 73).7 
</p>
<p>12. The persisting division of Cyprus continues to have consequences for a number of 
human rights issues on the whole island, including (a) the right to life and the question of 
missing persons, (b) the principle of non-discrimination, (c) freedom of movement, (d) 
property rights, (e) freedom of religion and cultural rights, (f) freedom of opinion and 
expression, and (g) the right to education. In addition, it is important to adopt a gender 
perspective when negotiating and implementing peace agreements (see below, chap. II, 
sect. H). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to life and the question of missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>13. According to article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to life, liberty and security of person. Furthermore, article 1 of the Declaration on 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance provides that any act of 
enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity, placing the persons subjected 
thereto outside the protection of the law and inflicting severe suffering on them and their 
families; any act of enforced disappearance also violates or constitutes a grave threat to the 
right to life.  
</p>
<p>14. The Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (CMP)8 continued the exhumation, 
identification and return of the remains of missing persons. As a result of the inter-
communal fighting in 1963 and 1964, as well as the events of July 1974 and afterwards, a 
total of 1,493 Greek Cypriots and 502 Turkish Cypriots have been officially reported as 
missing by both communities to the CMP. In July 2012, CMP contracted the International 
Commission on Missing Persons to perform the typing of the DNA samples from the 
relatives of missing persons, while further identifications of the remains are carried out by a 
team consisting of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot geneticists at the Committee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>anthropological laboratory at the United Nations Protected Area in Nicosia together with 
  
</p>
<p> 6 The Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 31 (para. 10) provides that: &#8220;States Parties are 
required by article 2, paragraph 1, to respect and to ensure the Covenant rights to all persons who may 
be within their territory and to all persons subject to their jurisdiction. This means that a State party 
must respect and ensure the rights laid down in the Covenant to anyone within the power or effective 
control of that State Party, even if not situated within the territory of the State Party.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 7 See also A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, paras. 74-87. 
 8 The Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus was established in April 1981 by agreement between 
</p>
<p>the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities under the auspices of the United Nations. 
According to its terms of reference the Committee neither attempts to attribute responsibility for the 
death of any missing persons nor makes findings as to the cause of such death (see www.cmp-
cyprus.org/media/attachments/CMP/CMP%20docs/Terms_of_Reference_1981.pdf).  </p>


<p>the CMP anthropologists. As at 30 November 2012, the remains of 896 individuals had 
been exhumed on both sides of the buffer zone by the Committee&#8217;s bicommunal teams of 
</p>
<p>archaeologists; the remains of 592 missing persons have been analysed in the initial phase 
at the Committee&#8217;s bicommunal anthropological laboratory; and the remains of 336 missing 
</p>
<p>individuals (269 Greek Cypriots and 67 Turkish Cypriots) have been identified and 
returned to their respective families.9  
</p>
<p>15. In its resolutions 2026 (2011) and 2058 (2012), the Security Council highlighted the 
importance of the activities of the Committee on Missing Persons and urged all parties to be 
more forthcoming in accommodating the Committee&#8217;s exhumation requirements 
</p>
<p>throughout the island, including in military areas in the north. After the initial statement by 
the Turkish military that the Committee must first exhaust all locations in the civilian areas, 
the Committee has been given access to the military control areas on a case-by-case basis; 
no request was denied so far and the Turkish military has granted permission to the 
Committee to dig in the military control areas sixteen times since 2006.10 
</p>
<p>16. On 3 April 2012, the European Court of Human Rights delivered two inadmissibility 
decisions with regard to the issue of missing persons in the cases of <i>Emin and Others </i>v.<i> 
Cyprus </i>(concerning 17 Turkish Cypriot men who went missing in 1963-1964) and<i> 
Charalambous and Others </i>v.<i> Turkey </i>(concerning 29 Greek Cypriot men who went missing 
in 1974). In both decisions the Court held that a fresh obligation to investigate arose for the 
respondent States following the discovery of the missing persons&#8217; bodies, as the state of the 
</p>
<p>remains and their location gave disturbing signs of the apparent use of unlawful violence.11 
With regard to the investigations carried out since 2010, following the identification of 
bodies by the CMP in the cases at stake, the Court found that it was too early to conclude at 
this stage that the authorities&#8217; actions are a mere sham or that there is bad faith, wilful 
footdragging and calculated prevarication involved; however, the Court also noted that 
&#8220;prolonged inactivity and silence by the authorities over a more significant period of time 
</p>
<p>might eventually render such a conclusion possible, but not yet&#8221;.12 Consequently, the 
applicants&#8217; complaints under the procedural aspect of article 2 of the European Convention 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights (on the right to life) were considered premature by the Court and rejected 
as manifestly ill-founded. 
</p>
<p>17. On 6 June 2012, the Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies of the Council of Europe, 
which supervises the execution of judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, 
encouraged the steps undertaken following the identification by the CMP of missing 
persons, while underlining the urgency to make further progress in the process of effective 
investigations into deaths of persons identified.13 The Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies 
also called on the Turkish authorities to adopt a proactive approach as regards effective 
investigations into the fate of persons who are still missing and reiterated their request to 
obtain further concrete information on the steps taken by the authorities aimed at giving 
CMP and investigative officers access to all relevant information and places, in particular 
concerning military zones. The Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies noted that a certain

and <i>Varnava and Others </i>v. <i>Turkey</i> (applications Nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 
16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90). </p>


<p>number of questions are raised in this context, among which the investigators&#8217; access to 
</p>
<p>forensic data and evidence found and/or conserved by CMP, and invited the Turkish 
authorities to provide replies to all the questions raised by the Committee, while also 
drawing on all relevant information contained in military archives and reports. Concerning 
the case of <i>Varnava and Others </i>v.<i> Turkey</i>, the Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies called 
upon the authorities to provide further information on the conduct of investigations in the 
cases in issue in this judgment, as well as on the payment of just satisfaction granted by the 
Court. 
</p>
<p>18. In its concluding observations on Turkey (CAT/C/TUR/CO/3), the Committee 
against Torture expressed concern in particular at &#8220;the lack of information on progress in 
</p>
<p>investigating disappearances cases for which the State party has been found in violation of 
articles 2, 3 and 5 under the European Convention on Human Rights (<i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> and 
<i>Timurtas v. Turkey</i> of the European Court of Human Rights)&#8221; (para. 9). According to the 
Committee, &#8220;this lack of investigation and follow-up raises serious questions with respect 
to the State party&#8217;s failure to meet its obligations under the Convention and, as concluded 
by the European Court of Human Rights, constitutes a continuing violation with respect to 
relatives of the victims (arts. 12 and 13)&#8221; (ibid.). The Committee recommended Turkey to 
take prompt measures to ensure effective, transparent and independent investigations into 
all outstanding cases of alleged disappearances, including those cited by the European 
Court of Human Rights, carry out prosecutions as appropriate, and notify relatives of the 
victims of the outcomes of such investigations and prosecutions. The Committee 
furthermore called upon Turkey to consider signing and ratifying the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>19. The Human Rights Committee expressed concern in its concluding observations on 
Turkey (CCPR/C/TUR/CO/1) that &#8220;no comprehensive approach to cases of enforced 
disappearance and exhumations has been adopted, including in those cited by the European 
Court of Human Rights (<i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> and numerous other individual cases)&#8221; (para. 
11). The Committee recommended that Turkey &#8220;should ensure the effective, transparent 
and independent investigations into all outstanding cases of alleged disappearances&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>that in all such cases it &#8220;should prosecute and punish the perpetrators and grant effective 
reparation, including appropriate compensation, to victims or their families&#8221; (ibid.). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>20. According to article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all are equal 
before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.14 
Furthermore, all are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and against any incitement to such 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>21. Cyprus is still considered to have the highest proportion of internally displaced 
persons in terms of the percentage of its population (up to 22 per cent).15 In the area under 
the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, there were up to 208,000 of 
internally displaced persons at the end of 2011, including over 86,000 people born to 
people with displaced status. Discrimination against children of internally displaced women 
with &#8220;refugee status&#8221; in access to the status partially ended in 2011, as the children of 
women with displaced person status became eligible for more of the same benefits as 
</p>
<p>  
 14 See also article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
 15 Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre of the Norwegian Refugee Council, <i>Global Overview 2011 
</i></p>
<p>&#8211;<i> People internally displaced by conflict and violence</i> (Geneva, 2012), pp. 17 and 66. </p>


<p>children of men with the status.16 However, children of women with displaced person status 
are still not accorded the status or counted by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as 
internally displaced persons, unlike the children of men with the status. 
</p>
<p>22. In its concluding observations of 15 June 2012 (CRC/C/CYP/CO/3-4), the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed its concern at the policy of Cyprus of 
issuing children of internally displaced persons a certificate of refugee status instead of a 
refugee identity card, resulting in limitations on the housing schemes that they are eligible 
for,<b> </b>and the Committee urged Cyprus to ensure that children of internally displaced persons 
have equal access to all essential services, including housing schemes (paras. 46 and 47).  
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, the Committee<b> </b>on the Rights of the Child<b> </b>remained concerned that<b> 
</b>there continues to be discrimination against children of Turkish origin and other minorities. 
In accordance with article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Committee 
urged Cyprus to increase its efforts to adopt a proactive and comprehensive strategy to 
eliminate discrimination on any grounds, including by considering the establishment of a 
targeted programme specifically addressing discrimination against children of Turkish 
descent and other ethnic minorities (paras. 21 and 22). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State, as well as 
the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.17 
</p>
<p>25. In Cyprus, however, crossings between the northern and the southern parts of the 
island are still possible only through official crossing points, which limits freedom of 
movement. During the reporting period, UNFICYP recorded more than 1,370,000 official 
crossings through the buffer zone.18 The &#8220;Green Line&#8221; Regulation (EC) 866/2004 continues 
to define the terms under which provisions of European Union law apply to the movement 
of persons, goods and services across the line between the northern and the southern parts. 
In the eighth report on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) 866/2004, the 
European Commission noted that the Green Line Regulation provided a stable legal 
framework for the free movement of Cypriots, other European Union citizens and third-
country nationals who cross the Green Line at authorized crossing points.19 While there was 
a slight increase in the number of Greek Cypriots crossing the line in 2011, the number of 
Turkish Cypriots, non-Cypriot European Union citizens and third-country nationals 
crossing the line decreased slightly. The Ledra Street/Lokma&#231;&#305; crossing point continued to 
account for the vast majority of crossings by non-Cypriots, primarily tourists. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief noted in his mission report 
(A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, paras. 38, 46, 51, 55, 71, 77 and 85) that the opening of a number of 
crossing points since 2003 allows people &#8211; albeit not all &#8211; to move about more or less freely 
and have access to religious sites previously inaccessible to them. However, the Special 
Rapporteur also referred to the case of the Greek Orthodox Bishop of Karpasia, whose 
name had been put by the de facto authorities on a &#8220;stop-list&#8221; since January 2012, with the 
result that he has been prohibited from visiting his Bishopric which lies in the northern part. 
The de facto authorities argued that they did not recognize his title and that he was &#8220;well-

<p>known for his past statements aimed at stirring [up] enmity and hatred&#8221;. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recommended that the de facto authorities should respect the right of religious 
leaders to visit their community in the northern part without undue restrictions. The Special 
Rapporteur also referred to instances where pilgrimages from the northern part, including 
settlers from Turkey and their descendants, to the Hala Sultan Tekke in the southern part 
have been stopped, with the result that those who had not entered the Republic of Cyprus 
from the &#8220;legal points of entry&#8221; were prevented from crossing the checkpoints if they wish 
</p>
<p>to visit Hala Sultan Tekke and other religious sites. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
recommended that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus should respect pilgrimages, 
including visits to the Hala Sultan Tekke, as an inextricable part of freedom of religion or 
belief, whose rank as a universal human right should not be supplanted by citizenship 
issues. 
</p>
<p>27. With regard to freedom of residence, nine Maronite families and two Greek Cypriots 
had asked UNFICYP to convey their request to reside permanently in their traditional 
villages in the north, however, during the reporting period no answer has been received 
from the Turkish Cypriot authorities on these requests.20 
</p>
<p><b> D. Property rights 
</b></p>
<p>28. According to article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to own property alone as well as in association with others, and no one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his property. 
</p>
<p>29. With regard to property claims of Turkish Cypriots in the southern part, the 
European Court of Human Rights on 6 March 2012 rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic 
remedies the applications of 21 Turkish Cypriot property owners who had complained 
about the restrictions on the use of their property within the Republic of Cyprus. The 
European Court of Human Rights concluded that the new provisions in the Turkish-Cypriot 
Properties Law 139/1991, as amended on 7 May 2010, &#8220;are formulated in broad terms and 
by express reference to the guarantees of the Convention as interpreted by this Court&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>allowing the applicants to make a claim to the Custodian alleging a violation of their 
Convention rights and, in the absence of a favourable response, to lodge a case in the 
District Court.21 The European Court of Human Rights therefore could not exclude that the 
amended Turkish-Cypriot Properties Law 139/1991 provides an accessible and effective 
framework of redress in respect of complaints about interference with the property owned 
by Turkish Cypriots.22 
</p>
<p>30. With regard to property claims of Greek Cypriots in the northern part, the European 
Court of Human Rights on 10 January 2012 awarded eight applicants between EUR 
100,000 and EUR 8,000,000 for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage (in total more than 
EUR 20 million).23 In its principal judgement, delivered on 2 November 2010, the Court 
held in particular that there had been a violation of the right of eight of the applicants to 
peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, most of which are located in Famagusta, and that

<p>the right to respect for private and family life had been violated with regard to seven of the 
applicants.24 
</p>
<p>31. As at 30 November 2012, a total of 4,157 applications had been lodged with the 
Immovable Property Commission;25 291 of them have been concluded through friendly 
settlements and nine through formal hearing. The Commission has paid 93,833,265 pounds 
sterling to the applicants as compensation. Moreover, the Commission has ruled for 
exchange and compensation in two cases, for restitution in one case, as well as for 
restitution and compensation in five. In one case, the Commission delivered a decision for 
restitution after the settlement of the Cyprus issue, and in another case it ruled for partial 
restitution. 
</p>
<p>32. In July 2012, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus reportedly approved the 
exchange of land belonging to Greek Cypriot refugee Michael Tymvios near Tymvou 
village in the northern part with Turkish Cypriot land in Larnaca in the southern part. This 
approval came four years after the European Court of Human Rights welcomed an 
agreement reached between Mr. Tymvios and Turkey, which provides for the payment of 1 
million USD to the applicant and the exchange of property insofar as the exchange decision 
can be executed within the control and power of the authorities in the northern part.26 
Subsequently, Mr. Tymvios filed domestic lawsuits at the Larnaca District Court against 
Cyprus for initially refusing to allow the transfer of title deeds. 
</p>
<p>33. In his mission report, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief noted 
that unsettled property issues and fear of deprivation of real estate in the northern part, in 
particular in connection with a restrictive and unfair handling of inheritance claims by the 
administration in the northern part, continue to cause bitterness in the Christian Orthodox 
community. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the de facto authorities should 
handle heritage claims of Christian minorities in the northern part, including real estate 
issues, in a fair and transparent manner, which would be an important signal for the 
Christian minorities that they have long-term prospects in the region (A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, 
paras. 44 and 84). 
</p>
<p>34. On 14 February 2012, the European Parliament adopted the Declaration on the 
return of the sealed-off section of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants,27 in which the 
European Parliament called on the Government of Turkey to act according to Security 
Council resolutions 550 (1984) and 789 (1992) as well as to the recommendations of the 
2008 Report of the Committee on Petitions on petition 733/2004.28 The European 
Parliament&#8217;s Declaration stresses that the sealed-off section of Famagusta (Varosha) should 
be returned to its lawful inhabitants, who must resettle under conditions of security and 
peace. Furthermore, the European Parliament urged the European Union institutions to 
coordinate their efforts with the European Parliament to promote the cooperation of Turkey

earlier judgement of 31 July 2003, the European Court of Human Rights found that there had been 
and continued to be a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (peaceful enjoyment of possessions) as 
Mr. Tymvios was denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of his property as well as any 
compensation for the interference with his property rights.

<p>and instructed its President to forward the declaration to the European Commission, the 
Council of the European Union, the Governments of European Union member States and 
Turkey, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The latest report of the Secretary-
General on the United Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2012/507, para. 9) reiterates that the 
United Nations holds the Government of Turkey responsible for the status quo in Varosha. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of religion and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. According to article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, which includes freedom to change 
his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public 
or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.  29 
Furthermore, according to article 27, everyone has the right freely to participate in the 
cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts as well as to share in scientific 
advancement and its benefits.30 
</p>
<p>36. Access to sites and icons of religious and cultural significance continues to be 
facilitated by UNFICYP. During the reporting period, the mission facilitated 36 religious 
and commemorative events, involving 7,224 individuals, which were either held in or 
required crossing of the buffer zone. UNFICYP also continues to monitor the welfare of 
Turkish Cypriots in the south, including with regard to access to places of worship, such as 
the Hala Sultan Tekke mosque near Larnaca.31 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief addressed the current 
situation of different religious communities and the impact of the Cyprus conflict on 
freedom of religion or belief in his mission report (A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, paras. 33&#8211;57). 
With regard to the Greek Orthodox minority in the northern part of the island, he referred to 
various issues of concern, including derelict and looted churches, acts of vandalism vis-&#224;-
vis tombstones and crosses, the recent flattening of a cemetery in Trachoni village, alleged 
restrictions on holding religious services in churches in Agia Triada and Angastina in June 
and October 2012, as well as the destruction or sale of ecclesiastical vessels. Members of 
the Maronite minority in the northern part also raised issues of ongoing restrictions, such as 
lack of regular access to some of their traditional churches and monasteries which are 
located in military compounds, the recent looting of one of their traditional churches and 
cases of surveillance by the de facto authorities. While no members of the Latin and 
Armenian communities currently reside in villages in the northern part, the Special 
Rapporteur strongly recommended that the Armenian Church and Monastery complex in 
the north of Nicosia, which have been restored since July 2012 with funding coming from 
the international community, will in the future be used also for religious purposes and be 
accessible to the Armenian community. However, in a joint press release of 2 November 
2012, the United Nations Development Program-Action for Cooperation and Trust and the 
United States Agency for International Development expressed serious concerns that the 
Evkaf administration (in charge of religious foundations and related issues) had leased the 
site through a tender process that was neither fair nor transparent; the Turkish Cypriot

<p>leadership has reportedly agreed to investigate the outcome and take action as appropriate.32 
Furthermore, it is reported that more than 100 churches, chapels and monasteries in the 
northern part have been desecrated and that many churches have been converted into 
mosques or are used by the Turkish army as hospitals or military camps.33 
</p>
<p>38. With regard to Muslim minorities in the southern part, who mainly live with larger 
communities based in Larnaca and Limassol, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief noted that their situation differs structurally from the living conditions of Christian 
Orthodox and Maronite minorities in the northern part. Main concerns of Muslims in the 
southern part related to a lack of professional religious education of their youth, the alleged 
destruction of more than 30 mosques, inadequate funding for the maintenance of mosques 
and cemeteries, limited accessibility of some mosques which are open only on Fridays or 
during opening hours, which prevent Muslims from regularly praying five times a day at 
the Hala Sultan Tekke. The Special Rapporteur also received information regarding an 
arson attack on the K&#246;pr&#252;l&#252; Mosque in Limassol on 14 April 2012, which reportedly 
destroyed the front door, window and roof of the gallery; the Government of the Republic 
of Cyprus strongly condemned the intentional actions of arson and destruction of public and 
private property. It also indicated that the Turkish Cypriot Properties Management Service 
spent EUR 504,331 in 2011 for the restoration and maintenance of Muslim places of 
worship (A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, paras. 53-57). 
</p>
<p>39. In his conclusions and recommendations, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief noted that the overall picture of the island was largely shaped by the 
reality of bicommunalism, which refers &#8211; concerning religious issues &#8211; to the Greek 
Orthodox Church (plus the three official religious minorities of Armenians, Latins and 
Maronites, which have associated themselves collectively with the Greek Community) and 
Islam. While this understanding of bicommunalism undoubtedly reflects a historic and 
contemporary reality, the Special Rapporteur argued that religious diversity on the entire 
island has de facto developed beyond the confines of this concept, for example through the 
arrival of migrants, settlers and their descendants as well as new religious communities in 
the northern and southern parts (A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, paras. 72). The Special Rapporteur 
recommended that projects which may contribute to improving the relations between 
different religious and/or ethnic communities should be further strengthened, explicitly 
referring to the commendable work done by the Bi-communal Technical Committee on 
Cultural Heritage and by the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (ibid., para. 88). 
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions 
without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any 
media and regardless of frontiers. 
</p>
<p>41. With regard to freedom of expression in the northern part, it is reported that 
independent newspapers and journalists who choose to cover controversial issues are 
frequently targeted, including through attacks and death threats, for example vis-&#224;-vis 
journalists of the Turkish-language daily newspaper <i>Afrika </i>in response to critical reporting

<p>on the policy of Turkey with regard to the northern part of the island.34 While there are 
some press freedom &#8220;laws&#8221; in the northern part, the de facto authorities are allegedly hostile 
</p>
<p>to the independent press and journalists can be arrested, put on trial and sentenced under the 
unjust actions section of the &#8220;Criminal Code&#8221;.35 
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>42. According to article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to education.36 Education should be directed to the full development of the human 
personality and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; it 
should promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or 
religious groups, and it should further the activities of the United Nations for the 
maintenance of peace. Furthermore, parents have a prior right to choose the kind of 
education that is given to their children. 
</p>
<p>43. Turkish Cypriot students still face a lack of access to European Union exchange and 
educational programmes owing to the non-recognition by Cyprus of the universities in the 
northern part of the island. The framework of a scholarship scheme for the Turkish Cypriot 
community was set up by the European Commission under the European Union aid 
programme in order to compensate for the lack of mobility that would be offered by the 
Erasmus programme. The scheme allows Turkish Cypriot students and teachers to spend 
one year abroad at a university or higher education institution in the European Union, and 
the level of funding is far higher than that for Erasmus. In the academic year 2011/12, a 
total number of 92 students and teachers participated in the scheme; in the current academic 
year, 28 undergraduate students and teachers were awarded a scholarship. The European 
Commission is in contact with the Government of the Republic of Cyprus in order to 
finalize the call for applications as the 2013/14 scholarship programme will offer the 
Turkish Cypriots the option of studying at universities in the southern part of the island.37 
</p>
<p>44. During its thirty-ninth session on 15&#8211;17 November 2012, the Council of Foreign 
Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) adopted a resolution on the 
situation in Cyprus, which inter alia invites OIC member States &#8220;to encourage cooperation 
with the Turkish Cypriot universities, including the exchange of students and 
academicians&#8221;.38 
</p>
<p>45. In its concluding observations of 15 June 2012 (CRC/C/CYP/CO/3-4), the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed its concern that Cypriot Turkish-speaking 
children continue to have limited access to education, beyond the restricted context of 
language lessons, in their native language. The Committee urged the State party to take 
measures to allocate resources for ensuring that Turkish Cypriot children are provided with 
the option of receiving bilingual education, including in their mother tongue (paras. 44&#8211;45). 
Furthermore, the report of the Secretary-General (S/2012/507, para. 17) noted that there 
were no new developments regarding the establishment of a Turkish language primary 
school in Limassol.

</p>

<p>46. With regard to the situation of Greek Cypriot students in the northern part of the 
island, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief noted in his mission report 
that &#8211; despite the existence of a Greek Cypriot school in the northern part &#8211; there is a 
general feeling that young people will likely leave the villages and that the community has 
no long-term prospects in the area (A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, para. 44).  
</p>
<p>47. Furthermore, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus protested in November 
2012 that the de facto authorities had rejected the appointment of a music teacher for the 
secondary school, a primary school teacher and a nursery school teacher and terminated the 
appointment of a primary school teacher who had served in Rizokarpaso for two years. 
After the Government had provided information concerning four teachers to replace those 
rejected and an additional Greek literature teacher who will serve at the secondary school in 
Rizokarpaso, the de facto authorities reportedly rejected two new primary school teachers 
once more on 19 October 2012. In addition, out of the 128 textbooks submitted by the 
Ministry of Education and Culture, seven textbooks were not allowed to enter the north in 
September 2012, as they allegedly contain references that are objectionable to the Turkish 
Cypriot side, including the primary school textbook entitled &#8220;I Know, I Never Forget and I 
</p>
<p>Struggle&#8221; and the secondary school textbooks entitled &#8220;Anthology of Cypriot Literature&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>48. In its resolution 1325 (2000), the Security Council called on all actors involved, 
when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to adopt a gender perspective, 
including, inter alia: (a) the special needs of women and girls during repatriation and 
resettlement and for rehabilitation, reintegration and post-conflict reconstruction; (b) 
measures that support local women&#8217;s peace initiatives and indigenous processes for conflict 
resolution, and that involve women in all of the implementation mechanisms of the peace 
agreements; (c) measures that ensure the protection of and respect for human rights of 
women and girls, particularly as they relate to the constitution, the electoral system, the 
police and the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>49. In its resolutions 2026 (2011) and 2058 (2012), the Security Council noted that 
active participation of civil society groups, including women&#8217;s groups, is essential to the 
</p>
<p>political process and can contribute to making any future settlement sustainable, recalled 
that women play an important role in peace processes, and welcomed all efforts to promote 
bicommunal contacts and events including, inter alia, on the part of all United Nations 
bodies on the island.  
</p>
<p>50. Following recommendations submitted to the two leaders by an expert group 
comprising Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot women, known as the Gender Advisory 
Team in July 2011, the project team of the bicommunal &#8220;ENGAGE: Do Your Part for 
</p>
<p>Peace&#8221; initiative has developed the &#8220;Active Dialogue Network&#8221;. This process is aimed at 
</p>
<p>supporting a platform for dialogue and exchange on the peace process and for incorporating 
a gender perspective into the peace process, as called for by the Security Council in its 
resolution 1325 (2000). In his 2012 assessment report on the status of the negotiations 
(S/2012/149), the Secretary-General emphasized that women of Cyprus have an important 
stake in a durable solution to the Cyprus problem, as well as specific needs that would need 
to be addressed in the context of a settlement and he commended such initiatives from civil 
society organizations, including women&#8217;s groups, which seek to contribute to the peace 
</p>
<p>process (para. 15). The Secretary-General also called on the sides to step up their 
engagement with civil society and women&#8217;s groups, with a view to building public 
confidence in the benefits of a settlement and ensuring that, once it is reached, the 
settlement is sustainable and truly representative of the needs and aspirations of all Cypriots 
(para. 22). </p>


<p>51. On 21 September 2012, a discussion on &#8220;barriers to women&#8217;s participation in 
decision making&#8221; took place in the bicommunal rooms of the Ledra Palace hotel in the 
</p>
<p>United Nations buffer zone, organized as a follow-up of Security Council resolution 1325 
(2000).39 In the discussion, representatives of 18 non-governmental organizations presented 
nine recommendations which could be implemented with a United Nations contribution in 
order to enhance Cypriot women&#8217;s role in the Cyprus peace process. The Special Adviser to 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General on Cyprus and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
attended the gathering and received the civil society&#8217;s recommendations on behalf of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations. The recommendations were the result of a workshop that same morning 
where non-governmental organizations addressed gender issues from both the Greek 
Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities in Cyprus as they focused on the role of 
women in peace, security and decision-making. Participants raised the need for the United 
Nations to enhance the relationship between non-governmental organizations and 
stakeholders to support public consultations on policy matters. They also urged the United 
Nations to support a campaign on human security, support training for men on gender 
issues and provide technical support to a women&#8217;s dialogue on the Cyprus problem. The 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General described the concerns expressed as very 
serious, noting that there should be more gender balance in the peace process. The Special 
Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus reminded that the United Nations has raised the 
issue of gender balance with the two sides on a number of occasions and tried to promote 
greater community-level participation, in particular by engaging more women in the 
process. 
</p>
<p>52. In his mission report (A/HRC/22/51/Add.1), the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief encouraged civil society organizations to continue the important work on 
building trust between the southern and northern parts and different communities, noting 
the importance of active and equal participation of women in civil society programmes and 
interreligious dialogue initiatives (paras. 89 and 90). Referring to the Security Council&#8217;s 
call on all actors, when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to adopt a gender 
perspective, the Special Rapporteur reiterated the views of the Gender Advisory Team that 
&#8220;effective representation of women should be guaranteed in decision-making on matters 
pertaining to property held in common by minority groups and other religious or cultural 
associations administering property on behalf of communities or minority or cultural 
groups&#8221; (para. 91).40 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>There have been some positive developments on the question of human rights in 
Cyprus, such as efforts by civil society organizat</b>ions, including women&#8217;s groups, <b>to 
build sustainable trust between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots as well as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>commendable work done by bicommunal committees, including the Technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee on Cultural Heritage and the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus.  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The persisting division of the island, however, continues to constitute an 
obstacle to the full enjoyment in mutual confidence by the whole population of Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p><b>of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is important to ensure that there 
</b></p>
<p><b>are no human rights protection gaps and that all persons can effectively enjoy their 
</b></p>
<p><b>fundamental rights wherever they live.
