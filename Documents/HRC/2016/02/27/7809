<p><b>  Corrigendum

<p><b>  Paragraph 48 
</b></p>
<p>For the existing text <i>substitute</i>  </p>
<p>48. A number of countries have also established specific protections for migrant 
</p>
<p>workers, many of whom are extremely vulnerable to contemporary forms of slavery. In 
</p>
<p>2011, the Czech Republic made several legislative changes to improve protections for 
</p>
<p>migrants and reduce their vulnerability to exploitation. The Act on Residence of Foreign 
</p>
<p>Nationals was amended to require that employers cover the costs of repatriation when 
</p>
<p>foreign nationals exit the country before the expiration of their work permit. In the United 
</p>
<p>Arab Emirates, Ministerial Resolution No. 1186 of 2010 allows migrant workers to transfer 
</p>
<p>from one employer to another after their contracts expire. In 2007, the Mexican National 
</p>
<p>Migration Institute improved labour protections for migrant agricultural workers with the 
</p>
<p>intent of regularizing and reducing abuses of migrant workers.
