CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
may contain forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  The use of any of the words “development”, “anticipate”,
“continues”, “estimate”, “expect”, “may”, “project”, “should”, “believe”, or similar expressions are
intended to identify such statements.  Forward-looking statements included in this report relate to,
among other things, comments regarding further exploration and evaluation of the Montanore
Project, including drilling activities, engineering and environmental studies, environmental,
reclamation and permitting requirements and the process and timing and the costs associated
with the foregoing; the process and timing associated with the Montanore Project permitting
process, financing needs, including the financing required to fund the Company’s ongoing
activities, sources of financing and the effect of existing and future financing structures on future
financing or business combination transactions; planned expenditures and cash requirements for
the remaining two quarters of 2016; the potential effect the Company’s current litigation may have
on its planned operation; the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement; and future plans relating to the potential structures for continued exploration and
potential development of the Montanore deposit.  We believe the expectations reflected in those
forward-looking statements are reasonable.  However, we cannot assure that the expectations
will prove to be correct.  Certain cautionary statements are also included elsewhere in this report,
including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking statements.  All forward-
looking statements speak only as of the date made.  All subsequent written and oral forward-
looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements.  Except as required by law, we undertake no
obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from our expectations include, among others, those factors referenced in the
“Risk Factors” section of this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and such things as:
·whether and when the business combination transaction with Hecla will be completed;
·Mines Management's ability to meet expectations regarding the timing, completion and
accounting and tax treatments of the merger;
·the ability of Mines Management and the other parties to the merger agreement to consummate
the transaction;
·the conditions to the completion of the transaction, including the receipt of approval and
adoption of Mines Management's stockholders;
·the nature, cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings,
including any such proceedings related to the merger and instituted against Mines Management;
·the need for additional financing to continue our business and complete the underground
evaluation program and whether such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all;
·terms of proposals the Company may receive relating to the acquisition or joint venture
development of the Montanore Project;
·financial market conditions and the availability of financing, or its availability on terms
acceptable to us;
·the history of losses, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future;
·the potential depressive effect of the potential issuances of common stock or securities
exercisable or convertible to common stock on the market price of our common stock;
·future dilution of shareholders by the exercise of warrants or options, and the depressive effect
on the stock price of the existence of a significant number of outstanding warrants and options;
·the absence of proven or probable reserves, and uncertainty regarding whether reserves will be
established at our Montanore Project;
Table of Contents
·the speculative nature of exploration for mineral resources, including variations in ore grade and
other characteristics affecting mining and mineral recoveries, which involves substantial
expenditures and is frequently non-productive;
·the availability, terms, conditions, costs, timing of, or delays in receiving required governmental
permits and approvals;
·challenges by environmental groups and others to the issuance of the biological opinion and
potential challenges to other steps in the exploration and development of the Montanore Project;

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Nature of Operations:
Mines Management, Inc. (the Company) is an Idaho corporation incorporated in 1947.  The
Company acquires, explores, and develops mineral properties in North America.  The
Company’s principal mineral property interest, the Montanore Project, is held by its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Newhi Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp.  The Company’s properties, including the
Montanore property, are currently in the exploration stage; none of its properties are currently in
production.  The Company continues acquiring various permits for the Montanore Project and is
determining its feasibility for development.  The Company’s business, operations and financial
condition are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional
funding to continue its business and execute its planned advanced evaluation and delineation
drilling program at the Montanore Project.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim
financial information, as well as the instructions to Form 10-Q.  Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the
opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring
adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have
been included.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are
published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of
the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that the
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material
effect on the reported amounts of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of
operations. Operating results for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.
For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
(a)   Going concern
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the
assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. The Company is an exploration stage company and has incurred losses since the
inception of its exploration stage.  The Company does not have a recurring source of revenue or
sufficient cash to fund normal operations or meet its debt obligations without raising additional
funds.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.  On May 23, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with
Hecla Mining Company as further described in Note 6.  If the proposed merger is not completed,
the Company will need to seek additional capital or consider other alternatives, which could
include bankruptcy or the sale of some or all of its assets.
(b)   Mining properties, exploration and development costs
All exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred.  Significant property acquisition
payments for active exploration properties are capitalized, including payments to acquire mineral
rights.  Once a feasibility study has been completed and approved by management, and a
decision is made to put the ore body into production, expenditures to develop new mines, to
define further mineralization in existing ore bodies, and to expand the capacity of operating
mines, are capitalized and amortized on the units of production basis over proven and probable
reserves.  The Company charges to operations the allocable portion of capitalized costs
attributable to properties sold.  Capitalized costs are allocated to properties sold based on the
proportion of claims sold to the claims remaining within the project area.
5
Table of Contents
(c)   Fair value measurements
The Company discloses the inputs used to develop the fair value measurements for the
Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as
well as the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their
entirety fall.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1:  Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
are accessible at the measurement date.
Level 2:  Quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or other observable inputs either directly related to
the asset or liability or derived principally from corroborated observable market data.
Level 3:  Unobservable inputs due to the fact that there is little or no market activity.
(d)   Stock compensation
The Company measures and records the costs of employee services received in exchange for an
award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award, recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for such
award.  Compensation cost is recognized for awards granted and for awards modified,
repurchased or cancelled.
(e)   Net loss per share
Basic earnings or loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings or loss per share is calculated on the
basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of
potential dilutive shares during the period.  Potential dilutive shares include outstanding stock
options and warrants.  For periods in which a net loss is reported, potential dilutive shares are
excluded because they are antidilutive.  Therefore, basic loss per share is the same as diluted
loss per share for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
(f)    Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which defines
management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an
organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
periods and interim periods thereafter.  Adoption of this update is expected to affect only the
presentation and disclosures of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard, Leases (ASC 842). Under the new
guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms
of more than twelve months and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is not
able to reasonably estimate the impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements at
this time.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation –
Stock Compensation:  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is
intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements,
including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows, and
forfeitures.  This guidance is effective for years ending after December 31, 2016.  The Company
is currently assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2 — CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT:
The Company has a certificate of deposit in the amount of $1,124,055 pledged as security for a
Letter of Credit to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality as a reclamation guarantee
for the Montanore expansion evaluation program.  This certificate matures on January 3, 2017,
bears interest at the rate of 0.15% and renews automatically each

year.  This certificate of deposit is included with reclamation deposits on the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
NOTE 3 — AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES:
Available-for-sale securities are comprised of common stocks which have been valued using
quoted market prices in active markets.  The following table summarizes the Company’s
available-for-sale securities:

NOTE 5 — CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:
The Company maintains most of its cash and cash equivalents in one financial institution.  To
date, the Company has not experienced a material loss or lack of access to its invested cash or
cash equivalents; however, no assurance can be provided that access to the Company’s
invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial
markets. The total uninsured bank deposit balance on the Company’s bank statements was
approximately $1,678,000 as of June 30, 2016.
NOTE 6 — MERGER AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENTS:
Merger Agreement:
On May 23, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (“merger
agreement”) with Hecla Mining Company (“Hecla”).  Pursuant to the merger agreement and
subject to approval of the Company’s stockholders and the satisfaction of other conditions
specified in the agreement, a subsidiary of Hecla (HL Idaho Corp.) would merge with and into the
Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Hecla.  Each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock will be
exchanged for 0.2218 shares of Hecla’s common stock per the terms of the merger
agreement.  The merger agreement, as amended, may be terminated
7

in certain circumstances prior to the closing, including by either party if the Company fails to
obtain stockholder approval of the merger agreement or the merger is not consummated by the
deadline.  The original merger agreement was amended on June 29, 2016 to clarify certain terms
and provide additional information.  On July 29, 2016, the merger agreement was further
amended to extend the deadline for consummating the merger agreement to September 30,
2016.
Term Loan Agreement:
On May 23, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a term loan and security
agreement with Hecla as lender (“the term loan agreement”).  The term loan agreement provides
for a $2.3 million secured term loan which bears interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus
five percent and, as amended, matures on the earlier of September 30, 2016 or the date the
merger is completed.  The term loan becomes due and payable in full upon a change of control
or event of default (as such terms are defined in the term loan agreement) or if the merger
agreement is terminated for any reason other than a breach of the merger agreement by
Hecla.   The term loan is secured, subject to certain permitted liens, by a security interest in
substantially all of the Company’s assets, including the Montanore Project.  On July 29, 2016, the
term loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity date from August 15, 2016 to the
earlier of September 30, 2016 or the date the merger is completed.
NOTE 7 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:
Preferred Shares:
During July 2014, the Company sold to one investor 4,000 units consisting of one share of the
Company’s Series B convertible preferred stock, no par value, and a warrant to purchase the
Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a stated value of $1,000 per
unit.  Each share of Series B convertible preferred stock was immediately convertible into shares
of common stock at a conversion rate of approximately 1,271 shares of common stock for each
share of Series B convertible preferred stock (equivalent to a conversion price of $0.7866 per
share of common stock).  The conversion rate was subject to downward adjustment upon the
Company issuing or selling shares of the Company’s common stock for a per share price less
than the applicable conversion rate.  The offering yielded gross proceeds, before offering
expenses, of $4.0 million (net proceeds of $3.5 million after deducting placement agent and
investor fees and expenses and other offering expenses).  The preferred stock had no voting
rights but entitled the holder to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6% per annum per
share, payable quarterly.  The dividends were payable in either cash or common stock at the
Company’s discretion.  As of June 30, 2016, 4000 shares of the Series B 6% convertible
preferred stock had been converted into 5,085,176 shares of common stock and no shares of the
Company's Series B convertible preferred stock were outstanding.
Warrants:  Each warrant is immediately exercisable and allows the holder to purchase
approximately 636 shares of the Company’s common stock.  The warrants are not listed on a
national securities exchange and do not have the rights or privileges of a holder of common
stock, including any voting rights, until the holder exercises the warrant.  Upon the occurrence of
a Fundamental Transaction, as defined in the warrant, the Company or its successor may be
required to purchase the unexercised portion of the warrant from the warrant holder.  The
following table sets forth the exercise price and expiration date of the outstanding common stock
purchase warrants as of June 30, 2016.
Number of Warrants       Exercise Price Per Share    Expiration Date
4,000
November 30, 2018
$1.0816
Liquidation:  Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary,
holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive distributions out of the Company’s assets,
whether capital or surplus, before any distributions may be made on any other outstanding
classes of stock.  The amount received by holders of the preferred stock will be equal to the
stated value of $1,000 per share of preferred stock plus any accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon, and any other fees or liquidated damages then due and owing.
Common Shares:
During 2007, the Company sold 2,500,000 common shares in a private placement to one
investor. In connection with the stock sale, the Company entered into a Right of First Refusal
agreement (the "ROFR") which grants a twenty-year right of first proposal and a right to match
third-party proposals, to purchase all or any portion of silver mined, produced or
8

recovered by the Company in the State of Montana. The ROFR does not apply to trade sales and
spot sales in the ordinary course of business or to forward sales, in each case, for which no
upfront payment is received by the Company.

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as with the financial
statements and related notes and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report.  As
used in this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, references to “we,” “our,” the
“Company,” “Mines Management” and “us” refer to Mines Management, Inc. and its subsidiaries
collectively.
Mines Management, Inc. is an exploration stage company with a large silver-copper project, the
Montanore Project, located in northwestern Montana. During 2016, the Company continued to
seek financing or strategic alternatives, to pursue federal and state agency permitting approvals,
and plan for the advanced exploration and delineation drilling program at the Montanore Project.
Overview
·On May 23, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (“merger
agreement”) with Hecla Mining Company (“Hecla”).  Pursuant to the merger agreement and
subject to approval of the Company’s stockholders and the satisfaction of other conditions
specified in the agreement, a subsidiary of Hecla (HL Idaho Corp.) would merge with and into
the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Hecla.  Each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock will be
exchanged for 0.2218 shares of Hecla’s common stock per the terms of the merger
agreement.  The merger agreement, as amended, may be terminated in certain circumstances
prior to the closing, including by either party if the Company fails to obtain stockholder approval
of the merger agreement or the merger is not consummated by the deadline.  On July 29, 2016,
the merger agreement was further amended to extend the deadline for consummating the
merger agreement to September 30, 2016.
·On May 23, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a term loan and security
agreement with Hecla as lender (“the term loan agreement”).  The term loan agreement provides
for a $2.3 million secured term loan which bears interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus
five percent and, as amended, matures on the earlier of September 30, 2016 or the date the
merger is completed.  The term loan becomes due and payable in full upon a change of control
or event of default (as such terms are defined in the term loan agreement) or if the merger
agreement is terminated for any reason other than a breach of the merger agreement by
Hecla.   The term loan is secured, subject to certain permitted liens, by a security interest in
substantially all of the Company’s assets, including the Montanore Project.  On July 29, 2016,
the term loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity date from August 15, 2016 to the
earlier of September 30, 2016 or the date the merger is completed.
·The Company’s cash reserves as of June 30, 2016, are insufficient to continue operations
through the end of the third quarter of 2016. If the proposed merger with Hecla is not completed,
the Company will need to seek additional capital or consider other alternatives, which could
include bankruptcy or the sale of some or all of its assets.
·As of June 30, 2016, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Series B 6%
convertible preferred stock had been converted into 5,085,176 shares of common stock.
·On July 1, 2015, the Company received a letter from NYSE MKT LLC (“NYSE MKT” or the
“Exchange”) stating that it is not in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in
Section 1003(a)(i-iv) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (the “Company Guide”). In order to
maintain its listing, the Company submitted a plan on August 3, 2015, in accordance with the
Exchange’s requirement, which addressed how it intended to regain compliance with the
financial impairment standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(iv) of the Company Guide by
December 31, 2015 and the equity standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(i)-(iii) of the Company
Guide by December 31, 2016.  During September 2015, the NYSE MKT accepted the
Company’s compliance plan and granted the Company until September 30, 2015 to regain
compliance with the financial impairment standards.  On October 21, 2015, the NYSE MKT
notified the Company that the Company had made a reasonable demonstration of its ability to
regain compliance with financial impairment standards by the end of
10
Table of Contents
the revised plan period of December 31, 2015.  In January 2016, the NYSE MKT granted the
Company a further extension to regain compliance with financial impairment standards to March
31, 2016.  In April 2016, the NYSE MKT granted the Company an additional extension to June
30, 2016 because the Company had made a reasonable demonstration of its ability to regain
compliance with Section 1003(a)(iv) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide by the end of the revised
plan period.  Based on information provided by the Company through June 30, 2016 and the
Company’s May 24, 2016  press release announcing a merger agreement with Hecla, the
Exchange granted a revised plan period of no later than August 31, 2016.
Financial and Operating Results
The Company continues to expense all of its expenditures when incurred, with the exception of
equipment and buildings which are capitalized.  The Company has no revenues from mining
operations.  Financial results of operations include primarily general and administrative
expenses, permitting and maintenance of the Montanore Project, and legal, accounting, and
consulting expenses.
Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
The Company reported operating expenses of $1.2 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2016
and 2015.  The most significant differences in operating expenditures between those two
quarters include: (i) a $0.1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily due
to the lack of stock compensation and the lack of expenditures for an annual meeting  and
directors compensation during 2016, (ii) a decrease of $0.2 million in technical expenses in 2016
primarily due to the completion of the final environmental impact statement on the Montanore
Project (“FEIS”) and issuance of the federal and state records of decision, which resulted in
reduced fees paid to the contractors working on obtaining and maintaining project approvals and
permits as well as a reduction in the baseline studies associated with the Environmental Impact
Study, and (iii) a $0.3 million increase in legal, accounting and consulting fees primarily
associated with the agreement and plan of merger with Hecla.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016
The Company reported operating expenses of $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The most significant
differences in operating expenditures between those two quarters include: (i) a $0.2 million
decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily due to the lack of stock compensation
during 2016 (compared to $0.1 million during 2015) and the lack of expenditures for an annual
meeting  and director compensation during 2016 (compared to $0.1 million during 2015), (ii) a
decrease of $0.3 million in technical expenses in 2016 primarily due to the completion of the
FEIS and issuance of the records of decision, which resulted in reduced fees paid to the
contractors working on obtaining and maintaining project approvals and permits as well as a
reduction in the baseline studies associated with the Environmental Impact Study, and (iii) a $0.1
million increase in legal, accounting and consulting fees primarily associated with expenditures
related to the agreement and plan of  merger with Hecla.
Liquidity
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the net cash used in operating activities was
approximately $1.8 million, which was $0.8 million less than the net cash used in operating
activities during the same period in the prior year.  Net cash provided by financing activities
during 2016 included approximately $1.3 million provided by the term loan agreement entered
into with Hecla and $0.2 million in proceeds from stock options exercised, offset by $0.1 million
cumulative preferred stock dividends paid.  During 2015, net cash utilized by financing activities
included $0.1 cumulative preferred stock dividends paid.  The Company’s cash and cash
equivalents decreased from $1.2 million at December 31, 2015 to approximately $0.8 million at
June 30, 2016.
The Company does not currently have enough cash on hand to fund ongoing operating
expenses through the end of the third quarter of 2016. The Company expects to fund its operating
expenses during this period, prior to completion of the merger with Hecla, by borrowing the
remaining funds available from Hecla pursuant to the $2.3 million term loan described above.
The Company does not have a recurring source of revenue or sufficient cash to fund normal
operations or meet its debt obligations without raising additional funds.  These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  On May 23, 2016,
the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Hecla.  If the proposed merger
is not completed, the Company will need to seek additional capital or consider other alternatives,
which could include bankruptcy or the sale of some or all of its assets.

ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our cash balances and our long term investment certificates of deposit are denominated in U.S.
dollars in local and national banking institutions.  We manage the timing of cash required for
review of the permitting and engineering of the Montanore Project and for general corporate
purposes utilizing our money market account.  Our policy is to invest only in government
securities rated “investment grade” or better.
The market prices of base and precious metals such as silver and copper fluctuate widely and
are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of any mining company.  These factors
include expectations with regard to the rate of inflation, the exchange rates of the U.S. dollar and
other currencies, interest rates, global or regional political, economic or banking crises, and a
number of other factors.  If the market price of silver or copper should decrease, the value of the
Company’s Montanore Project could decline and the Company might not be able to recover its
investment in that project.  Any determination to develop or construct a mine would be made long
before the first revenues from production would be received.  Price fluctuations between the time
that such decisions are made and the commencement of production could affect the economics
of the mine.
ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the
Company’s Controller and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016.  Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are appropriately designed and were effective as of June 30, 2016 to give
reasonable assurances that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the
Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is also accumulated and
communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In September 2007, we filed a declaratory judgment action, Mines Management, Inc., Newhi, Inc.
and Montanore Minerals Corp. v. Tracie Fus et al., Cause No. DV 07-248 in Montana Nineteenth
Judicial District Court, Lincoln County. In this action we sought a Court judgment against certain
of the defendants that the unpatented mining claims of such defendants, allegedly located above
portions of our Libby adit and overlapping certain of our patented and unpatented mining claims,
mill sites and tunnel sites are invalid. The defendants subsequently asserted trespass claims
against us relating to our use of certain of our mining claims, mill sites and the adit. The parties
participated in a mediation in 2009 which resulted in a settlement with seven of the ten
defendants. On March 21, 2013, the Court issued an order (i) enforcing the settlement with seven
of the ten defendants, (ii) enjoining us from trespassing on certain mining claims owned by one of
the defendants, and (iii) finding that the mining claim of another defendant is valid and superior to
certain of our claims. The claims with respect to which we were enjoined from trespass do not
overlap the adit. The mining claim that the Court determined was valid and superior to certain of
our claims overlaps portions of the adit and portions of certain of our patented claims and
unpatented mill sites and tunnel sites. We do not believe that this order affects our ability to use
the adit or to conduct exploration and development operations as currently planned once we
have obtained the required permits.
The Company appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, Case No. DA 13-0240, certain portions
of the order. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Company remanding the case to the District
Court with instructions to vacate the injunction and to conduct further proceedings. In January
2014, the Supreme Court reversed the District Court on the basis of lack of findings, existence of
an issue of fact, lack of evidence regarding trespass and misplaced reliance on evidence that the
District Court relied upon with respect to claim validity. In December 2015, the District Court set
the case for trial in April 2016.  The District Court subsequently vacated and has not reset the trial
date.
On June 28, 2013 the Company filed a condemnation action, Montanore Minerals Corp. v.
Easements and Rights of Way under through and across those certain unpatented lode mining
claims et al., Cause No. CV-00133-DLC, in the United States District Court for the District of
Montana, Missoula Division. In this action we sought to acquire easements and rights of way for
the Montanore Project including for use of the adit and the construction and use of another
underground tunnel and related equipment that are contemplated by the draft environment impact
statement for the Montanore Project and other draft permits. The defendants include the
defendant in the case referenced in the preceding paragraphs whose claim was determined to be
valid and overlaps the existing adit. We filed a motion for a preliminary condemnation order and
injunction to obtain immediate access to the easements and rights-of-way and a motion to have
the court declare the subject mining claims void for failure to comply with an essential federal
filing requirement. The primary defendant filed a motion requesting the court to dismiss without
prejudice or stay the condemnation proceeding on abstention grounds and a motion to dismiss
one of the two condemnation counts.
On April 29, 2014, the U.S. District Court in Missoula granted the Company’s motion for a
preliminary condemnation order, which affirms the Company’s right of access through the Libby
adit, and its right to construct another tunnel that is planned in connection with the potential
construction of a mine. In addition, the U.S. District Court granted the Company’s motion for a
preliminary injunction for immediate right of possession, thereby preserving the Company’s
ongoing access through the adit. Our motion to declare the subject mining claims void was
denied on abstention grounds. The primary defendant’s motions to dismiss without prejudice or
stay the condemnation proceeding on abstention grounds were denied. The primary defendant’s
motion to dismiss one of the condemnation counts was denied as moot. The court decisions
referenced in this paragraph are subject to appeal. The hearing on the compensation phase of
the condemnation case was held in April 2015.  In their report issued in May 2015, the
Commissioners appointed by the court to determine the just compensation for the taking resulting
from the court’s preliminary condemnation order concluded that the amount of just compensation
to the defendants is $0. On August 7, 2015, the U.S. District Court issued its final ruling affirming
the Commission’s decision.  The defendants have appealed this ruling.
In July 2014, Frank R. Wall filed a complaint in the Montana Nineteenth Judicial District Court,
Lincoln County, Montana, Frank R. Wall vs. Patent Lode Mining claims HR 133 AND HR 134, et
al., , Case No. DV-14-140, arising out of the facts related to the litigation described above and
claiming monetary damages, declaratory judgments and other
13
Table of Contents
relief. The complaint names the Company and its subsidiaries Newhi, Inc. and Montanore
Minerals Corporation as defendants. The Company believes the allegations of the complaint are
without merit.
In January 2016, Frank R. Wall filed a complaint in the United States Federal District Court for
the District of Idaho, Frank Reginald Wall v. United States Department of Agriculture, et al.,
Cause No. CV-16-0043-BLW, claiming a violation of his constitutional rights and requesting an
injunction against the USFS record of decision for the issuance of permits to the Company for
operations at the Montanore Project.  The Company is named as one of the defendants.  The
Company believes the allegations of the complaint are without merit.
On May 27, 2016, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Montanore Minerals
Corporation, filed motions to intervene in three cases pending in the United States District Court
for the District of Montana, Missoula Division captioned (i) Save Our Cabinets et al. v. United
States Fish and Wildlife Service et al., Cause No. CV-15-69-M-DWM, (ii) Libby Placer Mining
Company v. United States Forest Service et al., Cause No. CV-16-53-M-DWM, and (iii) Save Our
Cabinets et al. v. United States Department of Agriculture, Cause No. CV-16-56-M-DWM. Each
of the actions involve claims challenging the permitting of the Montanore Project. The motions to
intervene were granted in early June 2016.
Litigation related to the Merger
Since the announcement of the merger, the Company, members of the Company’s board of
directors, Merger Sub and Hecla were named as defendants in three putative stockholder class
actions, brought by purported stockholders of the Company, challenging the proposed merger.
Two of the lawsuits were filed in the Superior Court in Spokane County, Washington, and are
captioned O’Rourke v. Dobbs, et al., No.16202116-1 (Spokane Cnty, Wash. June 6, 2016) and
Schubert v. Dobbs, et al., No. 16202667-7 (Spokane Cnty, Wash. July 14, 2016) (together, the
“state lawsuits”). The other lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Washington, and is captioned Assad v. Mines Management, Inc., et al., No. 16-cv-
00256-SMJ (E.D. Wash. July 12, 2016) (the “federal lawsuit”).
The plaintiffs in the state lawsuits generally claim that (i) the members of the Company’s board of
directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders by authorizing the merger
with Hecla for what the plaintiff asserts is inadequate consideration and pursuant to an
inadequate process and with inadequate disclosures and (ii) Hecla and Merger Sub aided and
abetted the other defendants’ alleged breach of duties. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, to
enjoin the merger, rescind the transaction or obtain rescissory damages if the merger is
consummated, obtain other unspecified damages and recover attorneys’ fees and costs.
The plaintiff in the federal lawsuit generally claims that (i) the Company and the members of
the  Company’s board of directors issued a proxy statement containing false and misleading
statements and (ii) the members of the Company’s board of directors, Hecla and Merger Sub are
liable as controlling persons of the Company. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, to enjoin
the merger, rescind the transaction or obtain rescissory damages if the merger is consummated,
require the members of the Company’s board of directors to disseminate a proxy statement that
does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material facts required
or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, obtain other unspecified
damages and recover attorneys’ fees and costs. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome
of litigation matters with certainty, each of the Company, its directors, Hecla and Merger Sub
believe that each of the lawsuits are without merit, and the parties intend to vigorously defend
against all claims asserted.
ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS
In addition to the risk factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, investors should consider carefully the following risk factors.
Risk Factors Relating to the Merger
The merger may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all.
Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business
and financial results of Mines Management.
The completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is subject to certain
conditions, including (1) approval and adoption by Mines Management stockholders, (2) the
effectiveness of certain filings with the SEC, (3) the
14
Table of Contents
absence of certain legal impediments and (4) other customary closing conditions. Mines
Management cannot assure you that the merger will be consummated on the terms or timeline
currently contemplated, or at all. Mines Management has expended and will continue to expend
a significant amount of time and resources on the merger, and a failure to consummate the
merger as currently contemplated, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on Mines
Management’s businesses and results of operations.
If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Mines Management may be adversely
affected and Mines Management will be subject to several risks, including the following:
·Mines Management being required, under certain circumstances, to pay Hecla a termination fee
of $1,000,000 plus certain of Hecla’s expenses in an amount not to exceed $200,000;
·having to pay substantial other costs and expenses relating to the proposed transaction, such as
legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees and integration costs that
have already been incurred and will continue to be incurred until closing;
·under the merger agreement, Mines Management being subject to certain restrictions on the
conduct of its business, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain business
strategies in the future if the merger is not completed;
·under the term loan agreement, the amounts loaned to Mines Management are secured by the
Montanore Project, and the associated promissory note could mature as early as September 30,
2016. Therefore, if the merger does not close, Mines Management faces the prospects of quickly
needing to repay amounts due under the term loan agreement—currently $1.4 million—or
remedial actions, which could include bankruptcy or foreclosure;
·the focus of management of each of the companies on the merger instead of on pursuing other
opportunities that could be beneficial to the companies;
·the market price of Mines Management common stock could decline to the extent that the current
market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed; and
·if the merger agreement is terminated and Mines Management’s board of directors seeks an
alternative strategic transaction, stockholders of Mines Management cannot be certain that
Mines Management will be able to find a party willing to enter into a strategic transaction on
terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Hecla has agreed to in the merger
agreement;
in each case, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having the merger completed. In
addition, if the merger is not completed, Mines Management may experience negative reactions
from the financial markets and from its employees and other stakeholders. Mines Management
could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to perform its
obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, Mines Management
cannot assure its stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect
the business, financial results and stock prices of Mines Management.
The fairness opinion rendered to Mines Management’s board of directors by Canaccord Genuity
Corp. (“CG”) was based on CG’s financial analysis and considered factors such as market and
other conditions then in effect, and other information made available to CG, as of the date of the
opinion. As a result, the opinion does not reflect changes in events or circumstances after the
date of such opinion. Mines Management’s board of directors has not obtained, and does not
expect to obtain, an updated fairness opinion from CG reflecting changes in circumstances that
may have occurred since the signing of the merger agreement.
The fairness opinion rendered to Mines Management’s board of directors by CG was provided in
connection with, and at the time of, the evaluation of the merger and the merger agreement by
Mines Management’s board of directors. The opinion was based on the financial analyses
performed, which considered market and other conditions then in effect, and other information
made available to CG, as of the date of the opinion, which may have changed, or may change,
after the date of the opinion. Mines Management’s board of directors has not obtained an
updated opinion and does not expect to
15
Table of Contents
obtain an updated opinion prior to completion of the merger. Changes in the operations and
prospects of Hecla or Mines Management, general market and economic conditions and other
factors that may be beyond the control of Hecla or Mines Management, and on which the fairness
opinion was based, may have altered the value of Hecla or Mines Management or the prices of
Hecla common stock or Mines Management common stock since the date of such opinion, or
may alter such values and prices by the time the merger is completed. The opinion does not
speak as of any date other than the date of the opinion.
The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either Hecla’s
or Mines Management’s stock price.
Upon the closing of the merger, each share of Mines Management common stock (other than
shares owned by Mines Management, Hecla or Merger Sub, which will be cancelled) will be
converted into the right to receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common stock, with cash paid in
lieu of fractional shares. This exchange ratio was fixed in the merger agreement and will not be
adjusted for changes in the market price of either Hecla common stock or Mines Management
common stock. Changes in the price of Hecla common stock prior to the effective time of the
merger will affect the value of Hecla stock that Mines Management stockholders will receive in
the merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond
the control of Hecla or Mines Management), including, without limitation, the following:
·changes in Hecla’s or Mines Management’s businesses, operations, performance and
prospects;
·changes in market assessments of the business, operations and prospects of Hecla or Mines
Management;
·investor behavior and strategies, including market assessments of the likelihood that the merger
will be completed;
·interest rates, metals prices, general market and economic conditions and other factors
generally affecting the price of Hecla’s and Mines Management’s common stock; and
·federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the
businesses in which Hecla and Mines Management operate.
The price of Hecla common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from its price on the date
the merger agreement was executed and on the date of the special meeting of Mines
Management. As a result, the market value represented by the exchange ratio will also vary.
Any delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the
merger.
In addition to the required Mines Management stockholder approval and adoption, the merger is
subject to a number of other conditions beyond Mines Management’s control that may prevent,
delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. Mines Management cannot predict
whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, obtaining the required
approval and adoption could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or
prevent it from occurring.
The merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquiror
of Mines Management or could result in any competing proposal being at a lower price than it
might otherwise be.
The merger agreement contains “no shop” provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict
Mines Management’s ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage competing
third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of Mines Management. In addition, Hecla
generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the merger and the merger agreement
in response to any competing acquisition proposals that may be made before Mines
Management’s board of directors may withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Hecla) its recommendation. In some circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement,
Mines Management may be required to pay a termination fee to Hecla and/or reimburse Hecla for
certain expenses.
These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in
acquiring all or a significant part of Mines Management from considering or proposing such an
acquisition, even if it were prepared to
16
Table of Contents
offer greater value than provided for under the merger agreement, or might result in a potential
competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay
because of the added expense of the termination fee and/or reimbursement of certain expenses
that may become payable in certain circumstances, which would represent an additional cost for
a potential third party seeking a business combination with Mines Management.
The merger will involve substantial costs.
Mines Management has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial costs and
expenses relating directly to the transaction, including fees and expenses payable to legal,
accounting and financial advisors and other professional fees relating to the transaction,
insurance premium costs, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing
fees, printing and mailing costs and other transaction-related costs, fees and expenses.
Mines Management’s officers and directors have interests in the transactions that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Mines Management’s stockholders generally.
Officers of Mines Management negotiated, with oversight and input provided by its boards of
directors, the terms of the merger agreement.  Mines Management’s board of directors approved
and adopted the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best interests of Mines Management
and its stockholders. However, Mines Management’s officers and directors may have interests in
the transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Mines Management’s
stockholders.
Mines Management stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.
Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable, enable stockholders, in connection with
certain mergers, to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined
by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders
in the merger. Under Idaho law, stockholders do not have appraisal rights if, among other
circumstances, the shares of stock they hold at the record date are listed on the NYSE or the
NYSE MKT.
Because Mines Management common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, Mines Management
stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights under Idaho law in the merger with respect to
their shares of Mines Management common stock.
In connection with the announcement of the merger agreement, putative class action lawsuits
have been filed and are pending as of the date hereof, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the
merger, and an adverse ruling in any of these lawsuits may prevent the merger from being
effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame.
While Mines Management’s directors and management team believes that the allegations in the
complaints are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against these allegations, Mines
Management cannot assure you as to the outcome of these, or any similar future lawsuits, or the
amount of the costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be
incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of these claims. If any plaintiffs are
successful in obtaining an injunction with respect to the merger, such an injunction may prevent
the completion of the merger on the agreed upon terms, in the expected time frame or altogether.
Whether the plaintiffs’ claims are successful, this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts
management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of the
businesses of Mines Management.
Risk Factors Relating to Mines Management
If the merger is not completed, Mines Management will require additional external financing to
fund its continuing business activities in the future, and the terms of any such financing, if
obtained, may have negative effects on Mines Management’s flexibility and future transactions.
Mines Management is an exploration stage mining company and currently does not have
sufficient capital to continue its business activities as planned through 2016 or to fund the
activities needed to establish the economic feasibility of the Montanore Project. Mines
Management had approximately $0.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016,
which is insufficient to fund its business and operations through 2016. Mines Management
anticipates that its
17
Table of Contents
expenses in 2016 would total approximately $1.0 million for regulatory and environmental
monitoring activities and $1.5 million of general and administrative expenses, assuming that
Mines Management were able to obtain sufficient capital to continue operations. Mines
Management estimates that, following the completion of environmental mitigation activities, the
costs of completing the exploratory drilling program at the Montanore Project will be
approximately $20.0 to $25.0 million, plus general and administrative expenses during the period
in which the drilling program is being conducted. Uncertainties surrounding the exploratory
drilling program and the permitting process could require the drilling program to take longer and
cause costs to increase. Mines Management’s cash on hand is not sufficient to continue its
business through 2016 or to commence the exploratory drilling program and a bankable
feasibility study, and external financing will be required.
If the merger is not completed, Mines Management plans to continue its efforts to secure external
financing but it presently does not have agreements from any source under which such financing
will be received, and its recent efforts to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all, other than
from Hecla in connection with the merger, have been unsuccessful. There can be no assurance
that Mines Management will be successful in obtaining external financing or entering into a sale
of Mines Management, a sale or joint venture of the Montanore Project, or other type of
transaction that will permit it to repay amounts due to Hecla under the term loan agreement or
continue its business, or that the terms of any such financing or transaction would not make future
financings or transactions more difficult or otherwise limit Mines Management’s flexibility or
opportunities in the future. There can be no assurance that any financing obtained will not be
highly dilutive to existing stockholders. In addition, it is uncertain that the amount of any financing
that might be obtained would enable Mines Management to repay amounts due to Hecla under
the term loan agreement or continue its business and operations for more than a few months. If
no additional funding can be secured, Mines Management may not be able to remain in business
or to complete a transaction with respect to the Montanore Project or any other transaction.
Finally, the amounts owed to Hecla under the term loan agreement —currently $1.4 million—are
secured by the Montanore Project, and if Mines Management is unable to repay Hecla, it could
face the prospects of losing title to Montanore through foreclosure or other similar remedial
measures.
If Mines Management is unable to comply with the NYSE MKT continued listing requirements, its
common stock could be delisted from the NYSE MKT equities market. Delisting could negatively
affect its stock price and investors’ ability to make transactions in its securities.
On July 1, 2015, Mines Management received a letter from NYSE MKT stating that Mines
Management was not in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section
1003(a)(i-iv) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (the “Company Guide”). In order to maintain its
listing, Mines Management submitted a plan on August 3, 2015, in accordance with the NYSE
MKT’s requirement, which addresses how it intends to regain compliance with the financial
impairment standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(iv) of the Company Guide by December 31,
2015 and the equity standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(i)-(iii) of the Company Guide by
December 31, 2016. During September 2015, the NYSE MKT accepted the Company’s
compliance plan and granted Mines Management until September 30, 2015 to regain compliance
with the financial impairment standards. On October 21, 2015, the NYSE MKT notified Mines
Management that Mines Management had made a reasonable demonstration of its ability to
regain compliance with financial impairment standards by the end of the revised plan period of
December 31, 2015. In January 2016, the NYSE MKT granted Mines Management a further
extension to regain compliance with financial impairment standards to March 31, 2016. In April
2016, the NYSE MKT granted Mines Management an additional extension to June 30, 2016
because Mines Management had made a reasonable demonstration of its ability to regain
compliance with Section 1003(a)(iv) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide by the end of the revised
plan period and, in July 2016, the NYSE MKT granted an additional extension to August 31,
2016. If the merger is not completed, it is uncertain that Mines Management will be able to obtain
sufficient external financing to continue its business and operations for more than a few months,
which would be unlikely to satisfy the NYSE MKT financial impairment listing requirements.
There can be no assurance that Mines Management common stock will remain listed on the
NYSE MKT. If Mines Management is delisted from the NYSE MKT, Mines Management
anticipates that its common stock will trade over the counter. If Mines Management common
stock is delisted from the NYSE MKT, its stockholders may face material adverse consequences,
including, but not limited to, a decrease in the price of its common stock and reduced liquidity in
the trading market for its common stock. Some stockholders may sell their shares, and Mines
Management’s ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future
may be negatively affected. Mines Management would no longer be able to use a short form
Form S-3 registration statement (i) for a primary offering, if Mines Management public float is not
at least $75.0 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing the Form S-3,
18
Table of Contents
or a re-evaluation date, whichever is later, and (ii) to register the resale of its securities by
persons other than Mines Management. If Mines Management were unable to utilize a Form S-3
registration statement for primary and secondary offerings of Mines Management common stock,
Mines Management would be required to file a Form S-1 registration statement, which, due to
regulatory review periods, could delay Mines Management’s ability to raise funds in the future,
may limit the type of offerings of common stock Mines Management could undertake and could
increase the expenses of any offering.
If Mines Management common stock were delisted and determined to be a “penny stock,” a
broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade Mines Management common stock and an
investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of Mines Management common stock in
the secondary market.
If Mines Management common stock were removed from listing with the NYSE MKT, it may be
subject to the so-called “penny stock” rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a
penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject
to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any
transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice
requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If Mines Management common
stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult
to trade Mines Management common stock, and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or
dispose of Mines Management common stock on the secondary market.
Mines Management has no proven or probable reserves.
Mines Management is currently in the exploration stage and has no proven or probable reserves,
as those terms are defined by the SEC, on any of Mines Management’s properties, including the
Montanore Project. The mineralized material identified to date in respect of the Montanore
Project has not demonstrated economic viability and Mines Management cannot provide any
assurance that mineral reserves with economic viability will be identified on that property.
In order to demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves under SEC guidelines, it
would be necessary for Mines Management to advance the exploration of the Montanore Project
by significant additional delineation drilling to demonstrate the existence of sufficient mineralized
material with satisfactory continuity. If successful, the results of this drilling program would
provide the basis for a feasibility study demonstrating with reasonable certainty that the
mineralized material can be economically extracted and produced. Mines Management does not
currently have sufficient data to support a feasibility study of the Montanore Project, and in order
to perform the drilling to support such a feasibility study, Mines Management must first obtain
external financing and complete environmental mitigation activities to continue its exploration
efforts. It is possible that, even if Mines Management obtains sufficient geologic data to support a
feasibility study on the Montanore Project, the data will lead it to conclude that none of the
identified mineral deposits can be economically and legally extracted or produced. If Mines
Management cannot adequately confirm or discover any mineral reserves of precious metals at
the Montanore Project, it may not be able to generate any revenues.
Even if Mines Management discovers mineral reserves at the Montanore Project in the future that
can be economically developed, the initial capital costs associated with development and
production of any reserves found is such that Mines Management might not be profitable for a
significant time after the initiation of any development or production. The commercial viability of a
mineral deposit once discovered is dependent on a number of factors beyond Mines
Management’s control, including particular attributes of the deposit such as size, grade and
proximity to infrastructure, as well as metal prices. In addition, development of a project as
significant as the Montanore Project will likely require significant debt financing, the terms of
which could contribute to a delay of profitability.
Even if Mines Management’s exploration efforts at the Montanore Project are successful, Mines
Management may not be able to raise the funds necessary to develop the Montanore Project.
If Mines Management’s exploration efforts at the Montanore Project are successful, a Preliminary
Economic Assessment completed in November 2010 indicated that it would cost approximately
$550.0 million in additional financing to develop and construct the Montanore Project. If and
when an updated assessment is completed, this amount could increase significantly. Sources of
external financing could include bank debt financing, smelter offtake financings,
19
Table of Contents
equity financing or the sale of all or a portion of the Montanore Project. Even if a bankable
feasibility study is completed, commodity prices, the then-current state of financial markets or
other factors may render financing for the development of the Montanore Project difficult or
impossible. Financing has become significantly more difficult to obtain in the current market
environment. There can be no assurance that Mines Management will commence production at
the Montanore Project or generate sufficient revenues to meet its obligations as they become due
or obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and Mines Management may not be
able to secure the financing necessary to begin or sustain production at the Montanore Project. If
Mines Management cannot adequately finance its exploration of the Montanore property and its
subsequent development, Mines Management will not be able to generate any revenues. In
addition, should Mines Management incur significant losses in future periods, it may be unable to
continue as a going concern, and realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in other than
the normal course of business may be at amounts significantly different than those included in
Mines Management’s periodic reports.
Additional permits will be required and may be delayed during advancement of the Montanore
Project.
In the ordinary course of business, mining companies are required to seek governmental permits
for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations. Although the
final RODs were issued on February 12, 2016, additional permits will be required for
advancement of the Montanore Project. Obtaining these permits has been and continues to be a
complex and time consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involves
additional work and studies, public hearings, litigation and other costly undertakings. Mines
Management has been engaged in renewing or pursuing permits since early 2005. Obtaining
required permits for the Montanore Project has been and may continue to be more difficult due to
its location within the Cabinet Wilderness Area and its proximity to a core habitat of certain
protected species, including the grizzly bear and bull trout. In addition, Hecla is seeking to permit
its Rock Creek mining project near the Montanore Project, and the impact of that operation on the
environment and on wildlife in the area was taken into consideration in Mines Management’s
permitting determinations and has lengthened its permitting process and made those
determinations more difficult. Private political groups have been active in opposing permitting of
projects in and near the Cabinet Wilderness Area and have taken and may in the future take
actions to oppose or delay the Montanore Project. For example, Save Our Cabinets, Earthworks
and Defenders of Wildlife filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Montana against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) challenging the issuance of the
Montanore biological opinion. Two other lawsuits challenging the permitting of the Montanore
Project have since been filed.
Mining projects require the evaluation of environmental impacts for air, water, vegetation, wildlife,
cultural, historical, geological, geotechnical, geochemical, soil and socioeconomic conditions.
Permits are required for, among other things, storm-water discharge, air quality, wetland
disturbance, dam safety (for water storage and/or tailing storage), septic and sewage and water
rights appropriation, and compliance must be demonstrated with the Endangered Species Act
and the National Historical Preservation Act. Permitting costs through June 30, 2016 have totaled
approximately $47.1 million, and it is possible that the costs and delays associated with
compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that Mines Management
would be unable to raise sufficient funds to proceed with the further exploration, development or
operation of a mine at the Montanore Project.
Mines Management has a history of losses and expects losses to continue.
As an exploration stage company that has no production history, Mines Management has
incurred losses since its inception, and it expects to continue to incur additional losses for the
foreseeable future. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, Mines Management
incurred losses of $2.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, Mines
Management had an accumulated deficit of $92 million. There can be no assurance that Mines
Management will achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
The title to some of Mines Management’s properties may be uncertain or defective.
Although the Montanore deposit is held by patented mining claims, a significant portion of Mines
Management’s United States mineral and surface use rights consist of “unpatented” mining and
millsite claims created and maintained in accordance with the General Mining Law. Unpatented
mining and millsite claims are unique U.S. property interests and are generally considered to be
subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented
mining and millsite claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex
federal and state laws and regulations that supplement the General Mining Law. Also,
unpatented mining and millsite claims and
20
Table of Contents
related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to possible challenges by third
parties or contests by the federal government. The validity of an unpatented mining or millsite
claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a
complex body of federal and state statutory and decisional law. In addition, there are few public
records that definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining and
millsite claims. Mines Management has not filed a patent application for any of its unpatented
mining and millsite claims that are located on federal public lands in the United States and, under
current law and possible future legislation to change the General Mining Law, patents may not be
available. Mines Management has obtained a title opinion on some of the patented mining claims
covering the Montanore deposit, but not on all of its patented mining claims. Mines Management
has not obtained title opinions on any of its unpatented mining or millsite claims.
Mines Management’s ability to conduct exploration, development, mining and related activities
may also be impacted by administrative actions taken by federal agencies. With respect to
unpatented millsites, for example, the ability to use millsites and their validity has been subject to
greater uncertainty since 1997. In November of 1997, the Secretary of the Interior approved a
Solicitor’s Opinion which concluded that the General Mining Law imposed a limitation that only a
single five-acre millsite may be claimed or used in connection with each associated and valid
unpatented or patented lode mining claim. Subsequently, however, on October 7, 2003, the new
Secretary of the Interior approved an Opinion by the Deputy Solicitor which concluded that the
mining laws do not impose a limitation that only a single five-acre millsite may be claimed in
connection with each associated unpatented or patented lode mining claim. Current federal
regulations do not include the millsite limitation. There can be no assurance, however, that the
Department of the Interior will not seek to re-impose the millsite limitation at some point in the
future.
Other actions have been periodically brought, including one action that is currently ongoing,
against the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), seeking to impose the five-acre millsite
limitation, as well as to require mining claimants to pay fair market value for their use of the
surface of federal lands where those claimants have not demonstrated the validity of their
unpatented mining claims and millsites. To date, such actions have not been successful, but
there can be no assurances they or other actions will not be in the future.
In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the
General Mining Law, as well as legislation that would make comprehensive changes to the law.
Although no such legislation has been adopted to date, there can be no assurance that such
legislation will not be adopted in the future. If adopted, such legislation, if it included concepts
that have been part of previous legislative proposals, could, among other things, (i) adopt the
millsite limitation discussed above, (ii) impose time limits on the effectiveness of plans of
operation that may not coincide with mine life, (iii) impose more stringent environmental
compliance and reclamation requirements, (iv) establish a mechanism that would allow states,
localities and Native American tribes to petition for the withdrawal of identified tracts of federal
land from the operation of the General Mining Law, (v) allow for administrative determinations
that mining would not be allowed in situations where undue degradation of the federal lands in
question could not be prevented and (vi) impose royalties on silver and copper production or fees
on tons of material moved from unpatented mining claims located on federal lands or impose
fees on production or tons of material moved from patented mining claims. If adopted, such
legislation could have an adverse impact on earnings from Mines Management’s operations,
could reduce estimates of any reserves Mines Management may establish and could curtail its
future exploration and development activity on federal lands or patented claims.
While Mines Management does not believe that title to any of its properties is defective, title to
mining properties is subject to potential claims by third parties claiming an interest in them. For
example, in September 2007, Mines Management filed a declaratory judgment action captioned
Mines Management, Inc., Newhi, Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp. v. Tracie Fus et al., Cause
No. DV 07-248 in Montana Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Lincoln County. In this action,
Mines Management sought a court judgment against certain of the defendants that the
unpatented mining claims of such defendants allegedly located above portions of Mines
Management’s adit and overlapping certain of its patented and unpatented mining claims,
millsites and tunnel sites are invalid. The defendants then asserted trespass claims against
Mines Management relating to Mines Management’s use of certain of its mining claims, millsites
and the adit. The parties participated in a mediation in 2009, which resulted in a settlement with
seven of the ten defendants. In mid-March 2013 the court issued an order (i) enforcing the
settlement with seven of the ten defendants, (ii) enjoining Mines Management from trespassing
on certain mining claims owned by one of the defendants and (iii) finding that the mining claim of
another defendant is valid and superior to certain of Mines Management’s claims. The claims
with respect to which Mines Management was enjoined from trespass do not overlap the adit.
The mining claim that the court
21
Table of Contents
determined was valid and superior to certain of Mines Management’s claims overlaps portions of
the adit and portions of certain of its patented claims and unpatented mill sites and tunnel sites.
Mines Management appealed to the Montana Supreme Court with respect to certain portions of
the order. The Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of Mines Management, remanding the case
to the district court with instructions to vacate the injunction and to conduct further proceedings.
Mines Management does not believe that this order, if re-entered by the district court, would affect
its ability to use the adit or to conduct exploration and development operations as currently
planned once Mines Management has obtained the required permits.
Mines Management is obligated by a right of first refusal agreement relating to its future silver
production that may affect the willingness of third parties to enter into silver purchase agreements
with it.
In November 2007, Mines Management entered into a right of first refusal agreement with a
significant stockholder that granted to that stockholder a 20-year right of first proposal and a right
to match third-party proposals to purchase a silver stream, i.e., all or any portion of silver mined,
produced or recovered by Mines Management in the State of Montana. The right does not apply
to trade sales and spot sales in the ordinary course of business or forward sales. The existence
of this agreement may make other potential buyers less likely to negotiate with Mines
Management to purchase silver Mines Management produces since they would be subject to this
right of first refusal.
