<p>49. In response to increasing reports of violence against women, OHCHR, the Office of 
the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers conducted a joint field mission to the five 
most affected districts in the eastern region in July 2009. Following the visit and other 
expressions of concern, the Prime Minister announced a year-long campaign to combat 
violence against women, which was launched on 25 November. OHCHR welcomes this 
promising initiative, while noting the magnitude of the challenge.<b>
