<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report provides the observations and findings of the Working Group on the question 
of the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the 
rights of peoples to self-determination on its visit to Ecuador, which took place from 28 August 
to 1 September 2006.  During the visit, the Working Group delegation held meetings in Quito, 
Porto Viejo and Manta.  The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the Government of 
Ecuador for its cooperation and constructive consultations. 
</p>
<p> The visit to Ecuador forms part of an assessment by the Working Group on a regional 
tendency in Latin America towards the privatization of security services, including the 
recruitment in recent years of nationals of countries in the region by private military and security 
companies (referred to as PMSCs) to perform security services in foreign countries.  During its 
visit to Ecuador, the Working Group intended to verify information received concerning one of 
these private security companies, &#8220;Epi Security and Investigations&#8221;, which was said to post 
advertisements in the press and recruit individuals.  The Working Group focused its visit on five 
issues:  (a) national mechanisms and legislation, including licensing and registration, to ensure 
that PMSCs in Ecuador operate within a legal framework in accordance with human rights 
standards; (b) the status of foreign staff and Ecuadorian nationals working in private military and 
security companies operating in Manta, including concerns of immunity and impunity; (c) the 
contracting of foreigners by PMSCs based in Manta, possibly subsidiaries of foreign companies, 
to work abroad, including in countries in conflict; (d) PMSCs and army protection of oil 
companies and the effects of these activities on local populations; (e) the involvement of PMSCs 
in the aerial spraying of narcotic crops under the &#8220;Plan Colombia&#8221; and the impact on the 
environment and the population.  The Working Group notes recent developments adopted by 
the Government of Ecuador, including 2003 Law on Monitoring and Private Security, and 
2005 Law on Subcontracting, which aims at enhancing the protection of labour conditions of 
subcontractors.  This legislation could hold significant potential, considering that security guards 
in Ecuador are commonly exploited and work in inhuman conditions.  The Working Group was 
informed of the ongoing elaboration of accompanying regulations, which provide for tripartite 
arrangements involving the Government, private companies and labour union representatives.  
The Working Group welcomes the fact that arrangements will include social assistance and 
psychological support for PMSC staff..  This is important given the high suicide rates of 
personnel in the security-services sector. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recommends, inter alia, that the Government of Ecuador: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Accede swiftly to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consider incorporating the legal obligations thereof by means of a separate national 
law, or inclusion of mercenary acts as an offence in the Criminal Code; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Complete promptly the investigations surrounding the PMSC &#8220;Epi Security and 
Investigations&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure effective remedies to those affected by the involvement of private military and 
security companies in the spraying programme under &#8220;Plan Colombia&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Ecuador, the Working Group on the question of 
the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the 
right of peoples to self-determination visited the country from 28 August to 1 September 2006.  
The Working Group was represented by its Chairperson, Ms. Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez, and 
one of its members, Mr. Jos&#233; Luis Gomez del Prado.  The Working Group expresses its 
appreciation to the Government of Ecuador for the speedy invitation and cooperation with the 
preparations and undertaking of this visit, and commends the Government for its efforts and 
openness in consulting in a constructive and progressive manner.  This was consistent with the 
country&#8217;s standing invitation issued in 2003 to all special procedures mandates and its current 
membership in the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to obtain information which would contribute to fulfilling 
the mandate of the Working Group to study and identify emerging issues, manifestations and 
trends regarding mercenaries, mercenary-related activities and the functioning of private military 
and private security companies (hereinafter PMSCs) and their impact on human rights.<b>1</b>  The 
visit to Ecuador forms part of a regional assessment by the Working Group on tendency towards 
the privatization of security in Latin America, including a phenomenon in recent years where 
nationals of countries in the region have been recruited by private military and private security 
companies.<b>2</b>  These PMSCs are often subsidiaries of foreign-based companies, contracted to 
work in conflict situations in other regions, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>3. The areas of particular interest of the Working Group in Ecuador were fivefold:  
(a) national mechanisms and legislation, including licensing and registration, to ensure that 
PMSCs in Ecuador operate within a legal framework in accordance with human rights standards; 
(b) the status of foreign staff and Ecuadorian nationals working in PMSCs operating in Manta, 
including concerns of immunity and impunity; (c) the contracting of foreigners by PMSCs based 
in Manta, possibly subsidiaries of foreign companies, to work abroad, including in countries in 
conflict; (d) PMSCs and army protection of oil companies and the effects of these activities on 
local populations; (e) PMSCs and the impact on the environment and the population of the aerial 
spraying of narcotic crops under &#8220;Plan Colombia&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  For the purposes of this report, and while recognizing the definitional challenges, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group refers to private military and private security companies (PMSCs) as companies 
which perform all kinds of security assistance, training, provision and consulting services, i.e. 
from unarmed logistical support to armed guards involved in defensive or offensive military 
operations. 
<b>2
</b>  With a view to undertaking a regional visit, the Working Group decided at its meeting in 
</p>
<p>February 2006 to request invitations to visit Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and Peru 
(Report of the Working Group, E/CN.4/2006/11/Add.1, para. 23).  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/42/Add.2*

</p>
<p>4. During its visit, the Working Group delegation held meetings in Quito, Porto Viejo and 
Manta.  The Working Group benefited from constructive dialogues with the respective Ministries 
for External Relations, Labour, Internal Affairs and Police, deputies from the National Congress, 
the Attorney-General, the Constitutional Court, the Joint Command of the Armed Forces, the 
Office of the Ombudsperson, as well as with departmental and municipal authorities in 
Porto Viejo and Manta.  The Working Group delegation also benefited from meetings with a 
wide range of non-governmental organizations, academia, individuals, and representatives of the 
international community in Ecuador.  As reflected in the report, a significant portion of the 
consultations in Ecuador, particularly with the civil society representatives, centred on the 
activities of the multinational private company DynCorp Aerospace Technologies (hereinafter 
DynCorp).  The Working Group also notes that during the visit, it did not interview first hand 
any Ecuadorian private contractor of a PMSC having worked in a country of conflict abroad and 
returned. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>5. The mandate of the Working Group includes to monitor and to study the activities of 
PMSCs and their impact on all human rights.<b>3</b>  The Working Group considers that State 
authorities have the primary responsibility in maintaining public security and law and order in 
the State, under international and domestic law.  Noting the trends of privatization of security 
and the use of force, the Working Group is concerned that some PMSCs are committing human 
rights violations with impunity whilst operating in armed conflicts, in the control of national 
security or in other situations. 
</p>
<p>6. This phenomenon is often associated with the creation by transnational companies of 
satellite subsidiaries with legal personality in one country, providing services in another country 
and recruiting personnel from third countries.  As indicated in the Working Group&#8217;s 2006 report 
to the General Assembly (A/61/341, paras. 65-76), the international legal framework and 
regulatory schemes remain to meet the needs to ensure accountability and oversight of these 
companies.<b>4</b>  In the light of limited international regulation of PMSCs, the Working Group notes 
the critical importance of complementing international efforts by establishing national-level 
registration and licensing systems for PMSCs and employees.  Such regulation should include 
defining minimum requirements for transparency and accountability of firms, screening 
and vetting of personnel, and establishing a monitoring system including parliamentary 
oversight.

</p>
<p>activities of private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and security services on 
the international market on the enjoyment of human rights&#8221;, pursuant to Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 2005/2, para. 12 (e).

</p>
<p><b>II. POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRATEGY AND 
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>7. Ecuador is a State party to all seven major international human rights instruments and has 
ratified Optional Protocols to enable individual petition under the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (it is currently carrying out 
consultations for ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment).  In February 2002, Ecuador 
ratified the statute establishing the International Criminal Court.  Ecuador has also ratified the 
main conventions of the Inter-American human rights system and accepted in 1984 the 
jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. 
</p><p>8. Ecuador has signed the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing 
and Training of Mercenaries, which was sent to Congress for accession in 1992 and assessed by 
the Committee on National Defence.  In meetings with the National Congress and the Ministry 
of External Relations, respectively, the Working Group received positive indications that steps 
are taken towards the accession by Ecuador to this instrument.  The Working Group welcomes 
this process and extends its support and assistance for a speedy accession. 
</p>
<p>9. As PMSCs and their employees fall into a grey area not specifically covered by 
the 1989 Convention, this demonstrates the need for appropriate national regulation, control 
and monitoring of the activities of PMSCs. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National level 
</b></p>
<p>10. The 1998 Constitution of Ecuador states that international treaties have supremacy on 
domestic laws.  Articles 16-17 of the Constitution contain the primary provisions concerning the 
duties of the State to ensure the respect of human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. In meeting with the National Congress, the Working Group was informed that the 
Criminal Code Reform Bill No. 26804 prohibiting the recruitment, use, financing and training of 
mercenaries was in the process of adoption by the National Congress.  The Working Group 
supports this initiative, while noting that an alternative approach for inclusion in national 
legislation is to establish acts committed by mercenaries as well as mercenary-related activities 
as offences in the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>12. As to other legislative and regulatory measures, the Working Group was informed by 
Ecuador authorities of recent developments, including the 2003 Law on Monitoring and Private 
Security.  This law prohibits ownership by and recruitment of currently serving army and police 
personnel in PMSCs, with a view to avoid possible conflicts of interest.  Furthermore, section 13 
of the Law on Private Companies provides for the following necessary elements in order to 
successfully register a PMSC in Ecuador:  (a) establish an office and designate a local </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/42/Add.2* 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>representative; (b) get authoritization from the Ministry of Defence; (c) by US$ 2,000 minimum; 
and (d) to have a legal counsel.  If PMSC personnel are to utilize weapons in their work, the 
PMSC needs to obtain an additional licence from the Ministry of Defence.  The Working Group 
was informed by the Ministry of the Interior of special regulations under elaboration to 
implement the Law on Private Companies.  Existing legislation requires PMSCs to request 
profiles of employees to be recruited, and their inclusion into an official register. 
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group was informed in meeting with the Ministry of Labour of the 
enacted 2005 Law on Subcontracting, which aims at enhancing the protection of the labour 
conditions of subcontractors.  The Working Group notes the significant potential of this 
legislation and associated measures to counter a situation, described by non-governmental 
organizations and authorities alike, of security guards and other personnel in the security sector 
in Ecuador who are exploited, work in harsh conditions and experience high suicide rates.  The 
Working Group notes that the Ministry of Labour has already issued the Implementing 
Regulations of the &#8220;Labour Code Amendment Act regulating the subcontracting of ancillary 
services&#8221;.  It has also been informed that the Minister for Labour and Employment has 
introduced a Citizens&#8217; Action Mailbox, where workers in Ecuador can deposit their complaints 
and concerns when their rights have been violated or infringed by companies to which ancillary 
services have been subcontracted.  The Working Group welcomes these measures. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  PRIVATE MILITARY AND SECURITY COMPANIES IN ECUADOR 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Situation of private military and private security 
companies and licensing the use of force 
</b></p>
<p>14. According to information received by the Working Group when meeting with the 
Ministries of Interior, Defence and Labour, and the National Police, respectively, the procedure 
to establish a PMSC in Ecuador appears to be the following:  (a) registration as a limited 
liability company in the business register; (b) obtaining a licence from the Ministry of Defence; 
(c) obtaining a licence from the National Police; (d) obtaining a licence at the Ministry of the 
Interior; (e) if arms are to be used, the National Police issues licences and maintains control over 
the existence and calibre of such weapons through the &#8220;Centre of Operations for Private 
Matters&#8221;.  When a PMSC has been licensed, the so-called &#8220;Superintendente de Compa&#241;&#237;as&#8221; 
institution registers the PMSC and performs a monitoring role.  Once a PMSC recruits staff, the 
Ministry of Labour also becomes involved, and performs an additional supervisory function.  
The Working Group was informed that, under the Law on National Security, the Ministry of 
Defence can cancel and withdraw licences if warranted.  The Working Group was also informed 
of the existence of a &#8220;white book&#8221; manual for army actors and operations, which lists activities 
which face criminal and civil punishments; for the more serious offences the Criminal Code 
applies. 
</p>
<p>15. NGOs informed the Working Group that individuals recruited by PMSCs in Ecuador are 
often primarily retired police and army personnel.  In discussing the average background of 
private contractors with the Ministry of Defence, the Working Group was informed of their 
understanding of the preference of PMSCs to hire professionals, including ex-military personnel, 
who have already been trained on performing security services.  The Working Group was </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/42/Add.2* 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>informed by the Ministry of Defence that, among the criteria to establish a PMSC in Ecuador, it 
must have one partner or shareholder who is a former army officer.  However, NGOs also 
highlighted to the Working Group that, according to article 3 of the Law on Companies, an 
employee is not allowed to be an active serving employee of the armed forces or police; only 
retired personnel should be involved in PMSCs.  The Ministry of Labour stated to the Working 
Group that PMSC staff in Ecuador were often abused and exploited, including by working more 
than 10-12 hours per day for less than US$ 200 per month.  The prospect of being hired by one 
of these companies and earning US$ 1,000 per month for work abroad provides a strong 
incentive and explains the supply of interested, often unemployed, security personnel in Ecuador. 
</p>
<p>16. The National Police informed the Working Group of a new human rights unit within the 
police providing staff training.  The National Police has suggested to include a training 
component on international human rights standards also for employees of private security 
companies, in a module in the training organized for PMSCs on the use of weapons.  The 
Working Group discussed the matter with the Ministry of the Interior, which indicated that such 
training could be offered to PMSCs at the &#8220;Technological Institute&#8221;, similar to the training 
currently offered to national police.  The Ministry of the Interior also referred to draft regulations 
which could set up training centres for their staff, and which in time could possibly be accessible 
also for training of PMSC staff.  The Ministry of the Interior also informed the Working Group 
of the establishment of a trade association of PMSCs in Ecuador.  While not including all 
PMSCs, the trade association includes several legally registered and licensed PMSCs and could 
provide a vehicle for regulatory initiatives by the industry to complement international and 
national regulatory frameworks. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group notes the multiple risks involved when handing the functions of 
public security to private entities.  To this end, the Working Group emphasizes the obligation of 
the State according to article 17 of the Constitution of Ecuador, which guarantees to all 
inhabitants, without distinction, the free and effective exercise and the enjoyment of the rights 
enshrined in the Constitution and international instruments to which Ecuador has adhered. 
</p>
<p>18. The authorities and NGOs in Ecuador informed the Working Group of increased 
outsourcing of the use of force, and in particular security services, to private actors.  Although 
article 183 of the National Political Constitution grants to the National Police the function of 
guaranteeing security and public order, two tendencies are recurrent:  (a) the surrender of this 
privilege to private entities, with consequences such as the presence of multiple actors in 
controlling security; and (b) the privatization of services provided by the police, with 
consequences such as excluding people who cannot afford to pay for them and distracting the 
police from their primary functions and constitutional obligations. 
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group notes that the recent proliferation of PMSCs in Ecuador is often 
attributed to the need to fill gaps in law enforcement and provide security in urban and in rural 
areas.  In meeting with the Ministry of Labour, the Working Group was informed of an 
increasing number of companies registering security guards and providing protection of 
property.  The Under-Secretary responsible for multilateral relations reported that the Armed 
Forces had not privatized security services and that, moreover, the oil companies had at no time 
sought the help of the Ecuadorian Army in recent years in guarding oil installations.  The </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/42/Add.2* 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted that activities of security guards providing additional 
protection outside banks are in no way different from similar functions performed in many other 
countries.  In meeting with the Ombudsperson, the Working Group noted this institution&#8217;s 
estimation that Ecuadorians, in general, consider that the growth of PMSCs in the country has 
enhanced their security without violating their human rights. 
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group was informed by the National Police that the total number of 
national police amounted to 42,000 policemen, which does not include the separate entity of 
municipal police.  While the estimates of PMSCs in Ecuador vary, representatives of NGOs 
submitted to the Working Group that approximately 40 per cent are not registered, which was 
noted by the NGOs as indicating diminishing State control of PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group was informed by NGOs of a situation in Guayaquil, where 
municipal authorities had subcontracted private security firms as a temporary measure until 
sufficient numbers of national police officials had been recruited and trained to meet law 
enforcement requirements.  According to media reports, high crime rates in the city (one robbery 
every 21 minutes), widespread kidnapping, robberies of banks, public and private property, 
encouraged municipal authorities to hire private security companies to guard over 40 public 
installations considered particularly at risk.<b>5</b>  After a bidding process, a private security company 
won a US$ 1,314,000 contract.  Under the contract, the guards were required to be unarmed, 
while their tasks included facing dangerous local crime.  Several guards have been wounded for 
lack of appropriate protection elements in the exercise of their duties.<b>6</b>  The Working Group was 
informed by an NGO of one example of the consequences of this privatization of security.  On 
26 July 2005, a person was robbed by five persons in a mall in Guayaquil, just 25 metres from a 
location where two security guards had been hired by the municipality.  Although bystanders 
activated alarms, the guards alleged that they could neither move nor undertake any other action 
because they had been assigned merely to work in the place where they were physically located.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group considers that the circumstances and situation in Guayaquil invite 
further reflection of Ecuadorian authorities.  The question can be raised of why the allocated 
funds to hire private security guards were not directed to enhance the resources of the National 
Police working in this municipality.  The Working Group noted one argument which NGOs 
reported as used in favour of this arrangement, which was that private guards can guarantee their 
work in a professional manner, whereas the &#8220;national police is unarmed, not well paid and 
infiltrated by corruption&#8221;, as reported in one media comment.<b>8</b>  NGOs informed the Working 
Group of their concerns about the effectiveness and even legality of this privatizing measure.<b>9</b>

<p>A/HRC/4/42/Add.2*

</p>
<p>23. The Working Group received information from NGOs that a similar situation has arisen 
based on allegations that the National Police charges entertainment entrepreneurs, and even other 
State institutions, for providing security to private enterprises.  The Working Group was 
informed that this practice was normalized by Special Police regulation signed by the executive 
on 12 October 2005.  Public accounts indicate that some 900 serving officers belong to this 
police force (2.5 per cent of the total).<b>10</b>  In the view of the Working Group, such a measure 
would transform and limit the National Police into an entity that offers security to those who can 
afford to be secured. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group was informed that the National Association of Security Companies 
denounced this regulation as violating the Law of Surveillance and Private Security, which in 
article 3 prohibits active public force members from being involved with the security and 
surveillance companies.  By charging entities and individuals for security services, this would 
transform the National Police into something very similar to a private security company.  State 
resources would in this case be used for private and commercial ends, while using public 
uniforms, facilities, weapons and ammunition.  Furthermore, the important principle of the State 
providing equitable service to every individual in Ecuador would be infringed, and alter the 
social contract between the State and its inhabitants.  The Working Group considers that such 
privatization of the public service of maintaining security could violate constitutional principles 
and the equal enjoyment of rights under international law. 
25. A third example presented to the Working Group by NGOs concerns the case of <i>the 
Juntas de Defensa del Campesinado</i> (peasants&#8217; defence groups).  The Ecumenical Commission 
of Human Rights (CEDHU) has carried out monitoring of the processes of private security 
and the actions of self-defence groups, and registered information about 47 accusations, 
involving 87 victims having suffered violations of their human rights due to the Juntas de 
Defensa del Campesinado.<b>11</b>  The Working Group was informed by NGOs that Juntas de 
Defensa del Campesinado act in cases of security, land conflicts and common crimes.  In many 
of these cases, they apparently assume functions of public authorities, with accusations of abuses 
to include violation of the right to privacy, acts of tortures and degrading treatment, homicides 
and disappearances, as exemplified in the case of Mr. Fredy Nu&#241;ez, who went missing in 2001.<b>12</b>  
The Working Group received a list from an NGO of all penal processes underway against the 
leaders of the Juntas de Defensa del Campesinado.

<p>Quito, Ecuador.  Las Juntas de Defensa del Campesinado are peasants' groups that are organized 
in rural areas to guarantee security and to control thefts of livestock and crops.  These groups 
were organized due to the limited capacity of the National Police in rural areas and their lack of 
resources.  Las Juntas operate in the provinces of Bolivar, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo and 
Tungurahua in the Sierra and in the Provincia de los Rios by the Coast, and involve 
approximately 20,000 individuals.

<p><b>B.  Status of the staff of PMSCs working in Ecuador 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Working Group recognizes the sovereign freedom of States in the signing and 
ratification of treaties and bilateral and multilateral agreements.  However, the Working Group 
draws attention to the need for coherence among the constitutional norms and international 
obligations.  In this regard, the Working Group reiterates that, according to the 1998 Constitution 
of Ecuador, international treaties have primacy over domestic laws. 
</p>
<p>27. On 25 November 1999, the Government of Ecuador and the Government of the 
United States entered into an &#8220;Agreement of Cooperation&#8221; (hereinafter &#8220;Agreement&#8221;).  The 
purpose of the Agreement is &#8220;the granting of access to and the use of the Ecuadorian air force 
base at Manta to conduct detection and surveillance operations to curb illegal aerial drugs 
trafficking.<b>13</b>  In the Agreement, the &#8220;entities of central operations and foreign command&#8221; 
(<i>&#8220;entidades del centro operativo de avanzada&#8221;</i>, hereinafter COA) are defined as &#8220;any individual 
or juridical person and its employees which have a valid contractual relationship with the 
United States of America&#8221;.<b>14</b>  The Agreement grants to such entities or individuals a series of 
privileges:  it allows United States personnel, its clerks and the COA entities the access to and 
use of the Ecuadorian air force base in Manta, as well as to the port of Manta and the facilities 
related with the base or its vicinity.<b>15</b>  The Agreement also allows the entrance to and exit from 
Ecuador for United States personnel working for COA without visa, by only requiring a valid 
passport.<b>16</b>  Furthermore, the Agreement discharges all the import and export procedures, tariffs, 
direct and indirect taxes on products and other goods, as well as on baggage, furniture and other 
belongings for those serving at the location.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The Agreement provides that &#8220;the Government of Ecuador shall grant to United States 
personnel and their dependants in Ecuador a legal status equivalent to that granted to 
administrative and technical staff of the United States Embassy, in conformity with the 
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961&#8221;.<b>18</b>  The Working Group thus 
notes with concern the immunity that United States military and civilian contractors enjoy in 
Ecuador.  Although the Agreement excludes civil and administrative immunity in acts carried 
out outside of service, it requests the prompt handover of suspects to the competent authorities of 
the United States.

<p>29. Civil society representatives in Ecuador informed the Working Group of the concerns 
voiced by some Ecuadorian academics and NGOs, who challenge the constitutionality of the 
Agreement, and that a complaint has been filed to the Constitutional Court in this regard.<b>19</b>  One 
major concern expressed by NGOs is that the activities of PMSCs contracted to work in the base, 
including DynCorp, would not be limited to counter-narcotics tasks provided for in the 
Agreement, but to include maintenance, operational support, logistical support, crime prevention, 
intelligence, training (police and military), security of persons of facilities and demining. 
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group was informed by NGOs that since March 2002, DynCorp was 
incorporated into the base of Manta, through a contract with the United States Department of 
State, to provide logistical support to the United States military operating at the base.  According 
to information received, DynCorp provides services, including administration, maintenance of 
installations, delivery of mail, food and beverages, protocol and transportation.<b>20</b>  According to 
public reports, DynCorp in Ecuador employs 137 staff, including 82 Ecuadorians, with their 
logistical and maintenance work involving 134 foreigners.<b>21</b>  The Working Group was informed 
by NGO representatives of an increasing number of United States contractors and military 
working in the base. 
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group was further informed by NGOs that on 7 May 2002 a statement of 
NGOs was published in the Ecuadorian press complaining that DynCorp was carrying out 
Manta-based counter-insurgency and anti-drug operations, which should be undertaken 
exclusively by agents of the United States army operating in Manta, and not by private 
contractors.  As a result, NGOs informed the Working Group that the (then) Minister for 
Defence, Mr. Hugo Unda, and members of the Combined Command of the Military Forces, 
testified before the Commission of International Matters of the Congress.  In this testimony, the 
authorities are reported to have explained that the activities carried out by DynCorp from the 
airbase at Manta were only anti-drug activities, with the United States Embassy in Ecuador also 
having certified that DynCorp carried out exclusively administrative and logistical tasks, i.e. not 
military tasks.<b>22</b>

</b>  According to professor Diego Delgado Jara, writing in the Revista Econom&#237;a y Pol&#237;tica, 
</p>
<p>No. 10, Facultad de Ciencias Econ&#243;micas y Administrativas, the accord is unconstitutional 
on 10 normative and procedural grounds: three grounds with regard to the National Congress, 
two grounds relevant to the functions of the Constitutional Court, and on three grounds relevant 
to the President and the functions of the State.

of the capacity of some DynCorp employees to engage in direct combat if necessary.  This was 
publicly reported in 2001 when in the course of DynCorp&#8217;s logistical operations in Colombia, its 
employees engaged in direct combat against Colombian rebels to rescue the crew of a helicopter 
that had been shot down by guerrillas.  See Jeremy McDermott, &#8220;US Crews Involved in

</p>
<p><b>C.  Contracting of foreigners by PMSCs based in Manta 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Working Group reiterates the State&#8217;s responsibility in the protection of nationals, and 
the importance of the monopoly of the State in the use of force.  To ensure these principles, the 
Working Group recognizes the necessity of demanding registration and licensing procedures to 
be completed by all security companies operating in Ecuador.  It is only through comprehensive 
regulating and monitoring of PMSCs, whether armed or unarmed and whether operating at the 
national or international level, that the situation can be managed and controlled. 
</p>
<p>33. In August 2005, a PMSC in Ecuador received much public attention for advertising in the 
press and supposedly recruiting Ecuadorians and Colombians for security work abroad.  The 
Working Group was informed that the PMSC in question, &#8220;Epi Security and Investigations&#8221;, 
conducted interviews for the recruitment of more than 1,000 contractors for security work in Iraq 
and Afghanistan.  The owner of Epi Security and Investigations, a United States national, arrived 
in Ecuador on 29 January 2004, and worked until May 2005 in the military base of Manta as 
fireman, and then driver and operator for the company DynCorp. 
</p>
<p>34. According to declarations of the Ecuadorian Superintendent of Companies, 
Fabian Albuja, and as confirmed by the General-Attorney and other authorities in meetings with 
the Working Group, the company Epi Security and Investigations was neither registered with 
Ecuadorian authorities in Quito nor with provincial authorities in Mantabi/Porto Viejo.  
However, this did not hinder the company from engaging in recruitment activities, with the 
Working Group being informed by NGO representatives that interviews took place in Manta and 
in Medellin (Colombia), through advertisements in the press and via the website 
www.iraqijobcenter.com.<b>23</b> 
35. The Working Group discussed with Ecuadorian authorities the events surrounding 
Epi Security and Investigations in 2005 and subsequent actions by the State.  The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs conveyed to the Working Group the shared understanding of Ecuadorian 
authorities that due to the non-registered status of &#8220;Epi Security and Investigations&#8221;, these 
activities were denounced as illicit and did not reflect State policy.  The Working Group was 
informed of the range of public declarations by senior Government officials at the time of the 
incidents, including from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Interior, the Minister 
for Defence, the Superintendent of Companies of Ecuador, the Superintendent of Companies of 
the province of Manab&#237;, and the Commander of the Manta Police.<b>24</b>  In September of 2006,

<p>following the completion of the visit of the Working Group, the Working Group was informed 
that the Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared before the Commission on External Relations of 
the Parliament for a session addressing the subject. 
36. Once the events in 2005 were reported upon, a preliminary inquiry was carried out, 
headed by the Manta public prosecutor, Sonia Barcia de Pl&#250;as, and steps were taken to obtain 
information on the supposed offence of trafficking in persons.  The public prosecutor concerned 
initiated the investigation on the basis of media reports that an office operating in Manta was 
recruiting staff to work in security firms in Iraq.  The police launched an official investigation of 
the private company and its owner, and confiscated relevant computers and disks.  The Working 
Group was informed in meeting with the Attorney-General of Manabi of this preliminary 
investigation.<b>25</b>  Investigations remained to be concluded at the time of the visit of the Working 
Group in early September 2006.  The mayor of Manta in Manabi province informed the Working 
Group that he was among those contacting the police and calling for an investigation.  The 
mayor further stated to the Working Group that the reported incidents were acts committed by a 
foreigner without the consent of authorities and without the support of the local population. 
</p>
<p>37. In meeting with the Attorney-General in Quito, the Working Group was informed that the 
owner of Epi Security and Investigations had left Ecuador and remained in the United States.  
The Attorney-General informed the Working Group of approaches made to the United States 
Department of Justice with requests for information concerning the owner of &#8220;Epi Security and 
Investigations&#8221;, as he was allegedly located in Las Vegas.  Having not yet received the requested 
information by early September 2006, the Attorney-General noted to the Working Group that 
this was one cause for the delay in completing the investigations.   
</p>
<p>38. The Ombudsperson of Ecuador reported to the Working Group that he has not received 
any complaints from individuals having served in Iraq for Epi Security and Investigations or 
other PMSCs.  The Ombudsperson had not either received any complaint against a private 
contractor for having violated the rights of others.  The Working Group received informal 
accounts from both authorities and NGO representatives that the high remunerations received by 
private contractors, which enabled them to send remittances to their families, might have 
discouraged the individuals recruited by Epi Security and Investigations from reporting publicly 
on their experiences of having served in Iraq.   
</p>
<p>39. NGO representatives informed the Working Group of alleged involvement of Chilean 
instructors and Colombian ex-military figures in the operations of Epi Security and 
Investigations.  The Working Group also notes the consideration by several NGOs which 
doubted that the operations of Epi Security and Investigations could be carried out by a single 
individual, indicating possible connections and joint cooperation with other entities.

</p>
<p>40. The Working Group notes the calls from NGOs in Ecuador for the speedy investigation 
and elucidation by the relevant authorities of the situation surrounding &#8220;Epi Security and 
Investigations&#8221;, and notes the concerns voiced by civil society over delays in completing and 
making public the results of these investigations.  In this regard, the Working Group was 
informed by NGOs that when they requested further information on the investigations in 
August 2005, on the basis of the Freedom of Information Act, the Attorney-General referred to 
article 215 of the Criminal Code as a basis for not sharing information with third parties.   
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group received accounts from NGOs of prior advertisements on 
DynCorp&#8217;s web page concerning recruitments for security work abroad.  However, the Working 
Group has not received information that DynCorp in Ecuador has been directly involved in 
hiring individuals to perform security work in Iraq. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  PMSCs and protection of oil companies</b> 
</p>
<p>42. The Ecuadorian Constitution (art. 184) lays down that the Armed Forces have as their 
fundamental mission the preservation of national sovereignty, the defence of the integrity and 
independence of the State and the safeguarding of its legal system.  The Working Group 
reiterates the constitutional provision in Ecuador that the National Army protects all individuals 
in the Republic without distinction.  The Army of a State should not operate as a PMSC, offering 
security services for those who can pay for it, as this contravenes constitutional provisions and 
violates the principle of equal enjoyment of rights and security under related international human 
rights law.   
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group recognizes the position of the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of 
the Interior that petroleum facilities and their infrastructure are strategic installations which may 
require special protection for reasons of national security.  In meeting with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the Working Group notes their assertion that oil companies may outsource 
security in order to provide additional protection to facilities and to prevent attacks.  However, 
the Working Group is concerned by information received from NGOs and media that it is the 
Ecuadorian Army itself, contracted by the petroleum companies, which provide protection of 
wells, pipelines and other facilities owned by oil companies.  The Working Group considers this 
contracting of the Ecuadorian Army to resemble that of engaging a private security company.   
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group was informed by NGOs of several such agreements signed in 2000 
between the Ecuadorian Army and oil companies.  On 1 April 2000, the Ministry of Defence and 
the Oil Western Exploration and Production Company in the Amazon region were reported to 
have signed an &#8220;Agreement of Cooperation on Military Security&#8221;.<b>26</b>  On 30 July 2001 the former 
Minister for Defence signed a &#8220;Framework Agreement&#8221; valid for five years with 16 oil 
companies.  In this agreement the Ecuadorian Army committed to guarantee the security of the 
oil facilities, as well as the people that work with them &#8220;through patrolling, terrestrial and fluvial

<p>journeys in the jurisdiction of the IV Division and in that of the Force of Task II, to carry out 
intelligence work and counter-intelligence, to make a control of weapons and explosive and of 
undocumented people in its jurisdiction, and to establish a net of communications&#8221;.<b>27</b>  The 
Working Group was informed by NGOs that on 26 March 2004, the Texas Petroleum Company 
and the Fourth Division of the Ej&#233;rcito Amazonas signed a similar agreement. 
45. However, the Working Group notes that on 8 December 2005, the Minister for Defence, 
Oswaldo Jarr&#237;n, reported that the so-called &#8220;Convenios Marco&#8221; carried out between the Ministry 
of Defence and the oil companies to provide them security would be suspended.  &#8220;The State has 
decided to grant to the Ministry of Energy the control of the tasks of protection of the FFAA and 
to guarantee transparency&#8221;, Mr. Jarr&#237;n noted to the national press.<b>28</b>  Nevertheless, the Working 
Group received information from NGOs which reflect the note from one commentator that &#8220;the 
security of the oil sector remains in the hands of the military.  The agreements also include the 
rent of ships of the aviation of the Army for the transport of materials of the transnational 
companies&#8221;.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>46. Furthermore, the Working Group is concerned by information received from academics, 
and representatives of indigenous communities, that the actions taken by indigenous peoples to 
claim their rights, including the right to land and the right to a clean environment, have been 
considered as acts of sabotage by elements of the army which are providing security services for 
oil facilities.  In raising these concerns with the Government, the Working Group notes the 
position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that illegal acts of persons should be considered as 
sabotage, regardless of which community to which they belong.  The Working Group was 
informed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the implementation of precautionary measures 
adopted by the Inter-American human rights system to protect the rights of various indigenous 
communities, including the Sarayaku.<b>30</b>  The Attorney-General informed the Working Group of 
precautionary measures pursued, including withdrawal of explosive materials in regions of oil 
extraction.   
</p>
<p><b>E.  PMSCs and Plan Colombia</b> 
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group was informed by NGOs of the so-called &#8220;Plan Colombia&#8221;, which 
includes spraying activities which are carried out by PMSCs to combat narcotics cultivation, 
production and trade along the northern border zone of Ecuador and southern Colombia.  The 
Working Group was informed of actions taken by the authorities of Ecuador with regard to the 
spraying activities and of their effects.  In this regard, in meeting with the Ombudsperson of 
Ecuador, the Working Group notes and welcomes resolution No. DAP-001-2004, of the

is carried out from within Colombia, at least 10 km from the border with Ecuador, to guarantee 
the avoidance of further border contamination&#8221; (translated from Spanish).<b>31</b>   
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group received information that from 1991, the United States Department 
of State contracted the private company DynCorp to supply services for this air spraying 
programme against narcotics in the Andean region.  In accordance with the subscribed contract 
of 30 January 1998, DynCorp provides the essential logistics to the anti-drug Office of activities 
of Colombia, in conformity with three main objectives:  eradication of cultivations of illicit 
drugs, training of the army and of personnel of the country, and dismantling of illicit drug 
laboratories and illicit drug-trafficking networks.  According to one public account:  &#8220;DynCorp 
works directly with the United States military, with the Anti-Drug Directory of the police of 
Colombia and with the brigade against drugs of the Colombian Army &#8230; activities that 
International DynCorp has taken under the contract, were agreed and in connection with the 
precise specifications of the Office&#8221;.<b>32</b>   
</p>
<p>49. During its visit to Ecuador, the Working Group received information from NGOs on the 
consequences of the spraying carried out within the Plan Colombia had on persons living in the 
frontier region.<b>33</b>  An NGO report indicated that one third of the 47 women in the study exposed 
to  the spraying showed cells with some genetic damage.<b>34</b>  This investigation was undertaken

intoxication symptoms, presented genetic damages in a third of the sanguine cells.  In front of 
them, the group control of 25 women to more than 80 km of the fumigated area, they presented 
cells with scarce genetic damage; most of the cells are under good conditions.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>50. An NGO in Ecuador provided the Working Group with a copy of the demand of class 
action submitted before a court of the District of Columbia in the United States by a group of 
Ecuadorian citizens, representing approximately 10,000 persons, against DynCorp (DynCorp 
Aerospace, DynCorp Technical Services, and International DynCorp).  This complaint 
concerned the spraying with toxic herbicides in Colombian territory between January and 
February 2001 less than a mile from their homes in Ecuador.<b>36</b>  The Working Group is informed 
that the case was dismissed by the Court of the District of Columbia in the United States.  While 
therefore not commenting on the allegations made and further analysing the case, the Working 
Group refers to this case for the sole reason that one argument presented by DynCorp before the 
Court offers a useful insight, and exemplifies the necessity of legislation at the national and 
international levels regarding PSMCs as non-State actors exercising military or security 
functions.  In the proceedings, DynCorp alleges that the demand should be rejected in its entirety 
for the following, among other, reasons:   
</p>
<p> (a) The demand looks to impose responsibilities on the behaviour of DynCorp, 
specifically authorized by the United States Congress and as elaborated by the United States 
Department of State;<b>37</b> and  
</p>
<p> (b) In reference to the claim of the plaintiffs under the ATCA and TPVA of the 
federal Law, DynCorp &#8220;<i>emphasizes that it is necessary to keep in mind that the ATCA and the 
TVPA don&#8217;t cover the behavior of the private corporations</i>&#8221; (italics added)<i>.<b></b></i><b>38</b>   
51. The Working Group considers the last point raised by DynCorp imply that some States 
could be hiring PMSCs in order to avoid direct legal responsibilities.  This legal loophole of 
PMSCs as non-State actors is of concern to the international community, as expressed in the 
resolution establishing the Working Group, and highlights the need to prepare international basic 
principles to ensure that private companies promote the respect of the human rights in their

<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>52. As for specific conclusions of their visit to Ecuador, the Working Group:   
</p>
<p> (a) Expresses its appreciation to the Government of Ecuador for the speedy invitation 
and cooperation to undertake the visit, which was consistent with the country&#8217;s standing 
invitation to all special procedures mandates and its current membership in the Human Rights 
Council;  
</p>
<p> (b) Recognizes the efforts carried out by the Government and the Ecuadorian State on 
the regulation of the PMSC through legislation and regulation of the 2003 Private Security 
Companies and the 2005 Law on Subcontracting;  
</p>
<p> (c) Notes the immunity conferred to certain PMSCs in Ecuador, as in the case of 
DynCorp and their employees, with the consequence of placing them in a grey field of the 
legislation.  In enjoying immunity, and while not constituting officials of either Ecuador or the 
United States, PMSCs and their employees can evade responsibility for human rights violations;   
</p>
<p> (d) Notes the situation in Guayaquil, where municipal authorities have subcontracted 
private security firms as a temporary measure until sufficient numbers of national police officials 
had been recruited and trained to meet law enforcement requirements.  The Working Group 
invites further study and evaluation of this experience, while submitting its opinion that such 
privatizing of public security should be temporarily and closely monitored, and preferably 
avoided altogether;   
</p>
<p> (e) Notes its concern of the perception which seems to be growing among the 
population of security and justice being linked to private means, rather than functions ensured by 
State authorities.  This would appear to reflect the saying:  only those who can pay for it have 
security.   
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> In concluding its visit to Ecuador, the Working Group therefore: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Calls for the swift accession by Ecuador to the International Convention 
against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries.  The Working 
Group notes with appreciation the positive indications from the National Congress and the 
Ministry of External Relations that steps are being taken in this direction;

<p>A/HRC/4/42/Add.2*

</p>
<p><b> (b) Emphasizes the need for rigorous national legislation, to regulate and 
monitor the activities of national and transnational PMSCs, in order to ensure the 
responsibilities of the State to effectively protect and promote human rights.  In this 
regard, the National Congress is encouraged to enact law No. 24804 to prohibit the 
recruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries, submitted on 17 August 2005 by a 
Member of Parliament.  An alternative approach would be to establish acts committed by 
mercenaries as well as mercenary-related activities as an offence in the Criminal Code.   
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Urges the Ecuadorian authorities, especially to the Public Ministry and the 
General Fiscal Minister of the State, to complete promptly the investigations surrounding 
the PMSC Epi Security and Investigations in Manta, which offered to recruit Ecuadorian 
and foreign nationals for security work in Iraq.  The Working Group encourages 
appropriate follow-up action on the basis of these investigations, and invites the authorities 
to share the conclusions and results thereof openly with civil society;    
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Takes note of resolutions DAP-001-204 of the Ecuadorian Ombudsman and 
R-25-132 of the National Congress and urges the competent authorities to accept the 
resolutions emanated by these organs regarding the consequences of the spraying in the 
north frontier of Ecuador;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) While recognizing the Government&#8217;s efforts and those of other organs of the 
Ecuadorian State to adopt measures and to establish the necessary legislation for the 
regulation of this sector, the Working Group notes with concern the advance of a trend and 
the appearance of new modalities in private security.  The Working Group calls upon the 
authorities to be vigilant and alerts the State about the necessity to ensure that the Juntas 
de Defensa del Campesinado do not become paramilitary actors;    
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Considers that the lack of complaints filed regarding the activities of PMSCs 
in Ecuador demonstrates the limited knowledge by the population about human rights 
procedures.  In this sense, the Working Group invites Ecuador to pursue measures, in line 
with articles 3 and 16 of the National Constitution, relating to:  (a) the defence, promotion 
and protection of the rights of Ecuadorians; and (b) the plans provided for in the Political 
Constitution of Ecuador, in particular the National Human Rights Programme, issued 
under Executive Decree No. 1527 of 24 June 1998, aimed at fostering human rights 
education for diverse sectors of the society in schools, jails, among vulnerable populations 
and minorities, and to include among them the staff of private military and security 
companies, so that these rights are recognized and demanded by the population.
