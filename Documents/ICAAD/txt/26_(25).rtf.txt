IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
CRIMINAL JURISDICTION

Criminal Case No: HAC0019 of 2004S

STATE

v.

EUGENE T.M.C. LADPETER

Hearing: 1st February 2005
Judgment: 16th February 2005

Counsel: Mr. B. Solanki for State
Accused in Person

JUDGMENT

The Assessors have given their unanimous opinions that the Accused is not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. I direct myself in accordance with my summing up and agree with them. He is convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter on the ground of provocation. I consider that there is ample evidence that he did not act in self-defence and that he acted with malice aforethought.

He is convicted of manslaughter.
