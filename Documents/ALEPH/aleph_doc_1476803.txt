Notes to Condensed Unaudited Interim Financial Statements
September 30, 2014
Note 1.  Basis of Presentation
The  accompanying  unaudited  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information.  They do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments,  considered  necessary  for  a  fair  presentation,  have  been  included  in  the  accompanying  unaudited
financial statements.  Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may  be  expected  for  the  full  year.    For  further  information,  refer  to  the  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto,
included in the Company’s Form 10-K as of and for the year ended March 31, 2014 (“The Annual Report”).
Effective June 1, 2008, the Company sold all of its oil and gas properties in the Smoky Hill area of Alberta and is
currently reviewing other prospects.  To implement any new business plan, significant financing will be required and
the Company will need to be successful in its efforts to identify, acquire and develop a new business venture.
Upon  the  sale  of  all  of  its  oil  and  gas  assets,  the  Company  re-entered  the  development  stage  effective  June  1,
2008.  Consequently,  its  operations  are  subject  to  all  the  risks  inherent  in  the  establishment  of  a  new  business
enterprise.  For the period from inception through September 30, 2014, the Company has an accumulated (deficit) of
($6,839,714) prior to the development stage and accumulated (deficit) during the development stage of ($1,638,088).
Note 2.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, ”Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which requires an
entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers.  The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it
becomes effective.  The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.  Early application is not
permitted.  The  standard  permits  the  use  of  either  the  retrospective  or  cumulative  effect  transition  method.  The
Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.
  The  Company  has  not  yet  selected  a  transition  method  nor  has  it  determined  the  effect  of  the  standard  on  its
ongoing financial reporting.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10 “Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain
Financial  Reporting  Requirements,  Including  an  Amendment  to  Variable  Interest  Entities  Guidance  in  Topic  810,
Consolidation” (“ASU 2014-10”). ASU 2014-10 addresses the cost and complexity associated with the incremental
reporting  requirements  for  development  stage  entities,  such  as  startup  companies,  without  compromising  the
availability of relevant information and eliminates an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810,
Consolidation,  for  determining  whether  an  entity  is  a  variable  interest  entity  on  the  basis  of  the  amount  of
investment  equity  that  is  at  risk.  The  Company  elected  to  apply  ASU  2014-10  for  our  fiscal  quarter  year  ended
September 30, 2014. ASU 2014-10 impacts financial statement presentation only and removes the requirement to
present additional inception-to-date information.
In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2014-15,“Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties
about  an  Entity’s  Ability  to  Continue  as  a  Going  Concern”  (“ASU  2014-15”).  ASU  2014-15  is  intended  to  define
management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a
going  concern  and  to  provide  related  footnote  disclosures.  Specifically,  ASU  2014-15  provides  a  definition  of  the
term  substantial  doubt  and  requires  an  assessment  for  a  period  of  one  year  after  the  date  that  the  financial
statements  are  issued  (or  available  to  be  issued).  It  also  requires  certain  disclosures  when  substantial  doubt  is
alleviated  as  a  result  of  consideration  of  management’s  plans  and  requires  an  express  statement  and  other
disclosures  when  substantial  doubt  is  not  alleviated.  The  new  standard  will  be  effective  for  reporting  periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company will evaluate the going concern
considerations  in  this  ASU;  however,  as  of  the  current  period,  management  believes  that  is  current  disclosures
meet the requirement under this ASU.

Note 3.  Going Concern
The  accompanying  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.
  The  Company  has  incurred  (losses)  from  inception  through  June  1,  2008  of  ($6,839,714)  and  further  (losses)  of
($1,638,088)  during  the  development  stage.  The  Company  has  working  capital  and  stockholders’  (deficits)  of
($1,724,867) at September 30, 2014, and working capital and stockholders’ (deficits) of ($1,577,540) at March 31,
2014. The Company is reliant on raising capital to initiate its business plan. The Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern is contingent upon being able to secure financing and attain profitable operations.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability
of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Note 4.  Earnings Per Share
Basic  earnings  (loss)  per  share  are  calculated  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  by  the  weighted  average  number  of
common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.
Note 5.  Related Party Transactions

joint venture opportunities in the resource sector.
Plan of Operation
The  following  is  a  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  plan  of  operation  and  the  factors  that  could  affect  our  future
financial  condition.  This  discussion  and  analysis  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  unaudited  financial

We currently have no business and operate as a shell company.  We are in the process of evaluating the merits of
joint venture opportunities in the resource sector.
The Company entered into a letter agreement dated October 11, 2013 whereby the Company proposes to acquire
from  Paltar  Petroleum  Limited  (“Paltar”),  a  privately  held  Australian  company,  approximately  four  exploration  and
development permits and twenty-nine applications for additional exploration and development permits in respect of
land located in northern Australia. Details of the transaction can be found in the Form 8K dated October 15, 2013
filed on EDGAR or in the news release dated October 18, 2013 filed on SEDAR. On March 31, 2014, Nation Energy
Inc.  (“Nation”)  entered  into  a  first  amendment  to  the  letter  agreement  dated  October  11,  2013  (the  “Letter
Agreement”) with Paltar Petroleum Limited (“Paltar”), whereby the parties have agreed to amend certain terms of the
Letter Agreement as follows:
 
1.
The  period  of  time  provided  by  Paragraph  5  of  the  Letter  Agreement  during  which  Paltar  may  receive
advances under the Line of Credit, as defined in Paragraph 5, is amended so that it shall continue through
July 30, 2014, rather than March 31, 2014.
Paragraph 7 of the Letter Agreement is amended to provide that the parties will use their reasonable best
efforts to ensure that closing occurs on or before July 30, 2014, or on such other date as the parties may
agree, to be held at such place and time as the parties may agree.
2.
3.
Paragraph 9 of the Letter Agreement is amended to provide that Paltar will provide, prior to closing, audited
financial statements regarding the operations of Paltar assets for the two most recent ended fiscal years,
prepared by a PCAOB approved auditor, and prior to closing, will provide quarterly financial statements as
reviewed by its auditor for the fiscal period ended March 31, 2014, and such additional fiscal period financial
statements as may be required under SEC regulations.
In all other respects, the terms and conditions of the Letter Agreement remain in effect.
The Company is currently in negotiations with Paltar to amend the first amendment dated March 31, 2014 to the
letter  agreement  dated  October  11,  2013.  The  negotiations  relating  to  the  second  amendment  entail  a  proposed
extension of the closing date whereby all parties will use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the closing of
the transaction occurs on or before December 31, 2014.

Nation Energy Inc. Form 10-Q
We  have  suffered  recurring  losses  from  operations.    The  continuation  of  our  company  as  a  going  concern  is
dependent  upon  our  company  attaining  and  maintaining  profitable  operations  and  raising  additional  capital  as
needed.  Management's  plan  in  this  regard  is  to  raise  additional  capital  through  a  debt  or  an  equity  offering.    The
financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustment  relating  to  the  recovery  and  classification  of  recorded  asset
amounts  or  the  amount  and  classification  of  liabilities  that  might  be  necessary  should  our  company  discontinue
operations.
Due  to  the  uncertainty  of  our  ability  to  meet  our  current  operating  expenses  noted  above,  in  their  report  on  the
annual financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2014, our independent auditors included an explanatory
paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements contain
additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.
The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of exploration,
and, finally achieving a profitable level of operations.  The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result
in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.  Obtaining commercial loans, assuming
those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations.  We are
pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements.  There can be
no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms.  If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be
unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become
due.  In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.
Disclosure of Outstanding Share Data
As at the date of this quarterly report, we had 16,020,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  We do
not have any warrants, options or shares of any other class issued and outstanding as of the date of this quarterly
report.

$(62,244) for the three months ended September 30, 2013.  This increased loss is primarily due to increased legal
fees  pertaining  to  the  Paltar  Letter  Agreement  and  increased  filing  fees  paid  to  SEDAR  for  filing  the  Annual
Information Form and the year-end filing fees. Net (loss) per common share for the three months ended September
30, 2014 was ($0.003) compared to ($0.003) per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2013.
  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  to  $46,095  during  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2014
from $20,470 during the three months ended September 30, 2013. This increase is primarily due to increased legal
fees pertaining to the Paltar Letter Agreement and increased annual filing fees paid to SEDAR for filing the Annual

Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2013 totaled $51,208 compared to $41,774 for the three
months  ended  September  30,  2013.    The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  the  foreign  exchange  revaluation  for  the
three  months  ended  September  30,  2014  and  the  addition  of  two  loans  described  below  under  the  title  “Loans

compared to a gain of $18,559 for the three months ended September 30, 2013.  Our loan and accrued interest were
incurred  and  are  calculated  in  Canadian  dollars  while  the  reporting  currency  is  the  US  dollar.    The  value  of  the
Canadian dollar at September 30, 2014 was C$0.8929 to US$1.00 compared to C$0.9706 to US$1.00 at September

in the three month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to $20 in the three month period ended September
30, 2013. The increase in filing fees is primarily due to fees paid to SEDAR for filing the Annual Information Form
and  the  year-end  filing  fees.    Accounting  fees  decreased  to  $8,210  from  $9,500  in  the  comparative  three  month
period.

ended  September  30,  2013.      The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  the  higher  legal  and  filing  fees  during  the  six

Net cash (used in) operating activities was $(59,608) for the six months ended September 30, 2014 compared with
net cash (used in) operating activities of $(16,577) for the same period in 2013.  The increase in cash provided by

activities is due to the two loans acquired in in the six month period ended September 30, 2014.
Loans Payable
The Company entered into loan agreements with a related party, in 2003 and 2004 to fund operations.  The terms of
these loan agreements provided that any principal amount outstanding is payable upon demand and bears interest
at  15%  per  annum,  payable  quarterly.  On  March  31,  2006,  we  consolidated  and  restructured  our  loans  with  the
related party.  As part of the restructuring, we borrowed an additional CDN $250,000 (US $203,932).  The new loan
bears  interest  at  15%  per  annum,  calculated  and  compounded  monthly  and  is  payable  quarterly.  Any  principal
amount  outstanding  under  the  loan  is  payable  upon  demand.    The  loan  is  payable  in  Canadian  dollars  and  is
secured  by  a  Promissory  Note.  As  at  September  30,  2014,  the  loan,  together  with  accrued  interest  totaled
US$1,206,819.
On July 18, 2014, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Company’s sole officer and director, John
Hislop (“Lender”) for $50,000. The loan shall bear interest calculated quarterly, not in advance, at a rate of 15% per
annum  upon  demand  by  the  Lender,  both  before  and  after  each  of  maturity,  default  and  judgement  commencing
effective July 18, 2014. The principal sum and all accrued and unpaid interest will become due and payable on July
18, 2016. As of September 30, 2014, the principal balance of the loan was US$50,000 and accrued interest payable
of US$1,541.
On September 2, 2014, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Company’s sole officer and director,
John Hislop (“Lender”) for C$20,000. The loan shall bear interest calculated quarterly, not in advance, at a rate of
15%  per  annum  upon  demand  by  the  Lender,  both  before  and  after  each  of  maturity,  default  and  judgement
commencing effective September 2, 2014. The principal sum and all accrued and unpaid interest will become due
and payable on September 2, 2016. As of September 30, 2014, the principal balance of the loan was US$17,858
(C$20,000) and accrued interest payable of US$205 (C$230).
Going Concern
The unaudited financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
implies  that  our  company  will  continue  to  realize  its  assets  and  discharge  its  liabilities  and  commitments  in  the

normal course of business.  Our company has incurred losses since inception in excess of $8 million and has only
generated modest profitable operations when we commenced gas production in fiscal 2006.  We have relied solely
on shareholder advances to participate and continue operations.
Our company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon being able to secure financing and attain
profitable  operations.    Our  company  is  currently  evaluating  business  opportunities  and  will  require  financing  for
acquisition of any new business venture.  
  
Net cash (used in) operating activities in the six months ended September 30, 2014 totaled $(59,608) versus net
cash (used in) operating activities of $(16,577) in the six months ended September 30, 2013.  Cash balances were
$36,300 and $2,749 as of September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern is contingent upon being able to secure financing and attain profitable operations.
We have limited operating history.  We can only estimate the future needs for capital based on the current status of
our  operations,  our  current  plans  and  current  economic  condition.    Due  to  the  uncertainties  regarding  our  future
activities, we are unable to predict precisely what amount will be used for any particular purpose.
Future Financings
As  of  September  30,  2014,  we  had  cash  of  $36,300.    We  currently  do  not  have  sufficient  funds  to  acquire  and
develop  any  future  joint  ventures.    We  anticipate  continuing  to  rely  on  shareholder  loans  or  equity  sales  of  our
common stock in order to fund our business operations.   Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our
existing stockholders.  There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity or arrange for
more debt or other financing to fund any future activities.  
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Not Applicable.
ITEM 4 . CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and financial
officer evaluated our company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as define in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive  officer  and  financial  officer  concluded  that  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report,  these
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by
our  company  in  reports  it  files  or  submits  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  is  recorded,  processed,
summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  rules  and  forms  of  the  Securities  Exchange
Commission  and  to  ensure  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  company’s
management,  including  our  principal  executive  officer  and  financial  officer,  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding
required disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the
presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of
many small companies with small staff:
1.
2.
Lack of a sufficient number of independent directors for our board and audit committee. We currently
have  no  independent  director  on  our  board,  which  is  comprised  of  one  director.  As  a  publicly-traded
company, we strive to have a majority of our board of directors be independent;
Insufficient  segregation  of  duties  in  our  finance  and  accounting  functions  due  to  limited  personnel.
During  the  six  months  ended  September  30,  2014,  we  had  limited  staff  that  performed  nearly  all
aspects  of  our  financial  reporting  process,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  access  to  the  underlying
accounting records and systems, the ability to post and record journal entries and responsibility for the
preparation of the financial statement. This creates certain incompatible duties and lack of review over
the  financial  reporting  process  that  would  likely  result  in  a  failure  to  detect  errors  in  spreadsheets,
calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed
with  the  SEC.  These  control  deficiencies  could  result  in  a  material  misstatement  of  our  interim  or
annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected; and

Nation Energy Inc. Form 10-Q
Insufficient  corporate  governance  policies.  Although  we  have  a  code  of  ethics  which  provides  broad
guidelines for corporate governance, our corporate governance activities and processes are not always
formally  documented.  Specifically,  decisions  made  by  the  board  to  be  carried  out  by  management
should  be  documented  and  communicated  on  a  timely  basis  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  any
misunderstandings regarding key decisions affecting our operations and management.
We  intend  to  take  appropriate  and  reasonable  steps  to  make  the  necessary  improvements  to  remediate  these
deficiencies. We intend to consider the results of our remediation efforts and related testing as part of our year-
end  2015  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Subject  to  receipt  of
additional financing, we intend to undertake the below remediation measures to address the material weaknesses
described in this annual report. Such remediation activities include the following:
1.
2.
We plan to recruit at least one, preferably two or more, additional independent board members to join
our board of directors and audit committee at such time as additional board members are retained; and
We  intend  to  continue  to  update  the  documentation  of  our  corporate  governance  and  internal  control
processes, including formal risk assessment of our financial reporting processes.
It should be noted that a control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance  that  all  control  issues  and  instances  of  fraud,  if  any,  within  our  company  have  been  detected.  These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can
occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system
of internal control is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over
time  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the
policies  or  procedures  may  deteriorate.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  a  cost-effective  control  system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the six month period ended September
30, 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
PART II
OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our Company, nor are we involved as a
plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our director and
officer  or  affiliates,  or  any  registered  or  beneficial  stockholder  is  an  adverse  party  or  has  a  material  interest
adverse to our interest.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
The British Columbia Securities Commission has issued a cease trade order affecting our Company’s common
stock in British Columbia
By  Order  dated  August  21,  2009,  the  British  Columbia  Securities  Commission  (“BCSC”)  issued  a  Cease  Trade
Order  (the  “Order”)  with  respect  to  our  company’s  securities  under  the  British  Columbia  Securities  Act  (the  “BC
Act”).  The  Order  was  made  due  to  our  company’s  failure  to  file  on  Canada’s  System  for  Electronic  Document
Analysis  and  Retrieval  (SEDAR)  comparative  annual  financial  statements  for  our  financial  year  ended  March  31,
2009, interim financial statements for the interim periods ended September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008, Form
51-102F1  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  for  the  periods  ended  September  31,  2008(sic),  December  31,
2008 and March 31, 2009 and a Form 51-102F Annual Information Form for the year ended March 31, 2009.
As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have filed each of the documents specified in the Order
and all documents required to be filed on SEDAR since the date the Order was entered, and we have requested a

revocation of the Order.
The  Order  requires  that  all  trading  of  our  company’s  securities  in  British  Columbia,  Canada  cease  until  the
Executive Director has made an order under section 164 of the BC Act revoking the Order.
The fact that the BCSC issued and continues to maintain the Order may not only cause our company to expend
resources, but may also have a negative effect on our company’s securities, which could result in a decline in the
value of our securities or cause them to be valueless.  Further, until the Order is lifted, trading of our securities in
British  Columbia  or  by  persons  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  BCSC  is  prohibited,  which  could  cause  our
company’s  common  stock  to  have  less  liquidity.    Until  the  Order  is  revoked,  residents  of  British  Columbia  are
prohibited from buying or selling our securities.
