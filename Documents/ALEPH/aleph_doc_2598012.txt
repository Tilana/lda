(Re-lodged with additional technical detail in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) 
  Dongsugok Project produces very high stream sediment results of up to 
219 ppm lithium from the Tonggo Prospect – up to three times the level 
obtained from drainages at the Boam Lithium Mine, 3km to the east
  The  very  high  lithium  results  at  Tonggo  Prospect  form  a  3km  long 
strongly  anomalous  trend  that  is  the  subject  of  additional  stream 
sediment, rock chip and soil sampling programmes that are underway
  The Daehyeon Project produced high lithium stream sediment results 
of up to 124ppm lithium which appear to be associated with a north-
south corridor of large pegmatites, the subject of follow-up rock chip 
sampling currently underway
Peninsula Mines Ltd (“Peninsula” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce 
highly anomalous lithium results from the detailed stream sediment survey 
completed  over  its  lithium-pegmatite  project  areas  at  Daehyeon  and 
Dongsugok in South Korea (see Figure 1 for location). 
 
Stream Sediment Survey Results 
 
A  total  of  339  stream  sediment  samples  were  collected  over  both  the 
Donsugok and Daehyeon Lithium Projects, including an orientation survey in 
the vicinity of the Boam Lithium Mine, during May and June 2016. 
 
The  stream  sediment  survey  was  designed  to  follow  up  on  the  highly 
anomalous regional lithium results produced from the country-wide stream 
sediment sampling survey by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral 
Resources (“KIGAM”) (see Figure 1)4, and also indicated by the presence of 
the Boam Lithium Mine. 
 
The  stream  sediment  samples  were  analysed  for  a  suite  of  elements 
commonly associated with pegmatitic lithium deposits at Intertek laboratory 
in  the  Philippines.  The  results  from  the  vicinity  of  the  Boam  Lithium  Mine 
have  been  used  as  a  baseline  reference  study  to  establish  levels  of 
anomalism.  
 
The results include highly anomalous lithium results from two key drainages 
within  the  sampled  areas,  namely  the  Tonggo  Lithium  Anomaly  on  the 
Dongsugok Project, and the Daehyeon Pegmatite Ridge, on the eastern side 
of the Daehyeon Project.

Dongsugok Project Stream Sediment Results:
Highly anomalous lithium (Li) results received from the Dongsugok Project, including 219 ppm Li, 180ppm Li, 
150ppm Li and 129 ppm Li, form part of a 3km, northeast trending, anomalous corridor in the southern part 
of the Tonggo application area (See Figure 2).   
 
The Tonggo Lithium Anomaly lies approximately 3km west of the Boam Lithium Mine (not an asset of the 
Company),  where  orientation  stream  sediment  sampling  (conducted  with  permission  of  the  Boam  mine 
owner  produced  results  of  up  to  64  ppm  Li,  less  than  30%  of  the  levels  achieved  at  the  Tonggo  Lithium 
Anomaly.
Page 2 of 26
Further stream sediment sampling is required at Tonggo to infill and narrow down this very strong Li anomaly, 
to  be  followed  by  detailed  ridge  and  spur  soil  sampling  and  rock  chip  sampling  of  identified  pegmatite 
outcrops  if/when  located.    Geophysics  e.g.  detailed  magnetics,  radiometrics  and/or  resistivity  IP  may  be 
utilised to locate buried pegmatite(s) for drill targeting.
Figure 2: Dongsugok Project tenements and lithium stream sediment sample results
Daehyeon Project Stream Sediment Results: 
 
Highly anomalous lithium results including 124 ppm Li, 91ppm Li and 85 ppm Li were produced in drainages 
from pegmatites outcropping along a prominent ridge on eastern side of the Daehyeon Project (Figure 3).   
 
Initial reconnaissance has located large pegmatites  along the ridge top at Daehyeon, forming a pegmatite 
corridor of over 1 – 2 kilometres in strike length and up to 30m to 40m wide. Extensive rock chip sampling is 
in progress with results to come.  Petrography will also be conducted on selected samples to identify lithium 
bearing minerals. 
 
Peninsula  Mines  CEO  Jon  Dugdale  commented:  “We  are  very  pleased  with  the  highly  anomalous  lithium 
results produced from this initial stream sediment survey on our lithium projects in South Korea.” 
 
“We  already  know  there  are  lithium  bearing  pegmatites  in  the  area,  and  the  follow  up  work  has  already 
started with the objective of pinning down the source of these very good lithium results.”

About Peninsula’s South Korean Lithium Projects 
 
During early to mid-2016 the Company pegged a total of 77 tenements in the central east of South Korea 
where significant lithium stream sediment anomalism was reported from the KIGAM country-wide stream 
sediment geochemical survey (Figure 1)1.  The tenements are grouped into two main project areas, namely 
Daehyeon and Dongsugok (Figure 1)3. 
 
The Daehyeon Project comprises a 16 block tenement package located to the northwest of the Boam Lithium 
Mine  and  south  of  the  Sangdong  Tungsten  Mine.    The  Daehyeon  project  area  contains  the  highest 
concentration  of  lithium  anomalism  reported  from  the  KIGAM  geochemical  survey.  In  addition,  KIGAM 
mapping in the area identified numerous pegmatite outcrops (see Figures 2 - 3).   
 
The Dongsugok Project comprises a 15 block tenement package, centred around and adjacent to the Boam 
Lithium Mine where breccia and vein style pegmatite related lepidolite-elbaite-spodumene mineralisation 
occurs within the Janggun Limestone.3  
 
Globally,  lithium  is  mined  from  pegmatites  that  contain  lithium  bearing  minerals  such  as  spodumene, 
lepidolite and petalite.1  Pegmatites are interpreted to represent the last to crystallise, volatile rich, phases 
of intrusive granitic bodies that have concentrated rarer chemical elements with ionic sizes too great to fit 
into  crystalline  structures  of  major  rock  forming  minerals,  including  lithium,  tantalum,  tin  and  other 
associated elements, into dykes and sills distal to the parent intrusive which may lie below the Tonggo – Boam 
mine area as indicated by magnetic anomalies.2

Commentary 
At  the  Daehyeon  and  Dongsugok  Projects,  240  individual 
stream  sediment  samples  were  collected  and  assayed.  In 
addition,  a  99  sample  orientation  survey  was  undertaken 
over  streams  draining  the  area  around  the  Boam  Lithium 
Mine.  The  orientation  survey  focused  on  assessing  3 
sediment  size fractions, i.e. <80mesh (-0.18mm B  sample), 
40  to  80  mesh  (0.18  to  0.4  mm)  and  0.4mm  to  1.6mm  (A 
sample).  The  results  of  the  Boam  orientation  survey 
suggested  that  the  40  to  80  mesh  fraction  was  the  best 
fraction to assess lithium grades (Appendix 1). 
 
During the survey, 2 samples were sieved at each sample site 
and  collected  in  plastic  zip  lock  bags.  The  field  samples 
included a <0.4mm and 0.4<1.6mm sample for each site. The 
samples were then semi-dried at the Company’s secure core 
shed  at  Sotae-myeon  and  dispatched 
Intertek 
laboratories in the Philippines when all free water had been 
driven  off.  The  lab  then  further  dried  the  samples  before 
sieving  the  finer  -0.4mm  fraction  to  produce  a  third 
<0.18mm sample and a mid range 0.18<0.4mm B sample. All 
3 samples were then prepped and analysed using an Aqua 
regia digest to provide a suite of ICP results for each of the 3 
samples (Appendix 1).  
 
Following the evaluation of the results from the orientation 
survey, the balance of the <0.4mm samples were dispatched 
to  Intertek  for  prep  and  analysis.  The  additional  samples 
included  240  samples  from  the  Dongsugok  and  the 
Daehyeon  project  areas  (Figures  2  &  3  and  Appendix  2). 
Unfortunately,  due  to  a  combination  of  errors,  mistakes 
were made in the sample prep. A typing error by an SMCL 
staff member meant that the wrong prep code was entered 
on the submission  sheet. The lab then failed to  follow the 
written 
instructions  on  the  sample  submission  sheet 
requesting that each sample be sieved to produce a plus and 
a  minus  0.18mm  fraction.  As  a  result,  only  the  first  113 
samples  were  sieved  from  the  batch  of  240  samples.  The 
remaining 127 samples were erroneously pulverised without 
sieving  meaning  that  a  -0.4mm  fraction  (D  sample)  and  a 
0.18<0.4mm fraction were subsequently analysed. 
 
As  a  result  of  this  error,  a  direct  statistical  comparisons 
cannot be drawn between all the samples as the assayed size 
fraction varies across the sampled area. This error has most 
likely  resulted  in  an  undercall  of  lithium  grades  in  the  D 
sample based on the general differences observed between 
assays - the generally lower Li assay from the 0.18mm size 
fraction  compared  to  values  for  the  0.18<0.4mm  size 
fraction in the original orientation survey.

The locations of the sample points are shown in the figures 
2  and  3.  The  full  list  of  the  assay  results  are  included  as 
Appendix 2.
The  99  sample  orientation  survey  was  used  to  provide  a 
baseline over a known lithium occurrence and to help assess 
the  most  suitable  size  fraction  for  analysis.  The  survey  is 
considered total for lithium but only partial for Sn, W and Mo 
which  are  elements  known  to  have  dissolution  or 
precipitation issues when dissolved in acids.  
 
Samples were collected at sites above drainage intersections 
where sediment was collecting in a natural stream drainage 
trap.  Samples were sieved onsite and 2 size fractions were 
collected,  i.e.  <0.4mm  and  0.4<1.6mm.  After  drying  in  the 
Company’s core cutting shed, samples were dispatched by 
DHL to Intertek laboratories in the Philippines. Each sample 
fraction was nominally around 0.5kg wet and 0.35kg when 
semi-dry. As discussed previously, as part of the orientation 
survey,  the  finer  fraction  was  further  sieved  to  provide  a 
<0.18mm  fraction,  0.18<0.4mm  and  0.4<1.6mm  fractions. 
The orientation survey results indicated that the mid range 
0.18<0.4mm  fraction  was  the  best  fraction  to  identify 
anomalous Li  values in stream sediments.  This  formed the 
baseline for the subsequent assay work on samples from the 
Company’s other project areas.

Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the

All samples were stream sediments sieved at the sample site 
to provide 2 sample fractions. Subsequent lab based sieving 
produced  3  sample  fractions  with  the  mid  fraction 
(0.18<0.4mm) chosen for analysis. The samples were sieved 
using industry standard metal sieves. The field sieving was 
done  on  wet  samples  at  the  creek  sample  site.  The  lab 
sieving was undertaken on oven dried samples.
Once  the  appropriate  size  fraction  was  obtained  through 
sieving,  the  entire  fraction was then pulverised with a  sub 
sample and selected for acid digest and analysis. The details 
of the applicable sample preparation have been discussed in 
subsequent section on page 15.
Similar sample sites were chosen from each creek surveyed. 
Similar  sample  volumes  were  collected  from  each  sample 
site. The main quality control issue was the error made in the 
entry  of  the  sample  prep  code  in  the  sample  submission 
sheet  and  the  lab’s  failure  to  follow  the  additional  typed 
instructions regarding sample preparation. As a result, 127 
of the <0.4mm fraction samples from the main survey were 
pulverised without first being sieved. The analysis results of 
the 127 samples are highlighted in pale blue in Appendix 2 
and coded with D suffixes to the sample ID. These cannot be 
compared absolutely  with the results from the orientation 
survey and the results from the other 113 analyses.
Samples  were  collected  from  two  different  sites  (DS0009 
and AS0009) about 140m apart from the same stream. The 
results from both sites are within 1.5ppm Li of each other. At 
this  point  in  time,  no  other  duplicate  samples  have  been 
taken at any of the other sample sites. The coarser and finer 
fractions  from  each  site  have  been  retained  for  possible 
future  comparative  analysis.  The  3  analyses  from  the 
orientation  survey  are  also  available  to  the  reader  as 
Appendix 1. 
 
No  sample  splits  have  been  analysed  other  than  those 
routinely  analysed  by  the  laboratory  as  part  of  their  own 
internal QA/QC process. 
 
The  sample  size  is  considered  adequate  for  a  stream 
sediment  survey  and  the  size  fraction  was  selected  after 
analysis of the baseline survey over a known lithium deposit.

levels  of  accuracy  (i.e.  lack  of  bias)  and 
precision have been established.
All samples are stream sediment samples collected using a 
trowel and -1.6mm and -0.4mm sieves and collection dish. 
The wet field sample was then collected in a pre-labelled zip 
lock  plastic  bag.  The  samples  were  then  transported  by 
Company personnel to the Company’s secure core shed and 
office  facility  at  Sotae-myeon  and  semi-dried  in  the  core 
cutting shed (sea container) using an electric blanket and gas 
heater.  Once  dry  (after  2  to  3  weeks),  samples  were 
dispatched to Interek laboratories in the Philippines through 
DHL global forwarding. 
 
The  samples  were  packed  in  Styrofoam  boxes  wrapped  in 
cardboard.  Samples  were  then  further  dried,  sieved  and 
prepped at the lab prior to analysis.  
 
The  samples  were  logged  into  the  Intertek  system  upon 
arrival  at  the  Cupang  laboratory.  Samples  were  dried 
overnight at 60oC.  
 
Once  dry,  in  the  case  of  146  samples,  the  finer  <0.4mm 
fraction was sieved to produce a <0.18mm and 0.18<0.4mm 
fraction for analysis with the finer reject  fraction retained. 
The remaining 127 samples were erroneously not sieved. In 
the  case  of  the  orientation  survey,  3  fractions  were 
pulverised  and  prepped  for  analysis  to  generate  99  assay 
results (Appendix 1).  113 of the remaining 240 samples were 
sieved as requested and the mid range 0.18<0.4mm fraction 
was  pulverised  and  analysed.  The  remaining  127  samples 
were  not  sieved  and  the  entire  sub  0.4mm  fraction  was 
pulverised.  
 
A 10gm sub sample of the pulverised material from the 339 
samples analysed was selected for digest using a Aqua regia 
dissolution.  The  final  aliquot  was  then  analysed  using  a 
mixture  of  ICP-OES  or  ICP-MS.  Results  are  summarised  in 
Appendix 1 & 2). 
 
The Li analyses can be considered near total but the Sn, W 
and Mo assays should only be considered partial.
No geophysical results are commented upon in this release. 
The possibility of future geophysical surveys is discussed.
The  Company has not  included any blank  or CRM samples 
with these analyses.  The Company has relied solely on the 
standard repeat and CRM protocols undertaken by Intertek 
on the analyses of these samples.   
 
Only one duplicate sample was taken and no repeats other 
than  those  involving  size  fraction  analysis  as  part  of  the 
orientation survey have been undertaken at this time.

were  recorded  into  a  field  traverse  sheets  and  later 
transferred to an Excel spreadsheet. Samples were packed 
in styrofoam boxes reinforced by wrapping with  cardboard 
and  dispatched  by  DHL  Global  Forwarding  to  Intertek 
Laboratories  in  the  Philippines  after  a  2  or  3  week  drying 
process at the Company’s secure core yard facility. On arrival 
in Philippines, samples were held by customs for three to 15 
days before release to the laboratory staff. The laboratory 
conducts its own internal auditing of the sample processing 
procedures  to  maintain  sample  security  and  minimise  the 
risks  of  sample  contamination  or  swapping  during  the 
analytical process.
The Intertek laboratory in Cupang has not been audited by 
Company personnel. This is not considered material at this 
stage of the project evaluation process. Sampling techniques 
and  practices  and  assay  methodology  are  periodically 
reviewed  as  part  of  the  overall  aim  for  continuous 
improvement in the Company's sampling protocol.

SMCL, a  wholly  owned  subsidiary of Peninsula renewed its 
applications  for  exploration  rights  on  the  17  August  2016 
over 61 tenements on the Seobyeokri map sheet for Li, Ta, 
Nb, Y, Be, Ce, La, Mo and W. In addition, Sn exploration rights 
were  granted  over  59  tenement  blocks  (Figures  2  &  3) 
Further Au, Ag and basemetal rights were also granted over 
a  lesser  number  of  blocks.  A  full  list  of  tenements  was 
included  with  the  last  quarterly  report  and  will  be  further 
updated in the Annual Report. The tin exploration rights for 
blocks  123  and  133  are  already  held  by  another  party. 
Together, these two blocks are referred to as the Naedeok 
prospect.  Exploration  rights  are  granted  by  commodity  for 
tenement blocks defined by the GRS080 grid system over 1x1 
minute  graticule  blocks.    In  addition,  on  17  June  2016  the 
company  refiled  applications  for  the  exploration  rights  for 
the full range of elements over 16 tenement blocks on the 
Hyeongdong sheet to the east and west of the Boam lithium 
mine.  
 
The company now has until 13 February 2017 in the case of 
the Daehyeon project area and 14 December in the case of 
the  Dongsugok  Project  area  to  successfully  lodge  Mineral 
Deposit  Survey  reports  (MDS)  over  the  16  applied  areas 
before the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE). 
The Ministry then reviews the MDS and if satisfied, will issue 
an exploration right.

The Company has been granted tenure for 6 months and is 
required to submit an MDS report for each of the 77 applied 
tenements  prior  to  the  end  of  the  6  month  application 
period. 
 
If the MDS report is accepted by the Ministry, the Company 
will be granted Mining rights over the applied tenement for 
a further 3 years. Following the successful filing of the MDS, 
the  applicant  is  required  to  file  a  Prospecting  Application 
(PA).The PA report details the planned exploration activities 
to  be  completed  over  the  tenement  during  the  3  year 
prospecting  period.    This  includes  the  completion  of  a 
minimum  quantum  of  geophysical  surveys,  geochemical 
surveys or drilling as defined under the Mines Act. Provided 
that at least 50% of the statutory requirement is completed 
within  the  initial  3  year  prospecting  period,  the  tenement 
holder is entitled to apply for an additional 3 year extension 
to  facilitate  the  completion  of  the  specified  exploration 
programme. A Prospecting Report must then be submitted 
to  the  Ministry  at  the  completion  of  the  exploration 
programme. The tenement holder must then submit a Mine 
Planning  Application  (MPA)  to  the 
local  Government 
Authority who will, if the MPA is approved, grant tenure for 
mining  for  a  period  of  20  years  subject  to  statutory 
requirements  as  set  out  under  the  terms  of  the  MPA 
approval. The applicant holding a Mining Right can apply for 
extensions  provided  all  statutory  requirements  have  been 
met over the life of the mine.  
 
The Company has presented and commented upon all past 
exploration work in the area that the Company is currently 
aware  of.  All  the  exploration  work  by  KIGAM  has  been 
undertaken as high level reconnaissance  surveys including: 
airborne geophysics, regional scale stream sediment surveys 
and large scale regional geological mapping1,2. 
 
Company  is  not  aware  of  any  detailed  exploration  having 
been  undertaken  in  the  past  on  any  of  the  granted 
tenements.  The  Company  has  no  records  of  the  past 
production from any of the historic mines in the district. 
 
Data reviews and compilation are ongoing and the Company 
will  also  seek  to  acquire  any  recent  Korea  Resources 
Corporation  (KORES)  or  historic  Korea  Mineral  Promotion 
Corporation (KMPC) reports on any of the applied tenement 
blocks.

The  geological 
lithium 
mineralisation associated with lithium bearing minerals such 
as petalite, lepidolite, spodumene, elbaite and amblygonite. 
Historic mapping by KIGAM has highlighted a broad swarm of 
pegmatite  dykes  across  the  applied  tenement  area.  These 
dykes intrude Precambrian basement schists of the Goseonri 
Formation.  The  Goseonri  Formation 
is  a  mixed  meta-
sedimentary  sequence  of  slates,  sericite-chlorite-quartz 
schists,  biotite-quartz-andalusite  schists  and  cordierite-
mica±sillimanite schists. Locally meta-limestone calc-silicates 
occur as lenses. Towards the west of the applied area, biotite 
and quartz  feldspar gneisses become  more common as the 
basement sequence becomes more migmatitic while to the 
southeast, the Goseonri schist sequence is analogous to the 
Yulri  Formation  mapped  at  Boam3.  The  basement  schist 
sequence  is  intruded  by  Mesozoic  (Cretaceous)  granites, 
quartz feldspar porphyry and pegmatitic and basic dykes. The 
Hongjesa  Granite  occurs  in  the  Daehyeon  and  Uguchi 
tenement  areas  and  is  described  as  a  two  mica  microcline 
bearing granite. The Chunyang granite is a two mica granite 
with local coarse feldspar phenocrysts that occurs along the 
southern margin of the Uguchi prospect area.  
 
The  mineralisation  at  Boam  is  described  as  being  lepidolite 
micas associated with quartz veins either within pegmatitic or 
aplitic  dykes  or  as  breccia  style  mineralisation.  Choi  et  al., 
2014 have postulated that the Boam mineralisation is related 
to a large blind intrusive system.1   They  have described the 
ore  at  the  Boam  mine  as  greisen  style  mineralisation 
associated  with  a  blind  intrusive  body1.  Historically,  the 
pegmatites  in  the  district  were

The images in this release relate to stream sediment samples 
collected by Company personnel as part of a follow-up and 
infill  survey  over  areas  highlighted  by  KIGAM  as  being 
anomalous for lithium.  
 
The IDW interpolation undertaken by KIGAM and presented 
in  the  publically  available  images  is  by  default  smoothed 
during the interpolation phase4. The colour coded zones on 
the  processed  image  reflect  statistically  generated  zones 
based on percentile analysis of the primary data. The basis 
for  this  interpretation  and  interpolation  appears  to  be 
geostatistically sound. 
 
The Company has adopted a similar data range for the results 
presented  in  this  announcement  so  that  the  data  can  be 
readily compared with the KIGAM country wide data set. 
 
 The data has not been aggregated.  
 
No metal equivalent vales have been reported.
