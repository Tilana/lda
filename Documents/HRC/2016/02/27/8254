<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on the situation of human 
rights in Guinea</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In her previous report on Guinea (A/HRC/16/26), the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights made several recommendations to the Government, 
including that it take the necessary steps to fight impunity, prosecute the perpetrators of the 
human rights violations of 28 September 2009, establish a national human rights institution 
in conformity with the Paris Principles, follow up on the universal periodic review 
recommendations and undertake reform of the security sector consistent with human rights. 
</p>
<p> During the period from January to December 2011, the Government took steps 
towards implementing some of the above-mentioned recommendations, including on 
security sector reform. Nonetheless, reports continue on human rights violations, some of 
which were investigated by the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR), including 
allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention, harassment and threats against human rights 
defenders, and breaches of the right to freedoms of assembly and association. Most of the 
allegations of human rights violations were attributed to the security forces. 
</p>
<p> OHCHR in Guinea collaborated with the Government of Guinea, civil society 
organizations and other national and international stakeholders to elaborate strategies to 
address human rights challenges in the country. The transitional Parliament, the Conseil 
national de transition, adopted a bill to set up an independent national human rights 
institution, which was presented to the President for final adoption and promulgation into 
law. The steering committee overseeing security sector reform presented its final report to 
the President. With regard to national reconciliation, the President appointed two religious 
personalities as co-chairpersons of the provisional national commission on reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>These positive developments represent important steps towards the launching of a 
transitional justice process. 
</p>
<p> Despite these positive steps, major shortcomings remain in the follow-up to human 
rights violations. In particular, the commitment of the Government to prioritize the fight 
against impunity, reiterated by the High Commissioner during her visit to Guinea in March 
2011, has not been followed up, as illustrated by the slow rate of prosecution of the 
presumed authors of crimes against humanity committed during the events of 28 September 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p> The efforts of OHCHR in Guinea to assist the Government to address human rights 
issues have also been undermined by contextual and structural challenges, notably the slow 
pace of political transition and the delay in the holding of parliamentary elections, required 
for important institutional, judicial and legislative reforms to be undertaken. The report 
concludes with recommendations for the Government of Guinea and the international 
community on measures to be taken to address the human rights challenges.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/21, 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights assesses the human rights 
situation in Guinea during the period from January to December 2011 and the actions taken 
by the Government to implement the recommendations of international human rights 
mechanisms, including those made at the universal periodic review of the Human Rights 
Council and the recommendations made in the previous report of the High Commissioner 
(A/HRC/16/26). In the report, she also reviews the activities of the Office of the High 
Commissioner (OHCHR) in Guinea, and concludes with recommendations for the 
Government and the international community.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Visit of the High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>2. The High Commissioner visited Guinea in March 2011, shortly after the 
inauguration of President Alpha Cond&#233;. During her visit, she met with the President and 
senior Government officials, the United Nations country team, civil society organizations 
and associations of victims of human rights violations, and the diplomatic corps. In her 
discussions with the President and senior Government officials, she raised critical human 
rights issues, including the need for the Government to expedite measures to end impunity 
and to ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the international commission 
of inquiry into the human rights violations committed on 28 September 2009. She also 
urged the Government to establish a truth, justice and reconciliation commission and an 
independent national human rights institution, and to cooperate with international human 
rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review mechanism, the special 
procedures and the treaty bodies, and to implement their recommendations. She offered the 
continued support of OHCHR for Guinea.  
</p>
<p>3. President Alpha Cond&#233; affirmed the Government&#8217;s commitment to respect human 
rights and stressed that it would not tolerate impunity. The Government requested 
assistance from OHCHR, in particular in establishing a truth and reconciliation process and 
in fulfilling its treaty reporting obligations. The Government also pledged to cooperate with 
the United Nations human rights mechanisms and with OHCHR. Civil society 
organizations highlighted the need for a strong &#8220;justice&#8221; element in the truth and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation process to be established by the Government in order to deal with the legacy 
of impunity in Guinea.  
</p>
<p>4. The civil society organizations asked the Government to support the panel of judges 
appointed to investigate the human rights violations of 28 September 2009 in order for it to 
carry out a credible investigation, and noted that there was no definition of torture and other 
international crimes in Guinean law. They also called for the establishment of an 
independent national human rights institution, as well the reform and strengthening of the 
system of administration of justice and reform of the security sector. They pointed to a 
large backlog of criminal cases awaiting trial, resulting in exceedingly large numbers of 
people held in prolonged pretrial detention, and expressed concern about the significant 
number of clandestine detention facilities in the country. Some civil society representatives 
also stressed the importance of proper commemoration of the victims of decades of human 
rights violations, and requested the return of the bodies of those who had disappeared 
during the successive massacres in the country to their families for burial. They recalled 
that thousands of bodies had been buried in mass graves throughout the country and that the 
Government had cordoned off these sites for security reasons, presumably because they 
were located on military land.  </p>


<p>5. The High Commissioner also visited the Centre m&#232;re et enfant, a facility that caters 
for female survivors of sexual violence and other acts of torture committed on 28 
September 2009. She met privately with some 35 of the victims, who shared their stories 
and called for justice and reparations. She also met with about 40 male victims of torture 
and listened to their concerns, which mostly related to impunity and the lack of medical and 
social services available to them.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Main political developments affecting human rights 
</b></p>
<p>6. The human rights situation in Guinea during the period under review was influenced 
by a number of political developments. In particular, delays in completing the envisaged 
political transition, including the organization of parliamentary elections, impeded much 
needed institutional and legislative reforms. The stalemate over parliamentary elections also 
generated tensions, which occasionally degenerated into violence. There were also some 
issues of general insecurity.  
</p>
<p>7. As part of the political transition in Guinea, it was envisaged that the presidential 
elections at the end of 2010 would be followed by parliamentary elections, and that the 
parliament would then undertake the necessary institutional and legislative reforms. The 
parliamentary elections were not held because of a disagreement between the governing 
party, the Rassemblement du peuple de Guin&#233;e (RPG), and the main opposition party, the 
Union des forces d&#233;mocratiques de Guin&#233;e (UFDG), over the timetable for legislative 
elections and related issues. The Government proposed to carry out several electoral 
reforms before the elections, including organizing an electoral census, developing a new 
voters&#8217; list and reconstituting the Commission nationale &#233;lectorale ind&#233;pendante (CENI). 
On the other hand, the opposition parties, represented by the Collectif des partis politiques 
pour la finalisation de la transition, maintained that a simple revision of the voters&#8217; list 
would be adequate. They requested that the Government stop all commitments in relation to 
the electoral process and to restructure CENI, which they regarded as polarized along the 
memberships of political parties. 
</p>
<p>8. In the midst of this disagreement, on 16 September 2011, the President of CENI 
announced that the legislative elections would be held on 29 December 2011, and went 
ahead with the recruitment and training of enumerators. In response, the opposition 
organized a protest march on 27 September to put pressure on the Government to respond 
to their demands. The march was banned by the authorities, and protesters&#8217; attempts to 
demonstrate turned violent; three people were allegedly killed and several injured, owing 
reportedly to the use of excessive force by law enforcers. Numerous arrests and detentions 
were subsequently made by the security forces, and those arrested were charged with 
participation in an unlawful demonstration and destruction of property, then tried and 
sentenced to prison terms.  
</p>
<p>9. There was concern that the relationship between the RPG and the Collectif des partis 
politiques pour la finalisation de la transition could further deteriorate. Several international 
partners and some national stakeholders thus intervened to mediate and the Group of 
Friends1 met with the president to facilitate dialogue between the Government and 
opposition parties.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 Initiated by the President to replace the Contact Group on Guinea. It comprises representatives of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the 
International Organization of la Francophonie, the World Bank, the Mano River Union, Communaut&#233; 
des Etats Sah&#233;lo-Sahariens, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Burkina Faso, China, France, 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>10. Following these interventions, the President set up a committee for dialogue 
between the Government and the opposition. The opposition parties insisted, however, on 
the release of detained demonstrators and a consensus on the date of elections as a 
condition for participation in any dialogue. In a bid to reduce tensions, the President 
pardoned 25 people convicted for participating in an unauthorized demonstration and other 
counts relating to the incidents of 28 September 2009. Meanwhile, the legislative and local 
elections, which were scheduled for December 2011, were postponed. There remains a fear 
that the current tensions could spill over into the electoral process and lead to more violence 
and human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>11. There were also signs of political instability that had an impact on human rights. On 
19 July 2011, the President&#8217;s residence was attacked by several armed people, apparently in 
an attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. A member of the presidential guard was killed during the attack 
and several bodyguards and attackers were injured. Following the attack, road blocks that 
had been established in Conakry and other parts of the country were used by parts of the 
security forces to intimidate and harass the public. In addition, several people suspected of 
involvement in the attack were arrested; 25 soldiers and 28 civilians are currently in pretrial 
detention at the central prison in Conakry. They have been charged with treason, homicide, 
attempted homicide of the President and illegal possession of weapons.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>12. The situation of human rights has improved since the post-electoral crisis at the end 
of 2010. The Government has also taken some steps towards reform of the security and 
judicial sectors, and institutional reform more generally. The security forces have also made 
some progress in improving crowd-control techniques by reducing the number of security 
forces carrying firearms and keeping the army in the barracks during the demonstrations. 
Nevertheless, some of the structural and institutional impediments remain, including the 
persistence of impunity and weaknesses in the judicial sector as well as in the national 
human rights protection framework more generally. Reports were received of serious 
human rights violations during this period, including the violation of the right to free 
assembly and association, cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, poor conditions of 
detention and increased poverty.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>13. Although the Penal Code of Guinea requires only prior notification of public 
demonstrations, authorities often insisted on formal authorizations to organize 
demonstrations. In the absence of <i>bourgmestres</i> (mayors) legally authorized to receive 
notifications, administrative authorities often abused their power by prohibiting 
demonstrations they deemed contrary to their interest. A clear example of such a situation 
was observed in April 2011, when police and gendarmerie agents used excessive force to 
quell a peaceful demonstration organized by UFDG supporters to mark the return of 
opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo after a long stay abroad. Even though the organizers 
notified the authorities, as required by law, the Governor of Conakry &#8211; who had no 
prerogative in such matters &#8211; banned the demonstration.  
</p>
<p>  
the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United 
States of America. </p>


<p>14. During the reporting period, at least five people were reportedly killed during 
political demonstrations banned by the authorities in April and September 2011. Security 
forces used tear gas and shot live ammunition in the air to disperse protesters.  
</p>
<p>15. On 3 April, a 35-year-old man was intentionally shot in the head by a police officer 
during a demonstration to welcome an opposition leader, and died two days later from his 
injuries. Medical sources confirmed having treated 27 demonstrators at Donka hospital, 
mostly for bullet wounds in the legs.  
</p>
<p>16. On 27 September, the security forces violently dispersed a demonstration organized 
by the Collectif des partis de l&#8217;opposition pour la finalisation de transition, even though the 
organizers had reportedly informed the authorities beforehand; once again, the Governor of 
Conakry banned the protest. The security forces allegedly cordoned off streets and 
crossroads to prevent demonstrators from taking to the streets. They reportedly used tear 
gas and shot in the air and at the crowd, which led to an outbreak of violence between 
demonstrators and the security forces. During the clashes, a 25-year-old man allegedly died 
of gunshot wounds, while two other people reportedly died of stab wounds. Hospital 
sources confirmed that 55 people were treated and that nine were hospitalized at Donka 
hospital, mostly for injuries caused by beatings, machetes and bullets.  
</p>
<p>17. On 8 November, a few days before a demonstration organized by the Bar 
Association in December to protest against interference by the Governor of Conakry with 
the work of the judiciary, the Minister for Territorial Administration published a 
communiqu&#233; on State media banning all political demonstrations without prior notification. 
Faced with accusations for attempting to deprive citizens of their rights and freedoms, the 
Minister stated during an interview that his communiqu&#233; was meant to remind citizens to 
respect human rights. The protest march organized by the Bar Association was held on 14 
November without incident. 
</p>
<p>18. OHCHR noted that, during some political demonstrations, opposing groups of 
demonstrators threw stones and used machetes. Some protestors were harassed and their 
personal items stolen. Projectiles allegedly thrown by demonstrators reportedly injured 24 
security officers, who were hospitalized at the Camp Almany Samory Tour&#233; in Conakry. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Arbitrary arrests, detentions and prison conditions 
</b></p>
<p>19. There were reported cases of arbitrary arrest and detention by security forces during 
peaceful demonstrations. Approximately 350 people, including minors and elderly persons, 
were indiscriminately arrested and detained after the demonstrations of 27 September. 
OHCHR Guinea confirmed that at least 60 people, including minors, were arrested and 
detained at several police stations in Conakry. Some detainees interviewed by OHCHR 
staff claimed that they had not even been taking part in the demonstration and were arrested 
arbitrarily on the streets. The detainees were referred to the Trial Court of Dixinn, which 
charged them with participation in an unauthorized demonstration and destruction of public 
and private property. A total of 154 people were sentenced to terms ranging from one 
month to a year. On 17 November, the President signed a decree granting pardon to 25 of 
them. 
</p>
<p>20. Prison facilities are characterized by overcrowding and conditions below minimum 
international standards in terms of health care, food and hygiene, and lack recreational and 
educational facilities. For example, the Central Prison in Conakry, which was originally 
designed to house 300 inmates, currently houses more than 1,000. In some circumstances, 
detainees and convicts are put in the same cell. OHCHR staff members in Guinea visited 
several detention centres and noted that, on many occasions, suspects had been detained for 
minor offences beyond the legally stipulated period of 48 hours. </p>


<p>21. The lack of qualified staff remains a major challenge for the correctional system in 
Guinea. Although 600 new prisons wardens were recruited in July 2010, they had not 
undergone adequate training and lack uniforms and other basic equipment. Prison wardens 
dress in military fatigues, which are not distinguishable from army uniforms. The 
registration of inmates is still done manually at the Central Prison in Conakry. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>22. Guinea is one of the poorest countries in Africa; according to the Human 
Development Report for 2011 issued by the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP), the country currently ranks 178 on the Human Development Index. Women and 
children, particularly from the rural poor, constitute the most vulnerable segment of the 
population, with the highest rates of infant and maternal mortality, malnutrition, exposure 
to HIV/AIDs and other endemic diseases, as well as enduring the harshest living conditions. 
The degree of social and economic deprivation was aggravated by the escalation in food 
prices in 2011. The mismanagement of public funds further compounded the poverty 
situation and raised serious obstacles to the realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights. 
</p>
<p>23. In an effort to reduce poverty, in 2011, the Government subsidized the price of rice, 
which is the staple food, to make it more affordable. It also allocated 10 billion Guinean 
francs (approximately $1.3 million) to create income-generating activities in order to fight 
youth unemployment, and ordered that State hospitals provide caesarean operations free of 
charge.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Responses to human rights challenges, including impunity 
</b></p>
<p>24. Impunity remains a serious problem in Guinea, especially among the security forces. 
The Government has committed to judicial reform as a priority area in order to address this 
problem. It is also committed to the establishment of an independent national human rights 
institution and transitional justice mechanisms. In all these priority areas, little was done. 
While the Government has already identified where it needs support (transitional justice 
process, judicial reform, training of security forces in human rights), it has to redouble 
efforts to expedite reforms. The International Commission of Inquiry on the events of 28 
September 2009 recommended that the United Nations should engage with the Government 
to commit to the reform of the judicial sector, in compliance with international human 
rights norms and principles and benefiting from enough resources for its functioning.2 
</p>
<p>25. The International Commission of Inquiry highlighted impunity as a priority concern 
in Guinea. The Government has been cooperating with the Office of the Prosecutor of the 
International Criminal Court, which visited the country on several occasions in 2010 and 
2011, to discuss the responses to crimes against humanity committed on 28 September 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>26. A panel of three renowned judges was appointed by the Minister for Justice to 
investigate the human rights violations committed on 28 September 2009 and during its 
aftermath. The ability of the panel to carry out its mandate was limited by the lack of 
political will and resources. The Government made efforts to improve the working 
conditions of judges as well as their security. They were relocated to separate premises at 
</p>
<p>  
 2 S/2009/693, para. 267. </p>


<p>the Conakry Court of Appeal and were provided with a platoon of gendarmes for their 
security. However, concerns remain about the security of victims and witnesses.  
</p>
<p>27. In May 2011, the Minister for Justice informed OHCHR that the judges had 
interviewed numerous victims, including survivors of rape and other sexual violence, and 
had heard several witnesses. To date, 191 victims have filed civil claims before the panel 
and nearly 100 more are expected to join soon. Counsels for civil claimants have pointed to 
difficulties regarding access to investigation files. While the Code of Criminal Procedure 
states that investigation files are to be made available to counsel for the parties, and it is 
usual practice in Guinea to provide a copy of the preliminary investigation file, access to 
the files for civil party litigation teams in this case was restricted by the investigating team. 
. 
</p>
<p>28. Five people are currently in custody and a sixth has been placed under judicial 
supervision;3 however, the people named in the final report of the International 
Commission of Inquiry as having criminal responsibility have yet to be prosecuted; indeed, 
some of them still hold office. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>29. In her previous report, the High Commissioner highlighted the challenges faced by 
the judicial system in Guinea, including understaffing, the shortage of trained personnel and 
resources and the lack of independence and corruption. The Government of Guinea made 
some efforts to address these challenges in 2011. In March, the Government organized a 
national consultative workshop to assess the judicial system. Participants in the workshop 
recommended, inter alia, an increase in the budget of the Ministry of Justice, the institution 
of a proper national school for the judiciary and the establishment of a high judicial council. 
In June 2011, the Minister for Justice issued several decrees appointing current and 38 new 
magistrates to courts in Conakry and in the interior of the country. This reorganization of 
magistrates coupled with an increase in staff is a positive step towards the strengthening of 
the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>30. The European Union and other development partners have provided some funds to 
assist the Ministry of Justice to start implementing the recommendations made at the 
workshop by improving Ministry infrastructure and facilities.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Other initiatives and reforms 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Transitional justice process 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Government identified national reconciliation as a priority. In his inaugural 
speech, the President pledged to organize a conference on national reconciliation. Although 
there is general consensus that Guineans desire national reconciliation, there is no 
consensus on the form that it should take. Initial consultations carried out by the Conseil 
&#233;conomique et social with the support of the Peacebuilding Fund indicate that Guineans are 
divided about the process along ethnic and political lines. While some would like a 
comprehensive process dealing with all human rights violations since the country&#8217;s 
</p>

<p>independence and include a sanctions/justice dimension, others would prefer to forgive and 
forget. A draft programme for national reconciliation was submitted to the Prime Minister 
in February 2011. OHCHR participated in the technical committee in charge of reflecting 
on national reconciliation and facilitated a mission by the committee to Ghana and Togo to 
gather experience. The President has taken certain measures to advance the process. In June 
2011, he created the  Commission de r&#233;flexion sur la r&#233;conciliation nationale; in August, he 
appointed the Imam of the Conakry Fay&#231;al Mosque and the Archbishop of Conakry as co-
chairpersons of a provisional national reconciliation commission.  
</p>
<p>32. The structure of the provisional national reconciliation commission has not been 
clearly defined, although the commission has been mandated to reflect and make proposals 
on how to achieve reconciliation. OHCHR advised the co-chairpersons to start their work 
with consultations in order to collect peoples&#8217; opinions on how the process should be 
carried out. The Office also proposed that they take into consideration an approach that 
guaranteed the protection of victims and witnesses. The commission has started with 
consultations. The provision of funds by the Peacebuilding Fund, including for the 
operation of the commission, will enable it to accelerate consultations and the preparatory 
work for the transitional justice process. OHCHR had several meetings with the members 
of the commission and offered its technical assistance to them. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Establishment of a national human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>33. Among the recommendations made at the eighth session of the universal periodic 
review was that Guinea should establish an independent national human rights institution in 
accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles). Although Guinea initiated 
the process of creating a national human rights institution in 2008 when it established the 
National Democracy and Human Rights Monitoring Body (Observatoire national de la 
d&#233;mocratie et des droits de l&#8217;homme) under the supervision of the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office, 
</p>
<p>the institution remained understaffed and underresourced, and was not empowered to 
investigate human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>34. On 17 March 2011, the President appointed, by decree, Mamadi Kaba as President 
of the proposed national human rights commission. Civil society organizations criticized 
the appointment for contravening the requirement of the Paris Principles for an inclusive 
process for the selection of the members of a national human rights institution. The 
appointment was subsequently revoked by a decree, which also effectively dissolved the 
National Democracy and Human Rights Monitoring Body. 
</p>
<p>35. In July, the Conseil national de transition adopted draft legislation setting up a 
national human rights commission. The bill was sent to the President for review, and is 
pending final adoption and promulgation. During this period, OHCHR organized a 
workshop to sensitize actors on the establishment of an independent national human rights 
institution. Participants reviewed the bill at the workshop and made recommendations to 
improve it; to clarify the procedure for mobilizing and managing resources; to clarify the 
selection, appointment and removal of members of the national human rights institution; 
and to redefine the powers of the President of the institution. At the time of writing, no 
further move had been made by the Government on this issue. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Integration of human rights into security sector reform  
</b></p>
<p>36. The security services, including the police, gendarmes and the military, have been 
implicated in the most serious human rights violations committed in Guinea between May </p>


<p>2008 and December 2010. It is also well known that violence and human rights violations 
in 1985, 2006 and 2007, and during the regime of Sekou Tour&#233; (1958-1984) were 
committed mainly by the security and defence forces. Successive Governments often 
manipulated the military for their own political objectives, at times using the security and 
defence forces to silence critics and put down protests. Irregular recruitment, including of 
ethnic militias, into the military services exacerbated the crisis in the security sector. 
Indiscipline grew, culminating in several mutinies over demands for higher wages and 
better working conditions. 
</p>
<p>37. In 2008, an assessment of the security sector conducted by an international team 
composed of representatives of the African Union, the Economic Community of West 
African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations found structural deficiencies in the 
functioning of the army, police and judiciary that led to impunity for violations of human 
rights and increased mistrust between the security forces and the population. In its report, 
the team recommended the integration of human rights in the reform of the sector. At the 
universal periodic review of Guinea, in 2010, the promotion of human rights education for 
the security forces was also recommended. The Government has taken measures to move 
forward with the security sector reform. In March 2011, it organized a national seminar on 
security sector reform, which was followed by a planning workshop in May. 
</p>
<p>38. The Government also created a steering committee for security sector reform, 
supported by a number of technical committees. The steering committee submitted its 
findings to the President on 2 November 2011, including a plan of action, draft national 
security policy laws and draft decrees. These documents are not, however, rights-based. 
OHCHR, together with actors and partners, such as the International Committee of the Red 
Cross, are advocating for human rights and international humanitarian law to be taken into 
consideration in the final document to be adopted by the Conseil national de transition.  
</p>
<p>39. As immediate measures, the Government demilitarized the capital, relocated heavy 
weapons to barracks in the interior of the country and took measures to strengthen 
discipline in the armed forces. It also introduced biometric identification of military staff 
members and submitted to the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund a project aimed at 
retiring 4,300 soldiers. The project is designed to pay a separation allowance and to 
establish a military pension fund. Development partners, such as the European Union, 
expressed their wish to assist in the establishment of the military pension fund. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Role of civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>40. Civil society in Guinea has limited capacity to conduct effective programmes to 
promote and protect human rights. Its interaction with United Nations human rights 
mechanisms is also minimal, primarily owing to a lack of knowledge of human rights 
principles and mechanisms. OHCHR has carried out several training workshops for civil 
society organizations to enhance their knowledge of human rights principles and 
understanding of United Nations mechanisms and how to actively use them, for instance in 
submitting shadow reports. The Office also organized workshops to train civil society 
organizations in investigating and reporting on human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>41. Human rights defenders still face harassment and the threat of arbitrary arrest and 
detention. In November 2011, for example, five members of a non-governmental human 
rights organization accompanying two individuals who had just been released after a 
prolonged period of detention were detained and interrogated for several hours on the 
orders of the Governor of Conakry. They were subsequently released without charge.  </p>


<p><b> VIII. Engagement with international human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>42. Although Guinea is party to the main international human rights treaties, it has not 
ratified the First and Second Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. As mentioned in the previous report, Guinea has not yet submitted its 
reports to five treaty bodies, and 13 reports to treaty bodies are overdue. 
</p>
<p>43. In September 2009, the Government established an inter-ministerial committee to 
prepare for the universal periodic review, which it did successfully with support from 
OHCHR. In October 2011, the Government, in collaboration with OHCHR Guinea, 
organized a workshop to prepare a plan of action for the implementation of the 
recommendations from the universal periodic review and to develop a national human 
rights plan of action. Participants included members of the inter-ministerial committee, civil 
society organizations, non-governmental human rights organizations and relevant 
stakeholders. A national plan of action was drawn up taking into consideration the 
recommendations of the universal periodic review, treaty body recommendations and the 
recommendations of the International Commission of Inquiry. Some of the activities in the 
plan expected to be accomplished by 2015 include:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment and functioning of all institutions provided for in the Constitution  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The implementation of all recommendations of the Etats G&#233;n&#233;raux de la Justice 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The identification and ratification of principal treaties and conventions pending  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The strengthening of the capacity of army and security forces  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The amelioration of prison conditions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The fight against impunity, especially the prosecution of perpetrators of human 
rights violations of 28 September 2009 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of a support fund for victims of specific violence  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The creation of a committee in charge of preparing reports for treaty bodies 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of a programme on human rights education for the population, 
State agents and educational institutions 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Other forms of cooperation with the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>44. On 24 January, the Government confirmed the request made by the interim 
Government to the Peacebuilding Commission for support in three peacebuilding priority 
areas: (a) youth and women employment policy; (b) the promotion of national 
reconciliation; and (c) reform of the security and defence sector. Guinea was officially 
placed on the Commission&#8217;s agenda in February, and a Commission-led technical mission, 
including OHCHR, visited the country in May to develop a timetable to draft the priority 
plan. The statement of mutual commitments was signed by the President and the 
Chairperson of the Commission on 23 September.  
</p>
<p>45. The statement f mutual commitments elaborates priority actions in the promotion of 
national reconciliation and unity and security and defence sector reform, and stresses the 
need to establish a national reconciliation mechanism and an independent national human 
rights institution. With regard to the security sector, it seeks to establish a smaller, more 
professional army and to undertake a census of all security forces, and to establish and 
strengthen mechanisms and processes for civilian monitoring and oversight of the security 
sector as well as capacity-building for key Government departments concerned. The 
Government steering committee identified six quick-start projects for peacebuilding </p>


<p>funding, in particular projects to (a) support the promotion of dialogue; (b) support the 
economic integration of women and youth; (c) assist the biometric census of the defence 
forces; (d) assist victims of torture and gender-based violence; (e) strengthen the 
democratic and civilian control of defence forces; and (f) assist the retirement of 4,300 
soldiers.  
</p>
<p>46. If successfully implemented, the above-mentioned projects will contribute to 
strengthening the national human rights protection framework. OHCHR will participate in 
the implementation of the projects to support the promotion of dialogue and to assist 
victims of torture and gender-based violence, and provide expertise to strengthen national 
capacity for the project on national reconciliation. With regard to the project to assist 
victims of torture and gender-based violence, OHCHR will continue to provide support to 
two non-governmental organizations  &#8211; the Association des victimes, parents et amis du 28 
septembre 2009 and the Centre m&#232;re et enfant &#8211; which are currently being supported 
through the Voluntary Fund for Torture victims. The Association supports revenue-
generating activities to help the integration of torture victims in society, while the Centre 
provides victims of torture and gender-based violence with psychosocial and medical care. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Activities of the Office of the High Commissioner in Guinea  
</b></p>
<p>47. During the reporting period, OHCHR Guinea carried out monitoring, capacity-
building, technical assistance and sensitization activities with various counterparts.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Monitoring, advocacy and reporting 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Office monitored and reported to national and local authorities on incidents of 
human rights violation, visited prisons, police and gendarmerie cells and monitored trials. 
The findings from these activities were regularly shared with the Government at different 
levels to allow the problems to be redressed. Government officials were generally 
cooperative and responded positively to remedy some situations; for example, the Office 
expressed its concern to the Government about the conditions of detention, especially 
access to medical care, for some of the suspects arrested in relation to the attack on the 
President&#8217;s residence. Some detainees were subsequently allowed to visit a dentist or have a 
specialist check them in prison. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Promotion and capacity-building activities 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Office conducted a series of training sessions for more than 250 army, police, 
and customs officers in Conakry, Kindia, Kankan, Lab&#233; and Nz&#233;r&#233;kor&#233;, with funding by the 
International Organization of la Francophonie (OIF). OHCHR also carried out training for 
25 wardens in Conakry. More than 100 civil society and non-governmental organizations 
were trained in human rights in Nzerekor&#233;, Mamou, Kankan and Lab&#233;. OHCHR conducted 
human rights courses for 60 students at the Universit&#233; Kofi Annan. Following several 
requests made by national universities on human rights issues, OHCHR launched the course 
in 2011 as a pilot project with a view to generalize it. It also provided the Directorate of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms at the Ministry of Justice as well as the Conseil 
national de transition with technical advice.  
</p>
<p>50. To assist the Government in the establishment of an independent national human 
rights commission, the Office organized a workshop to sensitize actors on the relevant 
process and provided comments on the draft bill to establish the commission. OHCHR 
provided the Provisional National Reconciliation Commission with support. It supplied </p>


<p>human rights documentation and fact sheets to the Commission and reviewed the draft 
decree organizing its work. In the framework of the Peacebuilding Fund, OHCHR and 
UNDP are closely working on a project aiming to recruit an expert to technical assist the 
commission. 
</p>
<p>51. The Office assisted the Government, through funds provided by OIF, to organize a 
workshop to draft a national plan of action to implement the universal periodic review 
recommendations. It followed up with a campaign to disseminate the plan of action 
throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR Guinea successfully assisted three local non-governmental organizations 
(Association des victims, parents et amis du 28 septembre 2009, M&#234;mes droits pour tous 
and the Centre m&#232;re et enfant) to apply for a grant from the United Nations Voluntary Fund 
for Victims of Torture.  
</p>
<p><b> XI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>In her previous report, the High Commissioner recommended that the 
Government of Guinea should take steps to address the pervasive problem of 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity, reform the security sector, revitalize the judiciary and launch a transitional 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice process to address past human rights abuses, including those perpetrated 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the events of 28 September 2009 and highlighted in the report of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission of Inquiry. She also recommended that the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b>should provide Guinea with the necessary support to address these issues. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Government has committed to the above objectives and taken some steps 
to that end. In the field of security sector reform, more discipline seems to have 
</b></p>
<p><b>returned to the ranks of the army and security forces; the army is reportedly no 
</b></p>
<p><b>longer involved in crowd-control operations, which has led to a minor reduction in 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence during demonstrations. The justice sector has started to implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations made by the Etats G&#233;n&#233;raux de la Justice with the appointment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>new judges to revitalize the judiciary. Attempts have been made to establish an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent national human rights institution and a national commission on 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation. However, the challenges remain considerable and significant efforts are 
</b></p>
<p><b>required to accelerate the pace of implementation. 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> On the</b> <b>basis of the above findings, the High Commissioner recommends that 
the Government of Guinea: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Take the necessary measures to combat impunity and investigate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>hold accountable the perpetrators of human rights violations, in particular the crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>against humanity committed on 28 September 2009 and, in this context, ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate support for the judges investigating those violations and appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>support for the victims of them; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Accelerate the process for the establishment of transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms, including the proposed truth and reconciliation commission, and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the process leading to the establishment of such a mechanism is participatory, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive and in compliance with international human rights norms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Establish a national human rights institution in conformity with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights (the Paris Principles); 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Develop close cooperation with civil society organizations, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>women</b>&#8217;s<b> </b>organizations and victims&#8217; associations;<b> </b></p>


<p><b> (e) Accelerate the reform of the judiciary; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure the integration of human rights into the reform of the security 
</b></p>
<p><b>sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Increase its cooperation with international human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The High Commissioner</b> <b>recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Provide adequate financial support to the Government to enable it to 
</b></p>
<p><b>create and operationalize the proposed national human rights commission; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Provide the necessary assistance to the Government to reduce poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b>and improve the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</b></p>
