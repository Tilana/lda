<p><b>REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT EXPERT ON THE 
SITUATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS  
</b></p>
<p><b>IN HAITI, MICHEL FORST* 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b> 
</p>
<p>In the area of civil and political rights, notable progress has been made with the 
passing of the framework laws on the reform of the judicial profession, the Supreme 
Council of the Judiciary and the independence of the Judicial Training College, but 
there is still a long way to go before the country&#8217;s criminal justice system meets the 
imperatives of the rule of law. The appointment of the President of the Court of 
Cassation, who is also President of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, is a 
crucial factor in the implementation of the reforms in this respect. 
</p>
<p>The security situation has progressed, the number of kidnappings has fallen and the 
main gang bosses have been arrested. While these are significant advances and 
encouraging signs, the situation still remains precarious. 
</p>
<p>The reform of the Haitian National Police and the vetting process begun by it with 
the support of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) are a 
major test of the determination to effectively overhaul one of the cornerstones of the 
rule of law. The decisions which will be taken with a view to removing undesirable 
elements from the Haitian National Police in compliance with statutory provisions 
will signal to the population the commitment to re-establishing State authority. The 
MINUSTAH Human Rights Section should be involved in monitoring the entire 
procedure. 
</p>
<p>The issue of violence against women and girls, in particular rape, and issues relating 
to lynchings, human trafficking and deportees are still matters of concern.

<p> 
</p>
<p>Regarding the penitentiary system, the main problem is prison overcrowding, which 
constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. While imprisonment means the 
deprivation of liberty, respect for all human rights must nonetheless be guaranteed. 
The primary reason for prison overcrowding is closely linked to prolonged pretrial 
detention, for which there are remedies, as suggested by the previous independent 
expert. 
</p>
<p>There is much evidence that corruption, a scourge of Haitian society, is still rife at 
all levels. Combating corruption is part of the Ministry of Justice and Public 
Safety&#8217;s action plans, whose implementation would be a significant step forward. 
</p>
<p>In the area of economic and social rights, economic exclusion is a threat to political 
stability in Haiti and sustainable development, which cannot be contemplated 
without the strong and sustained support of the international community to achieve 
effective institution building, the only means of guaranteeing the provision of basic 
social services.  
</p>
<p>In the view of the independent expert and in line with the mandate conferred upon 
him by the Human Rights Council, the rule-of-law issue cannot be resolved solely 
through reform of judicial institutions and the criminal justice, police and 
penitentiary systems to allow the enjoyment and exercise of civil and political 
rights. 
</p>
<p>Establishing the rule of law also means ensuring the functioning of public services 
and institutions, which, in addition to the safety of persons and property, must 
guarantee to every citizen the full exercise of economic, social and cultural rights, 
as set forth in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
which is included in the parliamentary agenda for 2009. </p>

<p><b>Introduction  
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. In accordance with the mandate established by the Commission on Human 
Rights in its resolution 1995/70 and with Presidential Statement PRST/9/1, in which 
the Human Rights Council invited the new expert to undertake a mission to Haiti in 
the near future and report to it each year, the independent expert submits the present 
report to the Council at its eleventh session. The independent expert wishes to thank 
his predecessor, Louis Joinet, for the standard of his work and the care taken by him 
to forward to him the information necessary for a good understanding of the 
development of the mandate. He has noted the recommendations contained in the 
previous reports, whose implementation he has attempted to evaluate despite the 
unstable nature of the political situation in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert has also noted the recommendations made by the 
treaty bodies to the State party at the time of presentation of its reports and was able 
to be present at the consideration of the report of Haiti by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women in January 2009 (CEDAW/C/HTI/7). 
3. The present report covers the period from January 2008 to February 2009 and 
contains a list of recommendations made to the Haitian Government and to the 
international community. 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert carried out his mission to Haiti from 17 to  
28 November 2008. He travelled to Fort Libert&#233;, Ouanaminthe and Mirebalais, and 
wishes to express his gratitude to the many Haitians whom he met in the course of 
his visit, and also to Paris and Geneva. He was greatly impressed by the spirit of 
openness, historical rootedness and involvement of all those who live and work 
under sometimes extremely difficult circumstances in Port-au-Prince and in the 
departments which he visited. The series of cyclones and disasters severely affected 
the population and exacerbated the living conditions of the most vulnerable, further 
highlighting the link between insecurity and extreme poverty, the main cause of 
violence against the poorest. 
</p>
<p>5. The independent expert wishes to thank the Haitian authorities, who enabled 
his mission to be carried out in the best conditions. He is grateful to President 
Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val, to Mich&#232;le Pierre-Louis, the Prime Minister, and to the other members 
of the Government and Parliament whom he met for the frankness and quality of 
their observations. 
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert also had discussions with the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in 
Haiti (MINUSTAH), Hedi Annabi, and his Deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa, and he 
wishes to thank all the members of their team, who afforded him effective support 
in regard to logistics, security and public relations. 
</p>
<p>7. The independent expert also thanks the officials of the main institutions of the 
United Nations and Organization of American States whom he was able to meet and 
the members of the diplomatic corps present in Port-au-Prince with whom he was 
able on a number of occasions to exchange views concerning the role and action 
modalities of the international community in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>8. The independent expert finally wishes to express his gratitude once again to 
the United Nations staff members with whom he worked, who shared with him the </p>

<p><b> 5

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/11/5
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>information in their possession and experiences, and to whose professionalism, 
determination and courage he pays tribute. The members of the MINUSTAH Human 
Rights Section and Justice Section gave him unfailing support, both in Port-au-
Prince and during his travels, and shared with him their assessment of the situation 
and of the progress of the ongoing reforms. The independent expert would like to 
state that those two Sections are invaluable partners in the execution of the mission 
entrusted to him by the Council. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>I. THE RULE OF LAW 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Rule of law and constitutional legality 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9. In the summer of 2008, the appointment of Mich&#232;le Duvivier Pierre-Louis as 
Prime Minister, the installation of the Government and the adoption of the general 
policy statement by Parliament were perceived by the Haitian population and the 
international community as signs of the re-establishment of constitutional legality in 
Haiti following the April 2008 demonstrations. The senatorial elections scheduled 
for April 2009 should make it possible to fill the vacant third of the Senate seats and 
thereby complete one cycle in the political life of the country. 
</p>
<p>10. In February 2009, President Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val set up a commission with 
responsibility for formulating proposals to reform the Constitution, which many feel 
will make it possible to overcome major institutional obstacles which are hampering 
desirable and frequently announced reforms.  
</p>
<p>11. The report of a previous commission of experts had already identified a 
number of contradictions or imbalances in the Constitution, including the fact that 
the president appoints but can under no circumstances dismiss a prime minister. The 
commission, which had also drawn attention to the short intervals between elections 
in Haiti, implicitly argued in favour of general electoral contests every five years, 
which would make it possible to increase political stability, to limit the potential for 
tension and Haiti&#8217;s dependence on international assistance and security and to spend 
less money. President Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val had also been concerned with the issue of dual 
nationality, which would make it possible to contribute to the country&#8217;s economic 
and political stability so that Haitian men and women would not be forced to leave 
the country for economic reasons and be faced with the choice of adopting a 
different nationality in order to be become integrated in the receiving country. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Rule of law and human security 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12. Respect for the rule of law is a key factor in human security but human 
security is not confined to the restoration of the rule of law.<footnote name="1">0
  Municipal District Administration Councils, i.e. the smallest territorial authority. </footnote> The lack of 
observance, protection and realization of economic, social and cultural rights is 
increasingly seen by the people of Haiti as a grave injustice and a denial of the 
advances made elsewhere in the world. The interconnectedness and indivisibility of

development are mutually reinforcing &#8230;&#8221;, Security Council resolution 1840 (2008). </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>6

<p><b>A/HRC/11/5

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>human rights should not only be proclaimed but also be manifested in positive 
action. Whether in response to the distress of women and men affected by the series 
of natural disasters or the difficult situation of victims of violence, the mobilization 
of the international community must signal that what is at stake in Haiti not only 
involves restoring the judicial, police and penitentiary systems but also entails 
guaranteeing the effective exercise of all rights. For human security to prevail, the 
Haitian people and local communities must be protected not only from violence, 
injustice and corruption but also from hunger, sickness and natural disasters. 
13. Consolidating the rule of law is one of the factors in restoring conditions that 
will make it possible to contemplate the country&#8217;s sustainable development. In this 
connection, the independent expert applauds the decision taken by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of MINUSTAH to create within 
his team the new post of Rule-of-Law Coordinator with responsibility for providing 
a more comprehensive vision of the ongoing reforms and of those to be 
implemented with the aim of strengthening the rule of law. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Status of ongoing reforms 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to the reform of the two traditional cornerstones of the rule of law, 
i.e. the police and justice institutions, the independent expert was struck by the 
apparent disparity in the resources which seem to have been allocated to ongoing 
police and judicial reform activities. The police reforms are visible, be it only in the 
appearance of the Haitian National Police officers&#8217; new uniforms, the modern 
vehicles or the refurbished stations equipped with adequate office facilities, even if 
this image is sometimes tarnished by the behaviour of some officers. However, a 
different image is conveyed to the public by the judicial system. The buildings are 
dilapidated, the facilities are more limited and the equipment is basic, with the risk 
that the Haitian population might compare the two institutions and conclude that the 
international community&#8217;s political commitment is to providing more resources to 
one than to the other. 
</p>
<p>15. The independent expert cannot overemphasize the fact that it is essential for 
reforms in these two areas to go hand in hand, if only to show to the people of Haiti 
that reform efforts are under way and that they are not inconsistent, since their 
police and judicial systems are treated equitably and neither of these institutions 
takes precedence over the other. 
 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Justice reform 
</b> 
</p>
<p>16. The reform of the judicial system has for many years formed the backbone of 
the reports of the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti, who, 
at the time of his last mission, focused on the implementation of the previous 
reports&#8217; recommendations in this area. Following the adoption of the three-year 
justice reform plan described in Haiti&#8217;s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper and the three laws on judicial independence, which were passed in  
December 2007, advances have been achieved under the impetus of President 
Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val and through the determination seemingly shown by the Minister of 
Justice and Public Safety, Jean Joseph Exum&#233;, but the generally prevailing feeling is </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b> 7 
 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/11/5
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>that the reforms are stagnating and falling behind, partly owing to the absence of a 
decision on one key element. 
</p>
<p>17. The independent expert wishes to point out that the keystone of the reform of 
the judicial system in Haiti is the appointment of the President of the Court of 
Cassation. This appointment has been outstanding for five years and the 
independent expert has recommended to President Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val that it be made 
without further delay.<footnote name="2">At a meeting in Geneva, K&#233;ly C. Bastien, the President of the Senate stated that the invitation 
for candidatures for the post had been launched. </footnote> Apart from the political implications relating to the functions 
of the President of the Court of Cassation, this appointment would make it possible, 
as has been pointed out by the independent expert on several occasions, to overcome 
the deadlock on a number of situations, thereby encouraging the reform process, 
such as the functioning of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary (CSPJ) and the 
appointment of the director-general of the Judicial Training College. 
</p>
<p>18. The Supreme Council of the Judiciary is still not operating despite urgent 
calls. All its members have been elected, with the notable exception of its President, 
since he is also President of the Court of Cassation. All members have been vetted 
but not yet certified pending the report to be produced by the certification 
committee of the Ministry of Justice and Public Safety. Without prejudging the 
contents of that report, the establishment of the Supreme Council remains 
impossible until, inter alia, a definite appointment to the post of President of the 
Court of Cassation is made. This stumbling block, which could be lawfully 
circumvented by entrusting temporary responsibility for the presidency of the 
Supreme Council to the current acting president of the Court of Cassation, 
considerably hampers the process of installation and operation of the Supreme 
Council, whose role is paramount. This situation makes any attempts to improve the 
functioning of the judicial system very uncertain, given that, since the law on the 
Supreme Council was passed, it has not been possible to undertake the process of 
vetting judges and no further disciplinary procedures have been properly conducted, 
whereas many members of the judiciary have been dismissed by the executive, often 
in a totally non-transparent manner. 
</p>
<p>19. Also, the Supreme Council should be provided with a budget and human and 
material resources that will enable the institution to operate and play a specific and 
key role in the process of recruiting and vetting Haitian judges. 
20. <i>Judicial inspectorate</i>: The Minister of Justice and Public Safety has announced 
his firm intention to strengthen the monitoring of the effectiveness of the judiciary&#8217;s 
work through the judicial inspectorate. The aim is to oversee the operation of the 
courts, registries and prosecution services, including the figures, whether 
communicated or otherwise, in connection with defining quantifiable targets 
(number of inspections, purpose of inspections, etc.) and analysing performance. 
One important issue on which there does not appear to have been a conclusion 
relates to the profile of judicial service inspectors. The independent expert 
recommends that the inspectorate be headed by judges seconded for a limited period 
and not by officials of the Ministry of Justice and Public Safety. He also wishes to 
draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to the difficulties relating to the fact that, under the 
law on the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, the latter is entrusted with 
responsibility for the judicial inspection service in regard to judges, while registrars 
</p>
<p><b>__________________

<p><b>A/HRC/11/5 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>and prosecutors will remain under the authority of the minister. Also, government 
commissioners and senior law officers should be firmly reminded of the need for 
regular, ongoing and effective supervision of the activities of the courts and 
judiciary in order to ensure proper functioning and thus safeguard the rights of 
persons before the law. Such supervision should be carried out by the senior law 
officer on investigating magistrates and by the government commissioner on deputy 
prosecutors and district judges. 
21. <i>Judicial Training College</i>: The opening of the Judicial Training College 
(EMA) has taken place and Lionel Bourgoin was appointed director but not granted 
the title of director-general or the related prerogatives,<footnote name="3">1. In his reports, the previous independent expert had urged, primarily in 
anticipation of the departure of MINUSTAH, that the mandate of the Office be </footnote> as provided for in the Law 
of 20 December 2007. Under article 14 of that Law, the director-general is 
appointed by the President of the Republic by order of the Council of Ministers on 
the proposal of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, being also president of the 
Administrative Board of the College. However, since the President of the Court of 
Cassation has not been appointed, neither the Supreme Council nor the College&#8217;s 
Administrative Board has a president, which means that the director-general of the 
College cannot be appointed! 
</p>
<p>22. Also, the 2009 draft budget submitted by the Government (and rejected by 
Parliament at the time of drafting of the present report) simply discontinued all 
budgetary allocations to the institution. That situation, if ratified in the new draft 
budget, would make it impossible to go ahead with the announced recruitment and 
training of new judges on the basis of a competitive examination. 
23. The work of finalizing the renovation of the College premises, which had been 
interrupted for over four months through lack of resources, has resumed and should 
be completed thanks to assistance under the justice sector support programme of the 
Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) and allow the commencement 
of programmes, including in-service training for district judges. The aim of the 
College director is to resume continuous training for district judges, which was 
started last year (72 district judges have been trained and assessed to date), with 
those in the metropolitan zone. 
</p>
<p>24. The independent expert wishes to point out, however, that the primary 
objective of the College should be the implementation of the programme of initial 
training for judges, which is for the time being dependent on the appointment of the 
Administrative Board and director-general of the College. 
</p>
<p>25. A justice reform commission composed of 20 human rights specialists, who 
have no connection with the Government and receive technical assistance from 
MINUSTAH, has been set up by President Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val. In the view of the 
independent expert, this commission is a key element in the success of the judicial 
reform since it represents an important tool in fostering the ownership of the process 
by the people. The commission should now focus on being able to support the 
reform process, in particular by taking steps to ensure that the citizens of Haiti feel 
fully represented and regularly informed by this follow-up mechanism. 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Combating corruption</i>: In the course of his mission in November 2008, the 
independent expert obtained much evidence that corruption, a scourge of Haitian 
</p>

  At the time of drafting of the present report, the director&#8217;s position had not been regularized by 
an official appointment established by order published in the <i>Moniteur ha&#239;tien</i>. </p>

<p> </p>

</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>society, is still rife at all levels. The independent expert notes that the fight against 
corruption is part of the action plans of the Ministry of Justice and Public Safety and 
that an implementation evaluation would undoubtedly be a major step forward. 
Successive speeches by President Pr&#233;val since 2007 appear to have sent out a clear 
and renewed signal of the political commitment to making the fight against 
corruption a strategic objective but implementation seems to be slow. 
27. Implementation action should involve, inter alia, institution building in order 
to strengthen police and judicial investigation capacities in the areas of international 
crime, corruption and political offences, as well as the allocation of adequate human 
and financial resources to the Anti-Corruption Unit (ULCC) and to the Central 
Financial Intelligence Unit (UCREF). Also, the establishment of an effective 
forensic department equipped with biological and ballistic facilities and the 
strengthening of forensic medical services would greatly facilitate the search for 
evidence during judicial investigations. 
28. With regard to case handling, the independent expert wishes to point out that 
the early establishment of specialized chambers to deal with certain serious political 
offences and economic and financial crimes would undoubtedly be one way of 
effectively tackling corruption. The tasks of such a specialist structure formed of 
judges supported by qualified and competent investigators would be to handle 
crimes of kidnapping and aggravated abduction, serious political offences and other 
serious human rights violations. It would also be responsible for dealing with crimes 
frequently involving transborder activity, in particular economic and financial 
crimes such as drug trafficking, concealment of assets and money-laundering. In 
2008, an agreement was apparently reached between the Government and the 
judicial authorities to set up these specialized chambers at the lower court of 
Port-au-Prince, one to handle serious politically motivated offences and the other to 
deal with economic and financial crimes. 
</p>
<p>29. The independent expert wishes again to draw the attention of the Government 
and the international community to the fact that the complexity of the cases and the 
importance of quality investment in their study would warrant the provision of 
assistance, experience and technical skills by experts from abroad to Haitian justice 
practitioners in the form of short missions, without infringing the independence of 
Haitian judges. 
30. <i>Office of the Ombudsman</i>: Article 207 of the 1987 Constitution established the 
Office of the Ombudsman (OPC) with the aim of protecting all persons against any 
form of abuse by the public administration. Chosen by consensus by the President of 
the Republic, the President of the Senate and the President of the Chamber of 
Deputies, the Ombudsman is appointed for a non-renewable term of seven years. 
The independent expert commends the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for its support in the drafting of the 
legislative bill revising the functions of the Office of the Ombudsman to bring it 
into line with the Paris Principles and recommends that the bill be adopted by 
Parliament and that the Office be allocated an adequate budget to allow, in 
particular, the setting up of regional bureaux that will put the institution in closer 
contact with its beneficiaries.

<p>extended and its operational capacity strengthened by the creation of the post of 
Deputy Ombudsman (A/HRC/4/3, para. 76). In the new arrangement, the 
Ombudsman would be more particularly responsible for supervision of the mandate 
of the Office, relations with the national authorities and international relations, 
while the Deputy Ombudsman would have a dual protection and promotion role, on 
the one hand undertaking the supervision and coordination of investigations 
conducted by his team and its regional bureaux in the field and, on the other, 
providing human rights training, in particular in cooperation with the University and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
32. The independent expert recommends that the provision of support to the Office 
of the Ombudsman in the development of its mandate and the organization of its 
work at the national and regional levels form the subject of discussions with the 
involvement of national stakeholders in Haiti and also the OHCHR National 
Institutions Unit and the network of the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, whose 
expertise in this area is recognized. 
 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Police reform 
</b> 
</p>
<p>33. <i>Haitian National Police reform plan</i>: Assistance in the reform of the Haitian 
National Police (PNH) has been at the centre of the missions entrusted to 
MINUSTAH and regularly referred to in the resolutions in which the Security 
Council has extended its mandate each year. That process is in the hands of the 
Haitian National Police, which receives advice from MINUSTAH and from the 
United Nations Police (UNPOL) in successfully carrying out the work. Also, the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations has conferred on the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights the lead role4 in the vetting process in general, with the assistance 
of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime. 
</p>
<p>34. The reform plan adopted by the Haitian Government and negotiated with 
MINUSTAH is very ambitious but geared to meeting the challenges to enable Haiti 
to ensure its security in all areas. The strategy is aimed primarily at doubling police 
strength by 2011 to provide 14,000 well trained and instructed officers. The 
independent expert nevertheless had the feeling that the constraints of recruitment 
and training over a very short period might mean that, in the attainment of a 
quantity target, the quality targets are only partly met, at the risk of jeopardizing the 
objective of restoring the public&#8217;s confidence in its national police force. 
35. It has to be acknowledged that the relationship between the population and the 
Haitian National Police is still characterized by suspicion, accusations of brutality, 
human rights violations and complicity with criminal and corrupt elements. The 
weekly reports by the MINUSTAH Human Rights Section refer to allegations of 
brutality, violence and rape by uniformed officers. 
</p>
<p>36. The reform plan is at the same time aimed at bringing about the necessary and 
urgent strengthening of the General Inspectorate of the National Police and the 
Central Directorate of the Criminal Police. In this connection, the independent 
expert recommends that greater attention be paid to certification of the members of 
</p>

<p>the General Inspectorate, whose operational methods and practices should serve to 
restore public trust since it would be in a position to receive complaints, examine 
cases and ensure that investigations are initiated and that exemplary and effective 
sanctions are imposed where justified. 
37. The Haitian National Police vetting process is a major challenge in restoring 
the population&#8217;s confidence in its police force. While maintaining that it is for the 
Government to make the final decision and to take steps, in compliance with Haitian 
domestic law, to rid the police ranks of any officers who fail to meet the required 
standards, the independent expert is concerned about the non-transparency of the 
methods used and the delay in carrying out the vetting exercise. He wishes to point 
out that, under the terms of the Secretary-General&#8217;s decision on the distribution of 
tasks among United Nations institutions and bodies, OHCHR is the lead agency in 
the transitional justice and vetting process. The role of OHCHR in that capacity 
should be to coordinate and support the process, producing the necessary material 
and publishing tools to allow the adoption of a human rights approach to the vetting 
procedure and monitoring the execution of the process. OHCHR is not conducting 
the vetting process itself but is performing a support role for those conducting it. 
The purpose of such support by OHCHR is to set out the guarantees in order to 
ensure that police officers are treated fairly in the process and that those guilty of 
human rights violations are removed from the police force. 
</p>
<p>38. The independent expert is of the view that the vetting procedure currently 
followed in Haiti is not in line with human rights standards or the Secretary-
General&#8217;s decision and he therefore has the feeling that OHCHR wishes to maintain 
a certain distance until those standards are applied by all partners participating in 
the process. This does not mean requesting that the Human Rights Section be 
involved in every individual decision, for which it has neither the time nor the 
resources, but the independent expert recommends that the Human Rights Section 
be regularly and closely involved in all monitoring stages of the procedure to ensure 
that the process conforms to relevant international standards. 
</p>
<p>39. As regards the process itself, the independent expert is concerned about the 
delay in the vetting programme and recommends that priority now be given to 
vetting senior police officers in order to send out a clear signal as to the objective 
being pursued. 
</p>
<p>40. Finally, it is important for the population to understand that the Haitian 
National Police reform process is the wish of the Government and is not being 
imposed from outside. In this connection, the Government should reaffirm that the 
vetting process is a priority for the country and regularly inform the public of the 
outcomes of the process and the qualitative and quantitative targets achieved.

<p><b> D. Functioning of the justice system 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Situation of the courts and proceedings 
</b> 
</p>
<p>41. The operation of the judicial system has been the subject of several reports and 
publications and the independent expert has observed that, while the statistics 
provided show effective progress in regard to the lower and appeal or habeas corpus </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>12  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/11/5 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>courts, there is still a long way to go before the work of the judicial system is 
conducted at an appropriate speed. 
 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Prolonged pretrial detention 
</b> 
</p>
<p>42. While the situation relating to prolonged pretrial detention in Haiti has been 
the subject of much literature and many recommendations, the independent expert 
nevertheless notes with regret the delays in the implementation of most of the 
recommendations. It should be pointed out that, according to the figures supplied by 
MINUSTAH, in November 2008 the rate of pretrial detention was still 80 per cent, 
being higher in the jurisdiction of the West Department (86 per cent) than in the 
other jurisdictions of the country (70 per cent on average). The average length of 
pretrial detention is about two years for felonies and between 12 and 18 months for 
misdemeanours. Over 4 per cent of detainees awaiting trial are juveniles. More than 
3 per cent of remand prisoners are awaiting trial for petty offences, their 
confinement being unlawful or arbitrary, 80 per cent of remand prisoners&#8217; cases are 
held up at the prosecution or investigation stage and only 7 per cent of cases are 
currently being tried. 
</p>
<p>43. The reasons for these irregularities partly stem from the fact that, rather than 
order a remand prisoner&#8217;s appearance in court directly or under the summary trial 
procedure, the prosecution department passes the case to the investigation 
department, where it stagnates and, if a prisoner&#8217;s appearance is ordered under the 
summary trial procedure, no judges are in attendance. There is no permanent service 
at the main premises in Port-au-Prince or in the provinces and the idea put forward 
regarding the opening of an additional courtroom for summary trials is a useful one, 
provided that the judges are present, especially in the light of the findings of the 
commission on prolonged pretrial detention, in which it will be recommended that 
some detainees be tried very promptly.  
</p>
<p>44. The Constitution of Haiti and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CIC) provide 
for simple and swift court proceedings for minor offences or misdemeanours. 
However, pretrial detention has become systematized and widespread in practice to 
the point where it is now the rule whereas it should be the exception. On the excuse 
that the criminal law is strictly applied and in order to protect themselves against 
pressure from the police, civil society organizations and the press, which accuse the 
judiciary of corruption or laxness in releasing alleged criminals, judges are making 
excessive and abusive use of pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p>45. On the excuse that a remand prisoner would have to pay fees for a higher 
amount and more quickly, some attorneys are not taking the trouble to have the bail 
release provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure applied or still less to 
prosecute judicial officers for breach of official duty or unlawful and/or arbitrary 
arrest. Also, there is no effective inspection of judges&#8217; professional activities and no 
efficient supervisory service. Owing to the absence of such judiciary oversight and 
disciplinary mechanisms, the Ministry has often not concerned itself over the fate of 
persons held in pretrial detention beyond the time limits laid down in the Code of 
Criminal Procedure. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b> 13 
 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/11/5
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>46. The only recourse, which is still too little used in Haiti, is the remedy of 
habeas corpus,<footnote name="5">By way of illustration, only 46 habeas corpus petitions have been recorded, since the beginning 
of 2008, in the appeal court&#8217;s jurisdiction (2 in the South Department, 37 in the North 
Department and 7 in the Centre Department). </footnote> whose purpose is to protect individual freedom. Under this 
procedure, which is provided for by the Constitution, an application can be made to 
the chief justice of the lower court to rule on the lawfulness of a person&#8217;s arrest and 
confinement and, if appropriate, to order that person&#8217;s immediate release if article 
26 of the Constitution has been infringed.  
</p>
<p>47. The independent expert recommends that certain criminal procedures be 
clarified and simplified, particularly with regard to non-custodial and suspended 
sentences, police custody and habeas corpus, as well as the duration of pretrial 
detention based on the offence and the delegation of judicial powers to the criminal 
police.  
</p>
<p>48. In order to deal with certain cases pending with the prosecution department at 
the investigation stage, the Ministry of Justice and Public Safety could, by means of 
circulars, impose directions on the prosecution department to make it possible for 
any persons suspected of committing major or minor offences to be brought before 
an investigating magistrate within 48 hours if referral is necessary. The Ministry of 
Justice and Public Safety could also take steps with a view to implementation of the 
summary trial system with the consent of the chief justice of the lower court. It 
would also be possible to deal with all proceedings pending with the prosecution 
department within a time limit of one month by referral to an investigating 
magistrate, by direct order to appear in court with no preliminary investigation or by 
discontinuation of prosecution, or to have all cases involving detention and pending 
with the prosecution department disposed of by direct orders to appear if referral to 
the investigating magistrate is neither compulsory nor necessary.  
 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Juvenile justice 
</b> 
</p>
<p>49. In the opinion of the independent expert, juvenile justice is a further cause for 
concern. During his mission, he witnessed several instances where juveniles, in 
some cases young children, were remanded in custody but not brought before a 
judge owing to the lack of a children&#8217;s magistrate in the jurisdiction concerned. He 
also witnessed instances where juveniles shared accommodation with convicted or 
remand adults or cases involving juveniles still confined in the two youth prisons in 
Port-au-Prince even though care orders had been issued by the juvenile court and 
solutions should have been found in conjunction with the Institute for Social 
Welfare and Research. 
</p>
<p>50. The juvenile court in Port-au-Prince is experiencing operational difficulties but 
the excuses put forward to account for this irregular situation do not appear 
convincing. The previous Minister of Justice and Public Safety, Ren&#233; Magloire, had 
appointed youth judges in each jurisdiction. Although not yet trained, these judges 
can be assigned juvenile matters and, if they are not competent to pursue them, the 
cases are transferred to the children&#8217;s magistrate in Port-au-Prince or Cap-Ha&#239;tien. 
</p>
<p>51. The independent expert recommends that due attention be paid to the issue of 
youth imprisonment and that the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p><b>__________________

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Child, which has been ratified by Haiti, form the subject of a debate and policy shift 
given that incarceration is still the only solution contemplated to address the 
problems of children in conflict with the law, whereas it should only be used as a 
last resort. In this regard, he advocates the adoption, in the Juvenile Code, of 
provisions promoting youth crime prevention strategies, alternative non-custodial 
measures and the implementation of effective rehabilitation and reintegration 
programmes, while encouraging foster care in the case of some non-serious crimes. 
</p>
<p>52. The independent expert welcomes the official commencement of work on 
building the juvenile court in Cap-Ha&#239;tien and recalls that, under the Law of  
9 September 1961, specialized youth courts had been set up in five towns in Haiti 
but they have never been operational; only the juvenile court in Port-au-Prince 
provides specialized responses in juvenile justice matters. The establishment of the 
juvenile court in Cap-Ha&#239;tien will make it possible to try youth offenders in shorter 
periods within the Cap-Ha&#239;tien appeal court&#8217;s jurisdiction, avoid prolonged pretrial 
detention of minors within the jurisdiction and handle cases involving children in 
conflict with the law in conformity with the United Nations minimum rules.  
 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Institute of Forensic Medicine 
</b> 
</p>
<p>53. The successive reports of the previous independent expert on Haiti referred to 
the importance of granting the Institute of Forensic Medicine (IML) permanent 
status (A/HRC/4/3, para. 52). The forensic aspect of the procedural formalities is 
not taken into consideration by district judges who, contrary to the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, order at-the-scene examinations of corpses and act as criminal 
investigation officers in drawing up reports on findings. The statutory requirement 
that there be an accompanying medical officer to determine the apparent cause of 
death is thus never observed. 
</p>
<p>54. The number of autopsies carried out by the Institute of Forensic Medicine is 
not sufficiently high if one refers to the records of the State University of Haiti&#8217;s 
hospital for 2006.<footnote name="6">The independent expert did not have knowledge of more recent statistics. </footnote> By way of example, out of 5,330 admissions to its mortuaries, 
including 880 victims of violent deaths, the Institute carried out only 160 autopsies, 
i.e. 18 per cent of the total. It should be stated that these figures include neither 
victims of violence who are treated or die in operating theatres of public or private 
hospitals, which almost never inform the police or judicial authorities, nor victims 
of violent or suspicious deaths which are treated as ordinary deaths and are thus 
buried by the mortuaries without notification of the authorities. Most corpses, on 
arrival at the hospitals&#8217; mortuary on district judges&#8217; orders, do not undergo any 
medical examination leading to the issue of a death certificate stating the apparent 
cause of death. Bodies arriving at the Institute following an application by the 
government commissioner for an autopsy to be carried out are thus not accompanied 
by a death certificate or an at-the-scene examination report signed by a medical 
officer. Case files concerning violent or suspicious deaths which reach the 
prosecution department are in all instances accompanied by brief and poorly drafted 
reports on the findings. 
</p>
<p>55. Under the current circumstances, the independent expert recommends that the 
following recommendations be considered: institution of a legal framework to 
govern the functioning of the Institute of Forensic Medicine; creation of a 
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>demarcation line between the State University of Haiti&#8217;s hospital mortuary and the 
Institute&#8217;s mortuary; consideration of the possible extension of the services to the 
provincial jurisdictions through the setting up of at least two Institute annexes in the 
towns of Le Cap and Les Cayes to carry out autopsies and scientific inspections; 
and systematization of at-the-scene forensic examinations by making available to 
medical officers a standardized document containing the information to be 
forwarded to the prosecution department. 
 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Law centres 
</b> 
</p>
<p>56. The independent expert has learnt with interest of the establishment, in 2008, 
of law centres designed to facilitate public access to justice, which comprise several 
sections, including one supplying information on the judicial system, and at which 
training for NGO members and civil society in general is offered, legal advice is 
given by lawyers, legal consultations are undertaken by district court judges and 
victim support training is provided. He recommends that resources be released to 
enable the network to be expanded and a mechanism to be implemented for regular 
training and exchanges between persons in charge of the law centres. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Penitentiary situation and prison overcrowding 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>57. At Port-au-Prince and during his travels, the independent expert visited places 
of detention, prisons and police stations and held discussions with prison and police 
station management and staff and also with remand and other prisoners, with 
assistance from the Human Rights Section. 
</p>
<p>58. Although the independent expert does not regard prison conditions in the 
capital as comparable with what is happening in the departments, he wishes to point 
out that they are very poor, having been rightly criticized by international 
organizations, commissions of enquiry and specialist NGOs as constituting cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment, owing primarily to overcrowding but also to health 
standards. 
</p>
<p>59. For example, despite the recommendation of the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC) that, in very grave crisis situations, the floor space available 
to each detainee should be at least two square metres,7 remand and convicted 
prisoners at the civilian prison in Port-au-Prince have cell space of only 0.42 m2 
each, which requires them to sleep by turns or in makeshift hammocks formed of 
sheets and causes sometimes serious illnesses. 
</p>
<p>60. Elsewhere in the country, the prison situation has been exacerbated by the 
repeated destruction of places of detention as a result of the events which led to the 
departure of President Aristide in March 2004 or owing to the cyclones which 
devastated the country in 2008, thus increasing the number of detainees at police 
stations. 
</p>
<p><b>__________________ 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
  &#8220;This figure of 2m&#178; per person must in no way be considered as a norm but as a pragmatic 
indication which reflects the experience gained by the ICRC in very grave crises&#8221;, <i>Water, 
sanitation, hygiene and habitat in prisons</i>, ICRC, 2004, p. 21. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>16  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/11/5 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>61. Hygiene and health-care conditions are generally very precarious, despite 
ICRC assistance and refurbishment work carried out at some prisons, while the 
number of doctors and nurses means that access to care, where it exists, is limited to 
basic symptomatic treatment of the most common illnesses. The independent expert 
recommends that prisons be supplied with sufficient stocks of medicines, drugs and 
provisions to guarantee detainees&#8217; right of access to medical care and food. 
</p>
<p>62. Renovation work has, however, begun with a view to increasing available 
space at the Hinche, Carrefour and Cap-Ha&#239;tien prisons. In Port-au-Prince, plans 
have been drawn up to convert a former psychiatric hospital into a prison. The 
construction of a major new penitentiary establishment close to the capital is being 
contemplated provided that land-related problems can be resolved. 
</p>
<p>63. The independent expert recommends that a programme be initiated for the 
building of new prisons, in particular in Les Gona&#239;ves, to relieve the strain on the 
penitentiary system and to address the issues of prison overcrowding and the use of 
police stations as places of detention.  
</p>
<p>64. One of the causes of prison overcrowding is linked to, inter alia, pretrial 
detention and, while there were almost four times more individuals incarcerated in 
Haitian prisons in 2008 than in 1995,<footnote name="8">6. In anticipation of his next missions, the independent expert met the ministers 
responsible for welfare, health and education, whom he thanks for their 
attentiveness and the information and documentation supplied. He also visited a 
number of representative projects, which appear to be operating well, and plans to 
devote one of his next missions to exploring such topics as the right to food and 
water and access to schooling and health care and to report to the Council thereon. 
 
</footnote> the proportion of those held in pretrial 
detention remained at about 80 per cent of the prison population over the same 
period. 
</p>
<p>65. The mandate of the Consultative Commission on Prolonged Pretrial Detention 
(CCDPP) has been extended to April 2008 and its area of responsibility increased to 
include Gona&#239;ves. The Consultative Commission was instrumental in the release of 
892 detainees but its functioning and proposals have been widely criticized for 
having contributed, according to the United Nations Police and specialist NGOs, to 
the release of several tens of dangerous criminals. 
</p>
<p>66. The independent expert recommends that the Consultative Commission be 
given a new, nationwide mandate and entrusted with the task of examining, in 
accordance with clear and verifiable criteria, cases involving non-serious crimes or 
arbitrary detention, and that a prisoner&#8217;s discharge may only be authorized by a 
working group composed of judges, in order to prevent the release of dangerous 
criminals. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>67. Since the ratification by Haiti of the Inter-American Convention on the 
Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women, the country 
has seen considerable advances in women&#8217;s rights and in awareness of the actual 
issues involved, although instances of violence against women and girls have 
continued to be reported by the major intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations. The independent expert has had the opportunity to meet the two 
succeeding Ministers on the Status of Women and Women&#8217;s Rights and learnt with 
great interest of the action taken by the National Forum on Violence against 
</p>
<p><b>__________________

<p> 
</p>
<p>8
  According to the statistics supplied, the prison population was approximately 2,000 in 1995, 
4,100 in 2001 and 7,<footnote name="8">5. This holistic approach should also guide the choices of international and 
bilateral institutions in the identification of their technical assistance and 
cooperation programmes so that gradually access to education for all and to a 
health-care system, drinking water and sanitation services, adequate and decent 
housing, employment income and training are also guaranteed for everyone.

<p>Women.<footnote name="9">3. On the deportee issue, he recommends the following: </footnote> He also attended, in January 2009, the very good presentation of the State 
party&#8217;s report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women and welcomed the announcement on that occasion, by the President of the 
Senate, of Haiti&#8217;s forthcoming accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention, 
a mechanism which makes it possible for organizations and individuals to lodge 
complaints concerning violations of rights in States parties that have ratified the 
Protocol and for the Committee to initiate investigations. 
</p>
<p>68. While these are positive announcements, the independent expert wishes again 
to draw attention to this national scourge of violence suffered by women and girls, 
in particular rape in all its forms and especially violence in the domestic sphere, 
although the true extent of the problem is not fully known owing to a lack of 
comprehensive figures. According to the Minister on the Status of Women, rape, 
attempted rape and sexual harassment can form the subject of complaints under the 
provisions of the Criminal Code which deal with rape, indecent assault and 
aggravating circumstances relating to the status of the perpetrator, but sexual 
harassment could in fact be said to be tolerated by society and the State.  
</p>
<p>69. In practice, notwithstanding the assault on their physical integrity, it is the 
adverse prejudice against women and pressure by the perpetrator of the violence or 
his family or even by the victim&#8217;s own family which deter them from bringing cases 
to court through fear of reprisals or scruples about speaking in public on a matter 
that is both intimate and humiliating. However, the independent expert wishes to 
point out that the number of incidents of sexual violence against women and girls 
recorded in recent years has apparently increased but it is not possible to establish 
with certainty whether this increase is due to trivialization of such violence or to 
consciousness-raising activities which have persuaded an increasing number of 
victims to report such acts. 
</p>
<p>70. The independent expert pays tribute to the intensive work carried out by 
MINUSTAH and the specialized agencies of the United Nations and Organization of 
American States and also by NGOs, which, through their awareness and training 
programmes, contribute to combating violence against women.  
</p>
<p>71. The independent expert hopes that steps will be taken to adopt the framework 
law on all forms of violence against women, including domestic violence, which 
was announced for 2009, and also the special temporary measures required in cases 
relating to elective posts as well as in cases relating to recruitment and appointive 
posts and with regard to recruitment in the national police force, which should be a 
priority. The independent expert also welcomes the Senate&#8217;s passing of the law on 
working conditions of paid domestic staff. He hopes that the National Assembly will 
include these two instruments in its agenda at an early date and that the legislative 
bill on filiation and responsible parenthood will also be included in the 
parliamentary agenda despite the reluctance of those who feel that these bills might 
jeopardize an order from which they benefit.

  This coordinating entity, which is concerned with violence against women, brings together the

<p>72. The independent expert has noted that stereotypes, i.e. society&#8217;s portrayal of 
women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s roles, are still deeply rooted in attitudes in Haiti, which is at 
variance with the predominant role played by women in the economy and within the 
family. He recommends that the Minister on the Status of Women continue and 
extend the large-scale campaign to eradicate sexist stereotypes in schools, the media 
and advertising. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Lynchings 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>73. The independent expert is concerned about the many cases of direct lynching 
and extrajudicial arrest followed by serious acts of violence by the population in 
Hinche, Cap-Ha&#239;tien, Ouanaminthe, Fort Libert&#233; and Pandiassou. There have been 
reports of instances of popular justice, sometimes even involving the killing of 
individuals suspected of theft, murder, burglary, kidnapping, witchcraft or other 
criminal acts. Several cases have also been brought to his attention concerning 
persons burned alive by the people and he has heard many allegations of violence 
reportedly committed by members of the CASECs,10 which in some instances 
actually have their own places of detention and assume former policing functions of 
district chiefs. Although the increase in cases is not unrelated to the lack of trust in 
the capacities of the police and justice authorities, these acts of violence and 
lynchings are not investigated and their perpetrators go unpunished. The 
independent expert is aware that prosecuting those who commit such acts always 
proves difficult since they are part of anonymous crowds and the people very often 
collude in not revealing the perpetrators&#8217; names. However, it is necessary for 
investigations to be conducted and for a clear signal to be sent out from the highest 
government authorities that in a State governed by the rule of law no one is entitled 
to take the law into his own hands.

<p>74. The independent expert travelled to the north-east of the country and the 
border with the Dominican Republic, in particular to Ouanaminthe, where he 
witnessed the major problem of wealth inequality and migratory flows between 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic in connection with mass expulsions, labour 
exploitation and under-registration of births, which affect a large part of the 
population who inhabit or cross this border region.  
</p>
<p>75. Also, the situation of insecurity caused by organized crime networks and the 
limited presence of the State in this region make the border population very 
vulnerable to breaches of human rights. The border setting, impunity, lawlessness, 
poverty and disorder which characterize this region are gradually contributing to the 
creation of new territories defined by exploitation, abuse and human rights 
violations, where the value of life and human dignity are challenged daily. Many 
reports by international and non-governmental organizations document breaches of 
human rights in this area.

</p>
<p>76. The independent expert intends to continue exploring this matter during his 
next missions and to report to the Human Rights Council on, inter alia, the issues of 
kidnapping, adoption and forced labour of children under the <i>restavek </i>(&#8220;stay with&#8221;) 
system.

<p> 
</p>
<p><b> E. Deportee issue 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>77. The independent expert&#8217;s attention has been drawn to the fate of persons 
referred to as &#8220;deportees&#8221;, Haitian nationals expelled from Canada or the United 
States of America after committing a crime. They are either illegal migrants who are 
expelled for violating immigration laws or legal migrants who are expelled after 
completing their sentences in the receiving country for major or minor offences. 
Over the last twenty years, at least 5,000 Haitians have been deported, most often 
for non-serious crimes,11 such as unlawful residence, use or possession of small 
quantities of drugs and domestic violence. A marked increase in the number of 
deportees has been observed in recent months. Since 1996, deportees arriving from 
the United States or Canada are immediately incarcerated in Haitian territory, those 
with the worst records being taken directly to the National Penitentiary for at least 
three months.  
</p>
<p>78. From a human rights perspective, deportation raises at least two issues: 
</p>
<p> (a) Managing deportees&#8217; potential impact on public safety and crime in the 
country: Deportees may possibly reoffend in Haiti and bring crime into the country. 
However, without reliable statistics and data it is impossible to establish any links 
between deportees&#8217; entry into Haitian society and their individual records or to 
know the actual number of deportees who relapse into crime; 
</p>
<p> (b) Respecting citizens&#8217; rights: Most Haitian deportees are lawful residents, 
having left their country of origin at a very young age.12 They have adapted to the 
receiving country and been socialized there. For the most part they speak neither 
Creole nor French.  
</p>
<p>79. The independent expert commends the pilot project on the resettlement, 
rehabilitation and reintegration of Haitian deportees, which is being executed by the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) in partnership with the Haitian 
Government, the support work being carried out by deportees&#8217; associations and the 
help provided by families who actively assist the resettlement of deportees. He 
recommends that, as part of a balanced debate on migration and deportation, the 
image of &#8220;deportee crime&#8221; portrayed in Haitian society be made the subject of an 
appropriate communication, that deportees&#8217; return be handled by a reception 
procedure and facility, and that consulates fully play their part in the administration 
of the deportation process. 
</p>
<p>80. The independent expert has also expressed his concern regarding information 
to the effect that the United States had planned to expel tens of thousands of 
migrants unlawfully residing in its territory and has requested the American 
</p>

  Out of a sample of 603 deportees who arrived in Haiti between October 2006 and April 2007, 
only 3 per cent had committed serious crimes involving the use of criminal violence. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 12 The average age of deportees leaving Haiti is between 4 and 7 years and of those returning to  </p>
<p>Haiti is between 28 and 48 years. </p>

</p>
<p><b> F. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>81. The Human Rights Council, recognizing in Presidential Statement PRST/9/1 
that &#8220;full enjoyment of human rights &#8211; civil and political, economic, social and 
cultural &#8211; is a factor of peace, stability and progress in Haiti&#8221;, extended the 
independent expert&#8217;s mission, inviting him &#8220;to continue the work undertaken and to 
carry out his mission by bringing his experience and expertise to bear and 
contributing to the cause of human rights in Haiti, with a particular emphasis on 
economic, social and cultural rights&#8221; (para. 14). 
82. The independent expert&#8217;s mission is accordingly being developed within that 
framework and, while, in the present report, the bulk of the observations and 
recommendations are concerned with civil and political rights and with the 
implementation of the recommendations adopted by the Council, the independent 
expert began to address the issue of economic and social rights during his first 
mission and intends to continue his work in that area. 
</p>
<p>83. In the independent expert&#8217;s view and in line with the mandate conferred upon 
him, the rule-of-law issue cannot be resolved solely through necessary reform of 
judicial institutions and the criminal justice, police and penitentiary systems to 
allow the enjoyment and exercise of civil and political rights.. 
84. Establishing the rule of law also means ensuring the functioning of public 
services and institutions which, in addition to the safety of persons and property, 
must guarantee to every citizen the full exercise of economic, social and cultural 
rights, as set forth in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, which has been included by the Haitian Parliament in its agenda for 2009. In 
this connection, the independent expert recommends that the adoption of the 
ratification law take place at the earliest opportunity in order to send out a strong 
signal of the determination of the Government and Parliament and their commitment 
to improving the socio-economic situation of the country.
