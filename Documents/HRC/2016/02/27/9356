<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102 
of 6 October 2006, requesting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
&#8220;continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted 
by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. The 
present update outlines progress achieved since the last report of the Secretary-General to the 
Human Rights Council on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights 
(A/HRC/4/91). 
</p>
<p><b>I. THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
accords priority to the establishment and strengthening of NHRIs with due regard to the 
Principles relating to the status of national institutions (the Paris Principles; General Assembly 
resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993, annex). OHCHR is also engaged in improving 
United Nations system-wide coordination on the work of NHRIs, and supports increased 
participation of NHRIs in the United Nations human rights system. OHCHR encourages the 
sharing of good practices among NHRIs, supports the strengthening of their regional networks 
and facilitates their access to United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) and other relevant 
partners within and outside the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>3. During the reporting period, OHCHR has sought, through a wide range of activities, to 
heighten its commitment to supporting the building of strong NHRIs and to increasing the 
effectiveness of regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs. In addition, the National Institutions 
Unit (NIU) of OHCHR has established a fellowship programme and issued a call for candidates 
in 2007. Through this programme, one &#8220;A status&#8221; NHRI staff member will be selected to work in 
the NIU for six months in order to gain knowledge of and experience with the United Nations 
human rights system. This fellowship programme will be beneficial for OHCHR, both in terms 
of substantive expertise as well as through the consolidation of direct contacts with NHRI staff 
from the whole world. 
</p>
<p>4. Paris Principles compliant NHRIs stand out as partners who are central to national human 
rights protection systems and are important counterparts for OHCHR. They can play a crucial 
role in promoting and monitoring the effective implementation of international human rights 
standards at the national level; a role which is increasingly recognized by the international 
community. 
</p>
<p>5. This role was highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at 
the opening of the nineteenth session of the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC) on 21 March 2007. The 
High Commissioner noted that NHRIs are instrumental in ensuring respect for the rule of law at 
the national level as well as in addressing critical human rights issues, such as summary 
executions, torture and arbitrary detention, as well as fighting against impunity. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. On 3 May 2007, on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the Danish Institute for 
Human Rights, the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, highlighted the role NHRIs 
are likely to play within the universal periodic review (UPR) mechanism of the Human Rights 
Council. She pointed out that the UPR may lead to the birth of many new NHRIs and greater 
compliance of NHRIs with the Paris Principles, as countries are likely to redouble efforts to 
strengthen their national protection system. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Advisory services provided by OHCHR to NHRIs 
</b></p>
<p>7. OHCHR has undertaken to strengthen the role of NHRIs at the country, regional and 
global levels, mainly through its National Institutions Unit (NIU), which works in consultation 
with the geographic units and field offices of OHCHR. At the request of Member States, tailored 
advice is provided to a growing number of countries on appropriate constitutional or legislative 
frameworks regarding the establishment of NHRIs; on the nature, functions, powers and 
responsibilities of NHRIs. Comparative analyses, technical cooperation needs assessments, 
project formulation and evaluation missions are also undertaken. 
</p><p>8. Various training and informative materials have been finalized by OHCHR, such as the 
CD-ROMs of the Actors for Change project (see section IV A below), and a handbook on the 
role of NHRIs in the prevention of HIV/AIDS and in combating HIV/AIDS-related 
discrimination (in cooperation with UNAIDS). 
</p>
<p>9. Further to the holding of the 8th International Conference of NHRIs (Bolivia, 
October 2006), and as requested in the Santa Cruz Declaration, a study on best practices of 
NHRIs addressing human rights and migration issues was prepared. 
</p>
<p>10. Since 2003, OHCHR maintains, in cooperation with the Danish Institute for Human 
Rights, a website on NHRIs (www.nhri.net). The site, linked to all existing NHRI websites and 
to the OHCHR main web page, includes information on country and thematic issues of interest 
to NHRIs. Furthermore, a database of comparative analyses for procedures and methods of 
complaints handling by NHRIs, as well as a news alert sent by e-mail to all interested parties, 
were launched in 2004. In 2008, the management of the website will be ensured and led by the 
Indian National Human Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>11. During the reporting period, advice was provided by OHCHR to the following countries: 
Azerbaijan, Burundi, Cambodia, Chile, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Italy, Lesotho, 
Madagascar, Sierra Leone, the Sudan, Swaziland, Tajikistan, Uganda, and Timor-Leste. Advice 
was frequently provided in collaboration with other United Nations partners, including UNDP 
and DPKO, and regional networks of NHRIs. Furthermore, in April 2007, OHCHR sent letters to 
all United Nations Resident Coordinators together with an information note for UNCTs on steps 
which can be taken to establish or strengthen NHRIs. Positive responses have been received so 
far by UNCTs in, inter alia, Mongolia, Iraq, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
Montenegro, and Mauritania. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The Americas and the Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p>12. As a follow-up to missions conducted in 2005, OHCHR provided advice to the 
Government of Chile concerning the compliance of the <i>Instituto de Derechos Humanos</i> of Chile 
with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Africa 
</b></p>
<p>13. OHCHR contracted a consultant to undertake a mission to Lesotho and to submit a report 
for the establishment of a NHRI. OHCHR provided comments on the draft legislation to 
establish a National Human Rights Commission in Lesotho and on the constitutional 
amendment. At the time of writing, a draft law has been developed in consultation with national 
actors, aimed at establishing a NHRI. 
</p>
<p>14. In cooperation with its regional office for East Africa located in Ethiopia, OHCHR is 
engaged in discussions on capacity-building of the Ethiopian NHRI and the possibility of 
accreditation by the ICC. 
</p>
<p>15. The OHCHR regional office for Southern Africa in South Africa, together with the 
Commonwealth Secretariat, is developing a joint strategy to establish a NHRI in Swaziland. 
</p><p>16. OHCHR provided advice on the draft legislation on the reorganization of the Human 
Rights Commission in Madagascar, through the UNDP Office in Antananarivo. 
</p>
<p>17. OHCHR and the human rights section of the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) 
supported the establishment of the Southern Sudan Human Rights Commission, based in Juba 
and incorporated in the Southern Sudan Interim Constitution. OHCHR in cooperation with 
UNMIS facilitated a study tour in Uganda and South Africa for the newly appointed members of 
the Southern Sudan Human Rights Commission. OHCHR is working with the Government of 
Southern Sudan to finalize the enabling legislation of the Southern Sudan Human Rights 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>18. On 21 August 2007, the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) and 
the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone held a workshop to find consensus on the 
capacity needs of the Commission and the role of the United Nations in supporting it. Four main 
areas of cooperation were identified: capacity-building, joint programmes, resource mobilization, 
communication and information. OHCHR, in cooperation with UNIOSIL, has been supporting 
the Government of Sierra Leone in the establishment of the Human Rights Commission, 
particularly the drafting of enabling legislation, and through the provision of advisory services 
(including concerning the appointment process). OHCHR facilitated the integration of the 
Commission into the regional and subregional networks of NHRIs, as well as the participation of 
the members of the Commission to the 6th Conference of African NHRIs (Kigali, Rwanda, 
8-10 October 2007). 
</p>
<p>19. In C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, OHCHR and the human rights section of the United Nations Operation in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (ONUCI) provided a legal analysis of Presidential Decree No. 2005-08/PR 
of 15 July 2005 establishing the National Human Rights Commission. A study tour to Kigali was 
also organized in October 2007 for the members of the Commission. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. OHCHR has engaged with the Sub-regional Centre for Human Rights and Democracy for 
Central Africa (Yaound&#233;, Cameroon) and with the United Nations Operation in Burundi 
(BINUB) with a view to providing legal and policy advice to the Government of Burundi for the 
establishment of an independent NHRI. It is working with the focal point within BINUB. 
</p>
<p>21. OHCHR has been supporting the Ugandan Human Rights Commission in strengthening its 
complaints handling system. In mid-January 2008, two staff members of the Indian Human 
Rights Commission will deploy to Uganda to support OHCHR and the Ugandan Human Rights 
Commission in connection with strengthening complaints handling procedures and use of 
relevant database. The mission is organized and funded by OHCHR-Uganda. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Asia and the Pacific 
</b></p>
<p>22. A three-year capacity-building project was jointly developed by the <i>Provedor&#8217;</i>s Office of 
Timor-Leste, UNDP and OHCHR. Implementation began in January 2007 and serves as an 
umbrella for the donor community to the <i>Provedor</i>&#8217;s Office. OHCHR provided technical advice 
to the <i>Provedor</i> for Human Rights and Justice of Timor-Leste on the establishment of an 
advisory voluntary council which would ensure greater pluralism within the institution. 
</p>
<p>23. OHCHR contracted a consultant to support and join a UNDP-led needs assessment mission 
with the Raoul Wallenberg Institute for the support and strengthening of the Indonesian national 
human rights institution, KOMNAS HAM (11 November-5 December 2007).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. From 15 to 23 December 2007, OHCHR undertook a mission to Cambodia with a 
contracted consultant from the NHRI of Northern Ireland to meet key national and international 
stakeholders. The objective of the mission was to support the establishment of a Paris Principles 
compliant NHRI in Cambodia.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>25. OHCHR provided an advisory paper on a project research paper on forms of NHRIs in 
Small Pacific Island States, and on a discussion paper on ratification of international human 
rights treaties in the Pacific and the added value for the Pacific region.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Europe 
</b></p>
<p>26. In February 2007, OHCHR provided legal advice on the draft law to establish a NHRI in 
Italy. Further advice followed, in consultation with Italian civil society organizations. The text of 
the draft law was approved in April 2007 by the Chamber of Deputies and remains to be 
endorsed by the Senate. 
</p>
<p>27. Regarding Tajikistan, UNDP and OHCHR jointly developed a project for the provision of 
assistance in the drafting of a law on a NHRI. The project ran from October to December 2007 
and involved sharing knowledge on NHRIs, the hiring of a consultant to assist the Governmental 
Working Group to draft a law on the NHRI; and the organization of a national roundtable to 
publicly discuss the draft law. The Working Group is scheduled to present the draft text to the 
Government by the end of December 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>28. In 2007, OHCHR organized capacity-building and awareness training workshops for staff 
of the regional offices of the Office of the Ombudsman in Azerbaijan and selected civil society 
representatives (two workshops were held from 29 October-2 November 2007, one from 
24-25 December 2007, and one from 27-28 December 2007). Topics covered included the 
definition of a NHRI, the Paris Principles, and the role of NHRIs in the international human 
rights system. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  OHCHR support to regional initiatives related to NHRIs 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  The Americas and the Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p><b>Network of the Americas 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Network of the Americas is composed of NHRIs from the region which are accredited 
by the ICC as in compliance with the Paris Principles. As of December 2007, the Network 
included NHRIs from the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Canada, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, 
Peru, and Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>30. In November 2006, the Fifth General Assembly of the Network (held in Buenos Aires) 
adopted the Work Plan 2007-2008, covering activities in the areas of the right to education, 
persons with disabilities, right to a healthy environment, rights of indigenous peoples, the 
prevention of torture, and migrants. In May 2007, the Network organized a follow-up workshop 
to the Action Plan for the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Education in Managua. The 
United Nations participated in this event. 
</p>
<p>31. On 26 October 2007, the Network of the Americas, with the support of OHCHR, organized 
a discussion panel on the role of NHRIs vis-&#224;-vis the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities in Mexico City. The goal of the discussion was to strengthen the capacity of NHRIs 
from the region to monitor the implementation of the newly adopted Convention and in 
particular with regard to the explicit role given to NHRIs under article 33 of the Convention. 
National and international experts were invited to participate in the discussion. OHCHR 
contributed to the publication of the outcome of the discussion that should take the form of 
guidelines addressed to NHRIs. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Africa 
</b></p>
<p>32. OHCHR, in cooperation with UNHCR, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs), the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR), the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie and the 
Brookings Institution-University of Bern Project on Internal Displacement, supported the 
organization of the 6th Conference of African NHRIs (held in Kigali, 8-10 October 2007). The 
overall objective of the Conference was to raise awareness among African NHRIs of their 
potential role in addressing the human rights of refugees, IDPs and stateless persons and to 
strengthen the capacity of African NHRIs to engage effectively in the protection of these 
vulnerable groups. The outcome of the conference, the Kigali Declaration, is attached as 
Annex I. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>33. OHCHR has supported the establishment of the Network of African NHRIs. The 
Constitution of the Network was signed at the 6th Conference of African NHRIs; the main 
purpose of the Network is to encourage the establishment of NHRIs in Africa in conformity with 
the Paris Principles, to strengthen the effectiveness of NHRIs in Africa, and to encourage 
cooperation among NHRIs in Africa. The Network includes NHRIs which are accredited by the 
ICC and compliant with the Paris Principles. The Network replaced the Coordinating Committee 
of African NHRIs set up in 1996. The Constitution of the Network provides that a permanent 
secretariat of the Network is established in Nairobi. With the financial support of OHCHR, an 
executive director was recruited as well as an assistant. OHCHR has encouraged other potential 
donors to support the Secretariat once a plan of action and programme of activities are defined. 
</p>
<p>34. An international conference on democracy and human rights in Africa focusing on the role 
of NHRIs was held in Cairo on 3 and 4 December 2007. Discussions focused on the African 
Charter for Democracy, Elections and Governance and the role of NHRIs; the role of NHRIs in 
promoting democracy and development; and the interplay between human rights and judicial 
independence. Participants included: Egyptian authorities, OHCHR, the Organisation 
Internationale de la Francophonie; the League of Arab States; the African Union; and UNESCO. 
Senior staff of OHCHR participated in the event and delivered a keynote speech. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Asia and the Pacific 
</b></p>
<p><b>Twelfth Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Forum of National Institutions 
</b></p>
<p>35. As in previous years, OHCHR co-funded the Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific 
Forum (APF) which took place in Sydney from 24-27 September 2007. The Forum was held 
together with the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and brought 
together 150 representatives from NHRIs, regional Governments, non-governmental 
organizations and the United Nations. The main goal of the meeting was to enhance human 
rights cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region through the promotion and strengthening of NHRIs. 
OHCHR supported and actively participated in this event, and an opening address was delivered 
on behalf of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>36. The Twelfth Annual Meeting focused on the rights of people with disabilities. Participants 
highlighted the need for cooperation between NHRIs across the Asia-Pacific region as an 
important part of implementing the Disability Convention. APF members also agreed to establish 
a disability &#8220;focal point&#8221; in each NHRI and to communicate regularly at a senior management 
level to discuss progress in protecting, promoting and monitoring the rights of people with 
disabilities. The Advisory Council of Jurists presented its interim report on human rights and the 
environment. A key recommendation of the report is that NHRIs advocate for the adoption of a 
specific right to the environment.  
</p>
<p>37. In its Concluding Statement (see Annex II), the Forum expressed appreciation for the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for her leadership in supporting the 
establishment and strengthening of NHRIs. The Forum also warmly welcomed the strengthened 
partnership with the OHCHR and looked forward to enhancing this relationship and its 
participation in the United Nations human rights system.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>14th Annual Workshop of the Framework on Regional Cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>38. The 14th Annual Workshop of the Framework on Regional Cooperation for the promotion 
and protection of human rights in the Asia-Pacific region was held from 10-12 July 2007 in Bali. 
The workshop was attended by 32 States, 13 NHRIs, and representatives of UNDP, UNHCR, 
UNICEF, the World Bank, and various NGOs. The event was hosted by the Government of the 
Republic of Indonesia and formally opened by the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The 
14th Annual Workshop adopted the Bali Action Points (see Annex III), which inter alia 
welcomed the activities of NHRIs in support of regional cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b>Regional Workshop on the Establishment of NHRIs in Asia 
</b></p>
<p>39. From 15 to 17 October 2007, OHCHR organized in Manila a regional workshop on the 
establishment of NHRIs in Asia, in cooperation with the Commission on Human Rights of the 
Philippines and with the support of the Government of the Philippines. The workshop brought 
together representatives of Governments and Parliaments of nine countries in Asia that do not 
yet have a NHRI (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Japan, Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, 
Myanmar, Pakistan, Singapore and Viet Nam). The purpose of the meeting was to provide 
practical tools and lessons learned in order to establish a NHRI in their countries. 
Representatives of UNCT/UNDP Philippines, Viet Nam, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok 
and OHCHR participated in the workshop. The Concluding Statement (see Annex IV) adopted 
by the participants stressed the importance of taking necessary measures in order to establish a 
NHRI in compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Europe 
</b></p>
<p><b>European Coordinating Committee of NHRI 
</b></p>
<p>40. OHCHR participated in the meetings of the European Coordinating Committee of the 
European Group of NHRIs (Geneva, 20 March 2007; Berlin, 14 June 2007; and Dublin, 
17 September 2007) in order to discuss issues of mutual concern, such as the reform of the 
accreditation procedures for NHRIs, NHRI participation in the Human Rights Council, regional 
cooperation concerning NHRIs, and the National Institutions Database on Disability Rights. The 
European Group is composed of 17 full members - NHRIs which have been accredited by the 
ICC of NHRIs - and 9 observers (NHRIs which have not been recognized by the ICC as fully 
compliant with the Paris Principles). 
</p>
<p><b>Council of Europe 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Annual Forum of the North-South Centre was held in Lisbon on 16 and 
17 November 2007, in cooperation with the Venice Commission and the Office of the 
Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe. OHCHR participated in the event 
and delivered a statement on the role of NHRIs in the promotion and protection of human rights 
at the national, regional and international level. In general, the Lisbon Forum 2007 facilitated the 
debate on the role, function and actions of NHRIs, and the role of North-South cooperation in 
reinforcing the efficiency of NHRIs. </p>

<p>42. On 12 and 13 July 2007, OHCHR participated in the Supplementary Human Dimension 
Meeting organized by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and its 
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), held in Vienna. One of the three 
main sessions was devoted to the role of independent NHRIs in promoting and protecting human 
rights. OHCHR actively participated in this meeting. 
</p>
<p><b>Regional Ombudsman Conference 
</b></p>
<p>43. OHCHR participated in a Regional Ombudsman Conference organized by the 
Ombudsperson Institution in Kosovo with the support of the United States Office in Pristina and 
OSCE in Pristina on 8 and 9 June 2007. The conference, the theme of which was &#8220;Support and 
Obstacles to the Protection of Human Rights; cooperation between ombudsman institutions and 
public administration, media and civil society&#8221;, brought together NHRIs from across 
South-eastern Europe, representatives of Kosovo&#8217;s local authorities, civil society groups, media, 
and representatives of regional and international organizations. It was considered a success by 
participants and led to specific and practical joint recommendations (see Annex V). 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Arab region 
</b></p>
<p>44. In 2007, OHCHR participated in the Arab-European Human Rights Dialogue (AEHRD) 
meetings organized by the Jordan National Centre for Human Rights and the Danish Institute for 
Human Rights with the aim to establish a regional platform for cooperation and exchange on 
human rights issues between Arab and European NHRIs. The first Preparatory Meeting of the 
AEHRD which took place in Amman from 27 February to 1 March 2007 focused on access to 
information and civil society development, while the High-Level Meeting which took place in 
Amman on 18 and 19 April 2007 focused on human rights and terrorism. Concerning the 
protection of human rights while countering terrorism, it was recommended that a joint 
Arab-European working group develop practical tools for NHRIs (see Annex VI). The active 
participation of OHCHR in the event allowed for discussions and closer cooperation with a 
number of NHRIs from the Arab region. 
</p>
<p>45. From 8 to 10 November 2007 OHCHR participated in a round table entitled &#8220;The 
Mediterranean basin: space of dialogue and cooperation - mediators: actors for good 
governance&#8221;. The event, organized by the Mediator of Morocco, the Mediator of France and the 
Spanish Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo brought together NHRIs from several countries (Albania, Algeria, 
Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Croatia, Egypt, Israel, Malta, Mali, Morocco, 
Montenegro, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden). The meeting aimed at discussing the role of 
NHRIs as well as related challenges and opportunities in the promotion and protection of human 
rights in the Mediterranean region. The round table ended with the adoption of a final 
declaration, which included a commitment towards the establishment of a permanent network of 
ombudsmen and mediators for the exchange of experience and collaboration on cross-border 
issues (e.g. migration). 
</p>
<p>46. From 12 to 14 November 2007 the Third Conference on the role of NHRIs in promoting 
the independence of the judiciary in the Arab region was held in Rabat, organized by OHCHR 
and the Advisory Council for Human Rights of Morocco in cooperation with the Moroccan </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Government. The Conference aimed at supporting national and regional initiatives to strengthen 
the role of NHRIs and other actors in promoting the rule of law and the independence of the 
judiciary in accordance with international human rights norms. It brought together 
representatives of NHRIs in the region, the judiciary, regional organizations including the 
League of Arab States, United Nations, experts in the administration of justice, as well as 
non-governmental organizations. The Conference adopted the &#8220;Rabat Declaration&#8221;, which 
outlines a concrete strategy for NHRI engagement in promoting the independence of the 
judiciary in the Arab region (see Annex VII). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  OHCHR support to international initiatives related to NHRIs 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions 
for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC)  
</b></p>
<p>47. As the secretariat of the ICC and its Sub-Committee on Accreditation, OHCHR provided 
substantive support to and facilitated the holding of the nineteenth session of the ICC in Geneva 
from 21 to 23 March 2007. On that occasion, discussions were held on the engagement of 
NHRIs with the Human Rights Council; the role of NHRIs in the United Nations treaty body 
process; follow-up to the 8th International Conference of NHRIs and the Santa Cruz Declaration; 
the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and plans for 
the 9th International Conference of NHRIs. The ICC also elected a new Chairperson and 
Vice-Chairperson (the NHRIs of Canada and the Republic of Korea, respectively). OHCHR also 
provided support to parallel events on the potential role of NHRIs in torture prevention; on 
interaction between parliamentarian human rights committees and NHRIs; and on cooperation 
between NGOs and NHRIs. 
</p>
<p>48. A presentation was given on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. It was highlighted that, according to article 33 (2) of the Convention, 
NHRIs have an explicit role to play. The ICC meeting also expressed support for the Disability 
Rights Database, developed initially in the Asia-Pacific region to gather and analyse information 
on how NHRIs handle complaints involving persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>49. Another important outcome of the ICC meeting was the unanimous support of ICC 
members for the proposal to establish a permanent ICC representation in Geneva, primarily in 
order for the ICC as well as individual NHRIs to make their voice heard at sessions of the 
Human Rights Council and treaty body meetings. ICC members also encouraged regional 
coordinating bodies of NHRIs to actively participate in the sessions of the Council, as is the case 
with A-status NHRIs and the ICC, in line with Commission on Human Rights resolution 
2005/74, subject however to the strict procedures agreed upon at the session; i.e. they can speak 
on behalf of NHRIs with A-status accreditation only. 
</p>
<p>50. As agreed upon during the nineteenth session of the annual meeting of the ICC, an interim 
ICC representative was appointed who represented the ICC Chair and A-status NHRIs and spoke 
on their behalf at the sessions of the Human Rights Council and the human rights treaty bodies in 
the second half of 2007. Following consultations with the Director-General of the 
United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG), OHCHR facilitated the use by the ICC representative 
of an office space within the Palais des Nations, making easier the interaction between NHRIs 
and the international human rights system. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. From 19 to 22 June 2007, the ICC Bureau met for the first time, in Geneva (then consisting 
of the ICC Chair (Canada), the ICC Vice-Chair (Republic of Korea), the former ICC Chair 
(Denmark), and representatives of one NHRI per region (respectively from India, Nigeria, 
Mexico and Ireland). The Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs also participated. The ICC Bureau 
discussed, inter alia, NHRI interaction with the Human Rights Council, the human rights treaty 
bodies and special procedure mandate holders; the proposal to establish an ICC representative in 
Geneva; country and early warning mechanisms for NHRIs under threat; as well as 
organizational issues concerning the ICC.  
</p>
<p>52. An expanded ICC Bureau met a second time from 12 to 14 December 2007 and discussed, 
inter alia, ICC activities; ICC accreditation; preparations for the twentieth ICC session; as well as 
the International Conference of NHRIs planned in Nairobi in 2008. For the first time, all regional 
coordinating bodies, foremost the one from Africa - for the first time - attended. Sessions were 
also facilitated by a consultant from the Canadian Institute on Governance (a non-profit 
organization). 
</p>
<p><b>2. The Sub-Committee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection  
of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>53. OHCHR provided secretarial support to the meetings of the ICC Sub-Committee on 
Accreditation, held in April and October 2007 (for a list of NHRIs with ICC accreditation status, 
see Annex VIII).  
</p>
<p>54. In 2007, the Sub-Committee reviewed the accreditation status of NHRIs from the 26 
following countries: Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Denmark, Fiji, France, Georgia, Greece, 
Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Poland, 
Portugal, Senegal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden and Togo. As of 
December 2007, the ICC accredited 60 NHRIs with A-status, i.e. in compliance with the Paris 
Principles.  
</p>
<p>55. The ICC accreditation procedure has also been strengthened by the introduction of an 
appeal process, ensuring greater transparency and due process, especially for NHRIs which are 
considered not to comply with the Paris Principles. NHRIs now have 30 days to appeal the 
results of the Sub-Committee review, with the ICC full membership then taking a decision. A 
more rigorous review of each application for accreditation has also been introduced, including 
the full documentation and statement of compliance submitted in advance of the session by 
NHRIs. During the review, the Sub-Committee has the possibility to contact NHRIs themselves, 
if necessary, through conference calls. Moreover, recommendations of the Sub-Committee are 
formulated in a more focused manner, sometimes requesting a review of accreditations before 
the normal five-year time frame. Finally, Sub-Committee recommendations are more widely 
distributed to NHRIs and other stakeholders for follow-up action.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. COOPERATION BETWEEN UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS 
MECHANISMS AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>56. OHCHR has been supporting an enhanced role for NHRIs with regard to the Human 
Rights Council (HRC), in line with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/74 and past 
practice of the Commission on Human Rights. Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 
18 June 2007 opens many opportunities for NHRIs and their regional coordinating mechanisms 
to participate in HRC sessions and to engage with its various mechanisms. NHRIs accredited by 
the ICC as being in compliance with the Paris Principles, the ICC itself, as well as regional 
coordinating bodies of NHRIs, may participate and address the Council in an independent 
capacity and on all agenda items. They may also submit written statements, issue documentation 
(with a United Nations document symbol number), and have separate seating arrangements.  
</p>
<p>57. With regard to the mechanisms of the HRC, NHRIs have been given a clear and significant 
role by resolution 5/1, for example with regard to the UPR mechanism, where one of the three 
types of documents for review will consist of information provided by stakeholders, including 
NHRIs. NHRIs may play a crucial role in all phases of the UPR, from the submission of 
documentation, to attendance of the review, and follow-up to recommendations.  
</p>
<p>58. Finally, NHRIs can play an important role regarding the HRC Advisory Body as well as, 
more specifically, the Complaints Procedure. 
</p>
<p>59. In 2007, A-status NHRIs, the Asia-Pacific Forum of NHRIs as a regional coordinating 
body, as well as the interim ICC representative (on behalf of A-status NHRIs) intervened during 
sessions of the Human Rights Council, such as the <i>Commission Nationale Consultative des 
Droits de l&#8217;Homme de France,</i> the <i>Conseil Consultatif des Droits de l&#8217;Homme du Royaume du 
Maroc</i>, the Mexican National Human Rights Commission, the National Human Rights 
Commission of Malaysia; the South African Human Rights Commission; the Human Rights 
Commission of Rwanda, and a joint statement was made by NHRIs from Germany, France, 
Denmark, Greece, Norway and Morocco. NHRIs have also submitted documentation for 
processing as official United Nations documents with an own NHRI document symbol number.  
</p>
<p><b>Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>60. As an ongoing activity, OHCHR has systematically engaged with treaty body members by 
providing expert analyses concerning NHRIs and their related activities. OHCHR regularly 
prepares briefs for each treaty body on NHRIs and related issues concerning countries under 
examination. OHCHR also prepares and regularly updates a compilation of all treaty body 
concluding observations and recommendations that mention NHRIs (posted on the NHRI 
website www.nhri.net), and systematically sends concluding observations to the NHRIs of the 
countries concerned, following their adoption. 
</p>
<p>61. Since 2003, OHCHR has been involved in the European Union funded project 
&#8220;Strengthening the implementation of human rights treaty recommendations through the 
enhancement of national protection mechanisms&#8221;. This project aims at improving the 
implementation of conclusions and recommendations of human rights treaty bodies at the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>national level through the strengthening of the capacity of the following three main target 
groups: NHRIs, NGOs and the media. The activities are designed to enhance participation of 
these actors in the reporting process, as well as to encourage the use of international human 
rights instruments and treaty body recommendations in their respective areas of work as a tool to 
further the promotion and protection of human rights. In 2007, NHRIs and other stakeholders 
from Indonesia, the Philippines and Guyana benefited from this project through preparatory 
workshops. As revealed by follow-up activities, workshops conducted since 2003 have 
effectively led to the strengthening of national capacity to implement human rights treaty body 
recommendations, with NHRIs playing an increasing role in this context. 
</p>
<p>62. On 20 June 2007, the ICC Bureau participated in the Sixth Inter-Committee meeting of the 
human rights treaty bodies. The focus of discussion was the outcome document of the round 
table organized by the German Institute for Human Rights in Berlin, on 23 and 
24 November 2006 (HRI/MC/2007/3). This document contains a draft harmonized approach to 
NHRI engagement with treaty body processes, proposing that NHRIs be involved in the 
processes of State reporting, follow-up to treaty body recommendations, capacity-building at the 
national level with regard to the reporting process, as well as petitions and enquiry procedures. 
Treaty body members responded positively to NHRI participation in treaty body processes.  
</p>
<p>63. From 26 to 28 November 2007, OHCHR organized in Geneva the National Institutions and 
Treaty Bodies Workshop (see Annex IX) with the objective to review lessons learned and best 
practices in terms of NHRI interaction with treaty bodies; to build the capacity of NHRIs in their 
interaction with treaty bodies, including follow-up action; and to deepen the relationship between 
NHRIs and treaty bodies in line with the draft harmonized approach on the role of NHRIs in the 
treaty body process. NHRIs from all geographical regions participated, as well as treaty body 
members. The Secretary-General welcomes the organization and the outcomes of the Berlin and 
Geneva events, which strengthen and emphasize the importance of the involvement of NHRIs in 
treaty body process. 
</p>
<p>64. In 2007, the NIU of OHCHR addressed several sessions of the treaty bodies, including the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Sub-Committee on Prevention, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, and the Human Rights Committee. This provided useful interaction possibilities, 
including highlighting the importance of the involvement of NHRIs in the reporting process to 
treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p>65. In 2007, several NHRIs made statements and provided reports to treaty bodies in relation 
to the consideration of reports submitted by their respective countries - France, Bolivia, Croatia, 
Georgia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway and the Republic of Korea.  
</p>
<p><b>Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>66. NHRIs can be instrumental in the work of special procedure mandate holders, specifically 
with regard to country visits (preparation; meetings during the visit; follow up to 
recommendations); letters of allegations or early warning; participation in and organization of 
thematic studies, conferences and seminars; and interaction in international forums such as the 
Human Rights Council or the Annual Meeting of Special Procedure mandate holders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>67. OHCHR NIU regularly provides special procedure mandate holders with information 
concerning the work of NHRIs in the preparation of their country missions. Increasingly, 
mandate holders look to NHRIs for assistance in ensuring that their recommendations are 
followed up at the national level. This is an important area of work for NHRIs and should be 
further encouraged.  
</p>
<p>68. On 21 June 2007, OHCHR organized a side event to the Fourteenth Annual Meeting 
of Special Procedure mandate holders, focusing on the interaction between NHRIs and 
Special Procedure mandate holders. The background document for this event 
(see Annex X) contained concrete recommendations, and was met with overwhelming 
support by the special procedure mandate holders who attended it, including the 
Chairperson of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures 
(http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/annual_meetings/14th.htm). 
</p>
<p><b>III. COOPERATION BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH 
COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, UNITED NATIONS  
AGENCIES AND PROGRAMMES, AND INTERNATIONAL  
AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ON NHRIS 
</b></p>
<p>69. During the period under review, OHCHR has continued and strengthened its cooperation 
with UNCT members worldwide. On 2 April 2007, OHCHR sent letters to all United Nations 
Resident Coordinators together with an information note for UNCTs on practical steps they can 
take in order to facilitate the establishment or strengthen a NHRI, in close cooperation with 
OHCHR. NHRIs can be of significant support to the efforts of the United Nations in the areas of 
good governance, rule of law and human rights, and are central to effective implementation of 
programmes in these areas, especially with respect to sustainability and national ownership. 
Several positive responses have been received from UNCTs from different regions of the world 
and a number of joint activities are being discussed in reaction to that initiative.  
70. In its work relating to NHRIs, OHCHR also continued its and strengthened cooperation 
with the <i>Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie</i>, <i>l&#8217;Association francophone des 
Commissions nationales des droits de l&#8217;homme</i>, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the 
Commonwealth Secretariat, the Council of Europe, OSCE/ODIHR, the Ibero American 
Federation of Ombudsmen (FIO), the Special Fund for Ombudsmen and National Institutions of 
Latin America and the Caribbean, the African Union, the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).  
</p>
<p>71. Regarding the Commonwealth Secretariat, OHCHR participated in meetings of the 
Conference and Steering Committee meetings, in February and May 2007, respectively, 
regarding the setting up of a Commonwealth forum of NHRIs, the primary purpose of which is 
to serve as a platform to strengthen the capacity of NHRIs to protect and promote human rights 
within the Commonwealth while avoiding duplication of efforts with existing regional NHRI 
coordinating bodies. It was agreed that one of the main objectives of the forum will be the 
promotion of increased access, dialogue and interaction of NHRIs with Commonwealth Heads of 
Government meetings (CHOGM).  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>72. OHCHR participated in the first meeting of the Commonwealth Forum of NHRIs 
on 19 November 2007 in Kampala, the conclusions of which stressed the need for all NHRIs in 
the Commonwealth to respect and function in conformity with the Paris Principles. The Forum 
also called upon Commonwealth Heads of Government to strengthen NHRIs and adequately 
support them.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. ROUND TABLES OF NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
INSTITUTIONS ON THEMATIC ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conflict prevention and prevention of torture 
</b></p>
<p><b>Actors for change project 
</b>73. The project &#8220;<i>Actors for change: Strengthening the capacity of National Human Rights 
Institutions through distance and regional training</i>&#8221; commenced in 2005 with the aim of 
strengthening the capacity of NHRIs to prevent torture and engage in the prevention of conflict, 
including early warning, respectively. The project ended in 2007 and will be reviewed in 2008. 
Funded by the European Union, the project was implemented by OHCHR in partnership with the 
United Nations System Staff College (UNSSC), the Association for the Prevention of Torture 
(APT) and the NGO Fahamu (for a general description of the project, see A/HRC/4/91, 
paras. 85-88). 
</p>
<p>74. In collaboration with the UNSSC and Fahamu, a distance training on conflict prevention 
for NHRIs from Anglophone countries of Africa and the Middle East was organized between 
7 May and 15 July 2007. A follow-up workshop was held in Nairobi from 15 to 20 July 2007. 
Upon successful completion participants received a certificate from the University of Oxford. 
</p>
<p>75. From 29 May to 2 June 2007, in cooperation with the APT, OHCHR organized a workshop 
in Rabat on torture prevention for staff of French-speaking NHRIs. The workshop was hosted by 
the National Human Rights Institution of Morocco. Participants also included staff from NHRIs 
in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Haiti, Mauritius, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Canada. 
All of them had had successfully completed the first phase of the programme (distance learning 
course). The Rabat workshop included a visit to a prison. In the third phase of the programme, 
the participants drafted an action plan on torture prevention for their institution, which they were 
encouraged to present for actual adoption by their institution at the end of the course. 
</p>
<p>76. In September 2007, a two-month distance learning exercise started for Spanish-speaking 
participants from the Americas, monitored by tutors from the APT. From 26 to 
30 November 2007, OHCHR held a follow-up workshop in San Jos&#233;, Costa Rica, in 
collaboration with the APT, which included visits to six prisons in Costa Rica. Twenty-seven 
participants from 10 NHRIs attended (Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay and Peru).  
</p>
<p><b>Prevention of torture 
</b></p>
<p>77. Further to the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
(OPCAT) and the establishment of the Sub-Committee on Prevention in February 2007, OHCHR 
launched a survey on the role of NHRIs in torture prevention. NHRIs from Afghanistan, Algeria, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, India, 
Ireland, Jordan, Latvia, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, 
Niger, Northern Ireland, Palestine, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Slovakia, Spain and Uzbekistan 
participated in the first turn of the survey. The first results of the survey were very much 
appreciated by the Sub-Committee on Prevention and other actors. 
</p>
<p>78. In March 2007, a thematic dialogue was organized by OHCHR on the role of NHRIs and 
torture prevention, in order to explore opportunities for NHRIs to operate as a national 
preventive mechanism under the OPCAT. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Transitional justice 
</b>79. From 23 to 25 November 2007 a round table of NHRIs on transitional justice was 
organized by OHCHR in Cape Town, in close cooperation with the OHCHR Regional 
Representative for Southern Africa and the South African Human Rights Commission. It brought 
together NHRIs with either relevant experience or potential interest in transitional justice issues 
(i.e. Algeria, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Guatemala, Morocco, Nepal, Northern Ireland, 
Palestine, Philippines, Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste) to discuss how 
NHRIs can best perform their institutional role of human rights guarantor during transitional 
phases. The round table focused on the role of NHRIs in peace processes, their interaction with 
judicial (e.g. truth-seeking mechanisms, individual and collective reparations, vetting) and 
non-judicial mechanisms of transitional justice (international, regional, national and hybrid 
courts) as well as on challenges, opportunities and lessons learned in promoting justice, 
accountability and peace. Representatives of the Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa, 
the African Secretariat of NHRIs, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the 
International Centre for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and representatives of 
South African civil society also participated in the round table, which resulted in the elaboration 
of draft strategies for NHRI engagement in transitional justice. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Role of NHRIs in United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>80. On 15 November 2007, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea organized an 
international seminar in Seoul entitled &#8220;the Role of NHRIs in the Newly Established UN Human 
Rights Mechanisms&#8221;. Discussions focused on the increasing role of NHRIs in the Human Rights 
Council; NHRIs and the UPR; NHRIs and the Advisory Committee; NHRIs and special 
procedures; and the treaty bodies and the role of NHRIs. OHCHR was represented by a 
delegation and made a substantive contribution. The seminar provided an opportunity for 
participants to share their expertise with the aim to build the capacity of NHRIs. It highlighted 
many issues to strengthen the participation of NHRIs in the international human rights system. 
Finally, participants agreed on the need for NHRIs to stay informed and to develop strategic 
action plans for engagement with such mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81. NHRIs compliant with the Paris Principles are key elements of strong and effective 
national human rights protection systems. They can also be important partners in the 
international human rights system, especially through the Human Rights Council, the human 
rights treaty bodies and special procedures mandate holders. In particular, they can support </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Governments in ensuring that international human rights norms are applied at national level, 
including by facilitating follow-up actions to the recommendations resulting from the 
international human rights system. Ensuring the independence and autonomy of NHRIs, 
pluralistic representation, as well as their interaction with a broad range of national and 
international stakeholders, is a priority. 
</p>
<p>82. The Secretary-General welcomes the increasingly important role of NHRIs in the work of 
OHCHR and the deepening of their partnership in connection with the implementation of the 
High Commissioner&#8217;s Plan of Action and OHCHR country engagement strategies. The more the 
United Nations system works closely with and through independent NHRIs, the greater are the 
chances of success and sustainability of good governance, rule of law and human rights efforts. 
Working with NHRIs clearly facilitates a stronger sense of national ownership with respect to 
United Nations human rights programmes.  
</p>
<p>83. With the support of OHCHR, NHRIs are also engaging more actively in the Human Rights 
Council, human rights treaty bodies and special procedure mandate holders, directly or through 
the ICC representative in Geneva. In 2007, OHCHR responded to the increasing demand from 
Member States and stakeholders for in-depth expertise regarding NHRIs. The Secretary-General 
welcomes also that the accreditation process in the ICC has become more rigorous and more 
thorough in order to ensure independence and effectiveness of NHRIs in this important arena. 
</p>
<p>84. OHCHR is thus encouraged to continue to work on the establishment and strengthening of 
NHRIs and to enhance its relationship with NHRIs. National consultations and awareness-raising 
activities involving all major stakeholders, such as Government officials, members of 
parliament, civil society, and the media, are indispensable in this process. UNCTs should 
become major partners at the country level in these endeavours and they should increasingly 
develop partnerships with NHRIs, especially those compliant with the Paris Principles, in 
connection with programmes and activities in the areas of the rule of law, good governance and 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>85. OHCHR is working towards enhancing its support to and relationship with the ICC and its 
newly established Bureau as well as its accreditation procedure so that NHRIs can more 
effectively and independently contribute to ensuring that international human rights norms are 
translated into consistent national laws and practices. I count on OHCHR to provide rigorous 
secretariat support to the ICC in upholding the Paris Principles and ensure review of NHRI 
compliance. The importance of this process is witnessed by an increase in applications for 
accreditation, the rise in the number of A-status NHRIs, as well as in the access recognized for 
such institutions by international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>86. I finally encourage NHRIs to undertake activities for the sixtieth anniversary of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the theme of which is &#8220;Dignity and justice for all of us&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>SUPPORT AND OBSTACLES TO THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS; 
COOPERATION BETWEEN OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTIONS AND PUBLIC 
                      ADMINISTRATION, MEDIA AND CIVIL SOCIETY 
</b></p>
<p><b>REGIONAL OMBUDSMAN CONFERENCE ORGANISED BY THE 
OMBUDSPERSON INSTITUTION IN KOSOVO WITH THE SUPPORT 
    OF THE US OFFICE IN PRISHTIN&#203;/PRI&#352;TINA AND THE OSCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>8-9 June 2007, Grand Hotel, Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina, Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p><b>Joint recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Representatives of ombudsman institutions and international organizations meeting in 
Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina discussed ways in which ombudsman institutions can cooperate with 
the public administration, media and civil society for the realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ombudsman institutions will be most effective in the promotion and protection of 
human rights if, at a minimum, they are in full compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants recognized that maladministration and poor quality of public administration 
staff - including a lack of human rights training - have an adverse effect on the 
follow-up of recommendations made by the ombudsman institutions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants also recognized that ombudsman institutions should function independently 
from Parliament and that they have a mutually reinforcing and reciprocal relationship. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was recognized that ombudsman institutions operating in transition or post-conflict 
situations face unique challenges, such as in awareness-raising, investigation, the 
provision of advice, and reconciliation. They play a crucial role in the establishment of 
the rule of law, and are ideally placed to address the human rights concerns of 
minorities and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants recognized that there are arguments for and against having a specialized 
ombudsman institution mandated to deal with specific human rights issues such as 
minority rights. On the one hand, it may contribute to public confusion, contradictions 
and overlap in mandates, or a weakening of the national ombudsman institution. On the 
other hand, a specialized institution would allow for specific expertise and authority in 
addressing certain human rights issues. In any case, taking either direction is crucial for 
the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was recognized that ombudsman institutions form a crucial part of a national human 
rights protection system, which also includes an independent judiciary, the proper 
administration of justice, a representative national parliament and a strong and dynamic 
civil society. Effective cooperation between these elements is indispensable in 
establishing and strengthening the rule of law, protecting human rights, and fighting 
impunity and corruption. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ombudsman institutions should engage in exchanging information on approaches, 
experiences and best practices with international and regional networks and 
international partners which have a specific mandate in this respect. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was recognized that ombudsman institutions in the region operate within a variety of 
mandates and resource limitations. The following recommendations are intended to 
present aspirations in the work of these institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Cooperation between ombudsman institutions and the public administration 
</b></p>
<p>1. To ensure the proper functioning of a democratic society, the public administration should 
have an effective working relationship with ombudsman institutions and operate in the service of 
its citizens. The administration should also be given sufficient space to clarify a situation brought 
to its attention by the ombudsman institution. 
</p>
<p>2. Ombudsman institutions should play an important role in addressing maladministration, 
which is often due to legislative gaps. 
</p>
<p>3. Ombudsman institutions should address maladministration through proposals for 
legislative amendments or capacity building initiatives to improve the quality of the work output 
of public administration staff. 
</p>
<p>4. Ombudsman institutions should play a role in improving the quality of public 
administration through individual complaints-handling, the issuing of special reports, training of 
administrators and personal contact with administrators. 
</p>
<p>5. The public administration should establish a level of cooperation with the ombudsman 
institution that is timely, adequate and responsive to the recommendations submitted to it by the 
ombudsman institution. The public administration is also obliged to cooperate with the 
ombudsman institution by providing it with information and facilitating its investigations. 
</p>
<p>6. Ombudsman institutions should ensure engagement with persons whose rights have been 
violated, through ongoing outreach and awareness-raising activities. 
</p>
<p>7. In the case of a public administration&#8217;s non-compliance with the ombudsman institution&#8217;s 
recommendations, the latter should, where appropriate and after careful consideration, explore 
additional avenues - including the media - to ensure compliance. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The role of parliament as a partner to the ombudsman institution 
</b></p>
<p>8. Parliaments should establish an appropriate legislative framework for the establishment of 
an ombudsman institution, in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>9. Parliaments should ensure the highest standards regarding the election process and 
nomination of the ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>10. Ombudsman institutions should engage in awareness-raising activities for parliamentarians 
on international human rights, as well as the mandate and work of the ombudsman institution. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. Parliaments and ombudsman institutions should develop an effective working relationship 
with the goal of promoting and protecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>12. Parliament should ensure that adequate resources and facilities are provided to the 
ombudsman institution to enable it to perform its functions effectively. 
</p>
<p>13. The ombudsman institution should be under a statutory obligation to submit annual reports 
to Parliament, as well as special reports in cases where a human rights issue requires urgent 
attention. 
</p>
<p>14. The annual and special reports of an ombudsman institution should be sent to Parliament 
and other State entities promptly, so as to increase transparency and awareness. 
</p>
<p>15. The annual and special reports should be debated in Parliament promptly, and the 
Government&#8217;s response to the reports should be tabled in Parliament promptly. 
</p>
<p>16. Parliamentarians should invite the ombudsman to meet with them regularly to discuss 
issues of interest and concern. 
</p>
<p>17. Parliamentarians should ensure that their constituents, or the public at large, are made 
aware of the work of the ombudsman institution. 
</p>
<p>18. Parliamentarians should ensure that part of the mandate of the ombudsman institution is to 
advise Parliament on the conformity or otherwise of any legislation that may affect the 
enjoyment of human rights, and to address cases of maladministration. 
</p><p>19. When its mandate allows, an ombudsman institution should advise Parliament on the 
human rights implications of proposed legislation, constitutional amendments as well as existing 
laws, and recommend any necessary legislative amendments. 
</p>
<p>20. Parliamentarians should ensure that recommendations of the ombudsman institution are 
followed-up. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The role of the ombudsman institution in post-conflict situations or transition 
</b></p>
<p>21. Ombudsman institutions should be endowed with sufficient powers to play an important 
role in the reform and strengthening of law enforcement institutions - including the police and 
prison administrations - and in monitoring the application of standards of good governance. 
</p>
<p>22. Ombudsman institutions should ensure that the administration of justice conforms to 
human rights standards and provides effective remedies, particularly to minorities and the most 
vulnerable groups in society. 
</p>
<p>23. Ombudsman institutions are crucial in developing transitional justice strategies that can 
ensure accountability for past crimes, and in facilitating the creation of effective mechanisms for 
reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>24. Ombudsman institutions play a key role in fighting impunity and addressing critical human 
rights issues such as torture and arbitrary detention. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>25. Ombudsman institutions should play an educative role in the training and public 
awareness-raising of human rights issues in order to foster a culture of human rights 
understanding. 
</p>
<p>26. Ombudsman institutions should consider the investigation of issues related to the root 
causes of past conflicts and human rights violations as a priority. 
</p>
<p>27. Ombudsman institutions should issue recommendations to the Government on how to deal 
with human rights issues that were the cause or proximate cause of past conflicts. 
</p>
<p>28. Ombudsman institutions should pay particular attention to cases concerning persons in 
psychiatric institutions, particularly in a post-conflict environment. 
</p>
<p>29. Ombudsman institutions, especially those in conformity with the Paris Principles, should 
remind the Government of their unique position in fulfilling the role of a preventive mechanism, 
as envisaged under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p><b>D. The role of the ombudsman in protecting the rights 
of minorities and other vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>30. Ombudsman institutions should play an important role in objective mediation between all 
actors concerned and in the promotion of public debate. 
</p>
<p>31. Ombudsman institutions have an investigative and enforcement role through the handling 
of complaints (including between private parties), ex officio investigations, and the provision of 
legal aid and expert opinions. 
</p>
<p>32. Ombudsman institutions have a policy and legislative role through the provision of 
comments and proposed amendments on (draft) legislation, as well as the promotion of the 
ratification and implementation of international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>33. Ombudsman institutions have an educative and information role through the conducting of 
awareness raising campaigns, promotion of public debate, publication and dissemination of 
reports, dissemination of international human rights standards, and the provision of training to 
public officials. 
</p>
<p>34. Ombudsman institutions should also consider raising public awareness and promoting 
social dialogue through the use of the media. 
</p>
<p>35. The ombudsman institution should cooperate, where possible, with civil society in 
educative and awareness-raising activities, the organization of seminars/roundtables on minority 
rights issues, and in receiving complaints through NGOs. 
</p>
<p><b>E. The media&#8217;s cooperation with the ombudsman 
in combating nepotism and corruption 
</b></p>
<p>36. Ombudsman institutions should fight cases of nepotism and corruption in public 
institutions based upon sound and reliable information and, where appropriate, bring a situation 
to the attention of the public at large. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>37. Ombudsman institutions should keep the specific goals of the media in mind - particularly 
the need to appeal to as wide an audience as possible - when relying upon it as a source of 
information. 
</p>
<p>38. Ombudsman institutions should make appropriate use of the media to give additional 
weight to its arguments when addressing public authorities, whilst at the same time ensuring that 
its independence is retained. 
</p>
<p>39. Ombudsman institutions and the media are natural partners that should complement each 
other and be well informed about each other&#8217;s functioning. Ombudsman institutions should also 
make optimal use of the media to raise awareness among the general public about its mandate 
and daily work. </p>

<p><b>FIRST ARAB - EURO REGIONAL CONFERENCE FOR NATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF 
                HUMAN RIGHTS, AMMAN, 18-19 APRIL 2007 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conclusions and Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p> The first Arab - Euro Regional Conference for National Institutions for the Promotion and  
Protection of Human Rights held in Amman was devoted to the theme of protecting human 
rights while countering terrorism. The conference was organized by the National Center for 
Human Rights of Jordan and the Danish Institute for Human Rights. A list of participants of the 
conference is enclosed. 
</p>
<p> The conference was enriched by stimulating presentations by key note speakers from NIs, 
OHCHR and independent experts followed by constructive discussions and deliberations. 
</p>
<p> The first Arab - Euro Regional Conference adopted the following: 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the international bill of human rights and other international human rights 
instruments, freely ratified by states, to promote and protect human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention 
against Torture and its Optional Protocol, the International Convention for the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights underlining the legally binding obligations they impose on state parties and the 
contribution they make to international peace, security and development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the protection and promotion of human rights and the adoption of effective 
counter-terrorism measures are complementary and mutually reinforcing objectives that must be 
pursued together as part of the states&#8217; responsibility to protect, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>guidance and jurisprudence on the protection and promotion of human rights 
provided for in human rights treaty bodies and special procedures while countering terrorism, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the principles and recommendations of the Seoul Declaration of 2004 adopted 
by the Seventh International Conference for Nis, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that international human rights instruments contain provisions for the protection 
and promotion of human rights of each individual, and at the same time oblige states to provide 
safety and security for their population, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>that non-derogable human rights are absolute and inalienable and that any 
anti-terrorism measures that have an impact on derogable human rights, must be necessary, 
proportionate and be in conformity with international law and national legislation, including 
ensuring legal safeguards, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that states are obliged to ensure that anti-terrorist measures comply with 
international human rights standards and that National Institutions are mandated to advise their 
governments on compliance with these standards, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the need for non-violent conflict resolution and open, transparent and 
participatory processes in order to respond to terrorism, 
</p>
<p><i> Urge </i>governments, politicians and media to avoid describing the fight against terrorism in 
discriminatory ethnic stereotypes and instead address the root causes and real challenges with 
regard to preventing terrorism, 
</p>
<p><i> Encouraging </i>National Institutions to give priority to interaction with governments and 
other stakeholders regarding anti-terror legislation, its implementation as well as protection of 
human rights defenders <i>and urging </i>governments to pay due attention to advice of NIs and CSO, 
</p>
<p><i> Calling </i>for the use and application of national, regional and international human rights 
standards and mechanisms, in combating terrorism and in this respect strengthening 
collaboration with international and regional organizations such as the UN, including the 
OHCHR, the Council of Europe, EU, the Islamic Conference and the Arab League and other 
institutions, 
</p>
<p><i> Declaring </i>that there is a need for further collaboration, sharing of information and best 
practices, including the development of specific tools, among NIs in the Arab - Euro regions, 
</p>
<p><b>Way forward 
</b></p>
<p> NIs should focus on the respect for rule of law and effective administration of justice in 
line with international human rights treaties. They should carefully study both legislation and 
procedures and their compliance with international standards making full use of international 
human rights mechanisms including the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and the 
special procedures. 
</p>
<p> NIs should demand from the state that counter terrorism legislation is neither enacted in 
haste nor without public scrutiny. NIs should focus on and take steps to prevent violations of 
human rights, in particular non-derogable rights. 
</p>
<p>1. An Arab - Euro working group (WG) should be established consisting of representatives 
from two Arab NIs and two European NIs. A technical advisor of the OHCHR will be requested 
to be actively involved: 
</p>
<p> (a) Exploring possible definitions of terrorism in order to ensure the principle of legality 
and precise legal definition of terrorism. In its deliberations, the WG shall look into ways of 
distinguishing between &#8220;terrorism&#8221; and &#8220;the right of self-determination and legitimate 
resistance&#8221; and take into account work already prepared in this respect; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (b) Developing practical steps and tools that NIs can implement with regard to human 
rights responses to counter-terrorism measures. The WG should in particular consider entering 
into a dialogue with governments and politicians, professional groups such as the police, 
intelligence service, prosecutors, courts and defense lawyers, civil society and the media. 
</p>
<p>2. When working on this topic, NIs should explore the root causes of terrorism in their 
national context and monitor human rights violations in connection with implementation of 
anti-terrorism measures in order to prepare for an Arab - Euro strategy for protection of human 
rights in the implementation of counter terrorism measures. </p>

<p><b>RABAT DECLARATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>THE THIRD CONFERENCE ON THE &#8220;ROLE OF NATIONAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS IN PROMOTING THE INDEPENDENCE OF 
                        THE JUDICIARY IN THE ARAB REGION&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>12-14 November 2007, Rabat, Morocco 
</b></p>
<p> The Advisory Council for Human Rights in Morocco and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights organized the Third Conference on the Role of National 
Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in Promoting the Independence of the Judiciary in the Arab 
Region from 12 to 14 November 2007, in Rabat, Morocco. 
</p>
<p> The Conference aimed at supporting national and regional initiatives to strengthen the role 
of NHRIs and other actors, in promoting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in 
accordance with international human rights norms. 
</p>
<p> The Conference brought together representatives of existing NHRIs in the region, the 
judiciary, regional organizations including the League of Arab States, United Nations, and 
experts on the administration of justice, as well as non-governmental organizations. 
<b>Preamble 
</b></p>
<p><i> We representatives of NHRIs participating in the Conference,  
 Recall the principles of universality, indivisibility and inalienability of human rights as 
well as principles of the Charter of the United Nations; 
 Recall international human rights instruments, which guarantee the right to a fair hearing 
in all proceedings before a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal, notably in 
article 10 of the Universal Declaration for Human Rights, article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, and article 18 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all 
Migrant Workers and members of their Families; 
 Recall regional human rights instruments, principles and guidelines, which guarantee the 
right to a fair hearing before a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal, notably 
in article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Principles and Guidelines 
on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, and the provisions of the 
Arab-Charter for human rights related to the independence of the judiciary; 
 Take note that the protection of international and regional human right instruments to a 
fair hearing, and  normative guidance provided by international and regional principles and 
guidelines, is also applicable to military courts and tribunals and during states of emergency; </i></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Recognize the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary of 1985 as important 
benchmarks to assist Member States in endorsing the independence of the judiciary in the 
Constitution or the law of the country, the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors of 1990, and 
the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers of 1990, which provide protection for the 
independence and professional integrity of lawyers and prosecutors so that they can carry out 
their role in maintaining the rule of law; 
 Recall the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct adopted by the Judicial Integrity 
Group in 2002 and noted by the former Human Rights Commission in 2003, and the Economic 
and Social Council in 2006; 
</i></p>
<p><i> Welcome General Comment No. 32 on article 14 of the ICCPR on the &#8220;Right to equality 
before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial&#8221;, adopted by the Human Rights Committee in 
2007; 
</i></p>
<p><i> Reiterate the importance given to the conformity of the NHRIs with the Principles relating 
to the Status of National Institutions as adopted by the UN General Assembly resolution 48/134, 
on 20 December 1993 (known as &#8220;the Paris Principles&#8221;), and the need to build partnerships 
among NHRIs, governments and non-governmental organizations to promote the administration 
of justice and the rule of law, 
 Note that the Third Conference on the role of NHRIs in Promoting the Independence of the 
Judiciary in the Arab region has identified challenges and gaps in law and practice, as well as 
urgent requirements with regard to the independence of the judiciary in the Arab region; 
 Declare that the NHRIs from the Arab region agree to develop and strengthen regional 
and cross-regional cooperation aiming at exchanging experiences and good practices that 
support their endeavours to promote and protect human rights at the national level and promote 
the independence of the judiciary; 
 Emphasize further the key role of the media in raising public awareness on human rights 
and acknowledging the progress made also by Arab media in dealing with human rights issues; 
</i></p>
<p><b>Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>We recommend: 
</p>
<p>1. Arab States that have not yet established NHRIs to do so in accordance with the Paris 
Principles, to strengthen their independence and effectiveness in law and practice, and to 
endow them with adequate financial resources; 
</p>
<p>2. Arab States to reinforce national legal frameworks to promote and protect human rights, 
the rule of law and an effective administration of justice; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. Arab States, which have not done so, to ratify the core international human rights treaties, 
including Optional Protocols, notably the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, proceed with the ratification of the Arab Charter for Human 
Rights, remove reservations that contradict the essence of the treaties and accept the 
competency of the UN treaty bodies to consider individual complaints; 
</p>
<p>4. Ensuring conformity between international human rights norms and national legislation, 
and follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations of treaty bodies and special 
procedures, as well as observations resulting from the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>5. Strengthening constitutional, legislative and practical measures aiming at ensuring that 
judicial proceedings are conducted fairly in accordance with international norms and that 
the rights of the parties are respected; 
</p>
<p>6. Promoting the independence of the judiciary while adopting national human rights plans of 
action and establishing mechanisms of implementation in partnership with NHRIs, 
governments and non-governmental human rights organizations; 
</p>
<p>7. NHRIs to contribute in developing national strategies comprising activities aiming at 
raising awareness among relevant stakeholders in respecting the independence of the 
judiciary; 
</p>
<p>8. Promote and participate in monitoring cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, including the 
conditions of detention, and observe trials as practical measures to evaluate whether a court 
or tribunal is competent, independent and impartial;  
</p>
<p>9. NHRIs to engage in joint research and analysis to develop indicators and criteria to 
monitor and report on cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, inhumane conditions of 
detention and unfair trial; 
</p>
<p>10. NHRIs to provide effective legal assistance for victims of unfair trial and valuable and 
timely remedies for human rights violations in conformity with international standards and 
within the limits prescribed by the law; and ensure accessible complaint handling 
mechanisms guaranteeing everyone to obtain redress for violations committed during 
judicial proceedings; 
</p>
<p>11. NHRIs to promote public awareness programmes on the rule of law and the administration 
of justice through media outlets and encouraging liaison with the media; 
</p>
<p>12. The League of Arab States to facilitate the procedures of accreditation, as observers, of 
Arab NHRIs and non-governmental organizations to the Arab Permanent Commission for 
Human Rights, and to promote the status and participation of these institutions and 
organizations in the work of the Commission; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The participants in the Conference, finally, 
</p>
<p> Express their gratitude to the Kingdom of Morocco, the Advisory Council for Human 
Rights and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for 
organizing the Third Conference on NHRIs in the Arab region under the auspices of the 
Kingdom of Morocco on the theme of the independence of the judiciary in the Arab region; 
 Praise the Moroccan experience in the area of transitional justice and consider it as 
foremost among the reconciliation, truth and equity committees; 
</p>
<p> Agree on holding the Fourth Conference on common challenges facing the work of NHRIs 
in the Arab region, and elaborating adequate mechanisms to develop their capacities and 
independence in conformity with the Paris Principles and to open a discussion on those 
Principles; 
</p>
<p> Welcome the invitation made by the Algerian National Advisory Commission for 
Protection and Promotion of Human Rights to hold the Fourth Conference in Algiers; 
</p>
<p> Request the Advisory Council for Human Rights in Morocco and the host country to 
submit the recommendations of the present Conference, as an official document to the 
United Nations Human Rights Council. </p>

<p><b>Annex IX 
</b></p>
<p><b>WORKSHOP OF NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
INSTITUTIONS AND TREATY BODIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Geneva, 26-28 November 2007 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Representatives of nine National Human Rights Institutions met with members of four UN 
human rights Treaty Bodies on 26-28 November in Geneva to deepen the discussion that was 
started in Berlin in November 2006 on the interaction of NHRIs and UN human rights Treaty 
Bodies and review current practices. 
</p>
<p>2. The NHRIs present all had recent experience of engaging with the UN human rights Treaty 
Body process. They were from Germany, Guatemala, Ireland, Kenya, Mauritius, Mexico, 
New Zealand, South Africa and South Korea. Members of treaty bodies present were from the 
Human Rights Committee (3), the Committee Against Torture (2), the OPCAT Subcommittee on 
Prevention (1) and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (3). Also present 
were staff of OHCHR, an expert from Bristol University (UK) and representatives of NGOs, 
including the Association for the Prevention of Torture and the International Human Rights 
Service. 
</p>
<p><b>Role of NHRIs 
</b></p>
<p>3. It was noted that NHRIs play three distinct roles: at the national, regional and international 
levels. While NHRIs are the key element of strong national human rights protection systems, the 
international role is critically important. The more NHRI&#8217;s are able to contribute information to, 
participate actively in the international human rights system, and follow up to their 
recommendations, the more they enhance and strengthen their national position. NHRIs and UN 
human rights Treaty Bodies are natural partners in the protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>4. The ICC Sub-Committee on Accreditation acknowledged this international role of NHRIs 
in a General Observation at its meeting in October 2007. It specifically &#8220;highlights the 
importance for NHRIs to engage with the international human rights system &#8211; in particular the 
Human Rights Council and its mechanisms (Special Procedures Mandate Holders) and the 
United Nations Human Rights Treaty Bodies. This means generally NHRIs making an input to, 
participating in these human rights mechanisms, and following up at the national level to the 
recommendations resulting from the international human rights system&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>5. The importance of NHRIs engaging with Indigenous Peoples as part of their involvement 
in treaty body processes was emphasised. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Principal conclusion: Implementing the harmonised approach to NHRIs engagement with 
Treaty Body Processes 
</b></p>
<p>6. Participants shared and reflected on practical experiences of engagement since the Berlin 
meeting. On the basis of these discussions, they <i>endorsed </i>the harmonised approach to NHRI 
engagement with Treaty Body processes agreed upon in Berlin (attached to these conclusions) 
and <i>recommended</i> that NHRIs and treaty bodies work towards its implementation. The increased 
communication and sharing of practices between different UN human rights treaty bodies on 
engaging NHRIs was welcomed, and the Inter Committee Meeting of Treaty Bodies was 
encouraged to continue to focus on harmonising their approach working methods and interaction 
with NHRIs, and prioritise this discussion at the next Inter Committee Meeting of Treaty Bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>Encouraging participation 
</b></p>
<p>7. Treaty Body Secretariats and the National Institutions Unit of the OHCHR were asked to 
actively invite and encourage NHRI&#8217;s to participate in the UN treaty body processes and to 
provide them well in advance with information on the annual programme of consideration of 
state party reports as well as with summaries of previous recommendations by the international 
human rights system by country. Lists of Secretariat focal points for each Committee would also 
be made available. 
</p>
<p>8. They were also asked to provide guidelines on interaction with UN human rights Treaty 
Bodies, rules of procedure, development of reports by NHRIs and NHRI follow-up to concluding 
observations. The use of web technology to inform and familiarise NHRI&#8217;s and others with these 
procedures was supported. 
</p>
<p>9. The availability of an ICC Geneva Representative who could speak on behalf of A status 
NHRIs in UN human rights treaty body sessions was noted and supported. 
</p>
<p>10. The forthcoming publication by the German Institute for Human Rights of a Hand-Book 
on NHRI&#8217;s interacting with the treaty body system was welcomed. 
</p>
<p><b>NHRI and Treaty Bodies: Good Practices  
</b></p>
<p>11. The good practices shared by NHRIs concerning their interaction with Treaty Body 
secretariat staff ahead of the session; with individual members of the Treaty Bodies, their 
participation in informal/formal sessions and then the follow-up action at the national level to 
treaty body concluding observations were commended. Particular emphasis was placed on the 
need to envisage follow up mechanisms by NHRIs to Treaty Bodies recommendations in order 
to ensure oversight to Government action - acknowledging also that it is the State that has the 
primary responsibility for follow up. This included bringing together various national actors, 
such as Parliament, engaging the media, advocating for implementation, monitoring the State 
party&#8217;s response, and providing feedback to the relevant Treaty Body. Especially important was 
also the contribution of NHRIs to the identification of the list of issues to be discussed with the 
State party prior to the consideration of the report as well as their support in sharpening the focus 
of the concluding observations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>NHRIs as advocates for ratification and use of complaints mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>12. It was noted that NHRIs can make an important contribution by advocating for ratification 
of international human rights treaties, optional protocols, removal of reservations and the 
acceptance of treaty provisions relating to individual complaints (such as Article 14 of ICERD 
which has been accepted by only 51 State parties and used by individuals or groups of 
individuals from 9 States parties). 
</p>
<p>13. The role of NHRI&#8217;s in supporting the individual complaints mechanisms of specific UN 
human rights Treaty Bodies was emphasized, including raising public awareness of their 
availability, potentially providing support for petitioners, and monitoring follow up by the State 
party. 
</p>
<p><b>NHRI involvement in OPCAT 
</b></p>
<p>14. Examples of good practice were discussed in relation to the process of establishing 
National Preventive Mechanisms (NPM) under the OPCAT, the role of NHRI&#8217;s, their 
relationship with NGOs, and the importance and complementarity of cooperation between the 
Subcommittee and National Preventive Mechanisms. It was also noted that some NHRIs have 
been identified as the NPM and this in recognition of their independence and adherence to the 
Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b>Dissemination of the conclusions and report 
</b></p>
<p>15. The OHCHR and ICC of NHRIs as well as regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs were 
asked to widely disseminate the conclusions and report of the meeting to NHRI&#8217;s, Treaty Body 
members and States parties, including the harmonised approach to NHRI interaction with treaty 
body processes. In addition, it was pointed out that the report and conclusions of this meeting 
should be circulated by one or more NHRIs with A status as an official document of the Human 
Rights Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Annex X 
</b></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION PAPER ON INTERACTION BETWEEN NATIONAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS AND SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p> The purpose of this document is to identify areas for strengthened interaction between 
national human rights institutions (NHRIs) and Special Procedures (SPs) of the Human Rights 
Council (especially those NHRIs which are fully compliant with the Paris Principles, i.e. with 
A-status ICC accreditation<b>a</b>). NHRIs and SPs have much to gain from each other in performing 
their responsibilities for the promotion and protection of human rights.<b>b</b> 
</p>
<p> At the 12th annual meeting of SP mandate holders (Geneva, 21-25 June 2005), the need 
was recognized to strengthen follow-up to SP recommendations and to enhance their impact at 
the country level. Strengthened cooperation between SPs and NIs in these and other areas can 
make an important contribution to the effectiveness of both SPs and NIs, and to the effective 
realisation of human rights for people everywhere. 
</p>
<p> The potential for successful cooperation between NHRIs and SPs has recently also been 
acknowledged by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Louise 
Arbour, when she addressed the 19th annual meeting of the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights on 
21 March 2007. She mentioned that NHRIs take a pivotal position at the national level as the 
key-stone of a strong national human rights protection system. Moreover, she expressed her 
conviction that NIs are the best relay mechanism at country level to ensure the application of 
international human rights norms, and specifically mentioned the Special Procedures in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p> On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Danish Institute for Human Rights, the 
Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Kyung-wha Kang, also reiterated this on 
3 May 2007 when stating that NHRIs are key dialogue partners to Special Procedure mandate 
holders, contributing to the preparation, implementation and follow up action to country visits. 
</p>
<p> The important and mutually reinforcing role of NHRIs and SPs has been already 
acknowledged in several fora. The Annex to this paper lists areas for strengthened cooperation 
building on existing practices. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>a
</b>  The International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and 
</p>
<p>Protection of Human Rights has an accreditation procedure through which NHRIs are examined 
on their compliance with the international standards for NHRIs, the Paris Principles. Those 
NHRIs deemed to be in full compliance with the Paris Principles receive an A-status 
accreditation. 
<b>b
</b>  NHRIs in this document refer to those national institutions with a constitutional or legislative 
</p>
<p>mandate to protect and/or promote human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Proposals for the interaction between NHRIs and SPs 
</b></p>
<p><b>Country visits: standing invitations and visit requests 
</b></p>
<p>1. NHRIs can encourage the Government to extend a standing invitation to all thematic SPs. 
</p>
<p>2. NHRI can bring specific human rights developments to the attention of the relevant SPs, 
and when warranted encourage them to request a country visit to the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Preparation of a country visit 
</b></p>
<p>3. NHRIs are encouraged to propose reliable and relevant interlocutors, as well as provide 
SPs with relevant background information/materials, including relevant annual or thematic 
human rights reports. 
</p>
<p><b>During a country visit 
</b></p>
<p>4. SPs are encouraged to routinely include in their schedule a meeting with the NHRI. 
</p>
<p>5. NHRIs might be requested to assist in the organization of the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; part of the 
agenda. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendations after a country visit 
</b></p>
<p>6. SPs are encouraged when feasible to involve NHRIs in the process of formulating the 
recommendations, so as to sharpen their focus and specificity. 
</p>
<p>7. SPs could include in their recommendations that an NHRI in full compliance with the Paris 
Principles be set up, that an existing NHRI be strengthened so that it fully complies with 
the Paris Principles, that adequate resources be provided to NHRIs, that an NHRI seeks 
accreditation through the ICC, etc. 
</p>
<p>8. If an SP mandate holder issues a press release or public statement after the country visit, 
NHRIs are encouraged to widely publicize the statement at the national level. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to a country visit 
</b></p>
<p>9. SPs are encouraged to approach NHRIs to widely disseminate and translate the country 
visit report to their national contact network, including selected Government officials, 
Members of Parliament or NGOs and civil society groups. 
</p>
<p>10. SPs might wish to recommend in their country visits report that NHRIs actively monitor 
the follow-up of SP recommendations. 
</p>
<p>11. SPs are encouraged to actively request information from the NHRI in order to assess the 
status of implementation of the recommendations made following a country visit, for 
example through a questionnaire. NHRIs are also encouraged to regularly provide 
information to mandate-holders on the implementation of their recommendations (or lack 
thereof). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. NHRIs are encouraged to take relevant SPs&#8217; recommendations into account when 
submitting opinions, recommendations, proposals and reports to the Government, 
Parliament or other public body. 
</p>
<p>13. NHRIs can act as reliable partners at the national level for the monitoring of any retaliatory 
action against sources of information that have cooperated with a SP during a country visit. 
NHRIs are encouraged to promptly inform OHCHR of such events, for the attention of the 
SP mandate holder. 
</p>
<p>14. NHRIs could organize follow-up seminars, either at the request of SPs or at their own 
initiative, including all the human rights stakeholders as well as the SP mandate holder. 
</p>
<p>15. NHRIs are encouraged to take relevant SPs&#8217; recommendations into account when 
preparing their work-plan and when assisting in the formulation of National Human Rights 
Action Plans and in other human rights related programming activities. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications 
</b></p>
<p>16. The SP can make use of an NHRI as (1) a reliable and available source of information; 
(2) a potentially good partner to verify the accurateness of information obtained from other 
sources; and (3) an effective intermediary to obtain information from third parties. 
</p>
<p>17. In case of an anticipated or ongoing human rights violation, NHRIs can act as an important 
link for early warning and may bring such situations to the attention of the SP for their 
action. 
</p>
<p>18. Because of their mandate regarding existing or draft legislation, NHRIs are optimally 
placed to flag relevant (draft) laws to the SP, who may act upon this information. 
</p>
<p><b>Protection capacity 
</b></p>
<p>19. Whenever an NHRI is under threat, relevant SPs could act to protect it through 
communications or other measures. 
</p>
<p>20. SPs could make effective use of regional networks of NHRIs to mobilize public opinion to 
address particular human rights issues. 
</p>
<p><b>Thematic studies 
</b></p>
<p>21. NHRIs could bring a specific situation to the attention of the relevant SP and suggest 
specific issues be the subject of, or be included in a thematic study. NHRIs can also be 
approached with a further request for information or the dissemination of a questionnaire 
among the national contacts of the NHRI for the preparation of thematic studies. 
</p>
<p>22. NHRIs can organize thematic conferences or seminars and invite the relevant SP mandate 
holders to attend. 
</p>
<p>23. Thematic studies should be more systematically shared with NHRIs, so that their 
conclusions may be taken into account by NHRIs when formulating legislative proposals. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>International meetings 
</b></p>
<p>24. Those NHRIs which are in compliance with the Paris Principles (having received an 
A-status by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights) could attend sessions of the Human Rights 
Council and make an oral statement during the interactive dialogue after the presentation 
by the relevant SP mandate holder. 
</p>
<p>25. The 14th Annual Meeting of SPs could recommend that interaction between SPs and 
NHRIs be discussed on a regular basis during the Annual Meeting. When feasible, NHRIs 
should have a regular interaction with SPs at their Annual Meeting. This would provide for 
a venue to discuss and identify best practices and lessons learned.
