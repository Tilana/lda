<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment submits his third report to the Human Rights Council. In chapter II he summarizes 
his activities between August and December 2008 (the period since the submission of his interim 
report to the General Assembly (A/63/175), including updates on country visits, future visits and 
pending requests for invitations, and highlights of key presentations and meetings. In chapter III, 
the Special Rapporteur focuses on the compatibility of the death penalty with the prohibition of 
cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. He concludes that the historic interpretation of the 
right to personal integrity and human dignity in relation to the death penalty is increasingly 
challenged by the dynamic interpretation of this right in relation to corporal punishment and the 
inconsistencies deriving from the distinction between corporal and capital punishment, as well as 
by the universal trend towards the abolition of capital punishment. The Special Rapporteur 
invites the Council to request a comprehensive legal study on the compatibility of the death 
penalty with the right to personal integrity and human dignity. In chapter IV, he discusses a 
human rights-based approach to drug policies, concluding that drug users are often subjected to 
discriminatory treatment and that States have a positive obligation to ensure the same access to 
prevention and treatment in places of detention as outside them. He recommends that the Council 
take up the question of drug policies in the light of international obligations in the area of human 
rights at a future session. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, the third by the current mandate holder, is submitted in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 8/8. 
</p>
<p>2. Chapter I contains a summary of the activities of the Special Rapporteur between August 
and December 2008, since the submission of his interim report to the General Assembly 
(A/63/175). In chapter III, the Special Rapporteur focuses on the relationship between the death 
penalty and the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. In chapter IV, he raises 
questions relating to a human rights-based approach to drug policies. 
</p>
<p>3. The summary of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur from 15 December 2007 
to 14 December 2008 and the replies received thereto from Governments by 31 December 2008 
are found in document A/HRC/10/44/Add.1. Document A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 contains a 
summary of the information provided by Governments and non-governmental organizations on 
the implementation of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur following his country 
visits. With regard to addendum 2, the Special Rapporteur wishes to state that, starting with the 
present report, the format of the follow-up report has been modified with the aim of rendering it 
more reader-friendly and of facilitating the identification of the steps taken in response to 
recommendations. For this reason, follow-up tables have been created containing the 
recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, a brief description of the situation when the country 
visit was made, an overview of steps taken in previous years and included in previous follow-up 
reports, and more detailed information on the specific measures taken in the current year. These 
tables are submitted to the respective Governments for their input and comments before the 
report is published. Documents A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 and 4 are reports of country visits to 
Denmark and the Republic of Moldova, respectively. Document A/HRC/10/44/Add.5 is a 
preliminary note on his visit to Equatorial Guinea. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR

</p>
<p><b>III. THE DEATH PENALTY IN LIGHT OF THE PROHIBITION 
OF CRUEL, INHUMAN AND DEGRADING PUNISHMENT 
</b></p>
<p>29. During the interactive dialogue on the report of the Special Rapporteur (A/63/175) before 
the General Assembly, the representative of France, on behalf of the European Union, asked 
whether or not the death penalty was compatible with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment under international law in the present section, the Special Rapporteur 
seeks to explore different angles of this issue on the basis of political and legal trends and the 
jurisprudence of a variety of international, regional and monitoring bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Trend towards the abolition of capital punishment 
</b></p>
<p>30. To date, the death penalty has been primarily addressed in relation to the right to life. This 
is not surprising, as capital punishment has been regulated in international treaty law as an 
explicit exception to the right to life. Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights 
of 1950 stipulates only one condition for capital punishment to be in conformity with the right to 
life, namely that the accused is sentenced by a court following his (or her) conviction of a crime 
for which this penalty is provided by law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights is more demanding; four of the six paragraphs of article 6 dealing with the right to life are 
devoted to capital punishment. The death penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final 
judgement of a competent court, arrived at in accordance with the minimum guarantees of a fair 
trial and other provisions of the Covenant; it can only be applied for the most serious crimes, in 
accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime; it should not be 
applied for crimes committed by persons below 18 years of age; it should not be carried out on 
pregnant women; and anyone sentenced to death should have the right to seek pardon or 
commutation of the sentence. In addition, article 6 (2) and (6) clearly convey the message that 
the Covenant promoted the abolition of capital punishment and that abolitionist States parties are </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>prevented from reintroducing it. Article 4 of the American Convention on Human Rights<b>1</b> builds 
on the Covenant but develops it further. It explicitly requires abolitionist States not to re-
establish the death penalty; prohibits capital punishment for political offences or related common 
crimes; and prohibits its imposition on persons who, at the time the crime was committed, were 
over 70 years of age. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, in its article 37 (a), requires 
States parties to ensure that capital punishment is not imposed for offences committed by 
persons younger than 18 years of age. 
</p>
<p>31. The trend towards the abolition of capital punishment has also led to various protocols to 
the above-mentioned treaties, which in effect amount to respective amendments of the right to 
life for the States parties to such protocols. The sixth and thirteenth Additional Protocols to the 
European Convention on Human Rights, adopted in 1983 and 2002, respectively, call for the 
general prohibition of capital punishment, in times of both peace and war. Both the Council of 
Europe and the European Union made it a requirement for States wishing to join their respective 
organizations that they abolish capital punishment. For these reasons, Europe (with the exception 
of Belarus) today is a death penalty-free zone. Similarly, the Organization of American States, 
by means of the adoption of the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to 
Abolish the Death Penalty of 1990, clearly aim at its abolition, and Latin American States, with 
the exception of Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica, are abolitionist. In the same year, 
the United Nations adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty. Although only a limited number of States 
in effect became parties to these two protocols, they encouraged many States in all regions of the 
world to abolish capital punishment progressively, either de jure or at least de facto. When the 
United Nations was founded in 1945, only a small minority of seven States in the world had 
abolished the death penalty in law or practice.<b>2</b> At November 2008, this number had increased to 
a total of 141 States from all regions of the world.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>32. The trend towards abolition of capital punishment is also reflected by the fact that, even for 
the most horrible crimes, such as war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, 
international criminal law does not allow for the death penalty. Whereas the main war criminals 
of World War II had been sentenced to death by the military tribunals of Nuremberg and Tokyo, 
the Statutes of the International Criminal Court and of the ad hoc criminal tribunals established 
by the Security Council deliberately excluded capital punishment. Also, the Commission on 
Human Rights encouraged this trend in various resolutions. Before it was replaced by the Human 
Rights Council, the Commission in its last resolution 2005/59, called upon States that still 
maintained the death penalty to abolish it completely and, in the meantime, to establish a 
moratorium on executions. To date, the Council has not taken up this issue. In December 2007, 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1

</p>
<p>countries. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>however, the General Assembly adopted resolution 62/149 in which it envisaged that the Council 
could continue to work on this issue, and in which it called upon all States that maintained the 
death penalty to progressively restrict its use, to reduce the number of offences for which it may 
be imposed, and to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death 
penalty.<b>4</b> In addition, the Assembly called upon States that had abolished the death penalty not to 
reintroduce it and requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on the use of capital 
punishment based upon information to be provided by all States. Resolution 62/149 was 
reaffirmed by the Assembly in December 2008 with a slightly stronger majority.<b>5</b> In subsequent 
reports (A/63/293, paras. 14 and 69), the Secretary-General confirmed that there is a trend 
towards abolition. In addition, in November 2008, the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights adopted a resolution calling on African States to observe a moratorium on the 
death penalty.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>33. Despite the above non-binding resolutions of the highest political body of the 
United Nations and the clear trend towards abolition under international treaty law and practice, 
this legal analysis must conclude that, for States that have not yet ratified the Second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the respective protocols to 
the European and American Conventions on Human Rights, the further use of the death penalty 
does not constitute a violation of the right to life. This conclusion does, however, not provide a 
legal response to the question raised above, namely whether capital punishment is to be 
considered cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment in the sense of article 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or article 16 of the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>34. Traditionally, this question has been negated on the basis of a systematic and historical 
interpretation of the Covenant and comparable regional human rights treaties. The legal 
reasoning seems to be compelling: how can a certain practice be considered a violation of a 
specific provision of a treaty if it is explicitly permitted by another provision of the same treaty? 
Whereas this line of argument was certainly correct at the time when the human rights treaties 
were adopted, when the clear majority of States did not consider the death penalty cruel, 
inhuman or degrading, however, is it still compelling today? Would it not be more appropriate to 
interpret the meaning of &#8220;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment&#8221; in the light of 
the present-day understanding of these words by Governments around the world? Human rights 
are a rapidly developing concept and most international and regional treaty monitoring bodies 
apply a dynamic interpretation of human rights treaty law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Evolution of the prohibition of corporal punishment 
</b></p>
<p>35. The prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment has been interpreted in a 
dynamic manner in relation to the question of corporal punishment. Corporal punishment may be 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  A total of 104 States voted in favour of the resolution, 54 against and 29 abstained. 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  A total of 105 States voted in favour of the resolution, 48 against and 31 abstained. 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  See final communiqu&#233; of the forty-fourth ordinary session of the African Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, held in Abuja from 10 to 24 November 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>compared to capital punishment in the sense that, even apart from the physical pain and suffering 
it might cause, over the last decades it has evolved to be considered a direct assault on the 
dignity of a person and therefore prohibited by international law. When the European 
Convention was adopted in 1950, corporal punishment, as capital punishment, was widely 
accepted in European societies, in particular as chastisement in the family and as disciplinary 
punishment in schools, prisons, the military and similar institutions. In other words, these 
comparatively lenient forms of corporal punishment were not regarded as cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment by most European States. This attitude significantly changed, however, 
during the 1960s and 1970s. Consequently, the European Court of Human Rights, in the 
landmark judgement of <i>Tyrer v. UK</i>, decided in 1978 by a dynamic interpretation of article 3 of 
the European Convention on Human Rights that birching of a juvenile, a traditional punishment 
on the Isle of Man, was no longer compatible with a modern understanding of human rights in 
Europe. Referring to the European Convention as a &#8220;living instrument&#8221; that needed to be 
&#8220;interpreted in light of present-day conditions&#8221;, the Court considered birching degrading 
punishment.<b>7</b> Only four years later, the Human Rights Committee, in its general comment on the 
prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, expressed the 
unanimous opinion that the prohibition in article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights must extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement as an 
educational or disciplinary measure (para. 2). In 2000, this opinion was confirmed in the 
individual case of <i>Osbourne v. Jamaica</i>, which concerned the judicial sentence of 10 strokes 
with a tamarind switch on naked buttocks in the presence of 25 prison warders. In a unanimous 
decision, the Committee stated that, irrespective of the nature of the crime to be punished, 
however brutal it might be, corporal punishment constituted cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment or punishment contrary to article 7 of the Covenant.<b>8</b> This constant case law of the 
European Court of Human Rights and the Human Rights Committee has also been confirmed by 
the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights,<b>9</b> the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and national courts,<b>10</b> as well as by the practice of other monitoring 
bodies, including the Committee against Torture<b>11</b> and the Special Rapporteur on torture.<b>12</b>

cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.

</p>
<p>36. When the Declaration on Violence against Women was adopted in 1993, the prohibition of 
corporal punishment was extended to the private sphere of the family; in other words, an 
obligation was imposed on States to adopt legislative and other measures to protect women 
against domestic violence, including corporal punishment.<b>13</b> In addition, the positive obligation 
of States to effectively prohibit and prevent corporal punishment of children has been confirmed 
by various monitoring bodies, including the Committee on the Rights of the Child in relation to 
article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child<b>14</b> and the European Committee of Social 
Rights in relation to the explicit provision in article 17 of the revised European Social Charter.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>37. Since corporal punishment in all its forms, as a judicial or criminal sanction, whether 
imposed by State authorities or by private actors, including schools and parents, has been 
qualified by all relevant intergovernmental human rights monitoring bodies as cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment, it follows that, under present international law, corporal punishment can 
no longer be justified, not even under the most exceptional situations. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Capital punishment in the light of the prohibition of cruel, 
inhuman and degrading punishment 
</b></p>
<p>38. The question therefore arises whether this legal reasoning should not be equally applied to 
capital punishment. After all, is capital punishment not an aggravated form of corporal 
punishment? If the amputation of limbs is considered cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, 
how can beheading then be qualified differently? If even comparatively lenient forms of corporal 
punishment, such as 10 strokes on the buttocks, are absolutely prohibited under international 
human rights law, how can hanging, the electric chair, execution by a firing squad and other 
forms of capital punishment ever be justified under the very same provisions? 
39. Interestingly enough, the jurisprudence of international human rights monitoring bodies 
is much less clear in relation to capital punishment than it is in relation to corporal punishment. 
Even the European Court of Human Rights, which already in 1989 had found the 
death row-phenomenon in Virginia to constitute inhuman or degrading punishment,<b>16</b> never 
arrived at the conclusion that capital punishment per se violates article 3 of the European

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Convention.<b>17</b> The Human Rights Committee followed the systematic interpretation of the rights 
to life and personal integrity originally developed by the European Court,<b>18</b> although it 
increasingly realized the inconsistency between its approaches towards corporal and capital 
punishment. This became most evident in its jurisprudence concerning different methods of 
execution. All members agreed that certain methods, such as stoning to death, which 
intentionally prolong pain and suffering, amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. But 
opinions differ considerably as to which methods of execution can still be considered &#8220;humane&#8221; 
today. In <i>Kindler v. Canada</i>, the majority held in 1993 that execution by lethal injection, as 
practised in Pennsylvania, did not amount to inhuman punishment.<b>19</b> The United States Supreme 
Court arrived at a similar conclusion in 2008.<b>20</b> On the other hand, in its views on <i>Ng v. Canada</i> 
in 1993, the majority of the Human Rights Committee found that execution by gas asphyxiation, 
as practised until recently in California, did amount to cruel and inhuman treatment and, as a 
consequence, Canada had violated article 7 of the Covenant by having extradited the applicant to 
the United States.<b>21</b> In <i>Staselovich v. Belarus</i>, the Committee found execution by a firing squad 
to be in conformity with article 7 of the Covenant, but at the same time held that the failure of 
the authorities to notify the mother of the scheduled date for the execution of her son and their 
subsequent persistent failure to notify her of the location of her son&#8217;s grave amounted to 
inhuman treatment vis-&#224;-vis the mother.<b>22</b> The Inter-American Court on Human Rights, referring 
to the Soering case before the European Court of Human Rights, found in the decision of <i>Hilaire 
and others v. Trinidad and Tobago</i> that the fact that the victims in detention may be taken out of 
the cell to be hanged at any moment or compelled to live under circumstances that impinge on 
their physical and psychological integrity constituted cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.<b>23</b> 
Along similar lines, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
stated in a report submitted to the Council on transparency and the imposition of the death 
penalty that the practice of informing death row prisoners of their impending execution only 
moments before they die, and families only later, was &#8220;inhuman and degrading&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 32).

</p>
<p>40. Another controversial issue concerns the death row phenomenon. In 1993, the Judicial 
Committee of the Privy Council of the British House of Lords held in <i>Pratt and Morgan v. 
Attorney General of Jamaica</i> that any detention on death row for more than five years violated 
the constitutional prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment.<b>24</b> The Human Rights 
Committee criticized this approach by stating that the case law of the Privy Council &#8220;conveys a 
message to States parties retaining the death penalty that they should carry out a capital sentence 
as expeditiously as possible after it was imposed. This is not a message the Committee would 
wish to convey to States parties. Life on death row, harsh as it may be, is preferable to death&#8221;.<b>25</b> 
Consequently, even in cases of detention on death row for more than 10 years, the Committee 
maintained its jurisprudence of not finding a violation of article 7 of the Covenant unless death 
row was aggravated by particularly harsh prison conditions.<b>26</b>  
</p>
<p><b>D.  The death penalty and human dignity 
</b></p>
<p>41. The differing views reached by the Human Rights Committee and other authorities in 
grappling with the question whether detention on death row and of various methods of execution 
are compatible with the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment 
suggest the need for a different, more fundamental approach to the matter. Again, useful 
guidance is provided by the reasons for the finding that corporal punishment amounts to cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment. In reaching this conclusion, the international human rights 
monitoring bodies did not examine the suffering caused by physical chastisement itself. On the 
contrary, in <i>Tyrer v. United Kingdom</i>, the European Court explicitly found that, although the 
applicant did not suffer any severe or long-lasting physical effects, his punishment whereby he 
was treated as an object in the power of authorities constituted an assault on precisely that which 
is one of the main purposes of article 3 to protect, namely a person&#8217;s dignity and physical 
integrity.<b>27</b> The same idea was expressed at about the same time by Supreme Court judge Justice 
Brennan with regard to the death penalty: &#8220;The fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment of 
death is that it treats members of the human race as non-humans, as objects to be toyed with and

</b>  Judgement of 2 November 1993 (2 AC 1). 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  Decision of 22 March 1996 in <i>Errol Johnson v. Jamaica</i>, Comm. No. 588/1994, para. 8.4. 
</p>
<p><b>26
</b>  See for example the decisions in <i>La Vende and Bickaroo v. Trinidad and Tobago</i>, Comm. 
</p>
<p>Nos. 554 and 555/1993; and <i>Francis v. Jamaica</i>, communication No. 606/1994. 
<b>27
</b></p>
<p>  The African Commission approvingly quoted this judgement in <i>Curtis Francis Doebbler v. 
Sudan </i>and added &#8220;There is no right for individuals, and particularly the Government of a country 
to apply physical violence to individuals for offences. Such a right would be tantamount to 
sanctioning State-sponsored torture under the Charter and contrary to the very nature of this 
human rights treaty.&#8221; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>discarded. [It is] thus inconsistent with the fundamental premise of the clause [prohibiting cruel 
and unusual punishment] that even the vilest criminal remains a human being possessed of 
common human dignity.&#8221;<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>42. This perspective on the death penalty as primarily a question of human dignity appears to 
underlie also the most important pronouncement of the international community on the death 
penalty. In its resolution 62/149, in which it called upon all States to establish a moratorium on 
executions with a view to abolish the death penalty, the General Assembly justified this by 
stating that the use of the death penalty undermined human dignity. Although the notion of 
human dignity underpins the development of human rights in general, this statement can be 
interpreted as implying that the clear majority of States Members of the United Nations today 
consider that the death penalty violates the right to not be subjected to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment. 
</p>
<p>43. In this respect, it is also particularly noteworthy that the absolute prohibition of the death 
penalty against juvenile offenders in the Convention on the Rights of the Child is contained in 
article 37 (a), the provision prohibiting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
and not in article 6 on the inherent right to life. 
</p>
<p>44. The Committee against Torture has not yet developed a clear legal reasoning as to whether 
capital punishment per se constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, nor has it 
pronounced itself in the individual complaints procedure on the compatibility of capital 
punishment with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment in article 16 of the 
Convention against Torture. The Committee has, however, repeatedly called on States parties in 
the State reporting procedure to abolish capital punishment.<b>29</b>  
</p>
<p>45. At the national level, a significant number of courts of last instance and constitutional 
courts have found that the death penalty per se violates the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment.<b>30</b> One of the most convincing legal opinions to this effect was developed

<p>by the South African Constitutional Court in the landmark judgement of <i>State v. Makwanyane

case law of international human rights monitoring bodies at that time and then arrived at the firm 
conclusion that capital punishment in any case must be regarded as cruel, inhuman and 
degrading punishment. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>46.<b> What conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of developments pertaining to the 
death penalty in the light of the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment? In 
principle, the answer to the legal question posed by the French delegate in the 
General Assembly depends on the interpretation of the words &#8220;cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment&#8221; in article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and similar provisions in other international and regional human 
rights treaties. Traditionally, States and human rights monitoring bodies followed a 
systematic and historic interpretation of the right to personal integrity and human dignity 
in conjunction with the right to life, which explicitly contains an exception for capital 
punishment. This interpretation is in line with article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the 
Law of Treaties, which stipulates that provisions of international treaties should be 
interpreted in their context. At the time of the adoption of the respective treaties, this was a 
fully legitimate method of interpretation. 
</b></p>
<p>47.<b> International human rights monitoring bodies and domestic courts, however, 
developed and effectively apply a dynamic interpretation of the provisions of human rights 
treaty law. They consider human rights treaties &#8220;living instruments&#8221; that need to be 
interpreted in the light of present-day conditions. The application of this method of 
interpretation to the right to personal integrity and human dignity by regional human 
rights courts and universal treaty monitoring bodies has the effect that corporal 
punishment, which was not regarded as cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment at the 
time of the adoption of the respective treaties, is today considered such. Consequently, 
States that still practise corporal punishment as a judicial or disciplinary measure or that 
do not take effective legislative and other measures to prohibit and prevent corporal 
punishment in the private sphere are found to violate the absolute prohibition of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading punishment. Although the systematic interpretation of international 
human rights treaties has to date prevented regional and universal treaty monitoring 
bodies from applying the same dynamic interpretation of the right to personal integrity 
and human dignity to the death penalty, this legal reasoning is increasingly being 
challenged by obvious inconsistencies deriving from the distinction between corporal and 
capital punishment and by the universal trend towards the abolition of capital punishment.

</b></p>
<p><b>IV.  APPLYING A HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH TO 
DRUG POLICIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International drug policies and human rights: two separate issues 
</b></p>
<p>49. A number of human rights have been affected by how drug control policies are currently 
shaped, both at the international and national levels. This is particularly true for the two ends of 
the &#8220;drug continuum&#8221;, which share the brunt of the burden of current drug-control policies: the 
production side, because those who cultivate the plants used to produce narcotic drugs depend on 
them for their livelihood; and the consumer side (currently 26 million people - about 0.6 per cent 
of the planet&#8217;s adult population), because it runs a greatly increased risk of discrimination, 
criminalization and, as a result, of falling victim to a large range of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>50. Contemporary drug policies have also diverted attention, and much-needed resources, from 
the public health sphere. For instance, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the main 
United Nations department working on drug control, in its World Drug Report 2008, concluded 
that &#8220;public health, the first principle of drug control, has receded from that position, 
overshadowed by the concern with public security&#8221;.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>51. While the three major conventions relating to drugs, although referring to prevention and 
rehabilitation,<b>33</b> left it to individual States to devise their policies in this area, the international 
drug control system has evolved practically detached from the United Nations human rights 
machinery, which could have provided valuable guidance on how the above references should be 
interpreted, taking into account international human rights norms. As a result, only in 1998 did 
the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Demand Reduction include a reference to human 
rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and highlighted principles such as 
participation of the community, sensitivity to culture and gender.<b>34</b> In addition, the annual 
General Assembly resolutions on countering the world drug problem include references to 
human rights and the Charter of the United Nations.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>

</b>  See the &#8220;second unintended consequence&#8221; in the World Drug Report 2008, p. 216.

</b>  For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, arts. 36.1.b and 38; the 
</p>
<p>Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, arts. 20 and 22; and the United Nations 
Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988,

<p>  General Assembly resolution S-20/3, annex, para. 8. 
<b>35
</b></p>
<p>  For example, General Assembly resolution 62/176, para. 1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>52. In spite of the principles and the calls of the General Assembly, when describing 
international drug control in 2008, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime still stated that 
&#8220;a system appears to have been created in which those who fall into the web of addiction find 
themselves excluded and marginalized from the social mainstream, tainted with a moral stigma, 
and often unable to find treatment even when motivated to seek it&#8221;.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>53. In the present section the Special Rapporteur looks at a number of areas where torture and 
ill-treatment occur as a direct or indirect result of current approaches to drug control and makes 
recommendations on how the gap between the two parallel universes<b>37</b> could be bridged. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Drugs and the right to personal integrity and human dignity 
</b></p>
<p>54. The linkages between drugs and the right to personal integrity and human dignity have not 
previously been exposed in a systematic way, in particular not from a torture/ill-treatment 
perspective. One of the factors contributing to this is the limited access to justice for drug users, 
which goes hand in hand with the criminalization and marginalization to which they are 
subjected in many contexts. Similarly, they appear to have had little access to regional and 
international mechanisms. However, links between drugs and ill-treatment have many faces, 
extreme examples being the use of drugs to blunt fear and pain in child soldiers,<b>38</b> or drugging to 
make people compliant or to obtain information.<b>39</b> In the present section, the Special Rapporteur 
will look at two areas in more depth: drug users in the context of the criminal justice system and 
situations resulting from restricted access to drugs for palliative care. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Drug users in the criminal justice system 
</b>55. The Special Rapporteur, in the course of several of his country visits, has noted the 
challenges posed to criminal justice systems by punitive drug policies, in terms of sheer number 
but also of the special needs of drug users in detention. In Indonesia, about 35 per cent of the 
prison population are in detention on charges related to drug crimes. The use of, and dealing in, 
drugs within correctional institutions constitutes a major problem.<b>40</b> In this regard, the Special

<p>Rapporteur also refers to other United Nations human rights mechanisms that have 
expressed concerns about the severity of penalties relating to narcotics offences.<b>41</b>  
</p>
<p>56. Some of the problems faced by drug users in the criminal justice system with regard to 
ill-treatment are examined below. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Lack of access to medical treatment and drug substitutes during detention 
</b></p>
<p>57. Drug users are particularly vulnerable when deprived of their liberty. One of the questions 
in this context concerns withdrawal symptoms and to what extent they may qualify as torture or 
ill-treatment. There can be no doubt that withdrawal symptoms can cause severe pain and 
suffering if not alleviated by appropriate medical treatment, and the potential for abuse of 
withdrawal symptoms, in particular in custody situations, is evident. In a 2003 case, without 
specifically stating that the woman died from withdrawal, the European Court of Human Rights 
found a violation of the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment based on 
&#8220;the responsibility owed by prison authorities to provide the requisite medical care for detained 
persons&#8221;.<b>42</b> Moreover, if withdrawal symptoms are used for any of the purposes cited in 
definition of torture enshrined in article 1 of the Convention against Torture, this might amount 
to torture. 
</p>
<p>58. Also at later stages of detention, access of detainees to medical treatment, including access 
to opioid substitution therapy, is often severely restricted. Whereas the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and UNAIDS all concur 
that the therapy is the most effective intervention available for the treatment of opioid 
dependence and a critical component of efforts to prevent the spread of HIV among injecting 
drug users,<b>43</b> that it considerably reduces mortality and epidemics among drug users and that it 
improves uptake and adherence to antiretroviral treatment for HIV-positive opiate drug users,<b>44</b>

<p>in some developing and transitional countries, the most effective treatments for opiate addiction 
are available to fewer than 1 per cent of those in need. According to recent reports, only in 
33 countries, persons in detention have access to the therapy<b>45</b> (this does not mean generalized 
access, but availability in at least one prison). 
</p>
<p>59. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall the WHO/United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime Principles of Drug Dependence Treatment of March 2008,<b>46</b> which explicitly 
refer to the need to view drug dependence as any other health-care condition, in terms of the 
standards of ethical treatment and stress that drug addicts enjoy the right to autonomy and 
privacy. Access to treatment and care services needs to be ensured also for the patients not 
motivated to stop drug use or relapsing after treatment, as well as during detention periods in 
prison. The principles also emphasize that drug dependence treatment should in general be 
voluntary and that, if it is part of State-imposed penal sanctions, the patient should have the 
possibility to reject treatment. The Special Rapporteur underlines the requirement of consent in 
this respect and recalls that the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interpreted 
article 12 of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to include &#8220;the right to be 
free from [&#8230;] non-consensual medical treatment and experimentation&#8221; and stressed that States 
had the obligation to refrain from applying coercive medical treatments, unless on an exceptional 
basis in line with applicable international standards.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  High risk of infection with HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>60. On average, 1 of every 10 new HIV infections is caused by injected drug use, and in some 
countries and regions, this percentage is much higher. According to WHO, of all new HIV 
infections in Eastern Europe and Central Asia in 2005, 67 per cent were due to injection drug 
use.<b>48</b> The Reference Group to the United Nations on HIV and Injecting Drug Use concluded 
that 1 in 5 of the 15.9 million injecting drug users could be HIV-positive; in addition, nine 
countries have HIV rates among injecting drug users of 40 per cent or more. In his report of 
March 2007 (A/61/816) the Secretary-General stated that estimates from 94 low- and 
middle-income countries show that the proportion of injecting drug users receiving some type of 
prevention services was 8 per cent in 2005, and observed that this indicates &#8220;virtual neglect of 
this most-at-risk population&#8221;.<b>49</b>

<p>61. Whereas these figures reflect the situation in society at large, they are normally 
exacerbated when it comes to persons deprived of their liberty since places of detention create 
high-risk settings from the point of view of HIV, because of higher rates of HIV, high prevalence 
of risky-behaviour, including injecting drug use and sharing of injecting equipment, and sexual 
activity.<b>50</b> The criminalization of drug use and of syringes may contribute to this heightened risk.  
At the same time, although there is strong evidence that needle and syringe programmes play a 
crucial role in the prevention of HIV infection, only in eight countries do prisoners have access 
to such programmes.<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners, approved by the Economic and Social Council in its resolutions 663 C 
(XXIV) and 2076 (LXII), fully apply to drug users, in particular rule 22 (2), which requires that 
detainees have access to specialist treatment. He also refers to a 2006 case, <i>Khudobin v. Russia</i>, 
where the European Court of Human Rights found that the absence of medical assistance of a 
HIV-positive prisoner, in the given context, amounted to degrading treatment.<b>52 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.  Forcible testing for HIV or hepatitis C 
</b></p>
<p>63. Since drug users carry a higher risk of contracting blood-borne viruses, often owing to the 
unavailability of sterile injecting equipment, in many countries they are also disproportionately 
subjected to forcible testing, in particular with regard to HIV and hepatitis C. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, in general, testing must be voluntary and based on informed consent. In 
particular cases and circumstances, however, forcible testing may be necessary, such as for the 
purpose of obtaining evidence in court proceedings, but only if the necessary safeguards are in 
place.<b>53</b>

<b>52
</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;[T]he applicant was HIV-positive and suffered from a serious mental disorder. This 
increased the risks associated with any illness he suffered during his detention and intensified his 
fears on that account. In these circumstances the absence of qualified and timely medical 
assistance, added to the authorities&#8217; refusal to allow an independent medical examination of his 
state of health, created such a strong feeling of insecurity that, combined with his physical 
sufferings, it amounted to degrading treatment within the meaning of 
Article 3&#8221;, 26 October 2006, para. 96. 
<b>53
</b></p>
<p>  <i>Saunders v. the UK</i>, judgement of the European Court for Human Rights, 17 December 1996, 
paras. 69-74. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>64. If testing is indispensable, the way in which it is undertaken needs to be least intrusive and 
respect the dignity of the person subjected to the testing. In this context, a case before the 
European Court of Human Rights is of interest, even though it concerns the process of securing 
evidence.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>65. If forcible testing is done on a discriminatory basis without respecting consent and 
necessity requirements, it may constitute degrading treatment, especially in a detention setting. 
Therefore, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the clear language used in the UNAIDS/WHO 
policy statement on HIV testing of 2004, regarding consent, which requires that, in order to be 
able to provide informed consent, the patients should at a minimum be informed of the clinical 
benefit and the prevention benefits of testing, their right to refuse, the follow-up services that 
will be offered and, in the event of a positive test result, the importance of anticipating the need 
to inform anyone at ongoing risk who would otherwise not suspect they were being exposed to 
HIV infection.<b>55</b> The statement also mentions the right to confidentiality, which, if not respected, 
might raise concerns regarding inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Use of the death penalty and discriminatory treatment in  
the administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, in some countries, drug offences are punishable 
by the death penalty and consequently convicts are held on death row or sentenced to 
life-imprisonment. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 6 on the right to 
life, clearly stated that, under article 6 (2), States were obliged to restrict the application of the 
death penalty to the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, which does not include drug-related crimes.<b>56</b> This 
position has been reiterated by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions.<b>57</b> In the Special Rapporteur on torture&#8217;s view, drug offences do not meet the 
threshold of most serious crimes. Therefore, the imposition of the death penalty on drug 
offenders amounts to a violation of the right to life, discriminatory treatment and possibly, as 
stated above, also their right to human dignity. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>54
</b>  &#8220;The authorities subjected the applicant to a grave interference with his physical and mental 
</p>
<p>integrity against his will. They forced him to regurgitate, not for therapeutic reasons, but in order 
to retrieve evidence they could equally have obtained by less intrusive methods. The manner in 
which the impugned measure was carried out was liable to arouse in the applicant feelings of 
fear, anguish and inferiority that were capable of humiliating and debasing him. Furthermore, the 
procedure entailed risks to the applicant&#8217;s health, not least because of the failure to obtain a 
proper anamnesis beforehand. Although this was not the intention, the measure was implemented 
in a way which caused the applicant both physical pain and mental suffering. He therefore has 
been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3.&#8221; <i>Jalloh v. 
Germany</i>, 11 July 2006, para. 82.

</b></p>
<p>  A/HRC/4/20, para. 53. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>67. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, in many countries, persons accused 
or convicted of drug-related crimes are subject to other forms of discriminatory treatment in 
places of detention, including solitary confinement, special prison regimes and poor detention 
conditions. In Indonesia, for example, people convicted of drug-related crimes are held in special 
prison regimes, and suspected drug consumers and traders are particularly vulnerable to abuse, as 
ill-treatment is frequently used by the police to extract information on drug suppliers<b>58</b>. 
Moreover, in many cases, their detention and/or forced treatment are not subject to judicial 
review. For instance, at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to China, &#8220;enforced drug 
rehabilitation&#8221; programmes (<i>qianzhi jiedu</i>) were a specific form of administrative detention.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Palliative care/access to pain relief suffers from drug-control barriers 
</b></p>
<p>68. Worldwide, millions of people continue to suffer from often severe pain,<b>60</b> although 
already in 1961, the Single Convention, in its preamble, recognized that &#8220;the medical use of 
narcotic drugs continues to be indispensable for the relief of pain and suffering and that adequate 
provision must be made to ensure the availability of narcotic drugs for such purposes&#8221;, and its 
articles 4 and 21 further referred to the need for drugs to be available for medical purposes and 
the treatment of the sick. At its twentieth special session, the General Assembly, in its Guiding 
Principles of Drug Demand Reduction, more firmly declared the commitment of States to ensure 
adequate availability of narcotic drugs for the treatment of pain. In its resolution 2005/25 on 
treatment of pain using opioid analgesics, the Economic and Social Council recognized the 
importance of improving the treatment of pain, including by the use of opioid analgesics, as 
advocated by WHO, especially in developing countries, and called upon Member States to 
remove barriers to the medical use of such analgesics, taking fully into account the need to 
prevent their diversion for illicit use.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. However, access to narcotic drugs is still severely restricted and sometimes unavailable, in 
particular in the global South. WHO notes that &#8220;approximately 80 per cent of the world&#8217;s 
population has either no, or insufficient access to, treatment for moderate to severe pain. This is 
true for both developing and industrialized countries. Each year tens of millions of patients suffer 
moderate to severe pain without treatment: 0.8 million end-stage HIV/AIDS patients, about

<p><b>58
</b>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.7, paras. 22 and 64; appendix I, paras. 2 and 96. 
</p>
<p><b>59
</b>  E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6, para. 33, footnote 34. Whereas a new law regulating detention for drug 
</p>
<p>offences that entered into force in 2008 eliminated the use of re-education through labour, 
according to reports received by the Special Rapporteur, compulsory rehabilitation is still 
proscribed. 
<b>60
</b></p>
<p>  See for example World Health Organization briefing note on access to controlled medications 
programme, September 2008. See also the report of the International Narcotics Control Board 
for 2004 (E/INCB/1999/1), para. 15. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>4 million terminal cancer patients, patients suffering injuries, caused by accidents and violence, 
patients recovering from surgery, women in labour, patients with chronic illnesses and paediatric 
patients&#8221;.<b>61</b> 
</p>
<p>70. Apart from poverty and lack of access to medical care in general, this appears to be partly 
caused by strict narcotic drug control laws and practices devised at the national level, sometimes 
underpinned by international drug control policies, at least in the past. In 1999, the International 
Narcotics Control Board acknowledged that &#8220;outdated restrictive regulations and, more 
frequently, uninformed interpretations of otherwise correct regulations, misguided fears, and 
ingrained prejudices about using opioids for medical purposes continue to prevail in many 
countries&#8221;. Similarly, in 2007, the Board stated that &#8220;the low levels of consumption of opioid 
analgesics for the treatment of pain in many countries, in particular in developing countries, 
continue to be a matter of serious concern to the Board. The Board again urges all Governments 
concerned to identify the impediments in their countries to the adequate use of opioid analgesics 
for the treatment of pain and to take steps to improve the availability of those narcotic drugs for 
medical purposes, in accordance with the pertinent recommendations of WHO&#8221;.<b>62 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Conclusions and Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> With regard to human rights and drug policies, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
recall that, from a human rights perspective, drug dependence should be treated like any 
other health-care condition. Consequently, he would like to reiterate that denial of medical 
treatment and/or absence of access to medical care in custodial situations may constitute 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and is therefore prohibited under 
international human rights law. Equally, subjecting persons to treatment or testing without 
their consent may constitute a violation of the right to physical integrity. He would also like 
to stress that, in this regard, States have a positive obligation to ensure the same access to 
prevention and treatment in places of detention as outside. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> Similarly, the Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that the de facto denial of access to 
pain relief, if it causes severe pain and suffering, constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> To address the many tensions between the current punitive approach to drug control 
and international human rights obligations, including the prohibition of torture and cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Human Rights 
Council to take up the question of drug policies in the light of international obligations in 
the area of human rights at one of its future sessions.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>74.<b> Regarding the review process, decided by the General Assembly at its special session 
in 1998, to be held in Vienna in March 2009, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
States and the relevant United Nations agencies reassess their policies, bearing in mind the 
following points: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) States should ensure that their legal frameworks governing drug dependence 
treatment and rehabilitation services are in full compliance with international human 
rights norms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) States have an obligation to ensure that drug dependence treatment as well as 
HIV/hepatitis C prevention and treatment are accessible in all places of detention and that 
drug dependence treatment is not restricted on the basis of any kind of discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Needle and syringe programmes in detention should be used to reduce the risk 
of infection with HIV/AIDS; if injecting drug users undergo forcible testing, it should be 
carried out with full respect of their dignity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) States should refrain from using capital punishment in relation to drug-related 
offences and avoid discriminatory treatment of drug offenders, such as solitary 
confinement; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Given that lack of access to pain treatment and opioid analgesics for patients in 
need might amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, all measures should be 
taken to ensure full access and to overcome current regulatory, educational and attitudinal 
obstacles to ensure full access to palliative care.</b>
