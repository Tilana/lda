BAIL RULING

1       
This is the 2nd application filed by the Applicant for bail.

2       
The Applicant submits the following grounds for bail:

(a)

(a)     
 The charge against the Applicant is Rape of his step daughter;

Public interest and the interest of the community.

4       
Section 3 (1) of the Bail Act provides that every Accused has a right to be released on bail, unless it is not in the interest of justice that bail should be granted.

5       
In this case the Applicant had mentioned his wife as his surety.

6       
Considering Section 19 (1) ( c ) of the Bail Act it reads as follows:

"granting bail to the accused person would endanger the public interest or make the protection of the community more difficult."

7       
In Tak Sang Hao vs State (2001) FJHC 15; Her Ladyship Justice N Shameem had referred to Adesh Singh & Others v State (1988) FJHC 8 and stated, that the following factors should be considered.

1       
The presumption n of innocence;
2       
Whether the accused to appear to stand trial;
3       
Whether bail has been refused previously'
4       
The seriousness of the charges;
5       
The likelihood of the accused re-offending on bail;
6       
Any interference with prosecution witnesses;
7       
The accused's character;
8       
The accused's right to prepare his defence;
9       
The likelihood of further charges;
10      
The State's opposition to bail.

8       
The Applicant had submitted in his bail application that his wife is working and he is self employed as a carpenter.

9       
Considering the nature of the offence, the application and all other circumstances I find this application falls within the ambit of Section 19 hence I refuse bail.

10      
Application for bail is dismissed.
