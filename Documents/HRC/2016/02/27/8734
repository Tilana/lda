<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council Resolution 8/10, the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of migrants is mandated, inter alia, to examine ways and means to overcome 
the obstacles existing to the full and effective protection of the human rights of migrants 
and to request and receive information from all relevant sources, including migrants 
themselves, on violations of the human rights of migrants and their families.  In carrying 
out his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants may request, 
receive and exchange information on violations of the human rights of migrants with a 
variety of stakeholders including Governments, and is requested by the Human Rights 
Council to respond effectively to the information received. 
</p>
<p>2. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a country-by-
country basis, summaries of communications addressed to Governments in the form of 
urgent appeals and letters of allegations between 7 March 2009 and 31 March 2010, as well 
as replies received until 10 May 2010. Observations made by the Special Rapporteur have 
also been included where applicable. 
</p>
<p>3. It is important to recall that communications sent to Governments contain only 
requests for information in situations that raise concern, but also very frequently address 
situations where information regarding certain facts and actions needs clarification. The 
establishment of constructive dialogue with Governments is a crucial element to this 
process, as Governments have the primary responsibility for the protection of all persons 
under their jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in transmitting these allegations to 
Governments, he does not make any judgement concerning the merits of the cases, nor does 
he support the opinion and activities of the persons on behalf of whom he intervenes.  
</p>
<p>5.  In this report, country specific communications sent and Government responses 
received are presented in their original language as received. However, the names of 
individual victims and alleged perpetrators have been replaced by initials in order to protect 
their privacy and to prevent further victimization as well as to avoid pre-judgement of the 
alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Trends and observations 
</b></p>
<p>6. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 26 
communications on violations on the rights of migrants to 19 Member States. Of the 
communications that were sent, 17 were in the form of urgent appeals and the remaining 
were letters of allegations. 
</p>
<p>7. Communications were sent to the following countries: Angola, Australia, Bahrain, 
Burundi, R&#233;publique D&#233;mocratique du Congo, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, 
Egypt, France, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mexico, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Spain, 
Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur has continued to cooperate with other mandate-holders in 
his work. A total of 23 communications were sent jointly by the Special Rapporteur and the 
following special procedures mandate-holders:

Governments. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Governments of Australia, 
Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mexico, Republic 
of Korea, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan for their 
responses to his communications and their collaboration. He would also like to remind 
Governments that have not responded to do so, and to address all concerns raised in each 
communication. 
</p>
<p>10. The situations in which violations of the human rights of migrants are alleged to 
have occurred during the period under review, giving rise to the intervention of the Special 
Rapporteur, include allegations of:

<p><b>  Angola 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 18 December 2009 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 18 December 2009 the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
together with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences sent a letter of allegation to the government on Angola on the alleged 
detention and deportation of a large number of nationals to the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (DRC). 
</p>
<p>13. According to the information received, since January 2009, collective deportations 
and expulsion of nationals of the DRC have taken place, reaching a peak in late August 
</p><p>2009. Overall, approximately 18,800 DRC nationals have been allegedly expelled from 
Angola; approximately 16,000 of them since late August 2009. The following are two 
instances that illustrate the human rights violations that often take place during these 
expulsions.  
</p>
<p>14. In May 2009, in the Ngazi settlement in Lunda Norte province, refugees, asylum-
seekers and irregular migrant workers were subjected to ill-treatment, including gender-
based violence, and deprived of their belongings. These violations were mostly perpetrated 
by Angolan security forces and intended to force them to return to the DRC. 
</p>
<p>15. Whereas most of the DRC nationals were expelled from the provinces of Lunda 
Norte and Lunda Sul, expulsions have also reportedly occurred in the territories of Soyo 
and Cabinda since early October 2009. Citizens of the DRC were detained and kept in very 
poor conditions prior to their expulsion. It appears that the administrative detention of 
asylum seekers is not subject to independent monitoring, and takes place without prior 
authorization from a judicial body. The detainees are most often denied access to legal 
counsel. In the context of the expulsions, many of them were subject to sexual violence at 
the risk of HIV transmission, body searches without minimum hygienic standards and theft. 
</p>
<p>16. In this respect, we note the initiative to create a Commission in late November 2009 
to discuss this concern with the DRC authorities and the issuance on 13 October 2009 of a 
joint communiqu&#233; announcing the concerted cessation of expulsions and the political will 
to find sustainable solutions to the issue.  In spite of these commitments, we received 
reports that expulsions have continued to occur, albeit at a lesser scale. 
</p>
<p>17. (&#8230;) we would be grateful for the Government cooperation and observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Have complaints been lodged about the alleged violations including sexual 
and gender violence?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide information on the existing legal framework and 
implementation procedures applied to migrants in detention and those deported and 
how theses measures are compatible with international standards.  
</p>
<p>4. Please provide information on steps that have been taken with a view to 
stopping the occurrence of this and similar situations, and in particular to fulfill the 
commitments undertaken in the joint communiqu&#233; issued on 13 October 2009. 
</p>
<p>5. Please provide information on the proposed establishment of a Commission 
to discuss the issue of collective deportations and expulsions of nationals of the 
DRC, including when it is likely to be established in practice and what functions it 
will perform. </p>

<p>19. According to the information received on 29 June 2009, Mr. R.S., an Indian Student 
from Della International College, was on his way back to Melbourne, after finishing his 
work in Cranbourne. He was sitting in Dandenong train station with one of his friend, when 
they were approached by two people. They started abusing Mr. R.S verbally with racist 
insults and then went away. They however came back with four or five people and with a 
pair of scissors. When they approached Mr. R.S. for the second time, they removed his 
turban and gave him a punch on his face. After this, they started kicking him. They also 
pulled his hair and started cutting them. Mr. R.S.friend was also beaten up. The police 
arrived and arrested three of the people.  
</p>
<p>20. Mr. M.K.A, an Indian student from the Victoria Institute of Technology in 
Melbourne, was attacked on the evening of 22 June 2009 when he was coming out of a hair 
saloon. He was walking near a railway station in eastern suburb of Melbourne when two 
men, wearing hooded jackets walked up to him and punched him without any provocation. 
They reportedly demanded money from him and when he resisted they attacked him on his 
right eye. He was admitted to a local hospital thereafter.  
</p>
<p>21. Mr. S.B., an Indian student from the Deakin University in Melbourne, was 
physically assaulted by two men as he was about to get into his car in Boronia on 12 June 
</p><p>2009. Reportedly, the two men came up to Mr. S.B. and asked him for money. They then 
slammed the car door onto the hands of Mr. B and punched him in the head and stomach 
and racially abused him.    
</p>
<p>22. On 24 May 2009, Mr. R.K., an Indian hospitality student in Sydney, was sitting on 
his bed in the front room of his rented house when an unknown person allegedly threw a 
small petrol bomb through his window. The explosion and subsequent fire left Mr. K with 
burns to a third of his body. 
</p>
<p>23. Mr. S.K., an Indian automobile engineering student in Melbourne, was stabbed with 
a screwdriver on 23 May 2009 when two teenagers arrived at a party. While the party was 
on, one of the two teenagers came in and asked Mr. K.to switch off the music. The teenager 
started to create problems and first refused to leave. After a few minutes, the two teenagers 
however left the party. Everyone got back inside and the music was turned on. Suddenly 
one of the teenagers came back but was stopped by Mr. K.. While both argued on the 
doorstep, the other teenager came out of the car with a screwdriver and stabbed Mr. S.K. 
The police, who were patrolling the area, reportedly caught the two teenagers. 
</p>
<p>24. Mr. B.S., an Indian student in Melbourne, was attacked on the night of 22 May 
2009, when two men carrying weapons approached him and demanded money. As Mr. S. 
was searching through his bag to hand over his wallet, they stabbed him with a screwdriver 
in the abdomen. The attackers reportedly laughed while stabbing him and then fled the 
scene. Mr. S. was admitted to the Alfred Hospital thereafter.  
</p>
<p>25. Concern is expressed that all these attacks reflect a pattern of xenophobic violence in 
Australia over the recent months 
</p>
<p>26. (&#8230;)we would be grateful for the Government's cooperation and observations on the 
following matters: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 8 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>27. On 28 October 2009, the Government of Australia replied to the communication sent 
on 8 July 2009, highlighting its commitment to ensuring that crimes committed against all 
persons within their jurisdiction, irrespective of race or any other characteristic of a victim 
or perpetrator, are investigated fully and prosecuted where possible. It also highlighted that 
in all Australian States and Territories there are restrictions on publication of the identity of 
juveniles involved in criminal court proceedings.  
</p>
<p>28. The Australian Government did not comment on pending court proceedings. 
However, it informed that the police arrested and charged three suspects in relation to the 
incidents involving Mr R.S. and provided details on their the proceedings involved the three 
suspects.  In relation to the incidents involving Mr S. B. and Mr B. S., the Government 
highlighted that the victims reported the matter to the local police station. At the time of 
writing no offenders have been charged. However, investigations are continuing. 
</p>
<p>29. In relation to the incidents involving Mr R. K., the Government informed that a 
strike forced has been established by the police force and a team of detectives is 
investigating the incident. It also informed that a number of statements have been taken 
from witnesses, and items have been seized for forensic examination but that no suspect or 
no suspects have been identified. The Government also provided information on the steps 
taken to investigate and found the possible offenders.   
</p>
<p>30. In relation to the incident involving Mr S.K., a 17 year old male was charged and 
remanded in custody on 24 May 2009. A committal hearing was scheduled to occur on 16 
November 2009. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government of Australia also informed that following the incident referred to 
by-the Special Rapporteurs which occurred in New South Wales, consultation was 
undertaken with the local community, the office of the Indian Consul General and the 
Community Relations Commission (Commission). The Government also explained that the 
Commission has responsibility for promoting community harmony, participation and access 
to services in order that the contribution of cultural diversity to New South Wales is 
celebrated and recognised as an important social and economic resource. It recognises 
multiculturalism as a deliberate public policy and takes proactive steps to ensure a cohesive 
and harmonious society and that the Chairperson and staff of the Commission have 
maintained regular contact and dialogue with the Consul General of India, members of the 
Indian community and the international strident community through various forums and 
meetings. Moreover, in its response, the Government highlights the intense local 
community information campaigns that have been implemented and led by Local Area 
Commands, for example, in Rosehill and Harris Park, with the aim to provide personal 
safety and crime awareness information to students to reduce the risk of further crimes. 
</p>
<p>32. The Government also informed that the New South Wales government is 
implementing a number of measures to promote safety, and foster good police relations 
with international students, particularly Indian students. The New South Wales police force </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>policy and Programs command is developing a whole of organization approach to the safety 
needs of international students including Indian students.  
</p>
<p>33. In its response, the Government also informed about the establishment of the New 
South Wales of a number of measures aimed at providing greater protection to international 
students, as well as addressing broader concerns regarding education and support for 
international students in Australia. Those measures include the announcement, on 2 June 
2009, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Australian Parliament, of the establishment 
of a taskforce to coordinate the Government's efforts to address matters affecting the safety 
of international students in Australia across the Commonwealth and in collaboration with 
State and territory governments.  
</p>
<p>34. The Government also highlighted the importance of migration for their society in the 
following terms: &quot;Australia has benefited from the contributions of the millions of migrants 
from around the world who have made Australia home and helped shape its unique 
national-identity. Today, there are over 21 million Australians. Australians speak more than 
3001anguages, including Indigenous languages, identify with more than 200 ancestries and 
observe a wide variety of cultural and religious traditions. Forty-five per cent of 
australioans are born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas. The 
Australian Govemment's migration program is carefully managed to provide maximum 
benefit for the Australian community. This helps the Government meet its social objectives 
and international obligations, as well as economic goals&quot;.  
</p>
<p><b>  Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 31 December 2009 
</b></p>
<p>35. On 31 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants sent 
a letter of allegation to the government of Bahrain concerning the exploitation of migrant 
workers in its territory, including the non-payment of wages and confiscation of passports, 
thereby restricting workers&#8217; freedom of movement and their capacity to access effective 
remedies. Migrant workers in the private sector are subject to various forms of abuse, 
including confiscation of identity documents, limited freedom of movement, and non-
payment of wages or reduction in wages (see A/HRC/4/23/Add.2)  Concern is expressed 
that this pattern of abuse still seems to persist in Bahrain. 
</p>
<p>36. According to the information received, on October 6 2009, Mr. Muhammad Naseer, 
an Indian citizen, alleged that his employer and sponsor had refused to pay him nearly four 
months of arrear wages and withheld his passport. When the employer had allegedly 
refused his request for arrear wages, Mr. Naseer sought the help of the Indian embassy and 
filed a formal complaint with the Labour Ministry, which called an arbitration meeting with 
the employer. The Labour Ministry advised him that he could either go to court to recover 
his wages, or get his passport back and leave the country. As the legal proceedings are 
reportedly costly and lengthy, Mr. Naseer was compelled to sign a settlement letter, written 
in English &#8211; a language that he does not understand &#8211; in which he waived all legal claims 
against his employer in exchange for his passport and authorization to leave the country. 
The Labour Ministry helped Mr. Naseer retrieve his passport.  He returned to India on 
October 26, 2009, without receiving his arrears. 
</p>
<p>37. The same employer allegedly owes at least 29 workers arrear wages for three 
months. The employer allegedly tried to get the unpaid workers to sign documents 
affirming receipt of full payment, but the workers refused. In addition, the employer 
allegedly physically assaulted an employee who had requested the payment of arrear wages.  
</p>
<p>38. Information received also indicates that another company has not paid eight migrant 
workers for five months.  The withholding of wages appears to be a widespread practice, as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>evidenced by the demonstration outside the Indian Embassy in Manama on 24 October 
2009, which was apparently organized by 38 migrant workers at another company who 
claimed that their employer had failed to pay them for five months. 
</p>
<p>39. I note that article 302 of the Bahraini penal code makes it illegal for an employer to 
withhold wages in full or in part and authorizes the Government to prosecute abusive 
employers. I also note that Bahraini legislation forbids employers from withholding the 
passports of their migrant workers.  According to the information received, however, the 
practice of withholding wages and passports of migrant workers is reportedly widespread 
and the authorities rarely prosecute or take other action against employers in this respect. It 
is also alleged that the current arbitration system is unfair to migrant workers, for it favours 
employers who refuse to settle by arbitration and resort to litigation.  Migrant workers, 
most of whom cannot afford legal fees or the loss of income, often have little choice but to 
accept highly unfavourable settlements in order to avoid litigation.   
</p>
<p>40. (&#8230;) I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the cases accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation, judicial inquiry or any other inquiries carried out in relation to 
employers who withhold wages and passports of migrant workers in breach of 
Bahraini law.   
</p>
<p>3. Please provide information on whether there are adequate complaint 
mechanisms available to and accessible by migrant workers and their family 
members in Bahrain in line with the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons contained in her report (A/HRC/4/32/Add.2). Please also 
provide information on any efforts undertaken by your Government to inform the 
migrant workers of the existence of such mechanisms.

<p>52. On 31 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants, together 
with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishmen sent an urgent appeal to the government of Czech Republic concerning the 
situation of B.I., aged 30, citizen of Kazakhstan, who is currently awaiting deportation from 
the Czech Republic to his country of origin. 
</p>
<p>53. According to the information received, Mr. S. M. was arrested on 21 October 2008 
without any explanation and taken to the main police criminal investigation department in 
Prague. There he was severely beaten and called &#8220;dirty and black foreigner&#8221;. In the process, 
he was stripped of his clothes. As a result of the beatings, he kneeled down and begged the 
police to tell him why he had been arrested, to inform his consular authorities and to allow 
him access to a lawyer, but to no avail. Rather, the officers continued to beat him and 
forced him to sign some papers, which he did, despite the fact that everything was written 
in Czech, of which he has limited knowledge. As a result his head was bleeding and he felt 
the taste of blood in his mouth. The treatment continued on 22 October, when he received 
even stronger blows and his hands were handcuffed to a tube. The handcuffs were so tight 
he could not feel one of his hands.  
</p>
<p>54. It subsequently turned out that he and his brother were accused of having committed 
a murder. The brother was held in the neighbouring room, and Mr. S. M. could hear him 
beg for help. When he reiterated his request for a lawyer and an interpreter, one of the 
police officers took out a rifle and put it to his head, threatening to kill him. The policemen 
also allegedly indicated that foreigners were considered &#8220;shit and litter&#8221;, so nobody would 
believe them, in case they decided to file any complaints. Once he had made a confession, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>he was finally led to an office, where a defence lawyer was present. He said that he had 
nothing to do with the crime, but nobody listened to him.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Procedures mandate holders expressed fear Mr. S. M. may be sentenced 
on the basis of evidence obtained under torture/ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>56. (&#8230;)we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters, when relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of Mr. Maksudov?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>4. Please indicate the legal basis for the arrest and detention of Mr. Maksudov 
and how these measures are compatible with applicable international human rights 
norms and standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>5. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been 
undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on 
the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p>6. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the victim or the 
family of the victim. 
</p>
<p>7. Please provide information on the practical implementation of the right of 
foreign nationals, regardless of their immigration status, to communicate with an 
official of their own State in the case of detention and the Czech Republic obligation 
to inform the foreign national of that right. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 31 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>57. On 1 October 2009, the Government of the Czech Republic replied to the 
communication of 31 July 2009. The Government indicated that the first complaint against 
performed police action was received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Embassy 
of Uzbekistan in Austria, dated 27 March 2009, pursuant to the demand of Mr. S. M.&#8217;s 
parents asking for help against the arbitrary detention of their son. The Regional Police 
Directorate in Prague investigated this complaint. The result was that no violation of the 
law or service instruction had occurred during the actions performed by the police. The 
report of the investigation was sent to the attention of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 27 
May 2009. A second complaint was received from Mr. S. M. on 19 May 2009, regarding 
his dissent with the official action of four unnamed police officers who reportedly beat and 
kicked him, served him no food or drink and refused his request to call a lawyer on 21 and 
22 October 2008. During the examination of this complaint, two other complaints by Mr. S. 
M. were received by the Regional Police Directorate of Prague on 30 July 2009. The first 
was addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the second to the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. The content was nearly the same as in the complaint from 19 May 2009. The result 
of the common investigation of all three complaints was that no police officer had treated 
the accused in a manner that was in violation of law or service instructions and that no 
reduction of the rights of the accused had occurred. Mr. S. M. was not subjected to physical 
cruelty, verbal assaults, threats or other similar acts. In addition, he was regularly served 
meals and drinks. Even the Municipal Court in Prague did not find any violation of the law 
in the actions performed by the police.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>58. In its reply, the Government provided an explanation on the circumstances of the 
murder of a citizen of Belarus. According to the Government, there was a justified 
suspicion that Mr. S. M. and others had participated in the murder. The state attorney of the 
Metropolitan Prosecuting Attorney&#8217;s Office in Prague approved their detention. On 21 
October 2008, Mr. S. M. was detained in the parking of the Imperial Hotel in Prague, where 
he had been employed. In the course of his detention, holds and grasps were used, in 
accordance with Police Act No. 283/1991. He was also handcuffed due to his active 
resistance. Three other persons were also arrested. The investigation continued, and one of 
the detainees was released. The other men, including Mr. S. M., were handed over to the 
detention cell in the Regional Police Directorate. On 22 October 2008, the criminal 
prosecution began. The resolution to commence prosecution was handed over to Mr. S. M. 
in the presence of his appointed counsel. His interrogation was then conducted in the 
presence of his defending counsels and an interpreter. On 24 October 2008, through the 
resolution of the District Court Judge, Mr. S. M. was remanded in custody, and he was 
transferred to Remand Prison Pankrac, where he is currently detained. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 16 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>59. On 16 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants, together 
with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the 
government of Czech Republic concerning the situation of Bauyrzhan Imangaliev, aged 30, 
citizen of Kazakhstan, who is currently awaiting deportation from the Czech Republic to 
his country of origin. 
</p>
<p>60. According to the information received, Mr. Imangaliev is awaiting deportation in the 
refugee camp &#8220;B&#233;l&#225; Jezov&#225;&#8221; in the Czech Republic together with his pregnant wife and two 
small children. He claimed that in his country of origin, Kazakhstan, he was subjected to 
persecution on the part of the authorities for religious reasons as a member of an 
independent Muslim community which is not controlled by the official religious structures 
in Western Kazakhstan. However, his asylum claim in the Czech Republic was recently 
rejected and the conclusions of the migration service of the Czech Republic, which made a 
decision on his deportation, reportedly failed to take into account that four of his Muslim 
associates who stayed in Kazakhstan were imprisoned under falsified charge. Also, some 
procedural violations have been reported, such as incorrect translations from Russian into 
Czech of interviews, which failed to reflect some of the accounts relevant to the asylum 
claims.  
</p>
<p>61. While still in Kazakhstan, Mr. Imangaliev reportedly was subjected to persecution 
on the part of the authorities for religious reasons, namely in connection with alleged 
extremist views. Between 1999 and 2005, he was regularly called in by the National 
Security Committee (KNB) and questioned. In 2005, he was held in custody in a KNB 
isolator in Atyrau on two occasions: In early 2005, he was suspended from handcuffs and 
beaten on his kidneys by the officers. In late 2005, he was held for five days without his 
family being notified. Several members of his religious community have been arrested in 
recent years and some are still in detention. There are reports of them being harassed by 
prison staff in order to force them to give up their religious convictions. 
</p>
<p>62. Mr. Imangaliev and his family subsequently fled from Kazakhstan and founded a 
human rights organization in Prague, Czech Republic, where demonstrations have 
repeatedly been organized to protest against the violations of freedom of religion or belief 
by Kazakh authorities, which may lead to reprisals by the latter, in case he is returned to 
Kazakhstan.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>63. It appears that a large number of asylum seekers from Kazakhstan (222 persons, of 
who 54 minors born in emigration) are currently at risk of involuntary return to Kazakhstan. 
All of them claim to have been persecuted by Kazakhstani authorities on the basis of their 
beliefs, which have been labeled as &#8220;extremism&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>64. With a view to the above allegations of torture of Mr. Imangaliev by the Kazakhstan 
National Security Committee, concern is expressed that he may yet again be at risk of 
torture in connection with accusations of membership in a radical religious group, if he is 
forcibly returned to Kazakhstan.  
</p>
<p>65. (&#8230;) we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters, when relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Have complaints been lodged by or on behalf of Mr. Imangaliev or any other 
of the 222 asylum seekers?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why.

<p>66. El 26 de Octubre de 2009, el Relator Especial sobre los derechos humanos de los 
migrantes junto con la Experta independiente sobre cuestiones de las minor&#237;as y el Relator 
Especial sobre formas contempor&#225;neas de racismo, discriminaci&#243;n racial, xenofobia y 
formas conexas de intolerancia, envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n a la Rep&#250;blica Dominicana, 
para se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno, la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con presuntos 
abusos a trabajadores migrantes de origen haitiano.  
</p>
<p>67. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 4 de octubre de 2009, presuntos soldados entraron 
en una casa de Montecristi donde trabajadores migratorios de origen haitiano atend&#237;an una 
sesi&#243;n de formaci&#243;n sobre los derechos laborales de los trabajadores migratorios conducida 
por la Asociaci&#243;n Solidaria de Trabajadores Migrantes de la L&#237;nea Noroeste (ASOMILIN). 
Veinticinco de estos trabajadores migratorios de origen haitiano habr&#237;an sido trasladados a 
la base militar de Montecristi. El d&#237;a siguiente, el 5 de octubre de 2009, los habr&#237;an llevado 
a la ciudad frontera de Dajab&#243;n y posteriormente los habr&#237;an forzado a cruzar la frontera 
hacia Hait&#237;.  
</p>
<p>68. De conformidad con la informaci&#243;n recibida, a los migrantes detenidos no se les 
habr&#237;an reconocido algunas de las garant&#237;as asociadas al debido proceso tales como la 
oportunidad de impugnar la legalidad de su detenci&#243;n o el tener acceso a un mecanismo 
para controvertir la decisi&#243;n de expulsarlos a Hait&#237;. De igual manera, los trabajadores 
migratorios no habr&#237;an tenido acceso a un abogado ni a informarle a sus familiares sobre su 
situaci&#243;n. Los supuestos soldados les habr&#237;an impedido tomar sus objetos personales as&#237; 
como recibir los salarios que les adeudaban.  
</p>
<p>69. Se expresa profunda preocupaci&#243;n por la situaci&#243;n de estos veinticinco Haitianos 
expulsados y de sus familias dejadas en Republica Dominicana.  De manera general, se 
expresa tambi&#233;n preocupaci&#243;n por el tratamiento otorgado a las comunidades haitianas o de 
ascendencia haitiana en Rep&#250;blica Dominicana, que alcanzar&#237;an, de conformidad con

referencia al prejuicio racial existente en el anti-haitianismo as&#237; como a las expulsiones y 
deportaciones.  El reporte conjunto se refiere a deportaciones indiscriminadas y arbitrarias, 
y se&#241;ala que las &quot;deportaciones indiscriminadas y arbitrarias, [..] carecen de la protecci&#243;n 
que otorga el proceso con las debidas garant&#237;as.  Ciudadanos dominicanos de ascendencia 
haitiana y haitianos residentes en el pa&#237;s desde hace tiempo tienen las mismas posibilidades 
que los inmigrantes reci&#233;n llegados de ser deportados sin disponer de una ocasi&#243;n adecuada 
para hacer valer las debidas diferencias.  Las deportaciones se realizan tan r&#225;pidamente que 
no se informa a los familiares.&quot;.  En dicho reporte conjunto, tambi&#233;n se expres&#243; 
preocupaci&#243;n sobre los procedimientos de expulsiones y deportaciones que &quot;iban dirigidos 
especialmente contra personas de las que se sospechaba que eran &quot;haitianos&quot;, una

haitianos, dominicanos de descendencia haitiana y dominicanos negros desprovistos de

<p>71. El 5 de mayo de 2010, el Gobierno de Republica Dominicana env&#237;o respuesta a la 
carta de alegaci&#243;n enviada el 26 de octubre de 2009, aceptando que el 4 de Octubre de 
2009, fueron detenidos y conducidos a la Fortaleza San Fernando en la ciudad de 
Montecristi y luego trasladados a la Fortaleza Beller en la ciudad de Dajab&#243;n desde donde 
fueron repatriados a su pa&#237;s de origen, v&#237;a Oficinal Nacional de Migraci&#243;n veinticinco (25)

cantidad de nacionales haitianos se estar&#237;an organizando en la zona con la finalidad de 
recibir entrenamiento militar para llevar a cabo acciones subversivas.  
</p>
<p>72. En su respuesta, el Gobierno tambi&#233;n inform&#243; que el encargado des Departamento

Coordinador del Departamento de Inteligencia Fronteriza para que investigara en relaci&#243;n a 
que en el Batey Jaramillo, una gran cantidad de nacionales haitianos se estaban reuniendo 
presuntamente con fines subversivos. Aunque dichas alegaciones no fueron comprobadas, 
ya que se inform&#243; que la reuni&#243;n de haitianos ten&#237;a como objetivo formar una junta de 
vecinos, los hombres que se encontraban en el lugar eran indocumentados y las autoridades </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1

</p>
<p>procedieron a su detenci&#243;n y a su posterior deportaci&#243;n. El Gobierno inform&#243; que en dicha 
reuni&#243;n tambi&#233;n participaban mujeres y ni&#241;os, pero que solo detuvieron a los hombres y 
que ninguno le pidi&#243; hacer llamadas ni recoger pertenencias, ya que est&#225;s quedaban en 
manos de sus esposas e hijos.  Luego de estar en la Fortaleza, los ciudadanos detenidos 
hicieron llamadas a sus familiares, recibieron cena, sabanas y otros utensilios.  
</p>
<p>73. El Gobierno se&#241;alo igualmente que el 5 de octubre de 2009, la Oficina Nacional de 
Migraci&#243;n, recibi&#243; por parte de las fuerzas armadas, en el Punto Fronterizo de Dajabon, la 
cantidad de veintisiete personas de nacionalidad haitiana, presumiblemente ilegales en el 
territorio dominicano. Veiticinco de ellos declararon que no pose&#237;an documentaci&#243;n que 
avalase su estatus migratorio. Las autoridades gubernamentales procedieron a informarles 
sobre las disposiciones de la ley de Migraci&#243;n 285-04, con relaci&#243;n a la exigencia de la 
documentaci&#243;n migratoria que les permitir&#237;a permanecer en el territorio nacional; y que por 
esta raz&#243;n, proced&#237;a la repatriaci&#243;n a su pa&#237;s de origen, conforme a lo establecido en la Ley 
285-04 y por lo cual se procedi&#243; en consecuencia, a repatriar a esos veinticinco haitianos. A 
los dos que presentaron la documentaci&#243;n requerida, se les permiti&#243; permanecer en el pa&#237;s.

<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 2 December 2009 
</b></p>
<p>76. On 2 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment sent an urgent appeal to the government of Egypt regarding Ms. Medhine, an 
Ethiopian asylum seeker, reportedly detained at El Quanater Prison, El Qaliubiya, Egypt. 
</p>
<p>77. According to the information received, Ms. Medhine fled Ethiopia with her baby, 
Galila, in April 2008 to seek asylum in Egypt.  They travelled to Egypt by land via Sudan 
where they initially faced the risk of being deported to Ethiopia.  At the Egyptian border, 
they were arrested by the Egyptian authorities for their irregular entry into the country and 
detained at El Quanater Prison.  While there is no information on the date of the arrest, Ms. 
Medhine&#8217;s sister in Australia learned of the arrest in August 2008.   
</p>
<p>78. It is reported that the conditions at El Quanater Prison are harsh.  25 to 30 persons 
are allegedly detained in one cell and asylum seekers are detained together with Egyptian 
inmates.  The hygiene standards are not adequate and Galila suffered from diarrhea and 
vomiting for days.  There is allegedly no medical care inside the prison and the prison 
officers did not seek external medical attention, despite the fact that Ms. Medhine requested 
them to seek medical attention for her child.  As a result, Galila died in El Quanater Prison 
on 27 September 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>79. In June 2009, a complaint had been submitted to the High General Prosecutor, 
seeking orders to stop the deportation procedures against Ms. Medhine and Galila, as well 
as to release them from the prison.  While the deportation procedures were successfully 
suspended, Ms. Medhine remains detained at El Quanater Prison to date.  Although Ms. 
Medhine is an asylum seeker who is in need of international protection, she was denied any 
contacts with the outside world, including the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), until the Egyptian authorities finally granted UNHCR access to Ms. 
Medhine on 9 November 2009.  Following the death of Galila, another complaint has been 
submitted to the High General Prosecutor requesting an investigation into her death.  The 
Prosecutor is still investigating the case.

following matters, when relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate?

<p><b>  Italy 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 11 January 2010 
</b></p>
<p>88. On 11 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
together with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
of Italy concerning xenophobic violence targeting African migrant workers in the town of 
Rosarno, Calabria.  
</p>
<p>89. According to the information received, on 7 January 2010, two African migrant 
workers returning from work were shot at with air guns by Italian men. In order to protest 
against this incident, the migrant workers took to the streets and demonstrated violently by 
setting fire to cars, smashing windscreens and attacking local shops. The police intervened 
in order to prevent the demonstrators from undertaking further violent acts.  
</p>
<p>90. On 8 January 2010, in reaction to the violent demonstrations by migrant workers and 
in order to drive them out of the area, some residents of Rosarno beat migrant workers with 
iron bars, shot at them, and intentionally run over them with cars. As a result, it has been 
alleged that more than 50 people were injured, including 18 police officers who intervened 
to stop the violence.   
</p>
<p>91. Following this incident, approximately 1400 migrants have been reportedly arrested 
and sent to the Bari and Crotone centers, including those in possession of residence permits 
and asylum seekers. According to the information received, the Italian authorities have 
begun deportations of migrants held at the Crotone centre at the midday on 11 January 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>92. (&#8230;) we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide information on any inquiries carried out into the xenophobic 
attacks carried out against migrant workers on 8 January 2010.   
</p>
<p>3. Please indicate whether the victims or the families of the victims have access 
to adequate procedures of compensation for damages resulting from the xenophobic 
violence described above.  
</p>
<p>4. What measures are being taken to prevent the resurgence of violence between 
local residents and migrant workers, both in immediate and long terms?   
</p>
<p>5. Please provide information on current conditions of migrants who have been 
arrested and sent to detention facilities, including Bari and Crotone centres.  Please 
also provide information on long-term plans on how to accommodate the migrant 
workers concerned.  
</p>
<p>6. Please provide information on measures undertaken by your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government in order to ensure that migrants who face a real risk of torture and 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or other violations of 
fundamental human rights are not expelled to countries where they face such a risk, 
in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 11 January 2010 
</b></p>
<p>93. On 9 March 2010, the Government of Italy replied to the communication dated 11 
January 2010. In its response, the Government drew attention to the prompt intervention by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>the Police, as well as the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office, who started investigations that are still 
ongoing.  
</p>
<p>94. With regard to the events, the Government confirmed that on 7 January 2010, 
between the towns of Rosarno and Gioia Tauro, unknown persons fired a few shots of 
compressed air gun against a group of foreign nationals of African origin. One of the 
migrant of Togolese origin reported a wound considered curable in 10 days. Following that 
incident, several Non-EU citizens protested by a roadblock. About 100 foreign nationals 
demonstrated across the streets of Rosarno. During the demonstrations, the protesters 
damaged parked cars, shop windows, signs, street furniture and garbage bins. Some 
residents were victims of the riots and had to resort to medical care. The Police managed to 
contain the protest and arrested five non-EU citizens. The prosecutor promptly promoted, in 
respect of the above five migrants, three separate judicial proceedings on the charge of 
aggravated resistance to public officers. On the same day, the Court of Palmi confirmed the 
arrest and ordered the remand in custody for all the above persons, while postponing the 
trial, upon request by the defence counsels. 
</p>
<p>95. On 8 January 2010, many residents of Rosarno reacted to such events by acts of 
violence against a large numbers of migrants. It was reported the occurrence of many 
incidents of aggression by blows with a steel bar, many cases of beatings, and even some 
assassination attempts by voluntarily investing or trying to overrun with cars or other means 
Non-EU migrants. During the same day and the day after - on 9 January 2010 - three Non-
EU citizens, in two separate incidents, were hit by shotgun fired by unknown persons. 
There were also episodes of threats at gunpoint by unknown persons, against migrants who 
were asked to leave the houses where they were staying. The police arrested in three 
separate episodes three citizens of Rosarno; and the measure was promptly confirmed by 
the Court. Several judicial proceedings against unknown persons for the crimes of damage 
or injuries have been started. At the hospital emergency, there were some citizens and many 
Non-EU nationals, the most serious of whom were hospitalised.  
</p>
<p>96. The number of the above proceedings is expected to grow, as soon as notices of 
crimes arise from medical reports or complaints submitted by the victims. For the time 
being, the crimes to be ascertained, inter alia, refer to criminal association, attempted 
extortion, aggravated damage, use and illegal possession of weapons, aggravated injuries 
and other crimes. Investigations have already been delegated to the Police, Carabinieri and 
Guardia di Finanza that have provided investigators with additional resources. In fact, it 
was established an ad hoc taskforce working on a double-track: investigating both the 
individual conduct, and phenomena associated with and/or conducts systematically 
organized by groups, who may have planned and executed - possibly in a coordinated 
manner - retaliation and intimidation aimed to provoke the flee of migrant workers from the 
plain of Gioia Tauro. Investigations have been started also with regard to the illegal 
exploitation of migrants in the farms in the surroundings. Within this framework, a specific 
investigation has been launched to determine whether, in relation to the first episode of 
injury and other incidents of violence against migrants, it may be considered the 
aggravating circumstance concerning the crimes committed for purposes of discrimination 
or ethnic/racial hatred. By acquiring the video-tapes recorded by the street cameras, some 
valuable evidence has been collected. In fact, the prosecutor requested the Ministry of 
Interior to issue the special permit under Article 18 of the Unified Text on Immigration 
(Act No.286/1998), on behalf of five Non-EU nationals.  
</p>
<p>97. As for the number of migrants transferred by the Police in the Centres of Bari and 
Crotone, on 9 January 2010, they amounted to 758 - and not 1,400 individuals. At that time 
it was not clear how many of them were without a residence permit or applying for asylum 
in Italy.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>98. More specifically, the Government of Italy indicated that following the Rosarno 
incidents, the Minister of Interior set up an ad hoc Taskforce to provide a complete and 
detailed picture of the situation and to identify the most suitable economic and social 
solutions for the area under reference. Further to contacts with relevant NGOs and 
International Organisations, the Taskforce arranged the immediate transfer of migrants to 
the Reception Centres in Crotone and Bari. A medical team carried out a thorough 
evaluation of the hygienic conditions of the buildings where migrants were living before 
such events, and also assessed their health conditions. In addition, inspections are taking 
place in all the enterprises of the area, which have employed Non-EU seasonal workers in 
the agriculture sector, so as to verify their compliance with the law. It is envisaged that the 
employer be compelled to ensure the availability of a proper accommodation for Non-EU 
workers. A similar initiative is being implemented in Castel Volturno (Caserta). 
</p>
<p>99. There were 428 Non-EU citizens at the Crotone Reception Centre who were 
partially identified by nationality. These people held the following legal status: a) 348 Non-
EU citizens with a residence permit; b) 9 Non-EU citizens being under arrest; c) 20 Non-
EU citizens recipients of an expulsion measure; d) 46 Non-EU citizens escaped without 
previous identification; e) 5 Non-EU nationals applying for asylum. Currently, only 8 
asylum seekers are reported to be hosted in the above Reception Centre, while 6 other Non-
EU citizens are held in a Identification and Expulsion Centre (C.I.E). 324 migrants were 
moved to the Reception Centre in Bari. Among them, 159 persons were reported to hold the 
residence permit, 14 were arrested due to non compliance with the order to leave the 
national territory, and the others have been held in the local C.I.E., with the exception of a 
Nigerian citizen, who was moved to the C.I.E. in Rome. 
</p>
<p>100. In order to prevent the recurrence of such a situation, the Minister of Interior 
proposed to improve the reception conditions, including housing for migrant workers, and 
more generally the integration of migrants. To this end, the Ministry of Interior is launching 
projects for the establishment of a vocational training Centre for migrants in Rosarno, 
besides significant requalification and renovation strategies for the surrounding under 
concern. Additional funding has been made available for this purpose from the Ministry of 
Interior and other sources. In particular, in Rosarno and in some neighbouring districts, 
specific projects are in progress, in order to improve the reception and integration of 
immigrants present in the area. The Rosarno district is also interested in a project funded by 
the European Social Fund, managed by the Ministry of Labour and aimed at setting up 
accommodations for foreign seasonal workers. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 31 December 2009 
</b></p>
<p>101. On 31 December .2009, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
together with the Special Rapporteur on the right to education sent a letter of allegation to 
the Government of Italy in connection with some of the legislative developments in Italy, 
including Law No. 94 of 15 July 2009 on public security (&#8220;the Security Law&#8221;), Law Decree 
no. 11/2009 of 23 February 2009 (&#8220;Law Decree&#8221;), Law no. 125 of 24 July 2008 (&#8220;Law no. 
125&#8221;), and Law no. 155 of 31 July 2005 (&#8220;the Pisanu Law&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>102. According to the information received, laws which may have a negative impact on 
the rights of migrants, including: (a) irregular migration status as an aggravating factor in 
sentencing; (b) the offence of illegal entry and stay; (c) the expulsion of aliens; (d) the 
extension of administrative detention for migrants; (e)  restrictions on money transfer; (f) 
the modification of the Civil Code affecting irregular migrants&#8217; right to marry; and (g) 
restrictions on the right to birth registration.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b>  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Irregular migration status as an aggravating factor in sentencing 
</i></p>
<p>103. Law no. 125 provides that when a person commits an offence while unlawfully 
present in the national territory, his or her unlawful presence will be deemed an aggravating 
factor in respect of sentencing.  This may increases the period of imprisonment a person is 
sentenced to by up to one third.  The imposition of a more severe punishment solely on the 
basis of a convicted person&#8217;s legal status in the country is  a subject of concern, as it may 
result in discrimination based on one&#8217;s immigration status..   
</p>
<p><i> (b) The offence of illegal entry and stay 
</i></p>
<p>104. The Security Law introduced the offence of illegal entry and stay within the territory 
of the State.  Under Article 1, Paragraph 16, the offender is subject to punishment by a 
penalty ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 Euros.  While acknowledging the sovereign right of 
the State to regulate the entry and stay of aliens, please allow us to express concern about 
the effects of the criminalization of illegal entry and stay on the human rights of irregular 
migrants, which can further hamper access to, <i>inter alia</i>, education, health, housing, labour 
rights and the justice system, because of the fear of being denounced, imprisoned and 
ultimately deported. It has already been reported that many irregular migrants choose not to 
access health care even when their physical conditions demand medical attention, because 
of the fear that they would be reported by public officials and subsequently convicted of a 
crime.  According to information received, the number of migrants seeking treatment in the 
main hospitals in Rome has decreased by 35%, following the approval of the Security Law.  
Furthermore, there are reports that mothers and children who required urgent medical 
attention have died, because they did not access hospitals or doctors for fear of being 
reported as illegal immigrants.  The criminalization of illegal entry and stay also fuels anti-
migrant sentiments, aggravating an acute social problem.  The Security Law appears to be 
not  in line with the commitments of States, inter alia, in the framework of the Durban 
Declaration and Plan of Action which highlighted the importance of creating conditions 
conducive to greater harmony, tolerance and respect between migrants and the rest of 
society in the countries in which they find themselves. As reiterated in the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on he human rights of migrants to the seventh session of the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/7/12) irregular migration should be regarded as an administrative 
offence and irregular migrants should not be treated as criminals. 
</p>
<p>105. According to Article 1, Paragraph 17 of the Security Law, the offence is adjudicated 
through a new fast-track procedure.  This procedure, which is designed to be fast and 
informal, is conducted before a justice of peace and allows the public prosecutor to transfer 
the defendant to trial before a justice of peace within 15 days, if there are particular reasons 
of urgency or the accused person is not subject to detention measures.  If the accused 
person is detained, the public prosecutor may send the defendant immediately before the 
justice of peace.  In preparation of the defence, the defendant can request no more than 7 
days, or 48 hours in case he or she is already detained or for reasons of urgency.  We are 
concerned that the fast-track procedure diminishes the right of migrants to a fair trial 
guaranteed under Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), given the limited time available to prepare a defence. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Expulsion of aliens 
</i></p>
<p>106. Article 1, Paragraph 22M of the Security Law envisages the administrative 
expulsion of persons for illegal entry or stay without the authorization of a criminal judge.  
An alien subject to expulsion may challenge the order of expulsion in a hearing before a 
justice of peace and the ordinary judge is only notified of the execution of expulsion.  
Concern is expressed that a migrant is not afforded the right to challenge his or her 
expulsion before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p>that the scope of review for the administrative expulsion is narrow, as the justice of peace is 
only asked to verify that all procedures have been duly complied with and that the person 
has been reported for the offence of illegal entry and stay.   
</p>
<p>107. In addition, Article 3(1) of the Pisanu Law allows for expulsion of aliens by decree 
of the Minister of the Interior or the prefect when the alien is suspected of terrorist 
activities.  According to the information received, your Excellency&#8217;s Government has 
expelled three Tunisian terrorist suspects pursuant to the Pisanu Law since June 2008, 
despite the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend the 
expulsion until the ECHR issues decisions on their claims that they would face torture or 
other mistreatment upon their return to Tunisia.  Mr. Essid Sami Ben Khemais and Mr. 
Mourad Trabelsi were deported to Tunisia in June 2008 and December 2008 respectively.  
With regard to the case of Mr. Essid Sami Ben Khemais, the ECHR held on 24 February 
2009 that Italy violated article 3 (prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading 
treatment) and article 34 (right of individual petition) of the European Convention on 
Human Rights.  Despite Court&#8217;s interim measure to suspend the planned expulsion, it is 
reported that your Excellency&#8217;s Government has forcibly expelled Mr. Ali Ben Sassi Toumi 
to Tunisia on 2 August 2009. 
</p>
<p>108. Concern is expressed about the expulsion procedures, which do not seem to 
guarantee the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>. We also urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government  
to provide for adequate safeguards to ensure that the State refrains from expulsion where 
there are substantial grounds for believing that an individual faces a real risk, following the 
removal, of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or other 
violations of fundamental human rights, which seems not to be the case neither in the 
procedures for administrative expulsion under the Security Law nor in the expulsion 
procedures under the Pisanu Law.  In light of these considerations, Article 1, Paragraph 
22M of the Security Law also raises some concern, as it appears to favor and perpetuate the 
use of expulsion.  Paragraph 22M requires the <i>Questore</i> (provincial police chief) to 
continue re-ordering expulsion where a person violates an order of expulsion, while the law 
in force before the amendments only sanctioned the person with detention.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) The extension of administrative detention for migrants 
</i></p>
<p>109. It is reported that the Law Decree significantly increases the maximum length of 
administrative detention.  While the maximum period of detention was 60 days under the 
previous legislation, the Law Decree allows renewals of 60 days up to a maximum of 6 
months by the justice of peace in cases of lack of cooperation of the irregular migrant or 
delays in obtaining the documentation from third countries that is necessary for repatriation.  
Concern is expressed that the length of the administrative detention is not proportionate to 
the objectives of such detention, particularly in light of reports that unaccompanied children 
are often subject to long administrative detention.  
</p>
<p>110. While the new maximum period of administrative detention is still in line with the 
European Union Return Directive which allows detention of irregular migrants for up to 18 
months, we are concerned that the decision of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to increase 
the maximum period of administrative detention from 60 days to 6 months appears to be 
inconsistent with the principle of non-retrogression, which requires the most careful 
consideration in the adoption of any deliberately retrogressive measure.  In addition, we are 
concerned that the scope of review for administrative detention is limited, as the review 
processes are identical to those for administrative expulsion, which do not allow for a 
review on the merits. We would like to take this opportunity to recall the recommendation 
of the Special Rapporteur on migrants that detention should only be used as a measure of 
last resort and for the shortest possible time. (A/HRC/7/12). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b>  
</p>
<p><i> (e) Restrictions on money transfer 
</i></p>
<p>111. Article 1, Paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Security Law imposes restrictive 
requirements on money transfer operations, which are often used by migrants to remit part 
of their income to their country of origin.  The provisions require that in cases of non-EU 
nationals requesting to transfer money abroad the, money transfer agents must acquire and 
store for 10 years a copy of the resident permit.  If the permit is missing, the agent must 
inform the local police within twelve hours. Failure to comply with this requirement may 
result in the cancellation of the agent&#8217;s license.  The new requirement may further foster a 
culture of denunciation vis-&#224;-vis irregular migrants.  We are also concerned that the 
requirements unduly interfere with the private and family life of migrants,  given that the 
possibility of transferring earnings, assets and pensions is essential for many migrants 
whose families rely on their support. 
</p>
<p><i> (f) Modification of the Civil Code affecting irregular migrants&#8217; right to marry 
</i></p>
<p>112. Article 1, Paragraph 15 of the Security Law amends Article 116 of the Civil Code, 
which regulates the conditions for contracting marriage for aliens.  Aliens will be obliged to 
present a document demonstrating the legality of their presence in Italian territory before 
they can enter into a marriage recognized by the Italian Republic, We are concerned that 
this requirement impairs the enjoyment of the right of irregular migrants to marry, as legal 
resident status becomes a prerequisite to the exercise of this right.    
</p>
<p><i> (g) Restrictions of the right to birth registration  
</i></p>
<p>113. Article 1, Paragraph 20 of the Security Law requires the presentation of a residence 
permit before the birth of a child can be registered. This effectively deprives the child of an 
irregular migrant of the right to personal identity and citizenship at the time of birth.  
According to information received, in the first six months of 2009 alone, there were at least 
412 children who were born to parents without a residence permit and whose birth was 
hence not registered.  While irregular migrant mothers are entitled to a residence permit for 
the entire period of pregnancy and for the first six months after a child is born pursuant to 
Article 19 of Law no. 125, this temporary permit does not seem to effectively facilitate the 
registration of irregular migrant children, as the permit is granted only if the applicant 
mother holds a valid passport or an equivalent document, which many of the irregular 
migrants do not have.  The lack of registration may have grave consequences for the child, 
as he or she may be removed from his or her mother as an &#8220;abandoned&#8221; child and 
transferred to the social services by order of the Juvenile Court.  In addition, concern is 
expressed about the right to education in light of this new legislation that would 
significantly add further barriers to the full realization of the right to education to all, 
including irregular or undocumented migrants. 
</p>
<p>114. Also according to the information received, on 6 May 2009, the Italian coast guard 
and naval vessels interdicted boat migrants on the high seas and forcibly returned them to 
Libya without conducting any screening procedures to determine whether they warranted 
international protection.  The boat migrants were allegedly disembarked on a dock in 
Tripoli, Libya, where the Libyan authorities immediately apprehended and detained them. 
This program was apparently conducted on the basis of &#8220;The Treaty of Friendship, 
Partnership and Cooperation between the Italian Republic and Great Socialist People&#8217;s 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya&#8221; (&#8220;the Friendship Pact&#8221;) concluded between Italy and Libya in 
2008 which took effect on 3 March 2009 and called for &#8220;intensifying&#8221; cooperation between 
them in &#8220;fighting terrorism, organized crime, drug trafficking and illegal immigration&#8221;.  
Pursuant to the Friendship Pact, your Excellency&#8217;s Government reportedly transferred three 
patrol boats to Libya on 14 May 2009, which would be used in joint patrols in Libyan 
territorial water and international waters in conjunction with Italian naval vessels.  The </p>

</b></p>
<p>program reportedly resulted in the interception and return of approximately 900 boat 
migrants to Libya within the first nine weeks of the commencement of the program.  
According to reports we received, the Italian naval personnel who intercepted boat migrants 
on the high seas on 1 July 2009 did not try to identify the migrants&#8217; nationalities or the 
reasons of their travel during the 12.hour interception and return operation.  Allegedly, they 
did not offer food to people who had been at sea for four days and confiscated their 
personal effects including their passports and refugee certificates issued by the delegation 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Libya.  It is also alleged that the 
Italian personnel used force, including electric shock batons and clubs, to forcibly transfer 
the migrants to the Libyan vessel, resulting in the hospitalization of six migrants.  In this 
regard, we would like to recall the statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees on 14 July 2009, which expressed serious concern that your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government&#8217;s policy, &#8220;in the absence of adequate safeguards, can prevent access to asylum 
and undermines the principle of non-refoulement&#8221;.

<p>115. Also according to the information received, on 6 May 2009, the Italian coast guard 
and naval vessels interdicted boat migrants on the high seas and forcibly returned them to 
Libya without

<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 31 December  2009  
</b></p>
<p>116. On 31 March 2010, the Government of Italy replied to the communication sent on 
31 December 2009. In its response, the Government highlighted the different types of stay 
permits available for non-EU nationals and mentioned a computer-based procedure that was  
introduced to ensure the prompt release of the stay permit. The Government also 
highlighted that in case of protection for victims of human trafficking, the permit can be 
released on the spot and explained that individuals from certain countries are not required 
to get a visa for tourism reason. The Government also informed that as of autumn 2009, a 
computer-based procedure was introduced to facilitate the regularisation of migrants, even 
without stay permit, involved in the informal labour sector. In few months, approximately 
300.000 applications were submitted according to the information provided by the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>117. In connection with the so-called &#8220;security package&#8221;, the Government explain it aims 
at curbing criminal behaviours of individuals and that no provision at all is envisaged 
against any community, group or class nor is linked to any form of discrimination and 
xenophobia:  The Government also explained that the offence of illegal entry and stay in 
Italy, was introduced with the aim of reducing the mass flow of migrants illegally staying in 
Italy. It also highlighted that the aggravating circumstances, only apply to illegal migrants 
found guilty of a main crime. It further explained that such provision responds to the 
increasing trend, observed by the Italian judicial system, on the involvement of illegal or 
irregular migrants used as a workforce by the organized crime. Along these lines it has been 
introduced the detention penalty for those who rent apartments to illegal migrants.  
</p>
<p>118. The Government informed it aims at addressing, more effectively, the illegal 
immigration (and its possible connection with organized crime) and its negative effects on 
the society as a whole, including the hundreds of thousands of legal migrants. To this end, 
the Government also informed it has introduced the payment of a minimum tax and a test of 
the Italian Language as for the release or the renewal of the stay permit.  
</p>
<p>119. In its response, the Government also explain that in connection with children, the 
Law ensures that &#8220;any foreigner, born in Italy, who has resided legally and without any 
interruption, acquires the Italian citizenship at the coming of age, provided that s/he makes 
a declaration to this end, within one year&#8221;. It highlighted that the rationale behind this 
provision is clear: the best interest of the child is saved in the event of omission or delays in 
the registration procedure by the parents. It is sufficient that the child concerned can prove </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>his/her stay, for instance by medical or school certificates. Accordingly, as for the birth 
declaration (birth register and civil status register), no residence-related document shall be 
produced as long as the submission of the declaration itself is sufficient. 
</p>
<p>120. The Government also mentioned in its response that it fully observes the relevant 
constitutional principles. No limitation to the right to health and to education has been 
introduced so far. The &#8220;security package&#8221; does not oblige physicians or school principals to 
denounce illegal migrants.  It also explained that the domestic legislation envisages the 
judicial control over the order of expulsion adopted by the administrative authority. The 
request for validation of the order is submitted to the competent judge (justice of peace), 
within 48 hours. The judge may confirm the order within the following 48 hours. In case of 
expulsion, despite the ten-year prohibition to re-enter (&#8220;security package&#8221;), the foreigner 
may always return to Italy if a stay permit for family reunification is granted or s/he is 
regularly hired. Besides a Constitutional Court&#8217;s verdict (No. 376/00) has stipulated the 
prohibition of expulsion to the spouse of pregnant women, or to the parent of a six-month 
child. 
</p>
<p>121. In its response, the Government briefly commented on sections 1.01; 1.02; 1.04 and 
1.05. It also explained that  Italy adopted Law Decree No.144/2005, which was then 
converted into law by the so-called Pisanu Law (In brief, the law allows for increased 
surveillance and enhanced police powers to gather evidence in terrorism cases, for example 
DNA for purposes of identification). It also referred to  the trend to replace the expulsion 
following the criminal conviction under Article 235 of the penal code with the so-called 
alternative measures to the detention penalty [specifically the transfer in a labour house, 
pursuant to Art. 216 of the penal code].  
</p>
<p>122. With specific regard to the reception procedures, as for the extension of the stay in 
the Identification and Expulsion Centre up to 6 months, in line with the EU Directive on 
return (by which the holding period may be extended to a maximum of 18 months), such a 
provision has been adopted with the aim of detecting the identity of the migrant without 
documents. In this regard, it has to be mentioned that it is the judge - and not the 
administrative authority &#8211; to be tasked with controlling whether it is necessary and 
legitimate to extend the stay. Such review will take place every 30/60 days.In terms of 
reception, the initial phase includes health-care services, cultural mediation, legal 
counselling, identification, examination of the relevant applications and, eventually, 
repatriation, only for those who are not entitled to stay in Italy. To this end, the Reception 
Centres have a capacity of 3.400 places. The Centres for the first-aid and reception (CPSA) 
with a 1.200-place capacity are placed in the locations most affected by landings from the 
sea, for instance in Lampedusa Island. There are thirteen Identification and Expulsion 
Centres (CIE) across the country with 1806 places.As for asylum-seekers, specific 
reception Centres (CARA) have a 2.083-place capacity. They are also intended for 
undocumented people, those who violate border controls, and foreigners detained because 
illegally staying in Italy. Specifically, as regards asylum-seekers, the decision on the 
asylum application, as a general rule, should take 35 days. After this deadline, if a decision 
is still pending, a renewable temporary residence permit is granted; and asylum-seekers can 
leave the Centre during the day. In line with the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status 
of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, Italy has established a system for providing protection to 
refugees.  
</p>
<p>123. The Government also provides temporary protection measures to individuals who 
may not qualify as refugees under the 1951 Convention, which have to be renewed 
periodically and do not ensure future permanent residence. As for the asylum procedure, no 
modifications has been introduced by the security-package (which has introduced: a fine for 
the illegal entry or residence in Italy; while the aggravating circumstance under reference 
applies only if a crime has been perpetrated by the illegal migrant; the requirement to pass a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>language test for the release of the stay permit; the extension of the stay in the CIE up to 
180 days when the expulsion order or the return cannot be enforced, inter alia, to ascertain 
the identity or to acquire due travel documents).    
</p>
<p>124. The Government also informed that to date, Italy has translated all the EU asylum-
related Directives. Within the EU framework Italy is also a party to the Dublin II 
Instruction, whose adherents generally transfer asylum applications to the first member 
country, in which the applicant was present. It also highlighted that within the EU 
framework, Italy has been developing &#8220;emergency resettlement&#8221; projects for vulnerable 
individuals, including unaccompanied minors, women at risk, victims of torture and of 
physical and sexual violence, the elderly, and people who have suffered a prolonged 
detention or with serious health diseases. As for minors, they cannot be deported unless the 
removal order applies to the entire family. As for unaccompanied minors, until the coming 
of age, they enjoy the full protection, including the right of access to education and health-
care. Victims of trafficking are granted protection and assistance, regardless of their 
cooperation with the police. They are granted a special social protection permit, while 
attention is paid to ensure their voluntary assisted return to the country of origin.  
</p>
<p>125. Furthermore, the Government mentioned that Italy has signed 30 bilateral re-
admission and cooperation agreements for the return of irregular migrants being untitled to 
international protection. These agreements are a useful tool to fight human trafficking and 
promote regular migration. It added that the integration of foreign nationals remains a key 
factor for social cohesion. Many projects are underway. In each Province there are 
Territorial Councils for immigration, which include immigrants representatives. For 
instance, a &#8220;Portal for Integration&#8221; is currently under implementation. It will be a useful 
multimedia instrument for supplying information and, at the same time, circulate all 
possible data for migrants inclusion within the Italian society, with a special focus on their 
rights and duties as well as their working opportunities in our country.  
</p>
<p>126. Finally the Government recall that in Italy regular migrant workers are fully 
protected and enjoy equal civil, economic, social and cultural rights. According to Italian 
legislation, the national collective contract of employment signed with organizations 
representing workers and associations of employers, aims at jointly pre-regulate the 
minimum economic and regulatory issues applicable to all workers, including migrant 
workers. Thus several social protection measures, including social benefits, are ensured to 
all migrant workers.

<p>127. On 20 October 2009 the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
together with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery sent an urgent 
appeal to the government concerning an Uzbek boy who was trafficked to Kazakhstan to 
work in a forced labor situation and whose whereabouts are currently unknown.  
</p>
<p>128. According to the information received, Mr. <b>B.I</b>, aged 17, is a resident of the Khiva 
town of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan.  In May 2008, Mr. B.I and four young Uzbek 
men were recruited by Mr. Bakhtiyor Bekchanov, a citizen of Uzbekistan aged 56, to travel 
to Kazakhstan as labor migrants.  Mr. Bekchanov promised them and their parents that he 
would take care of their employment in Kazakhstan.  He also assured them that being the 
oldest in the group; he would look after the young men during their stay in Kazakhstan. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>129. Upon their arrival in Kazakhstan, the young men were taken to a house of Mr. 
Nurlibek Mamatov, located in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast.  Mr. Mamatov is a 
citizen of Kazakhstan and a member of the local council in Zhalagash aul.  Mr. Bekchanov 
received $5,000 from Mr. Mamatov in exchange of the young men and handed over their 
passports to Mr. Mamatov before he disappeared.  The young men were forced to carry out 
a variety of work in Mr. Mamatov&#8217;s house, including construction work.  They were forced 
to work under harsh conditions and without appropriate food and compensation.  
Approximately two months after the young men left for Kazakhstan, Mr. Bekchanov 
appeared in Khiva.  Bekzod&#8217;s mother went to see Mr. Bekchanov to ask how her son was.  
Mr. Bekchanov assured the mother that all the young men were well and that they would 
soon be sending money they earned in Kazakhstan.  However, Bekzod&#8217;s mother never 
heard from her son, as all the young men were not given any opportunity to contact their 
families in Uzbekistan.  The young men except Bekzod eventually managed to escape the 
house and return to Khiva. 
</p>
<p>130. In December 2008, B&#8217;s mother lodged an appeal to the Department of Internal 
Affairs in the Khiva district and to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 
Uzbekistan to search for her son.  However, she did not receive any responses from the 
authorities.  Concerned for her son&#8217;s safety and desperate to find him, she travelled to Mr. 
Mamatov&#8217;s house in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast on 12 June 2009.  When she 
arrived at Mr. Mamatov&#8217;s house, he shouted at her in the Kazakh language, throwing the 
passports of the young Uzbek men who were forced to work in his house.  He told her that 
B was taken by a Police Major named &#8220;Abdurakhmon&#8221; from Shimkent city in Yuzhno-
Kazakhstanskaya oblast.

<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 20 October 2009 
</b></p>
<p>132. On 20 December 2010, the Government replied to the communication sent on 20 
October 2009 highlighting that the internal affairs organs of the Republic of Kazakhstan are 
currently conducting investigations in order to ascertain the facts regarding the economic 
exploitation of a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan by N.V. Manbayev (Mamatov), a 
citizen of the Republic of Kazakhstan. With a view to making a thorough and objective 
appraisal of the evidence and issuing a procedural ruling, the Office of the Procurator and 
the Department of Internal Affairs of the province of Kyzylorda are preparing a request to 
the law enforcement agencies of the Republic of Uzbekistan that they question B. I in order 
to fully clarify the circumstances of the case. 
</p>
<p>133. The Government also highlighted that the Criminal Police Committee of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan received an application from Zulaikho 
Kalandarova and Nazhot, a human rights group based in Khorezm which belongs to the 
Rapid Response Group of Uzbekistan, for assistance in the search for B. I, born in 1991. It 
further added that the internal affairs agencies of Kazakhstan spearheaded the hunt for the 
missing person by undertaking criminal investigations and inquiries, and medical 
establishments likewise made some checks in an endeavour to establish his whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>134. In its response, the Government highlighted that pursuant to paragraph 27 of the 
Instruction concerning a unified procedure for conducting interstate searches for persons, 
which was approved by the decision of the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs of the 
States Parties of the Commonwealth of Independent States of 7 September 2007, the above-
mentioned application was forwarded to the Central Department for Criminal Investigation 
and Counterterrorism of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan with a view to 
initiating investigations and an international search for B. I. At the same time an answer 
was sent to Nazhot and Z. Kalandarova. It further highlighted that the staff of the internal 
affairs agencies of Kazakhstan again contacted Nazhot in order to exchange information on 
B. I&#8217;s whereabouts. According to a letter from Nazhot dated 3 December 2009, B. I was 
then at home (60 Shokhimardon Street, Shokhimardon community, Khiva district, province 
of Khorezm, Uzbekistan). 
</p>
<p>135. The Government also highlighted that it was established that, in May 2008, 
Bakhtiyar Bekchanov, a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan, approached them in order to 
propose the services of his 10-person &#8220;team&#8221; to work on building sites &#8211; to which N. 
Manbayev agreed. In June 2008 B. Bekchanov and his building team, minus B. I, who was 
then on another of N. Manbayev&#8217;s building sites, received the sum of US$ 3,000 and 
vanished without completing the building. B. I stayed on for two to three months. During 
that time he regularly spoke to his parents by telephone. He received food and clothing and 
did odd jobs. They did not subject him to pressure or force. In the autumn of 2008, B. 
Ikramov left the house and did not return. N. Manbayev tried in vain to find him. In the 
spring of 2009, B. I&#8217;s mother came to the town of Kyzylorda to search for her son. On 
meeting her, N. Manbayev explained that B. I had worked for him and lived at his house, 
but that he did not possess any information regarding his current whereabouts. B. I did not 
lay a complaint with law enforcement agencies regarding any unlawful actions on the part 
of B. Manbayev or officials of the Department of Internal Affairs of South Kazakhstan or 
the province of Kyzylorda. The Government also provided information and contact details 
on Abdrakhman Kolebayevich Serkebayev, born in 1956 and highlighted that no 
information is available about any investigations, judicial or other inquiries in relation to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b>  
</p>
<p>this case. According to information supplied by the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
in Uzbekistan, it did not receive any complaints or applications from B. Ikramov&#8217;s mother, 
or anyone else, in connection with this case at any point in 2008. 
</p>
<p>136. The Government also referred to some of the provision of the code of criminal 
procedure, notably article 163 and 162, paragraphs 1 and 2 and described the governmental 
structure in place to deal with human trafficking. . 
</p>
<p>137. In its response, the Government also highlighted it is gradually implementing plans 
to combat and prevent crimes related to human smuggling  and have launched information 
campaigns to counter human trafficking.  It further informed that in 2009, as a result of the 
latest steps, anti-trafficking units initiated criminal proceedings in 265 cases. The 
Government also provided extensive information on the activities and programmes being 
implemented in its territory. 
</p>
<p>138. Finally the Government informed that according to the statistical data supplied by 
the Legal Statistics Committee and in particular by the Office of the Procurator General on 
enforceable sentences for crimes under article 128 of the Criminal Code (human 
trafficking), the number of convictions was as follows: in 2007, three persons; in 2008, five 
persons; and in the first nine months of 2009, five persons. The number of convictions for 
crimes under article 133 of the Criminal Code (trafficking in minors) was as follows: in 
2007, three persons; in 2008, one person; and in the first nine months of 2009, six persons.

<p>which stated that the aforementioned accused who was employed as a domestic by the 
family of the victim Dala Bassam Abd Al-Hadi AL-Nigi intended to take revenge against 
the victim on account of their many quarrels and their unwillingness to accept the scolding 
she received from the victim. She decided to kill her and prepared a large knife for the 
purpose as well as pair of nylon gloves to remove the traces left by lier hand on the knife. 
Having waited until the victim, was in bed alone, she went to her bedroom at dawn and 
attacked her while she was asleep, stabbing lier repeatedly until she was dead. According to 
the report of the forensic physician, the victim&#8217;s death was attributable to stabs wounds to 
the chest area. 
</p>
<p>143. The Government also highlights that the public prosecutor office issued a decision 
on 19 August 2007 to refer the accused to the criminal court on the charge of intentional 
and premeditated homicide of the victim. It added that on 13th April 2008, the criminal 
court decided adversarially to sentence the accused to death, relying on the factual 
testimony of witnesses, supported by the conclusions of the forensic physician&#8217;s report on 
the victim, the findings of the criminal evidence report (Masrah Division), the result of the 
public prosecutor&#8217;s office examination of the scene of the crime and the conclusions of the

acercado por la noche a la Casa del Migrante y habr&#237;a roto y tirado al suelo el medidor de 
luz, interrumpiendo con ello el abastecimiento de energ&#237;a el&#233;ctrica del lugar.  </p>

<p>146. Tambi&#233;n se informa que a partir del 6 de octubre la poblaci&#243;n migrante que se 
alberga en la Casa del Migrante de Bel&#233;n, habr&#237;a disminuido por miedo represalias por 
parte de algunos grupos de la poblaci&#243;n de Saltillo.  
</p>
<p>147. Finalmente, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 6 de octubre, el Congreso de Coahuila 
habr&#237;a emitido un punto de acuerdo mediante el cual se solicita al Congreso de la Uni&#243;n, 
&quot;para que se realicen las propuestas de modificaci&#243;n a la Ley General de Poblaci&#243;n con la 
finalidad de regular en forma clara la situaci&#243;n de las llamadas casas del migrante, sin 
perjudicar los derechos humanos de los extranjeros que de un modo u otro transitan o 
radican en [M&#233;xico].&quot; El Relator Especial sobre los derechos humanos de los migrantes 
lamenta que la respuesta del gobierno incluya una acci&#243;n legislativa (la modificaci&#243;n de la 
Ley General de Poblaci&#243;n) que esta fuera de la competencia del Poder Ejecutivo, el cual si 
tiene competencia para actuar directamente sobre las medidas de protecci&#243;n de los derechos 
humanos a los que se refiere este llamado de urgencia. 
</p>
<p>148. Aunque la solicitud realizada al Congreso en dicho instrumento jur&#237;dico es de 
car&#225;cter general, se ha llamado nuestra atenci&#243;n sobre algunos de los elementos contenidos 
en la exposici&#243;n de motivos del punto de acuerdo, en los que se difundir&#237;an elementos de 
intolerancia contra las casas de migrantes y los migrantes irregulares.   
</p>
<p>149. Los Relatores Especiales solicitaron informaci&#243;n sobre los asuntos mencionados a 
continuaci&#243;n,  siempre y cuando sean aplicables al caso en cuesti&#243;n: 
</p>
<p>1. &#191;Son exactos los hechos a los que se refieren las alegaciones descritas?

<p><b>  Communication sent on 14 October 2009 
</b></p>
<p>150. El 14 de octubre de 2009, el Relator Especial sobre los derechos humanos de los 
migrantes junto con el Relator Especial sobre la tortura y otros tratos o penas crueles, 
inhumanos o degradantes y el Relator Especial sobre las ejecuciones extrajudiciales, 
sumarias o arbitrarias, enviaron un llamado de urgencia al Gobierno de M&#233;xico en relaci&#243;n 
con el deceso de un migrante irregular y las lesiones personales ocasionadas a seis 
migrantes cerca de Comit&#225;n, en el estado de Chiapas.  
</p>
<p>151. De conformidad con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 18 de Septiembre, las fuerzas de 
seguridad mexicanas dispararon contra una camioneta  pick-up que transportaba a siete 
migrantes irregulares de nacionalidades ecuatoriana y salvadore&#241;a cuando cruzaban la 
frontera cerca de Comit&#225;n, en el estado de Chiapas.  
</p>
<p>152. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n proporcionada, el conductor de la camioneta pick-up en donde 
se transportaban los migrantes irregulares habr&#237;a aminorado la marcha al acercarse a un 
control de seguridad, pero habr&#237;a acelerado al ver la orden de alto de la Polic&#237;a. Los agentes 
de control de seguridad habr&#237;an salido tras ellos y presuntamente habr&#237;an abierto fuego </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>contra el veh&#237;culo, que, alcanzado por reiterados disparos, habr&#237;a dejado de funcionar a los 
pocos minutos.  
</p>
<p>153. Como resultado, uno de los siete migrantes, el se&#241;or V&#237;ctor Alexander Melgar 
Lemus, nacional de El Salvador, habr&#237;a muerto y los seis restantes habr&#237;an resultado  
heridos. Tres de los migrantes sobrevivientes habr&#237;an escapado de las autoridades 
mexicanas despu&#233;s de los disparos ocurridos en un control militar. Los tres migrantes que 
habr&#237;an quedado a disposici&#243;n de las autoridades mexicanas habr&#237;an sido interrogados por 
agentes de polic&#237;a y militares y presuntamente reportar&#237;an haber sido pateados y golpeados 
con las culatas de sus armas. Uno de los migrantes habr&#237;a sido golpeado directamente en 
una herida de bala. Dos de los migrantes se hallar&#237;an presuntamente bajo vigilancia policial 
en un hospital donde estar&#237;an siendo atendidos, y el otro, un ciudadano ecuatoriano, se 
hallar&#237;a recluido en espera de su repatriaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>154. Se teme por la seguridad de los migrantes que est&#225;n recibiendo atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica, 
frente a posibles acciones encaminadas a impedir la denuncia de violencia de car&#225;cter 
policial ya que, aunque la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Derechos Humanos de M&#233;xico habr&#237;a 
abierto una investigaci&#243;n sobre los hechos, no se habr&#237;an iniciado investigaciones sobre el 
uso desproporcionado de la fuerza por parte de las autoridades de control policial.  Se teme 
tambi&#233;n que los migrantes sobrevivientes puedan ser repatriados a sus pa&#237;ses de origen 
antes de que los hechos hayan sido completamente clarificados. 
</p>
<p>155. Los Relatores Especiales solicitaron informaci&#243;n sobre los asuntos mencionados a 
continuaci&#243;n,  siempre y cuando sean aplicables al caso en cuesti&#243;n: 
</p>
<p>1. &#191;Son exactos los hechos a los que se refieren las alegaciones descritas? 
</p>
<p>2. Por favor proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada sobre las investigaciones 
iniciadas en relaci&#243;n con el caso, incluyendo los resultados de ex&#225;menes m&#233;dicos, en 
caso de que se hubieran llevado a cabo.  
</p>
<p>3. Por favor proporcione informaci&#243;n sobre las diligencias judiciales y, las 
sanciones de car&#225;cter penal, en caso de que hayan sido adoptadas contra el o los 
presuntos culpables.

administrativas o de otro car&#225;cter que han sido o ser&#225;n adoptadas con miras a

</p>
<p>5. Quisi&#233;ramos agradecer al Gobierno de su Excelencia por la informaci&#243;n 
detallada que ha proporcionado en su carta del 29 de avril de 2009 en relaci&#243;n con la 
muerte de Norma Dut&#225;n Parrapi, Levis Clarisa Moina y Kevin P&#233;rez Carias, otros 
tres migrantes aparentemente matados por la Polic&#237;a Estatal Preventiva en Chiapas 
en enero de 2009 en circunstancias similares a las del deceso de V&#237;ctor Alexander 
Melgar Lemus. Preguntar&#237;amos que se nos mantenga informando del progreso de las 
investigaciones y del proceso penal mencionado en la respuesta su Gobierno, del 
progreso de la queja iniciada por la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos, y 
de los esfuerzos para compensar las familias de los migrantes difuntos. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 14 October 2009  
</b></p>
<p>156. El 10 de Mayo de 2010, el Gobierno de M&#233;xico respondi&#243; al llamado urgente 
presentado el 14 de octubre de 2009, en relaci&#243;n con la muerte de V&#237;ctor Alexander Melgar 
Lemus, migrante salvadore&#241;o as&#237; como a la situaci&#243;n de 6 migrantes centroamericanos. Al 
respecto, el Gobierno se&#241;alo que el 18 de septiembre de 2009, elementos de la polic&#237;a 
preventiva de la Secretar&#237;a de Seguridad P&#250;blica y Protecci&#243;n Ciudadana del estado de 
Chiapas ubicados en un puesto de control en el municipio de Comit&#225;n de Dom&#237;nguez, 
Chiapas, dispararon en contra de una camioneta de redilas por la negativa del conductor </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>40</b>  
</p>
<p>para detenerse; posteriormente se supo que en dicha camioneta transportaba en la parte 
posterior a 7 migrantes indocumentados y armamento de uso exclusivo del Ej&#233;rcito 
mexicano. En el evento, el se&#241;or Melgar Lemus perdi&#243; la vida, y tres de los seis migrantes 
resultaron heridos. 
</p>
<p>157. El Gobierno tambi&#233;n se&#241;al&#243; que se mismo d&#237;a, la Fiscal&#237;a de Distrito Fronterizo 
Sierra de la Procuradur&#237;a General de Justicia del estado de Chiapas, inici&#243; la averiguaci&#243;n 
previa 580/FS94-M4/2009 por los delitos de homicidio en agravio del se&#241;or Melgar Lemus 
(de nacionalidad salvadore&#241;a) y lesiones en agravio de los se&#241;ores Freddy Enrique Mancilla 
Mancilla (de nacionalidad salvadore&#241;a), Gustavo Mall&#233;n Cela y Edgar Andreo Guncay 
Zu&#241;a (de nacionalidad ecutoriana), la cual se encuentra integrada, entre otras, por las 
siguientes actuaciones:diligencia de identificaci&#243;n y entrega del cad&#225;ver; necropsias 
practicada por dos m&#233;dicos peritos del servicio m&#233;dico forense; informe de investigaci&#243;n 
rendido por la polic&#237;a ministerial; constancia mediante la cual se solicit&#243; al Subsecretario de 
Cooperaci&#243;n Internacional y Asuntos Migratorios del estado de Chiapas que por su 
conducto se informe a los representantes de los consulados de El Salvador y Ecuador los 
apoyos jur&#237;dicos y m&#233;dicos brindados por las autoridades estatales a los migrantes 
indocumentados, as&#237; como lo relativo al traslado del cad&#225;ver a su pa&#237;s de origen. 
</p>
<p>158. De conformidad con la respuesta proporcionada, de las pesquisas realizadas durante 
las investigaciones se encontr&#243; en la parte posterior de la camioneta armamento de uso 
exclusivo del Ej&#233;rcito mexicano (delito Federal) lo que motiv&#243; que la Fiscal&#237;a remitiera la 
averiguaci&#243;n previa a la Procuradur&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica (PGR) para continuar con las 
investigaciones.  La Comisi&#243;n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos inici&#243; una queja la cual 
se encuentra en tr&#225;mite ante la Quinta Visitadur&#237;a General. 
</p>
<p>159. As&#237; mismo, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; en su respuesta que la averiguaci&#243;n previa integrada 
por la PGR a&#250;n se encuentra en la etapa de an&#225;lisis para emitir la determinaci&#243;n que 
conforme a derecho proceda. Igualmente se&#241;al&#243; que la pol&#237;tica exterior de M&#233;xico en 
materia de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos de los migrantes tiene como 
fundamento la universalidad de estos derechos, independientemente de la situaci&#243;n 
migratoria, el principio de la responsabilidad compartida, el fortalecimiento de la 
cooperaci&#243;n internacional y la no criminalizaci&#243;n de la migraci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>160. El Gobierno destac&#243; igualmente el rol del Instituto Nacional de Migraci&#243;n (INM)y 
su &#8220;Programa de Reordenamiento de la Frontera Sur&#8221; que facilita la documentaci&#243;n y 
vigilancia de los flujos migratorios.  Tambi&#233;n se&#241;alo que en el mes de marzo de 2008 el 
INM introdujo la Forma Migratoria para Trabajadores Fronterizos que permite el ingreso 
documentado de trabajadores de Guatemala y Belice para laborar en los estados de Chiapas, 
Campeche, Tabasco y Quintana Roo. Bajo este Programa se ampli&#243; la Forma Migratoria de 
Visitantes Locales, que otorga facilidades a los visitantes locales guatemaltecos, a fin de 
que la poblaci&#243;n transfronteriza pueda ingresar en tr&#225;nsito local en los estados de Chiapas, 
Tabasco y Campeche. El Gobierno tambi&#233;n destac&#243; esfuerzos para asegurar que la 
repatriaci&#243;n de nacionales centroamericanos v&#237;a terrestre se lleve a cabo de manera 
ordenada, digna, &#225;gil y segura, con base en acuerdos con Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras 
y Nicaragua. De igual manera, destaco el convenio suscrito entre el Sistema para el 
Desarrollo Integral de la Familia Chiapas y la Comisi&#243;n Mexicana de Ayuda a Refugiados 
y las labores del albergue para menores de edad de Sistema para el Desarrollo Integral de la 
Familia Chiapas, ubicado en el municipio de Tapachula, el cual se coordina con la 
delegaci&#243;n del INM que a su vez, cuenta con la estaci&#243;n migratoria modelo. Esta &#250;ltima 
tiene un &#225;rea especializada en la atenci&#243;n de menores de edad, de tal forma que los ni&#241;os, 
ni&#241;as y adolescentes son canalizados en cualquiera de las dos instancias, dependiendo de su 
edad y sexo. 
</p>
<p>161. Finalmente, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que en el mes de julio de 2008 entr&#243; en vigor la 
reforma a la Ley General de Poblaci&#243;n que despenaliza la migraci&#243;n indocumentada, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1

eliminar abusos contra migrantes indocumentados.

<p><b>  Communication sent on 9 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>162. El 9 de septiembre de 2009, el Relator Especial sobre los derechos humanos de los 
migrantes junto con el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de 
opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n y la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los 
derechos humanos, enviaron un llamado de urgencia en relaci&#243;n con las amenazas contra el 
padre Alejandro Solalinde Guerra, el Sr. David Alvarez Vargas, la Sra. Areli Palomo 
Contreras y otros miembros del Alberge del Migrante Hermanos en el Camino. El padre 
Solalinde Guerra es director del Albergue del Migrante Hermanos en el Camino de la 
Esperanza y Coordinador de la Zona Sur de la Dimensi&#243;n Pastoral de la Movilidad Humana 
de la Conferencia Episcopal Mexicana. El Sr. Alvarez Vargas es asistente en el mismo 
Albergue del Migrante. La Sra. Palomo Contreras es operadora del Registro Nacional de 
Agresiones a Migrantes y ayuda en el Albergue del Migrante Hermanos en el Camino de la 
Esperanza. El Albergue del Migrante Hermanos en el Camino brinda ayuda humanitaria a 
personas migrantes extranjeras que se ven obligadas a cruzar por M&#233;xico con el fin de 
llegar a los Estados Unidos de Am&#233;rica. Adem&#225;s, el padre Solalinde Guerra ha denunciado 
p&#250;blicamente en varias ocasiones las violaciones de derechos humanos presuntamente 
cometidas por miembros de la polic&#237;a y de las fuerzas de seguridad en contra de los 
migrantes en M&#233;xico. 
</p>
<p>163. Con fecha del 7 de julio de 2008, la Relatora sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de 
derechos humanos y el Relator sobre los derechos de las personas migrantes emitieron un 
llamamiento urgente al Gobierno Mexicano en relaci&#243;n con las agresiones en contra del 
padre Alejandro Solalinde Guerra. 
</p>
<p>164. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas el 22 de julio de 2009, dos hombres no 
identificados, supuestamente pertenecientes a una banda de la delincuencia organizada 
denominada &#8220;Los Zetas&#8221;, habr&#237;an allanado el Albergue del Migrante buscando a un grupo 
de migrantes que recib&#237;a ayuda del Albergue con la intenci&#243;n de secuestrarlos. Sin embargo 
los migrantes se habr&#237;an escondido.  
</p>
<p>165. El 21 de julio, cuatro hombres armados con pistolas habr&#237;an entrado por la fuerza al 
Albergue nuevamente buscando a otro grupo de migrantes. Sin embargo, este grupo 
tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a logrado esconderse.  
</p>
<p>166. El 11 de julio de 2009, aproximadamente a las 23:00 horas de la noche, un grupo de 
personas, supuestamente procedentes de Veracruz y pertenecientes a &#8220;Los Zetas&#8221;, habr&#237;an 
allanado el Albergue con la intenci&#243;n de raptar a un grupo de migrantes de Honduras. Esa 
misma noche, los agresores habr&#237;an subido a un tren en el que viajaban varios migrantes y 
se habr&#237;an llevado a un grupo de migrantes. 
</p>
<p>167. Las acciones anteriormente mencionadas habr&#237;an puesto en riesgo a los miembros 
del Albergue del Migrante as&#237; como a los migrantes que se encontraban all&#237;. Adem&#225;s, 
miembros del equipo que trabaja en el Albergue del Migrante habr&#237;an recibido amenazas de 
muerte y supuestamente se encuentran en una situaci&#243;n altamente riesgosa. El mayor factor 
de riesgo lo constituyen las organizaciones de la delincuencia organizada como &#8220;los Zetas&#8221;; 
el refugio y atenci&#243;n que ofrece el Albergue, as&#237; como su actividad de denuncia y 
promoci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, implica para los delincuentes un freno en sus 
actividades de extorsi&#243;n a las personas migrantes.  
</p>
<p>168. A pesar de que miembros del Albergue del Migrante habr&#237;an hecho denuncias 
formales ante las instancias de Procuraci&#243;n de Justicia, ni las autoridades locales, ni las 
federales habr&#237;an tomado las medidas necesarias para brindar la protecci&#243;n y seguridad 
necesarias para el personal del Albergue y los migrantes. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>169. Se teme que el padre Solalinde Guerra, el Sr. Alvarez Vargas, la Sra. Palomo 
Contreras y otros miembros del Alberge del Migrante &#8220;Hermanos en el Camino&#8221; est&#233;n en 
riesgo como resultado directo de su trabajo en defensa de los derechos humanos, en 
particular de los derechos de migrantes. Adem&#225;s, se expresa una profunda preocupaci&#243;n por 
la integridad psicol&#243;gica y f&#237;sica de todos los miembros del Albergue del Migrante 
&#8220;Hermanos en el Camino&#8221;. Estos actos de hostigamiento e intimidaci&#243;n, de ser 
confirmados, se enmarcan en un contexto de gran vulnerabilidad de los migrantes en 
M&#233;xico que amenaza tambi&#233;n aquellos que trabajan para la defensa de sus derechos. 
</p>
<p>170. Los Relatores Especiales solicitaron la cooperaci&#243;n y observaciones del Gobierno 
sobre los asuntos siguientes, siempre y cuando sean aplicables al caso en cuesti&#243;n:

<p>171. El 10 de Mayo de 2010, el Gobierno de M&#233;xico respondi&#243; al llamado urgente 
enviado por los Relatores Especiales el 9 de septiembre de 2009. De conformidad con la 
respuesta del Gobierno, informaci&#243;n proporcionada por el Instituto Nacional de Migraci&#243;n 
(INM), diversos medios de comunicaci&#243;n locales publicaron notas period&#237;sticas que 
habitantes de Ciudad Ixtepec, Oaxaca, exigieron al sacerdote Alejandro Solalinde Guerra, 
director del albergue del migrante &#8220;Hermanos en el Camino de la Esperanza&#8221; y coordinador 
de la zona sur de la Dimensi&#243;n Pastoral de la Movilidad Humana de la Conferencia 
Episcopal Mexicana, el cierre del albergue de manera definitiva y adem&#225;s amenazaron que 
de no hacerlo en un plazo de cinco d&#237;as, incendiar&#237;an el albergue. La exigencia de los 
habitantes de dicho municipio obedeci&#243; a la denuncia presentada ante la Procuradur&#237;a 
General de Justicia del estado de Oaxaca (PGJ Oax), el 20 de junio de 2008 por parte de la 
Sra. Nora Luz Solano Rivera en contra del nacional nicarag&#252;ense Jaime Francisco Alvarado 
Flores2, por el delito de violaci&#243;n en perjuicio de su hija de seis a&#241;os de edad, ocurrido en 
su domicilio particular ubicado a un kil&#243;metro del albergue. 
</p>
<p>172. La informaci&#243;n proporcionada se&#241;ala que el sacerdote Alejandro Solalinde se&#241;al&#243; a 
los habitantes que no era posible acceder a su requerimiento debido a que el albergue se 
encuentra a cargo de la Dimensi&#243;n Pastoral de la Movilidad Humana, &#225;rea Pastoral de 
Migrantes de la Di&#243;cesis de Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, cuya finalidad es ofrecer alimentaci&#243;n, 
albergue y atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica a las personas migrantes procedentes de Guatemala, Honduras, 
El Salvador y Nicaragua, en tr&#225;nsito temporal en M&#233;xico con rumbo hacia los Estados 
Unidos de Am&#233;rica. Al tener conocimiento de las exigencias, el Arzobispo de Tijuana, 
responsable de la Dimensi&#243;n Pastoral de la Movilidad Humana expres&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n 
por la seguridad del sacerdote y solicit&#243; a representantes del INM la implementaci&#243;n de las 
medidas de seguridad para la protecci&#243;n del sacerdote, de los migrantes que la habitan y del

<p>personal que lo auxilia. Por su parte, el sacerdote Solalinde solicit&#243; ayuda al presidente 
municipal de Ciudad Ixtepec, Oaxaca para garantizar la seguridad del albergue. 
</p>
<p>173. En su respuesta, el Gobierno se&#241;ala que en atenci&#243;n a la petici&#243;n formulada por el 
Arzobispo, el 26 de junio de 2008, la delegada regional del INM en el estado de Oaxaca 
solicit&#243; al Secretario de Seguridad P&#250;blica Federal (SSP) y al Secretario de Protecci&#243;n 
Ciudadana del estado de Oaxaca, brindaran medidas de seguridad para resguardar el orden 
de la comunidad y del albergue en caso de suscitarse hechos violentos que pusieran en 
riesgo la salud, integridad y vida del sacerdote Solalinde, de los migrantes albergados, as&#237; 
como los habitantes del municipio de Ciudad Ixtepec, Oaxaca. 
</p>
<p>174. As&#237; mismo, el Gobierno destaca que el 27 de junio de 2008, en las oficinas del 
palacio municipal de Ixtepec, Oaxaca, se celebr&#243; una mesa de di&#225;logo con la participaci&#243;n 
del sacerdote Alejandro Solalinde, del  presidente municipal y sus colaboradores, el

comisi&#243;n conformada por los vecinos del municipio. 
</p>
<p>175. El Gobierno tambi&#233;n se&#241;ala en su respuesta que la comisi&#243;n de vecinos mostr&#243; su 
inconformidad ante los hechos en los que se vio involucrado el nicarag&#252;ense Alvarado

funcionamiento del albergue.Al finalizar la reuni&#243;n se concertaron los siguientes acuerdos: 
Se solicit&#243; apoyo de la polic&#237;a estatal y municipal con el objeto de incrementar la seguridad

<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on15 January 2010 
</b></p>
<p>178. On 15 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent an 
allegation letter to the government concerning Mr. Minod Moktan as well as alleged human 
rights violations of migrant workers, including alleged violations of the right to freedom of 
expression and the right to liberty and security of the person. 
</p>
<p>179. According to the information received, Mr. Minod Moktan, a Nepalese citizen and 
human rights activist, arrived in South Korea in February 1992 on a short-term tourist visa.  
Mr. Moktan worked as a manual laborer in South Korea from 1992 until 2003. In 2004, he </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>reportedly founded a band in South Korea called &#8220;Stop Crackdown Band&#8221;. In 2005, he 
carried out educational programme on labour rights for migrants and also appeared on 
several television news programme to discuss the discrimination faced by migrant workers 
and the importance of cross-cultural awareness. He was reportedly one of the founders of 
the Migrant Workers TV (&#8220;MWTV&#8221;), a television station that broadcasts news related to 
migrants in South Korea in several languages. Between 2007 and 2008, he served as Co-
chair of MWTV and in 2009 as Director of the MWTV Film Production Team.  Mr. 
Moktan was reportedly arrested on 8 October 2009 at 10 a.m. in front of his office building 
by officers of the Seoul immigration authorities. He was allegedly deported to Nepal on 23 
October, 2009. Concern is expressed that the arrest and deportation of Mr. Moktan are 
linked to his activity in favour of labour rights for migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>180. These allegations are of particular concern, when considered in light of the 
information received which indicates that there exists a pattern of excessive use of force 
against and arbitrary arrest of irregular migrants by immigration officials.  Between January 
and May 2009, the Immigration Service has reportedly arrested and detained 11,818 
irregular migrant workers, and has deported 11,318 irregular migrants.  Reports indicate 
that immigration officials often failed to follow arrest procedures in cases of irregular 
migrant workers and even use violence to execute the arrest.  According to the information 
received, in June and July 2009, immigration officials conducted raids in Ansan, an area 
reportedly heavily populated by migrant workers.  They reportedly entered private houses 
without any warrants and without identifying themselves.  Some migrant workers 
reportedly suffered from injuries due to the excessive use of force by the immigration 
officials in those instances. 
</p>
<p>181. The Special Rapporteurs requested the Government's cooperation and observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide information concerning the legal grounds for the arrest and 
deportation of Mr. Moktan and how these measures are compatible with 
international norms and standards   
</p>
<p>3. Please provide information on measures undertaken by your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to guarantee the rights and freedoms of Mr. Limbu and Mr. Sabur as 
referred to in the previous communication dated 16 May 2008.  Please indicate 
whether or not they were deported to their countries of origin and if so, on what 
grounds. 
</p>
<p>4. Please provide information on the measures taken to ensure that migrants&#8217; 
rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association are respected in 
accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>5. Please provide information on the existing legal framework, policies and 
regulations to ensure that immigration and law enforcement officials duly respect 
international human rights standards concerning arrest procedures and the use of 
force. Please also provide information on measures or efforts undertaken by your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to implement such a legal framework, policies and 
regulations in practice. 
</p>
<p>6. Please indicate whether the victims or the families of the victims have access 
to effective remedies, including compensation for damages resulting from the 
alleged arbitrary arrest and violence committed against them. </p>

<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on15 January 2010 
</b></p>
<p>182. On 13 April 2010, the Government replied to the communication sent on 15 January 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>183. On 13 April 2010, the Government replied to the communication sent on 15 January 
2010 denying the veracity of the allegation that immigration officials entered a <i>private 
</i>residence in the Ansan area, on 10 July 2009, without any warrant-and without identifying 
themselves. It highlighted that the immigration official who was in charge of the 
enforcement operation at the time attempted to verify the identity of suspicious foreigners 
in the street after presenting his identification<i>. </i>However, Mr. Moktan abruptly ran away to a 
nearby residence in order to avoid the enforcement operation., and the official entered.the 
private house in the process of chasing him. lt is true that a few of the immigrant workers 
were injured. These injuries occurred accidentally in the process of the attempt to arrest <i>the 
escaping </i>irregular migrants, and the Immigration Service took disciplinary measures 
against <i>the officials </i>concerned and carried out special training in that regard.  
</p>
<p>184. In its response, the Government highlighted that the allegation regarding an 
excessive use of force against and arbitrary arrest of irregular migrants by immigrant 
officials is inaccurate and describes what it considers the legal Grounds for the Custody and 
Deportation of Mr. Moktan. It also highlighted that Mr Moktan had a past record of 
escaping in early 2000 from the temporary release which was granted to him by his request 
on the condition that he would leave the country as soon as he received his overdue wages. 
The judgment was finally settled on 15th January 2010. 
</p>
<p>185. In its response, the government stresses it guarantees freedom of speech and the 
press, and Freedom of assembly and association under Article 21 of the constitution. It also 
mentions that the Act on the Employment, of Foreign Workers stipulates that legally 
employed foreigners are to be accorded equal treatment, with domestic workers, and 
therefore foreign workers are allowed to freely organize a trade union or join one in 
accordance with the Trade Union and Labor Relations Adjustment Act. It adds that illegal 
foreign workers, however, are not allowed to join a trade union or to organize one under the 
Trade Union and Labor Relations Adjustment Act. They are prohibited from working 
pursuant to the immigration Control Act, and thus can not be seen as workers entitled to 
trade union rights.  
</p>
<p>186. The Government also informed that the due procedure for enforcement Operation 
directed at Immigration Offenders&quot; and &quot;General Standards for the Protection of human 
Rights&quot; were introduced and. have been implemented in order to enhance the protection of 
hurnan rights and compliance with due process. The Directive sets out detailed provisions 
to ensure enforcement operations, investigations and evaluations of violation of the law, 
and the use of tools for arrest and restraining devices are conducted in such a manner as to 
fully protect human rights.  
</p>
<p>187. Finally, the Government explained that in a case alleged existence of arbitrary arrest 
and violence by law enforcement officials, the alleged victims and their families are able to 
file a civil suit against the officials concerned and pursue a state litigation in accordance 
with the State Compensation Act. A complaint or lawsuit can also be brought to 
investigation agencies, and the Government of the Republic of Korea, if necessary, 
postpones the deportation or permits a temporary release from custody. Furthermore, the 
Korea Legal Aid Corporation provides legal aid services to irregular migrants and their 
families in the same manner as it does to citizens of the Republic of Korea.  </p>

<p><b>  Communication sent on 10 December 2009  
</b></p>
<p>188. On 10 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, 
together with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance brought to the attention of the 
Government information they have received concerning xenophobic violence targeting 
3000 foreign migrant workers in de Doorns, Western Cape province.  
</p>
<p>189. According to the allegations received, on 17 November 2009, a mob attacked and 
demolished the shacks in an informal settlement of foreign workers, mainly Zimbabweans, 
in the town of De Doorns. The foreign workers were also prevented from going to work. 
Reportedly, violence erupted following allegations that foreign migrant workers were 
willing to work for less than the minimum wage (R60) and without any legal contracts. 
They were therefore accused of stealing jobs from local residents.  
</p>
<p>190. The situation would have been allegedly tense since 13 November 2009, following a 
violent quarrel involving Zimbabweans in a local tavern. After that incident, some 68 
Zimbabweans would have fled the area, fearing a resurgence of xenophobic violence, 
similar to the one which occurred in May 2008.  
</p>
<p>191. The South African authorities reacted promptly by helping to set up an internally 
displaced persons camp site at the De Doorns Sports Grounds. On 20, 21 and 23 November 
2009, they also arrested 24 individuals involved in the xenophobic attacks on 17 November. 
These 24 individuals appeared in court on 23 November on charges of public violence and 
a hearing was postponed until 30 November for further investigations to take place. One of 
the 24 individuals, a minor, was subsequently released. Additional charges, including theft 
and damage to property, are being investigated in respect of the 23 remaining detainees. 
Following the 30 November court hearing, 12 of the 23 suspects were released for lack of 
evidence. The 11 remaining individuals should have appeared in court on Friday 4 
December for another hearing. 
</p>
<p>192. The Special Rapporteurs inquired the Government on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide information on any inquiries carried out into the xenophobic 
attacks carried out against foreign migrant workers on 17 November 2009.  Please 
also provide information on the status or results of the trial of the 11 individuals who 
should have appeared for the court hearing on 4 December 2009.   
</p>
<p>3. What measures are being taken to prevent the resurgence of violence between 
local residents and foreign migrant workers?  
</p>
<p>4. What steps are being taken for the safe return to their homes of the people 
victimized by violence? 
</p>
<p>5. Please indicate whether the victims or the families of the victims have access 
to adequate procedures of compensation for damages resulting from the xenophobic 
violence described above.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 10 December 2009 
</b></p>
<p>193. On 3 May 2010, the Government of South Africa replied to the communication 
dated 10 December 2009. In its response, the Government provided information made 
available following consultations with the Department of Home Affairs, Cooperative 
Governance and Traditional Affairs, and the Breede Valley Municipality.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>194. The Government indicated that after consultation with relevant role-players, it 
appears that simmering social tension between citizens of Zimbabwe and the local 
community gave rise to the outbreak of violence. It further seems that the preference of 
local farmers to rather employ the migrant for cheaper wages caused the local community 
to attack Zimbabwean nationals living in the area.  
</p>
<p>195. In order to discuss the situation, a meeting was held between stakeholders, including 
local government and municipal departments, employer associations, local community 
representatives and representatives of the Zimbabwean community. From the consultations, 
it became clear that a great number of the affected Zimbabwean citizens have applied for 
asylum. According to the provisions of the South African Refugees Act and the 
Constitution, they are entitled to engage in income generating activities in order to sustain 
their livelihoods. They were employed by the farmers.  
</p>
<p>196. The Department of Home Affairs facilitated the documentation process whereby 
people who lost their documents during flight and those who were still undocumented at the 
time of the attacks were provided with new documents. There were 717 Zimbabweans in 
possession of asylum permits. There were also 250 people who were undocumented, and 
150 people who had lost their permits. The people who were undocumented and who also 
lost their permits were assisted by the Maitland Refugee Reception Office in Cape Town. 
The local authorities, in conjunction with the UNHCR, also provided temporary shelter for 
the migrant community, as well as protection services by the South African Police Service. 
Local authorities and NGOs also provided clothing and food.  
</p>
<p>197. After the attacks 25 people were arrested on charges of public violence for the 
incident of 17 November. Of those arrested, 12 people were released due to lack of 
evidence and 13 people were released on bail and appeared in court on 20 January 2010. 
Posters denouncing xenophobia were circulated in the neighbouring areas of Worcester and 
De Doorns as part of information dissemination just after the November 2009 attacks.   
</p>
<p>198. Concerning its international obligations under the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the Government of South 
Africa indicated that it complies with article 4 of the ICERD which requires that measures 
be instituted for the punishment of offences that instigate hatred or propagate ideas based 
on racial superiority. The ICERD requirements are entrenched in Chapter 2, Section 16 of 
the South African Constitution. Furthermore, the Government has introduced the 
Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill which criminalizes hate speech, in order to give effect to 
the ICERD and the Constitution of South Africa. The Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill 
imposes penalties to anyone who publicly advocates hatred against any person or group of 
persons. It is deemed an offense to instigate hatred on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender or 
religion, that is hurtful, harmful, intimidatory or incite imminent violence or seriously 
violate human rights.  
</p>
<p>199. The Government of South Africa also indicated that it complies with article 7 of the 
ICERD which requires that measures to combat prejudices and to promote understanding 
and tolerance be put in place. This provision is entrenched in the preamble of the 
Immigration Act which provides for anti-xenophobia programmes; a human rights culture 
of immigration enforcement; compliance with Government&#8217;s international obligations; and 
human rights education for civil society. In this regard, the Department of Home Affairs 
conducts public education and training for schools, communities and immigration officers. 
The education programme covers human rights, refugee protection and immigration issues.  
</p>
<p>200. In line with article 6 of ICERD, the Department of Home Affairs, in collaboration 
with other government departments, participated in consultative meetings and mediation 
with civil society organizations, Zimbabweans, farmers associations and political 
leadership. The purpose of these consultations was to assess the situation and identify </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>48</b>  
</p>
<p>possible solutions for the re-integration of the displaced Zimbabweans. Discussions are 
ongoing. In the specific case of De Doorns, 3 committees have been established to give 
feedback on a daily basis at the stakeholders meetings, which include a Camp Management 
Committee, a Reintegration Committee and Humanitarian Committee.   
</p>
<p>201. The Breede Valley Officials have also undertaken to investigate the issue of 
landownership by foreigners in De Doorns as from 7 January 2010. They have undertaken 
to ensure that residents living in flood prone areas will be relocated to safer sites and will 
receive basic services. The Breede Valley Municipality will conduct regular meetings with 
affected stakeholders as well as with the community to address developmental issues and 
the reintegration process.  
</p>
<p>202. Finally, the Government indicated that the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on 
Labour and the Department of Labour also probed into the allegations of below minimum 
wages that farmers reported to have paid to the Zimbabwean nationals. The result of the 
investigations and recommendations from such investigations are dealt with by these 
relevant institutions.

<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 2 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>209. On 2 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, 
together with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance sent an allegation letter to the 
Government as a follow up to the previous communication of 10 November 2009 
(Reference <i>AL G/SO 214 (106-10)  G/SO 214 (78-15) THA 10/2009</i>) on the effects of the 
nationality verification process on the human rights of migrant workers from Myanmar.   
</p>
<p>210. According to the information received, on 19 January 2010, the cabinet of the 
Government approved a resolution for the extension of the nationality verification process 
and the temporary amnesty of permission to stay in the country by two years, for registered 
migrant workers who received work permits in 2009, in accordance with the cabinet 
resolutions of 18 December 2007 (382,541 persons), and in accordance with the Cabinet 
resolutions of 26 May 2009, 28 September 2009 and 3 November 2009 (a total of 928,149 
person).   
</p>
<p>211. Following this announcement, the deputy director general of the Employment 
Office, Mr. Suphat Kukhu, has stated that for migrants to benefit from the extension, they 
must now submit their nationality verification forms by 28 February 2010 and also renew 
their work permits by that time to be able to stay in the country. The Government will give 
permission for this group of workers to work temporarily in Thailand but only on the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>condition that every worker must enter into the Nationality Verification process and then 
return to the home country to complete the Nationality Verification process before 28 
February 2012. If migrant workers do not submit national verification forms and renew 
work permits by 28 February 2010, they shall be considered illegal aliens for which the 
only option is arrest and deportation from the Kingdom of Thailand. The policy affects over 
one million migrant workers from Myanmar, together with 200,000 workers from Laos and 
Cambodia.  
</p>
<p>212. While officials from the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and Cambodia will 
come to Thailand to assist their nationals, Myanmar&#8217;s Government has reportedly refused 
to allow its officials to cross into Thailand. Instead, migrant workers from Myanmar must 
return to their country, and for many, such moves create anxiety amid fears of harassment 
and extortion by Myanmar officials.  
</p>
<p>213. The Special Rapporteurs requested information from the Government on the 
following issues:  
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide details of any measures your Excellency&#8217;s Government has 
undertaken to inform migrant communities from Myanmar about the nationality 
verification scheme, including the procedural steps involved and the rights to which 
the migrants would be entitled to upon the completion of the process.   
</p>
<p>3. Please comment on our concerns that migrant workers must agree to enter 
into the National verification process by 28 February 2010 by submitting their 
personal information or, for migrants refusing to enter into the nationality 
verification process, they should be deported from Thailand after28 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>4. Please provide details of any measures your Excellency&#8217;s Government has 
undertaken to ensure the safety and human rights of migrant workers from Myanmar 
who participate in the nationality verification scheme, as well as the safety of their 
family members.

Government has planned, should the majority of migrants from Myanmar be unable 
to comply with the nationality verification process. In particular, kindly provide 
details of any long-term plans to accommodate Myanmar&#8217;s migrant workers who are

freedoms of indigenous people and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a joint urgent appeal concerning the 
forcible repatriation of approximately 4,000 Lao Hmong from Thailand to Laos and risks of 
torture they may face upon their return.  
</p>
<p>215. According to the information received, on 28 December 2009, the Thai Government 
proceeded to return about 4000 Lao Hmong to the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic under 
a bilateral agreement with the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic. The Government

<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 29 December 2009 
</b></p>
<p>217. On 12 January 2010, the government replied to the communication sent on 29 
December 2009.  The government responded that on 28 December 2009, the Thai 
authorities oversaw the return of 4,350 Laotian Hmongs at Huay Nam Khao in Petchaboon 
Province and 158 Laotian Hmongs in the IDC in Nong Khai Province to Lao PRD under 
the framework of the bilateral agreement between Thailand and Laos with due regard to 
human rights and humanitarian principles.  The returnees were provided with adequate food 
and medical services throughout the return process.  Special considerations were given to 
the needs of women and children.  The Thai government also took great care to uphold the 
principle of family unity and for all those concerned.  The return followed assurances given 
by the Government of the Lao PDR to the Thai Government at all levels, from the 
leadership to the working level, that legal proceedings will not be undertaken against 
returning Laotian Hmongs and requests for onward travel by them will be facilitated.  
Moreover, third countries wishing to resettle some Laotian Hmong retrunees would be able 
to directly discuss details with the Government of the Lao PDR.  The Government of the 
Lao PDR has also given assurances that it will facilitate those Laotian Hmongs wishing to 
return to their home communities with transportation and initial financial assistance, while 
housing and other assistance will be provided to those wishing to move to a development 
village.    
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 12 November 2009 
</b></p>
<p>218. On 12 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, sent a letter of allegation concerning the alleged exploitation of and 
systematic discrimination against migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, particularly 
with respect to: (1) The effects of the nationality verification process on migrant workers 
from Myanmar; and (2) The rights of migrant workers from Myanmar who are injured as a 
result of workplace accidents.   
</p>
<p>219. According to the information received, on 21 June 2003, your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government and the Government of Myanmar reportedly entered into a <i>Memorandum of 
Understanding between the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand and the Government 
of the Union of Myanmar on Cooperation in the Employment of Workers</i>, establishing a 
nationality verification scheme for irregular migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand. 
While these efforts to regularize migrant workers are a welcome step, the scheme has 
reportedly caused significant confusion in migrant communities. After the initial 
verification process began, which reports suggest was in mid-2009, many migrant workers </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>have expressed confusion about the complexities of the registration process and the rights 
to which they would be entitled once their nationality had been verified.   
</p>
<p>220. The nationality verification scheme reportedly requires all registered migrant 
workers from Myanmar in Thailand to have their nationality verified by means of a 
complex 13-stage process involving Thai employment offices, the Embassy of Myanmar in 
Thailand, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs in Myanmar and Thailand, and National 
Verification and Processing Centres in three border crossings in both Myanmar 
(Kawthaung, Myawaddy and Tachileik) and Thailand (Ranong, Mae Sot and Mae Sai). In 
late 2008, your Excellency&#8217;s Government reportedly announced that no irregular migrants 
would remain in Thailand after 28 February 2010, as all must complete nationality 
verification before this date or face deportation. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government then 
offered a final 30-day registration period in July 2009 to allow all unregistered migrants to 
register and complete the nationality verification process. As of early October 2009, we 
were informed that around 2,000 of approximately 1 million registered migrants from 
Myanmar eligible for nationality verification have completed this process.   
</p>
<p>221. Despite the gravity of consequences of failing to complete the nationality 
verification process, it is alleged that your Excellency&#8217;s Government has not provided 
migrant communities from Myanmar with sufficient information about the process, 
especially in their native languages. In addition, the perspective of the migrant communities 
appears to be that the deadline set by your Excellency&#8217;s Government for the completion of 
the verification process is tight and unrealistic.  Furthermore, it has been reported that 
certain ethnic groups, especially Shan and Mon, are increasingly fearful of providing 
personal information as part of the process, as they fear that their families will face 
harassment once this personal information reaches the Myanmar&#8217;s authorities and that 
Myanmar&#8217;s authorities might be using the process to arrest political activists.   
</p>
<p>222. Further, taking advantage of the lack of public information and clarity on the 
nationality verification processes, private brokers have allegedly charged migrant workers 
exorbitant fees for assistance in the paperwork.  It has been reported that some migrants 
were charged more than 7,000 baht (US$250), which many cannot afford. In addition, it is 
not clear to migrants as to what these fees cover and whether they need to apply for new 
work permits at additional costs when they return to Thailand with their temporary 
passports and visas. There are also reports that in some cases, brokers disappeared without 
providing services, and there have even been allegations that the nationality verification 
process may contribute to increasing trafficking in persons. For example, we have received 
information that migrants going through the nationality verification process at the Mae 
Sai/Tachilek border crossing are charged exorbitantly high fees with no legal basis.   
</p>
<p><i>Exploitation and Systematic Discrimination Against Migrant Workers from Myanmar  
</i></p>
<p>223. According to information received, migrant workers in Thailand are often exploited 
by their employers and deprived of access to mechanisms for the protection of labour 
rights, given their &#8220;illegal&#8221; status.  In particular, we have received information which raises 
particular concerns about the rights of migrant workers who are injured or disabled as a 
result of workplace accidents.  Migrant workers from Myanmar are reportedly denied 
access to the Social Security Office (&#8220;SSO&#8221;) Workmen&#8217;s Compensation Fund (&#8220;WCF&#8221;) in 
the event of workplace accidents, although the WCF should be available to all workers in 
the case of work-related accidents and disease.   
</p>
<p>224. The refusal to allow migrant workers from Myanmar access to the WCF apparently 
results from their inability to satisfy conditions stipulated in circular RS0711/W751, issued 
by the SSO on 25 October 2001.  These conditions provide that to obtain compensation 
directly from the WCF, migrants: (a) must possess a passport or alien registration 
documents; and (b) their employers must have registered for and paid a dividend into the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>53 
</b></p>
<p>WCF.  According to the information received, many migrants from Myanmar cannot satisfy 
these conditions, as they originally entered Thailand without documentation, or at best only 
possess one-year work permits, which are not accepted in lieu of passports or alien 
registration documents.  The circular provides that if workers concerned cannot satisfy 
these conditions, their employers are responsible to compensate them directly.  It has also 
been reported, however, that migrant workers from Myanmar rarely receive work accident 
compensation from their employers, as they are often not in the position to negotiate with 
them. Similarly, migrants often do not approach the SSO, due to the lack of knowledge 
about their rights.  Even in few cases where the SSO orders employers to pay compensation 
to migrant workers, such orders are usually ignored and remain unenforced, as legal 
assistance necessary to enforce such orders is rarely accessible to migrant workers, because 
of language constraints and the lack of legal aid services.  In that regard, the following 
individual cases were reported:  
</p>
<p>(a) Ms. Nang Noom Mae Seng, a 37 year old migrant worker from Shan State, 
Myanmar, was injured while working for Nai Wirat Mangkhon, a subcontractor of 
Link Innofa Properties Co. Ltd. and Wo Hup Company (Thailand) Ltd., at the 
Shangri-la Hotel construction site in Chiangmai, Thailand.  On 4 December 2006, a 
300 kg mould fell from the 12th floor of the building and a piece of the shattered 
mould struck Nang Noom who was working on the 2nd floor. As a result, Nang 
Noom suffered extensive injuries and was rendered permanently disabled by 70 
percent. Her legs are paralysed and she will never be able to walk again. On 27 April 
2007, the SSO in Chiangmai ordered her employer to pay 6,206.20 baht for the time 
she was unable to work and for the period when she received medical treatment 
(from 4 December 2006 to 20 February 2007). On 20 July 2007, the SSO ordered 
again to her employer to compensate Nang Noom in the amount of 2,418 baht a 
month over 15 years, in addition to the medical treatment costs not exceeding 35,000 
baht. Nang Noom appealed these orders to the WCF Appeals Committee on the 
basis that she is entitled to lump sum compensation from the WCF pursuant to the 
Workmen&#8217;s Compensation Act 1994. On 10 November 2007, while Nang Noom&#8217;s 
employer agreed to pay lump sum compensation in the amount of 362,796 baht, they 
unfairly dismissed Nang Noom. In addition, the SSO has reportedly refused Nang 
Noom rehabilitation assistance. On 24 November 2007, the appeal to the WCF 
Committee was rejected on the grounds that RS0711/W751 provides that only 
migrant workers entering Thailand legally could directly access the WCF. This 
decision was further appealed to the Region 5 Labour Court and then to the Supreme 
Court on 29 August 2008. The case is pending and yet to be assigned a hearing date.  
</p>
<p>(b) Nang Noom has also been involved in several attempts, alongside other 
migrants, to challenge the SSO&#8217;s policy in the administrative courts. It has been 
reported that on 27 November 2008, the Supreme Administrative Court of Thailand 
refused jurisdiction in her case on the basis that it was a labour case. Nang Noom 
and other migrants then proceeded to challenge the SSO circular in the Central 
Labour Court, which, on 25 May 2009, accepted jurisdiction over the case. The case, 
however, was then dismissed by the Region 5 Labour Court on 21 September 2009. 
The court refused to consider the legality of the SSO circular on the ground that the 
plaintiffs had no standing to petition the court. The case is now pending in the 
Supreme Court. It is noted that over a 2 year period, 4 different courts have 
reportedly refused to consider the validity of the SSO circular and/or to invalidate 
the circular on legal and jurisdictional grounds.  
</p>
<p>(c) Mr. Sai Htun, a 17 year old unregistered migrant worker from Shan State, 
Myanmar, worked for Nai Manas Promdaen on a local government flood defense 
project in Mae Rim district of Chiangmai Province, Thailand. On 20 June 2007, the 
riverbank collapsed on him and he died of brain injuries in a Chiangmai hospital on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b>  
</p>
<p>24 June 2007. When Sai Htun&#8217;s relatives claimed compensation immediately after 
his death, the employer told them that unregistered workers had no right to accident 
compensation under Thai law. Sai Htun&#8217;s family was assisted for several years to 
pressure the SSO in Chiangmai to issue an order in his case. Finally, on 9 June 2009, 
SSO Chiangmai issued an order against Nai Manas and the contractor of the flood 
defense project, whereby: (a) The person(s) who organised the funeral for Mr. Sai 
Htun was entitled to 100 times his daily salary prior to his death in compensation; 
and (b) dependents of Sai Htun, in accordance with the definition in the law, were 
entitled to compensation for 8 years at 60% of his daily salary prior to his death. The 
order did not, however, state who the entitled persons were, despite the fact that the 
SSO apparently received an abundance of documents on the case, in Thai, Burmese 
and English. On 14 July 2009, dependents of Sai Htun appealed this SSO decision to 
the WCF Committee, arguing that the SSO should name those entitled to 
compensation based on the documents already provided, and that the WCF should 
pay compensation in one lump sum to Sai Htun&#8217;s dependents, and not his employer. 
The appeal is pending to date. On 3 September 2009, following extensive 
negotiations in Region 5 Labour Court on a separate damages claim by Sai Htun&#8217;s 
family, it is reported that an agreement was endorsed by this Court whereby Sai 
Htun&#8217;s employer and the contractor of the flood defense project agreed to pay his 
mother and father 210,000 baht of compensation, with the first payment due to be 
transferred electronically on 4 October 2009. The agreement was reached on the 
basis that all SSO cases against the employer and the contractor as well as appeals 
were withdrawn. It is reported, however, that the employer or the contractor did not 
disburse the payments as scheduled on 4 October 2009. Sai Htun&#8217;s relatives claim 
that they still have to receive compensation for his death. 
</p>
<p>(d) Mr. Nai Khek Booma (or Ou Kin Zo), a 44 year old migrant worker of Mon 
ethnicity from Myanmar, entered Thailand in 1998 with his wife. In April 2008, Nai 
Khek and his family began working at Roongsri Thanawat Co. Ltd, in Naknom 
Pathom, which produced show soles, shoes, crepe rubber and foam boxes. He was 
paid 150 baht per day, which was below the minimum wage of 203 baht in this 
province. The conditions in the workplace were very dangerous and there was no 
personal protection equipment. On 9 June 2008, his right hand was cut off when he 
tried to place a 30 kg crepe rubber into a machine. On 30 July 2008, Nai Khek 
complained to the SSO in Nakhon Pathom and requested compensation for his 
injury. On 1 December 2008, the SSO issued compensation order No 3/2551 to his 
employer to pay medical expenses, 60 percent of Nai Khek&#8217;s salary during the 
period he was unable to work, and 3166.80 baht per month for the loss of an organ 
for 112 months in the total amount of 354,681.60 baht. On 25 December 2008, Nai 
Khek went to SSO to negotiate this order with his employer and his employer 
offered to make a single payment of 70,000 baht or pay compensation periodically 
for 112 months, as per the SSO&#8217;s order. He refused this payment and instead 
appealed the order to the WCF Committee requesting a single one-off payment from 
the WCF. On 10 July 2009, the WCF Committee rejected Nai Khek&#8217;s appeal on the 
basis of the SSO Circular RS0711/W751, but ruled that he had the right to 
rehabilitation and ordered his employer to pay for rehabilitation. From 1 December 
2008 to the present, Nai Khek&#8217;s employer has paid him, as per the SSO order, 
3,166.80 baht per month. However, he and his family live now in poverty and want 
to return home. Despite requests to the SSO, officials have allegedly refused to assist 
Nai Khek to receive his monthly payments back in Myanmar, insisting instead he 
travels himself, at the cost of 500 baht per trip, to pick up his compensation every 
month at the SSO office in Nakhon Pathom. Given the loss of his right hand, Nai 
Khek cannot work and the SSO has reportedly refused to allow him access to 
rehabilitation under the SSO schemes. At least three workers in the same factory as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>55 
</b></p>
<p>Nai Khek have had accidents and have been refused any compensation by their 
employer. Instead, they were dismissed by their employer and then deported back to 
Myanmar without compensation.   
</p>
<p>(d) Mr. Nai Yuu, a 39 year old migrant worker from Myanmar, entered Thailand 
in 2001. In August 2008, he started to work for a shoe factory making soles for 300 
baht per day in Mahachai, Samut Sakorn Province. On the second day at work, his 
left hand was cut by a rubber machine, as he tried to push the crepe rubber inside it.  
All of his fingers were amputated from his left hand. On 10 September 2008, Nai 
Yuu complained to SSO Samut Sakorn and requested compensation for his injury. 
SSO did not reportedly take any action, as they did not know the company or the 
name of the employer and said Nai Yuu had not provided appropriate medical 
evidence. Nai Yuu has not yet received any compensation and SSO Samut Sakorn 
has not issued an order in his case, despite having all the required medical evidence. 
SSO has reportedly not provided any rehabilitation assistance to Nai Yuu.  
</p>
<p>(e) Mr. Nai Jam (or Aung Ngwe Ton), a 35 year old migrant worker from 
Myanmar, arrived in Thailand in 2001. On 23 February 2008, he started working for 
S.B.L. Industrial Co. Ltd and received 203 baht per day for placing iron in and out 
of a machine. On 3 August 2008, while he was taking the iron out, his fingers were 
cut off by the machine.  His employer paid him 9,000 baht as compensation during 
the period in which he was unable to work. On 10 October 2008, Nai Jam 
complained to the SSO Samut Sakorn, but the SSO did not reportedly take action for 
a long time on the basis that officials did not know the company or the name of the 
employer and that Nai Jam&#8217;s name was spelt incorrectly on the hospital certificates. 
Nai Jam requested that his employer compensate him approximately 200,000 baht in 
accordance with the law, but he has never received any compensation, except for the 
9,000 baht. He is currently unemployed and has been arrested three times by the 
police since the accident due to his status as an undocumented migrant worker. On 
29 September 2009, SSO Samut Sakorn issued an order in Nai Jam&#8217;s case, ruling 
that: (1) Nai Jam should receive compensation for the time he was unable to work of 
3166.80 baht (60% of his pre-accident salary), not exceeding one year; and (2) Nai 
Jam should receive compensation for the loss of his fingers at 3166.80 baht for a 
period of 64 months, or in total 202, 675.20 baht; and (c) Nai Jam&#8217;s employer must 
pay all medical expenses. It is alleged that Nai Jam&#8217;s employer continues to refuse to 
pay him any compensation and he is living in poverty. The SSO has reportedly 
never provided Nai Jam with any rehabilitation assistance.        
</p>
<p>(f) Ms. Nang Saw Wai (or Ka Zing), a 23 year old migrant worker from 
Myanmar, entered Thailand in 2003.  In January 2008, she started to work at a 
factory in Samut Sakorn province for 175 baht per day, although the minimum wage 
in this province was 203 baht.  Her job was to put plastic sacks into a grinding 
machine. On 8 January 2008, the forefinger and middle finger of her right hand were 
cut off by the grinding machine.  Her employers, Don and Lee, agreed to pay her 
some money as compensation, but she claims she has not received it yet.  Nang Saw 
Wai complained to the SSO Samut Sakorn, but SSO did not reportedly respond to 
the complaint. When the SSO officials visited the employers, the factory had then 
been moved and it was no longer possible to trace them. When one of the employers, 
Lee, was located, he refused to acknowledge that Nang Saw Wai was ever his 
employee. To date, Nang Saw Wai has not received any compensation and the SSO 
has reportedly never provided her with any rehabilitation assistance.

<p>226. On 26 August 2009, the Vice-Chairperson Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent a joint urgent appeal concerning a group of individuals from 
the Rohingya minority of Myanmar currently in immigration detention in Thailand.  
</p>
<p>227. According to the information received, on 1 July 2009, Abdul Salam deceased at the 
age of 18 at the Ranong IDC after suffering from heart failure. On 13 August 2009, 
Hammah Tulah, 15 years of age, also died while in detention at the Ranong IDC. In both 
cases, the rapid deterioration of their health might be due to the inadequacy and inefficiency 
of healthcare being provided to them during the entire period of their detention and 
particularly during the hours preceding their deaths. A third person is reportedly in a critical 
medical condition. 
</p>
<p>228. Following these deaths, all remaining individuals from the aforementioned 
Rohingya minority group have been transferred to the Suan Plu IDC in Bangkok.  It has 
also been reported that irregular immigrants in Thailand face potentially indefinite 
administrative immigration detention. </p>

</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the

<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 26 August 2009:  
</b></p>
<p>230. On 17 November 2009, the Government replied to the communication sent on 26 
August 2009.  The Government stated that Thailand has taken care of the group of 78 
Rohingyas based on humanitarian considerations.  The Government allowed relevant 
embassy representatives and staff from the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to visit and talk to this group of persons earlier in 
</p><p>2009.  With respect to the death of Mr. Abdul Salam and Mr. Hammah Tulah, the post 
mortems have suggested that the causes of death were cardiac arrest.  On a humanitarian 
basis, the Immigration Bureau moved all the Rohibgyas to the IDC in Bangkok to allow 
them more space for exercise and recreation, as well as better access to medical care.  The 
Government stated that this move would also make it easier for UNHCR and other relevant 
NGOs to access this group of people.  The Government had no intention of detaining them 
indefinitely and steps were being taken to verify their nationality and country of origin and 
provide a lasting solution for them.

</b></p>
<p>231. On 16 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
together with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children sent a joint allegation letter concerning Ms. Fatima Zahra Moussa, who was an 
alleged victim of trafficking in persons and had no access to an effective complaint 
mechanism.   
</p>
<p>232. According to the information received Ms. Fatima Zahra Moussa, a Moroccan 
national, submitted a case of alleged trafficking in persons to the NCCHT through the 
official website of the NCCHT in May 2009.  In this case, Ms. Moussa claimed that she 
was trafficked to and within the United Arab Emirates by her former employers, the 
Emirates Centre for Strategic Studies and Research (&#8220;ECSSR&#8221;) and the Dubai Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry (&#8220;DCCI&#8221;).    
</p>
<p>233. Ms. Moussa was first offered a position of Editor by ECSSR on 25 July 2005.  Upon 
arrival in Abu Dhabi, she surrendered her passport to ECSSR for the duration of her one 
year contract, which was stipulated to be part of the employment conditions.  She was 
informed that it was possible for her to have her passport back as and when necessary.  The 
employment conditions also stipulated that 10 percent of her salary would be withheld each </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>58</b>  
</p>
<p>month. The sum withheld would be accumulated and subsequently paid back at the end of 
the year.  She was informed by ECSSR that this was a standard practice in the UAE.     
</p>
<p>234. On 19 July 2006, after having worked one year for ECSSR, she was requested to 
renew her contract for another year.  Although she refused to sign the contract, she was 
allegedly forced to do so, as personnel of the Human Resource Department of ECSSR 
allegedly intimidated her and told her that she would not be allowed to leave the room 
unless she signed. Allegedly, she had no option but to sign it, particularly because ECSSR 
was in possession of her passport at the time and she feared for ECSSR&#8217;s retaliation.  She 
contacted the Ministry of Labour in Abu Dhabi and informed them of ECSSR&#8217;s practice, 
but the Ministry did not assist her on the basis that it only deals with cases of employees 
working for private companies.   
</p>
<p>235. On 16 January 2007, Ms. Moussa submitted a letter of resignation to ECSSR.  She 
was informed that her resignation would be approved after she submitted a clearance letter 
from the bank confirming that she has no outstanding loans or debts.  After she submitted 
the clearance letter to ECSSR, however, ECSSR allegedly cancelled Ms. Moussa&#8217;s 
residence permit without complying with a requirement to pay her back the accumulated 
salaries owed to her.  It then filed a criminal complaint against her at Al Shaabiyah police 
station in Abu Dhabi to evict her from the accommodation which belonged to ECSSR and 
to expel her from the UAE.  She alleges that ECSSR did this to harass her and to retaliate 
against her.    
</p>
<p>236. In Abu Dhabi Court of first instance, she was fined 2,000 UAE dirhams in the case 
filed by ECSSR.  She sought to appeal against this decision and went to the Abu Dhabi 
Public Prosecution office.  While she was waiting to see the Chief Public Prosecutor in the 
office, it is claimed that two police officers suddenly handcuffed her and aggressively 
dragged her until another police officer intervened to stop them.  While the police officer 
apologized for the mistreatment, he allegedly insisted that she pay the fine of 2,000 dirhams 
immediately.  She paid the fine, so that she could leave the office.  Subsequently, one of the 
two police officers filed a case against her on the basis that she insulted the police officer 
during the course of her duties.  When she reported to the police station for questioning, she 
was arrested and put in jail.  She was released only after a colleague came to the police 
station and left his passport as a guarantee.  In Abu Dhabi Court of first instance, she was 
again fined 2,000 UAE dirhams, which she was allegedly forced by the police to pay on the 
same day.  In both cases, there appeared to be no investigations and Ms. Moussa did not 
have a lawyer.       
</p>
<p>237. On 20 March 2007, Ms. Moussa was offered a position of business editor with 
DCCI.  She was required to surrender her passport to DCCI as a guarantee to receive 
housing allowances, although this was not stipulated as part of the employment conditions.  
Ms. Moussa complained to the Ministry of Labour in Dubai about this practice, but the 
Ministry did not offer her any assistance .  On 17 July 2007, she was dismissed by DCCI 
without any satisfactory explanations for the dismissal. Following the dismissal, DCCI 
issued an absconder notice against Ms. Moussa on 28 July 2007.  On 26 August 2007, she 
departed the UAE and the absconder notice is still in effect to date.   
</p>
<p>238. Ms. Moussa submitted a complaint to the NCCHT, alleging that ECSSR and DCCI 
trafficked her.  The NCCHT registered her case under the reference number NC000032.  
Ms. Moussa also called the NCCHT and provided further details of her case.  She claims 
that she was informed during the telephone conversation that her case would be referred to 
the Public Prosecution without delay.  However, on 7 June 2009, she was informed by the 
NCCHT by email that her case would not be reviewed as its official website cannot be used 
to notify the NCCHT about individual cases of human trafficking.  This is contrary to the 
information publicly released by the National Media Council on 13 May 2009 that the 
official website of the NCCHT features an &#8220;important interactive feature &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>allows contact with officials via email, thus enabling users to send complaints and notify 
the committee about cases related to human trafficking&#8221;.  While Ms. Moussa sought 
explanations from the NCCHT of its refusal to handle her case, it is alleged that the 
NCCHT has not responded to her request to date.        
</p>
<p>239. Moreover, under the &#8220;Contact us&#8221; page of the NCCHT webpage, it is stated that 
&#8220;[c]omplaints filed through this channel will not be processed&#8221;, in contradiction with the 
information released by the NCCHT in the mentioned official press release of 13 May 2009 
related to the creation of its website. 
</p>
<p>240. The Special Rapporteurs requested the cooperation and observations of the 
Government on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the cases accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details of how the NCCHT considered Ms. Moussa&#8217;s case 
and elaborate the ground(s) on which the NCCHT determined not to respond to Ms. 
Moussa&#8217;s case.   
</p>
<p>3. Please clarify and provide information on the current framework for reporting 
potential cases of human trafficking to the authorities in the United Arab Emirates. 
In particular, what specific measures have been adopted to provide victims with an 
easily accessible way to submit complaints and obtain assistance or redress? What is 
the role of the NCCHT and its website in this regard? 
</p>
<p>4. Please provide information on the measures taken by your Government to 
prevent trafficking and violations to the rights of migrant workers, in particular their 
being held in forced labour and services including practices similar to slavery and

Emirates of the right to consular protection in cases involving migrants.

<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 16 November 2009:

<p>241. On 23 April 2010, the government replied to the communication sent on 16 
November 2009. The response will be available in the next communication report to be 
issued by the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants as it is being translated 
from Arabic into English.

<p><b>  Communication sent to the Government on 20 November 2009 
</b></p>
<p>242. On 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
together with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, sent a joint 
urgent appeal concerning an Uzbek boy who has been trafficked to Kazakhstan to work in a 
forced labor situation and whose whereabouts are currently unknown.   
</p>
<p>243. According to information received: Mr. <b>B.I</b>, aged 17, is a resident of the Khiva town 
of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan.  In May 2008, B.I and four young Uzbek men were 
recruited by Mr. Bakhtiyor Bekchanov, a citizen of Uzbekistan aged 56, to travel to 
Kazakhstan as labor migrants.  Mr. Bekchanov promised them and their parents that he 
would take care of their employment in Kazakhstan.  He also assured them that being the 
oldest in the group, he would look after the young men during their stay in Kazakhstan.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>60</b>  
</p>
<p>244. Upon their arrival in Kazakhstan, the young men were taken to a house of Mr. 
Nurlibek Mamatov, located in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast.  Mr. Mamatov is a 
citizen of Kazakhstan and a member of the local council in Zhalagash aul.  Mr. Bekchanov 
received $5,000 from  Mr. Mamatov in exchange of the young men and handed over their 
passports to Mr. Mamatov before he disappeared.  The young men were forced to carry out 
a variety of work in Mr. Mamatov&#8217;s house, including construction work.  They were forced 
to work under harsh conditions and without appropriate food and compensation.  
Approximately two months after the young men left for Kazakhstan, Mr. Bekchanov 
appeared in Khiva.  B&#8217;s mother went to see Mr. Bekchanov  to ask how her son was.  Mr. 
Bekchanov assured the mother that all the young men were well and that they would soon 
be sending money they earned in Kazakhstan.  However, B&#8217;s mother never heard from her 
son, as all the young men were not given any opportunity to contact their families in 
Uzbekistan.  The young men except B. eventually managed to escape the house and return 
to Khiva.        
</p>
<p>245. In December 2008, B&#8217;s mother lodged an appeal to the Department of Internal 
Affairs in the Khiva district and to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 
Uzbekistan to search for her son.  However, she did not receive any responses from the 
authorities.  Concerned for her son&#8217;s safety and desperate to find him, on 12 June 2009, she 
travelled to Mr. Mamatov&#8217;s house in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast by her own 
means.  When she arrived at Mr. Mamatov&#8217;s house, he shouted at her in the Kazakh 
language, throwing the passports of the young Uzbek men who were forced to work in his 
house.  He told her that B. was taken by a Police Major named &#8220;Abdurakhmon&#8221; from 
Shimkent city in Yuzhno-Kazakhstanskaya oblast.       
</p>
<p>246. It has been reported that Mr. Bekchanov has deceived a number of individuals from 
the Khorezm region in a similar manner and the Department of Internal Affairs in the Khiva 
district commenced criminal proceedings against him under Article 135 of the Uzbek 
Criminal Code (Human Trafficking).  However, Mr. Bekchanov has not been apprehended 
and the whereabouts of B. are unknown to date.   
</p>
<p>247. The Special Rapporteurs requested the Government's cooperation and observations 
on the following matters:  
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the cases accurate?

<p> <b>61 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government to the communication sent on 20 October 2009:  
</b></p>
<p>248. On 25 November 2009, the Government replied to the communication sent on 20 
October 2009.  In summary, the Government stated that: on 26 December 2008 the 
investigative section of the Department of Internal Affairs of Khiva district instituted 
criminal proceedings against B. Bekchanov under article 135, paragraph 3, of the Criminal 
Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan.  The basis of the investigation was the alleged 
deception of Bekzod Ikramov, Ikrom Nosirov, Kuranba Babazhanov, Atabek 
Dzhabberganov, Abdul Abdullayev, Ravshanbek Palvanov and Shabkat Baltayev, citizens 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan, by gaining their trust and promising monthly wages of US$ 
500 and inveigled them into leaving the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan and going 
to the Kyzyl-Ordinsk province of the Republic of Kazakhstan, where he forced them to 
work in various places without pay.  By a decision of the investigator of 20 January 2009, 
B. Bekchanov was charged (in his absence) under article 135, paragraph 3, of the Criminal 
Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan.  On 8 November 2009 Bakhtiyar Bekchanov was 
arrested and placed in remand centre No. 6 in Urgench. As a result of the measures taken, 
the whereabouts of Bekzod Ikramov were ascertained and Bekzod Ikramov returned to 
Uzbekistan on 8 November 2009 and he is now living with his parents in the district of 
Khiva.  
</p>
<p>249. After returning to their homes in the Republic of Uzbekistan, the other victims K. 
Babazhanov, A. Dzhabberganov, R. Palvanov and S. Baltayev underwent medical 
examinations and were not found to be suffering from any illnesses.  They were therefore 
offered work by the job centre.  
</p>
<p>250. The Government has taken steps to improve national legislation to counter and 
combat trafficking in persons.  The Act on countering the trafficking in persons was 
adopted on 17 April 2008, which is in conformity with the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.  Pursuant to this law, 
the Government approved a national plan of action to boost the effectiveness of the fight 
against trafficking in persons for the period 2008&#8211;2010. As part of the implementation 
efforts, the Cabinet adopted a resolution on 5 November 2008 to set up a 30-bed national 
rehabilitation centre to assist and protect victims of trafficking in persons.  On 26 February 
2004, the Ministry of Internal Affairs established a special unit to counter human 
trafficking in the central department for criminal investigation and counter-terrorism. The 
unit has local sub-units comprising field agents from the crime prevention service.  The 
Ministry of Internal Affairs has also formulated and issued guidelines on the investigation 
of offences linked to human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>251. In order to stop clandestine labour migration, the Ministry of Labour and Social 
Welfare provide advice on the labour and migration laws of the countries of most frequent 
destination from the Centre for Pre-departure Adaptation and Training and the Agency for 
Foreign Labour Migration of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.  The Ministry also 
issued booklets on these issues.   
</p>
<p>252. The Government also conducted awareness-raising campaigns to disseminate 
information about risks of human trafficking through mass media.  Special advertisements 
are shown on national and local television channels. Clips and broadcasts are prepared and 
articles are published in periodicals. The causes of human trafficking and circumstances 
promoting it are discussed in direct contacts with the population.   Banners have been hung 
up, posters have been placed on hoardings in all regions of the country and booklets on 
these issues have been distributed to the population. To date 1,438 banners and 325,128 
posters have been put up and 3,980,000 booklets have been distributed in an endeavour to 
prevent crimes and offences related to human trafficking and to increase the population&#8217;s </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.1

<p><b>62</b>  
</p>
<p>awareness of the means and methods used by malefactors engaged in this kind of criminal 
activity.   
</p>
<p>253. In addition, a series of seminars, round tables, conferences and training sessions on 
ways of combating human trafficking and improving support for the victims of these crimes 
have been held for the staff of government bodies, law enforcement agencies and courts, 
the education system, the health, labour and welfare services, migration and border services 
and also representatives of community organizations.
