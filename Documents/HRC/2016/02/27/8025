</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Sri Lanka elaborated on plans to achieve improvements in human rights in the 
context of post-conflict peace-building and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>6. It noted that, as a result of the 2008 Review, a National Action Plan for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (NHRAP), a principal pledge, has been 
formulated; based on recommendations, accepted pledges made, recommendations of treaty 
bodies and special procedures. Civil society had nearly equal representation on the drafting 
committees. 
</p>
<p>7. The NHRAP was approved by Cabinet in September and the implementation 
strategy was approved in December 2011. Implementation was ongoing and the process 
was nationally owned and driven. As to implementation of the NHRAP, specific examples 
of implementation were outlined which demonstrate clear commitment and progress. 
</p>
<p>8. After defeat of the LTTE in 2009, measures to ensure a return to civilian life 
progressed. After the 2008 review, the final phase of the humanitarian operation was 
launched to rescue civilians held by the LTTE in the North. In May 2009 nearly 300,000 
civilians were rescued. Post-conflict Sri Lanka, faced a range of daunting challenges </p>


<p>stemming from the conflict, while maintaining sustainable economic growth and preventing 
acts of destabilization, had placed primacy on non-repetition of past mistakes and genuine 
reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>9. On the allegedly disappeared, ongoing engagement with the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance and recent progress to clear the backlog was 
outlined. The relatively small number of cases reported by the WGEID post-2005 laid to 
rest the canard of increasing disappearances. The addressing of this challenge could be 
better addressed if countries receiving asylum seekers would cooperate by identifying the 
names of such persons. Sri Lankan authorities had successfully resolved many of the 
supposed disappearances and outstanding allegations would be thoroughly investigated. 
</p>
<p>10. Civil society&#8217;s rights had received constitutional recognition.  They had freedom to 
form non-governmental and community-based organizations. Regarding allegations of 
intolerance or attacks against these organizations or their leadership, it was noted that there 
was no Government policy to stifle criticism, activism or dissent, and that the Government 
did not condone such attacks. 
</p>
<p>11. The President had appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission 
(LLRC) in May 2010 to strengthen the national reconciliation process and ensure the 
dividends of peace to Sri Lankans. In May 2012, the Cabinet decided that a Task Force 
would monitor the implementation of LLRC recommendations. In July, a matrix containing 
the National Plan of Action to implement the recommendations was developed, approved 
and published by the Task Force. Noting that the primary focus of the ill-conceived March 
2012 resolution of the Human Rights Council had been the implementation of the LLRC 
report, Sri Lanka recalled that it had repeatedly assured the Council of its commitment to 
implement the domestic process and requested time and space. 
</p>
<p>12. A time frame for implementation was in process. Thematic sub-committees had 
been created under the task force for better coordination and implementation. 
Recommendations were further subdivided and related to: National Policy; final phase of 
the conflict; Human Rights and National Security concerns; and resettlement and 
development. Certain matters of broad national policy in the Action Plan are referred to the 
proposed Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC). On the Action Plan, specific examples of 
completion or substantial progress on activities were provided. Suggestions that only some 
of the recommendations were addressed for implementation and that there was no progress 
were unfounded. Detailing progress in relation to ex-combatants, specific information of 
persons rehabilitated and reintegrated into society (including child combatants), as well as 
those being processed, were provided. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding resettlement, the delegation stressed that resettled persons must be 
provided with &#8220;durable solutions&#8221;. With closure of the last welfare centre in September, Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka will deal with IDPs residing with host families and in protracted displacement. Sri 
Lanka had resettled 501,194 persons by October. The &#8220;older caseload&#8221; of IDPs includes 
tens of thousands of Muslim residents of the North, forcibly evicted by the LTTE in 
1990/1991 in pursuance of their policy of ethnic cleansing, and thousands of Sinhalese 
similarly evicted. The total number of houses constructed in the Northern and Eastern 
Provinces up to September is 124,184 was at the cost of SL Rs 33.34 billion from 2005. 
</p>
<p>14. Progress was achieved in demining to enable resettlement. As at October 2012, 
about 98 per cent of the areas identified were cleared. The Army was responsible for 
demining approximately 75 per cent of the land. Management of land in the North and East 
was a priority. A programme to resolve land disputes had been implemented. Steps that will 
enable the Government to gain an understanding of the magnitude and ramifications of the 
conflict  and which would conclusively lay to rest the unfounded allegations of &#8220;tens of </p>


<p>thousands&#8221; of civilian deaths alleged to have occurred in the first five months of 2009, were 
taken. 
</p>
<p>15. On accountability, a Court of Inquiry was appointed in January 2012 by the Army 
Commander, tasked with inquiring into the observations of the LLRC in its report on 
alleged civilian casualties during the final phase of the Humanitarian Operation and a probe 
into the Channel-4 video footage. Progress of the Court of Inquiry in investigating more 
than 50 incidents referred to in the LLRC report was referred to. The Army had appointed a 
Board of Inquiry to study the LLRC recommendations and formulate a viable action plan to 
implement relevant recommendations. The Sri Lanka Navy had also initiated similar 
measures. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to allegations of torture, several avenues for investigation and 
prosecution of offenders, as well as preventive measures taken, were explained. The current 
status of the Bill on the protection of victims and witnesses was also elaborated on. 
Regarding military presence in the former theatre of conflict, there has been a significant 
reduction of the military strength in the North since the end of the conflict and there is no 
intrusive presence impacting on civilian life &#8211; in Jaffna or in the Wanni. On the contrary, 
the military had assisted civilians resume their normal lives.  Livelihood assistance has 
been facilitated by the armed forces, contributing to restoration of normality. Functions 
have now been taken over by the civilian administration. 
</p>
<p>17. On the supposed increase in sexual violence in the North, Women&#8217;s Protection Units 
with female police officers and Women&#8217;s Centres had been established in the welfare 
centres and counselling services were provided. Action had been taken to combat sexual 
violence. Any correlation between military presence and sexual violence is unfounded. 
Protection of women and advancement of their rights has been a cornerstone of 
Government policy in the post-conflict phase. Several projects have been initiated including 
a focus on conflict-affected women and female-headed households. Sri Lanka ratified the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and acceded 
to the Optional Protocol. Its periodic report was considered by the Committee and 
responses on concluding observations have been submitted. 
</p>
<p>18. Language policy was a key issue which impacted upon the reconciliation process. 
Steps had been taken in relation to the Trilingual Policy (2012 to 2020), and its 
implementation. On the way ahead as a nation and the institutional and other arrangements 
to unify the people and work together for a mutually beneficial future, the Government&#8217;s 
approach to evolving a consensus formula remains the establishment of a PSC, aimed at 
achieving a multi-party consensus. Government has already nominated its members and the 
opposition nomination of members was awaited, to commence sittings. 
</p>
<p>19.  The Government had taken steps to restore normality to the conflict affected areas - 
committing US$ 2.8 billion to ongoing projects in 2011, in addition to expenditure on 
humanitarian assistance and relief. The economy in the Northern Province had grown by 22 
per cent [as against 7 per cent nationally] in 2010 and 27 per cent in 2011 [as against 7.5 
per cent nationally]. The Millennium Development Goals are integrated into the national 
development agenda. Sri Lanka has achieved some and is on track to reach most indicators. 
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework, applicable from 2013, reflects 
this approach towards developing a stable and prosperous Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka requested 
an objective assessment of what has been done.
