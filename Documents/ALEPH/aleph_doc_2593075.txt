Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information; Risk Factors
 
This report for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 ("Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q") contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Canadian and United States securities laws,
including the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. From time to time,
our public filings, press releases and other communications (such as conference calls and
presentations) will contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking information is often, but
not always, identified by the use of words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "plan,"
"intend," "forecast," "target," "project," "may," "will," "should," "could," "estimate," "predict," or
similar words suggesting future outcomes or language suggesting an outlook. Forward-looking
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements with
respect to expectations of our prospects, future revenue, earnings, activities and technical results.
Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs as well as assumptions made by, and
information currently available to, management concerning anticipated financial performance,
business prospects, strategies and regulatory developments.  Although management considers
these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may
prove to be incorrect. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are
made as of the date they were issued and we do not undertake any obligation to update publicly
or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
 
By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both
general and specific, and risks that outcomes implied by forward-looking statements will not be
achieved. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements
as a number of important factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from the
beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions expressed in such
forward-looking statements.
 
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the impact of: levels and volatility of
oil and gas prices; cyclical nature of the energy industry and credit risks of our customers;
fluctuations of our revenue and earnings; operating hazards inherent in our operations; changes
in governmental regulations, including those related to the climate and hydraulic fracturing;
consolidation or loss of our customers; the highly competitive nature of our business;
technological advancements and trends in our industry, and improvements in our competitors’
products; global economic and political environment, and financial markets; terrorist attacks,
natural disasters and pandemic diseases; our presence in international markets, including
political or economic instability, currency restrictions and trade and economic sanctions;
cybersecurity incidents; protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights; changes in, or
our failure to comply with, environmental regulations; restrictions under our credit facility that that
may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs and could accelerate our debt
payments; failure of our manufactured products and claims under our product warranties;
availability of raw materials, component parts and finished products to produce our products, and
our ability deliver the products we manufacture in a timely manner; retention and recruitment of a
skilled workforce and key employees; and ability to identify and complete acquisitions. These
risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking
statements. When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions, investors and
others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential
events.
 
Copies of our Canadian public filings are available through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.  Our
U.S. public filings are available through www.tescocorp.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.
 
Please see Part I, Item 1A—"Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 ("2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K") and Part II, Item 1A—"Risk Factors" of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding our exposure to
risks. Additionally, new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict
all such risk factors, nor to assess the impact such risk factors might have on our business or the
extent to which any factor or combination of risk factors may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and
uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a
prediction of actual results.

TESCO CORPORATION
 
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1—Nature of Operations and Basis of Preparation
 
Nature of Operations
Tesco Corporation a global leader in the design, assembly, and service delivery of technology-
based solutions for the upstream energy industry. The Company seeks to change the way wells
are drilled by delivering safer and more efficient solutions that add value by reducing the costs of
drilling for, and producing, oil and natural gas. Product and service offerings consist mainly of
equipment sales and services to major oil and natural gas service companies and exploration
and production operating companies throughout the world.
Basis of Presentation
 
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of operating results for the interim
periods presented. Adjustments consist of normal and recurring accruals. The consolidated
financial statements are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and
consequently do not include all disclosures required for annual financial statements presented in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). For further
information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. All references
to $ are to U.S. dollars.
Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our accounting policies as described in the notes to our
audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-09,
Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which requires income tax effects of awards to
be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It will also allow an
employer to repurchase more of an employees' shares for tax withholding purposes without
triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they
occur. The update will be effective January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of
the standard is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position, results of
operations, or disclosures in notes to consolidated financial statements of the Company.
Note 3—Inventories, net
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventories, net of reserves for excess and obsolete
inventories of $8.0 million and $11.8 million, respectively, by major classification were as follows
(in thousands). Finished goods inventories include completed units assembled and ready for
sale and spare parts inventory outside of our assembly facility that are ready for sale to third-party
customers.

When top drive units from our rental fleet are sold, the sales proceeds are included in revenue
and the net book value of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales and services within
product sales of our Products segment. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, 3
and 6 used top drives, respectively, were sold from our rental fleet, which had an aggregate net
book value of $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, one used top drive was sold from our rental fleet, which had an aggregate net
book value of $0.2 million.
Asset Impairment
We evaluate for potential impairment of long-lived tangible and intangible assets subject to
amortization when indicators of impairment are present. Circumstances that could indicate a
potential impairment include significant adverse changes in industry trends, economic climate,
legal factors, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. More specifically, significant
adverse changes in industry trends include substantial declines in revenue rates, utilization
rates, oil and natural gas market prices and

industry rig counts. In performing an impairment evaluation, we estimate the future undiscounted
net cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of long-lived tangible and intangible assets
grouped at the lowest level that cash flows can be identified, which is our operating segments. If
the sum of the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of
the asset group, then we determine the fair value of the asset group. The amount of an
impairment charge is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value
of the asset group.
Since late 2014, oil prices have declined significantly resulting in a downturn in our industry,
affecting both drilling and production services. Consequently, we saw an overall decline in the
number of new wells drilled and the average rig count throughout 2015, which impacted the
demand for our products and services. We continued to see further declines during the first three
months of 2016, which resulted in significantly lower cash flow projections. Accordingly, we
performed an impairment evaluation on our long-lived assets as per the guidance of ASC Topic
360, Property, Plant and Equipment. Consequently during the three months ended March 31,
2016, we recognized $0.9 million of impairment related to intangibles and $34.6 million to reduce
the carrying values of our fixed assets to estimated fair value in our Products operating segment.
The value of assets in our Tubular Services operating segment are deemed to be recoverable,
and no impairment resulted.
We measured the fair value of the asset group by applying a combination of the market approach
and the cost approach at February 29, 2016. To estimate the fair value in-exchange of the
property, plant and equipment, we utilized the market approach and relied upon a combination of
third party market comparable, recent market sales, review of salvage values from published
guides and management estimates. To estimate the fair value in-exchange for the two large
manufacturing plants located in Houston and Calgary, we relied upon the improved sales
comparison approach / discussions with brokers to estimate the market value. For the remaining
3 minor owned locations, the indirect cost approach was utilized. Our estimates of fair value
required us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value
measurement, including assumptions related to the future performance of our Products operating
segment, such as future oil prices, amount of drilling activity, and projected demand for our
services.
The following tables present the impairments recognized by our major categories of property,
plant and equipment and by our major categories of intangible assets (in thousands):

Shares were excluded from the calculation of the diluted weighted average number of shares
outstanding as the Company was in a net loss position for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015. The inclusion of the shares would be anti-dilutive. For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, there were approximately 322,000 and 346,000
shares excluded, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, there were
approximately 295,000 and 247,000 shares excluded, respectively.
Common Stock Issued
During the three months ended June 2016 the Company completed a secondary public equity
offering of 7.0 million common shares that generated proceeds of $46.7 million, net of
underwriting discounts, commissions, issuance costs and expenses. Subsequent to the balance
sheet date, our underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional
130,752 common shares that generated nearly $1 million in additional proceeds. The
unexercised options expired on July 8, 2016.
Note 8—Income Taxes
 
TESCO is an Alberta, Canada corporation. We conduct business and are taxed on profits earned
in certain jurisdictions around the world. Income taxes have been provided for based on the laws
and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted or in which we are
considered a resident for income tax purposes.
Our income tax provision (benefit) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
was as follows (in thousands):

Our effective tax rate, which is income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax earnings, was a
1% benefit and 0% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to
a (79)% and (48)% expense for the same periods in 2015. The current income tax expense for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was due to certain tax jurisdictions where we
remain profitable.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable
income of the appropriate character and in the related jurisdiction in the future. In evaluating our
ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider the available positive and negative
evidence, including the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, past
operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and forecast of
future taxable income which inherently requires significant assumptions and judgment.

Note 9—Long-Term Debt and Credit Facility
We entered into our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on April 27, 2012 (the
"Credit Facility"), to provide a revolving line of credit of $125 million, including up to $20 million of
swing line loans (collectively, the "Revolver"). During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we
reduced the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility by $65 million to $60 million. See
Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9” in our 2015 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the
Revolver and $1.9 million and $1.3 million in letters of credit outstanding within our Credit
Facility, respectively.
On February 29, 2016, we received a waiver under the Credit Facility ("this Waiver") for the
Company's failure to comply with certain financial covenants under the Credit Facility as of the
end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2015. This Waiver was effective from February 29,
2016 through and including the date on which we deliver, to our lenders, our financial statements
and compliance certificate, both with respect to the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2016. On May
6, 2016, the waiver was extended to and through the date on which we deliver, to our lenders,
our financial statements and compliance certificate, both with respect to the fiscal quarter ending
June 30, 2016, contemporaneously with the filing of this Report.
Under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to, among other things, (i) not permit the
leverage ratio to be greater than 3.00 to 1.0 at any time, (ii) maintain a consolidated net worth of
not less than $394.2 million as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2016, (iii) not
permit the interest coverage ratio to be less than 3.00 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter,
and (iv) if the leverage ratio is greater than 2.0 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, not permit
the consolidated capital expenditures to be greater than the sum of consolidated EBITDA
calculated for the most-recently completed four fiscal quarters plus net cash proceeds from asset
sales for the most-recently completed four fiscal quarters. As of the end of the fiscal quarter
ending June 30, 2016, the Company had a leverage ratio of (0.07), a consolidated net worth of
$348.0 million, an interest coverage ratio of (16.4) and capital expenditures of $7.0 million. Under
the Waiver (as amended on May 6, 2016), the lenders waived failures of the Company to
maintain the requisite leverage ratio, consolidated net worth, interest coverage ratio and
consolidated capital expenditures covenants under the Credit Facility as of the end of the fiscal
quarter ending June 30, 2016.
On August 9, 2016, we terminated the Credit Facility in order to eliminate certain fees and
expenses associated with maintaining an undrawn credit facility. Further, as of August 9, 2016,
we maintain $1.9 million on deposit as collateral for the letters of credit outstanding.

Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies
 
Legal contingencies
In the normal course of our business, we are subject to legal proceedings brought by or against
us and our subsidiaries. None of the proceedings involves a claim for damages exceeding ten
percent of our current assets on a consolidated basis. There can be no assurance as to the
eventual outcome or the amount of loss we may suffer as a result of these proceedings.
 
Other Contingencies
 
We are contingently liable under letters of credit and similar instruments that we enter into in
connection with the importation of equipment into foreign countries and to secure our
performance on certain contracts. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our total
exposure under outstanding letters of credit was $3.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively.
At June 30, 2016, accounts receivable included approximately $1.6 million from a customer in
Mexico for the period of May 2013 through July 2014 that are unbilled due to a contractual rate
dispute.

Major customers and credit risk
Accounts receivable are subject to normal industry credit risks and are principally derived from
major oil and natural gas service companies and exploration and production companies. We
perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and grant credit based upon past payment
history, financial condition and anticipated industry conditions. Customer payments are regularly
monitored and a provision for doubtful accounts is established based upon specific situations
and overall industry conditions. Many of our customers are located in regions that are inherently
subject to risks of economic, political and civil instabilities, which may impact our ability to
collect. The main factors in determining the allowance needed for accounts receivable are
customer bankruptcies, delinquency and management’s estimate of ability to collect outstanding
receivables based on the number of days outstanding and risks of economic, political and civil
instabilities. Bad debt expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our
consolidated statements of income.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
 
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be
read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related
notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion
contains forward-looking statements.  Please see "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking
Information; Risk Factors" above and "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A below and in our 2015
Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions
associated with these statements.
Overview and Outlook
We are a global technology leader and provider of highly engineered solutions for drilling,
servicing, and completion of wells with facilities in North America, Europe, Russia, Latin
America, Middle East, and Asia Pacific. Operations consist of pipe handling product sales and
rentals, after-market sales and services, and tubular services, including related products and
accessories sales.
Unless indicated otherwise, results of operations data are presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP").
Business Environment
Our revenues are dependent on the number of worldwide oil and gas wells drilled, the price of
crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by exploration and production companies and drilling
contractors, the level of worldwide oil and gas reserves inventory, civil unrest and conflicts in oil
producing countries, and oil sanctions and global economics, among other things. The
profitability of exploration and production companies is primarily affected by the current and
anticipated prices of crude oil. Profitability is a key factor in their willingness to invest in new
exploration and production activities, which drives rig count and well count and influences
profitability of drilling contractors. Accordingly, rig count and well count are important business
barometers for the drilling industry and its suppliers, as they may reflect the relative strength and
stability of energy prices and overall market activity. When drilling rigs are active they consume
products and services produced by the oil services companies like ours. However, it is important
to look at rig count in conjunction with the well count. Moreover, these counts should not be
solely relied on as an indicator of the economic condition of our industry, as other specific and
pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.

Outlook
The effect and duration of oil and gas price downturns continues to be unpredictable. We began
to see a decline in crude oil prices after the average West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") and Brent
reached highs of $107.95 and $115.19, respectively, in June 2014. The declines continued
throughout the remainder of 2014 and 2015, with WTI and Brent at $36.36 and $36.61,
respectively, at the end of 2015. The spot prices of WTI and Brent at June 30, 2016 have shown
moderate increases to $48.27 and $48.05, respectively. The current outlook for commodity prices
is that they will remain relatively unchanged for the remainder of 2016 with only modest increase
for 2017. (2)
The Company's response to the market conditions has resulted in aggressive cost rationalization
and global reorganization to right-size the company. During the six months ended June 30, 2016,
the global workforce was reduced by an additional 23%, as compared to December 31, 2015,
resulting in a charge of $3.0 million. Facility closures during the same period resulted in a charge
of $0.9 million. In addition, certain austerity measures and efforts to streamline our overhead and
support structure initiated in the previous year were continued. During the year ended December
31, 2015, the global workforce was reduced by 30%, resulting in a related aggregate charge of
$10.9 million. The benefits of these efforts were seen this quarter as profitability improved despite
a decline in sales.
The global markets will continue to be challenging as recent rig count increases in the U.S. were
offset by declines in international markets. In addition, the recent steep decline in oil prices below
$40 is softening the consensus about the pace and strength of the recovery. Accordingly, cost
reductions and restructuring alone will not be sufficient to return us to profitability. We need to
grow our revenue run rates and improve our products and services mix to achieve a break-even
EBITDA. Our focus it to take advantage of changes in the marketplace and increase our market
share by accelerating the deployment of our organic initiatives, accelerating the deployment of
new technologies, adapting our business models more aggressively and, possibly, the
acquisition of key synergistic technologies to complement our platform.
In a recovering market, we have the capacity to be an early actor through our ability to
aggressively fund capital spending and working capital as well as to accelerate technology
deployments. We believe that greater integration of drilling services into the rig operations;
upgrading of rigs, particularly around pipe handling and mechanization of rig-floor processes;
increased focus on highly mobile, plug and play rig equipment that can move between rigs and
create much greater capital efficiency; and the acceleration of remote management, real-time
communication and software technologies to enhance drilling performance are emerging market
trends that favor Tesco.

active, a rig must be on location and be drilling or 'turning to the right'. A rig is considered
active from the moment the well is "spudded" until it reaches target depth. Rigs that are in
transit from one location to another, rigging up or being used in non-drilling activities such as
workovers, completions or production testing, are not counted as active.

In addition, we have begun to see a shift in the market in which participants are moving from
maintaining their own equipment to outsourcing this activity under long-term contracts. Moreover,
we believe that in the current business environment, many top drives have suffered deferred
maintenance and cannibalization, which we expect will result in a steady increase in the need for
service, maintenance, and recertification as commodity prices recover and drilling activity
increases. We plan to use our existing facilities as a base to promote our after-market sales and
services to capture long-term maintenance contracts opportunities, which may be enhanced
through our automated rig controls, equipment health monitoring services, and pipe handling
automation. These services are also compatible with our competitors' top drives. We expect
these factors to allow us to take advantage of our existing inventory.
Historically, our tubular services business was primarily focused on onshore drilling. With land-
based drilling consistently moving toward horizontal drilling, the value from automated casing
running tools, specifically our CDS offering, has served as the foundation of our land-based
expertise. Our customers have realized great benefit from the performance of our casing running
tools and our approach to developing new solutions has provided us with the opportunity to
expand to offshore markets. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for growth in the
offshore market, including the market for our automated tubular services and equipment. Our
automated services require fewer people to operate, thereby reducing expense and promoting
safety and service quality. We plan to use our offshore expertise gained in Indonesia, Saudi
Arabia, the United States, Mexico and the North Sea to continue to increase our offshore market
share. Offshore operations are long-term in nature and, therefore, less affected by short term
swings in crude oil prices. We plan to capitalize on growth opportunities, continue to invest in
research and engineering related to our Products and Tubular Services segments and continue
to better integrate our products and service offerings with our customer's needs.

Products Segment
Revenues from our Products segment are generated through pipe handling product sales,
rentals, and after-market sales and service. Sales of top drives consist of new and used top
drives and catwalks. Our rental fleet of pipe handling products is mobile. We install the units on
the customers' rig site and charge a daily rate for rental operating days. Rental operating days
are defined as a day that a unit in our rental fleet is under contract and operating.
Our after-market sales and service consists of providing parts and servicing units. We provide
these services for automated pipe handling equipment we manufacture and selected models of
our competitors.
Q2 2016 as compared with Q2 2015
Sales
Revenues decreased by $5.4 million, or 39%, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to fewer top drive units sold globally as a result of decreased
demand, rig count and crude oil prices. In the three months ended June 30, 2016, we sold a total
of 8 top drives, of which 5 were new and 3 were from our rental fleet, as compared to the same
period in 2015, where we sold 11 top drives, of which 10 were new and one was from our rental
fleet. We recognized revenue of $1.6 million and $0.8 million related to the sale of the used top
drives from our rental fleet during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Rental Services
Revenues decreased by $11.8 million, or 67%, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to the depressed market demand within the industry, which led
to a 50% decrease in our utilization. At June 30, 2016 utilization declined to 15% due to fewer
operating days and fewer contracted units. The decrease in activity in conjunction with price
compression primarily impacted our revenues in Latin America.
17
Table of Contents
After-Market Sales and Services
Revenues decreased by $3.6 million, or 36%, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to a decline in demand for parts and services in North America
and Asia Pacific, accounting for 67% and 16%, respectively, of the total decline. With the
continued decline in oil prices and consequential decrease in drilling activity, customers have
chosen to defer non-critical services and consume their inventories rather than replenish them.
Operating Loss
Products operating loss was flat for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015.
Declines in revenue were offset by reductions in operating expenses derived from our aggressive
restructuring and cost rationalization efforts. Reductions in workforce and offices closures
resulted in charges of $0.8 million and $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
YTD 2016 as compared with YTD 2015
Sales
Revenues decreased by $18.9 million, or 60%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to fewer top drive units sold globally as a result of decreased
demand driven by reduced rig count and depressed crude oil prices. In the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we sold a total of 14 top drives, of which 8 were new and 6 were from our rental
fleet, as compared to the same period in 2015, when we sold 25 top drives, of which 24 were
new and one was from our rental fleet. We recognized revenue of $2.8 million and $0.8 million
related to the sale of the used top drives from our rental fleet during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Rental Services
Revenues decreased by $25.3 million, or 67%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to the depressed market demand within the industry causing a
56% decrease in utilization rates. At June 30, 2016 utilization declined to 14% due to fewer
operating days and fewer contracted units. The decrease in activity compounded with price
compression primarily impacted our revenues in Latin America, North America and Russia.
After-Market Sales and Services
Revenues decreased by $10.0 million, or 45%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to a decline in demand for parts and services in North America,
Asia Pacific and Latin America, accounting for 63%, 14% and 13%, respectively, of the total
decline. With the continued decline in oil prices and consequential decrease in drilling activity,
customers have chosen to defer non-critical services and consume their inventories rather than
replenish them.
Operating Loss
Products operating loss decreased by $43.6 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to the decline in revenues for each product offering due to
current market conditions as a result of continued declines in oil prices and in overall demand for
oilfield services.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we identified indicators that could cause
potential impairments to our long-lived assets. Due to these indicators, we conducted testing for
impairment and determined that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in our Products
segment exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recognized an aggregate long-lived asset
impairment of $33.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. For further discussion,
see Part 1, Item 1, "Financial Statements, Note 5", included in this report. Reductions in
workforce and offices closures resulted in charges of $1.4 million and $3.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Tubular Services Segment
We generate revenues in our Tubular Services segment from land and offshore services
augmented by sales of products, accessories and consumables for the casing running process.
Our services include personnel and equipment, including the CDSTM, power tongs, pick up/lay-
down units, torque monitoring services and connection testing services for new well completion
and in work-over or re-entry operations. Our product sales include the CDSTM, down-well
consumables and other non-consumable parts.
Q2 2016 as compared with Q2 2015
Land
Revenues decreased by $15.7 million, or 67%, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased activity and demand in North America and Latin
America of 46% and 45%, respectively. The decrease in rig count and
18
Table of Contents
overall activity resulted in a reduction of jobs performed during the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015. In addition, we experienced significant price compression within
tubular services during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015.
Offshore
Revenues decreased by $4.4 million, or 50%, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the number of operating rigs within the Asia
Pacific region during the second quarter of 2016. This decrease is partially offset by offshore
revenue in North America as our mix of services performed continue to shift towards higher
revenue generating deepwater services.
CDS, Parts, & Accessories
Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015 were flat. Decreases
in revenues of part and accessories sales in North America and Latin America were offset by the
sale of a used CDS unit in Asia Pacific.
Operating Loss
Tubular Services operating loss decreased by $6.5 million, for the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the aforementioned declines in revenue partially
offset by cost reductions achieved through aggressive cost rationalization efforts undertaken.
Reductions in workforce and offices closures resulted in charges of $0.8 million and $1.1 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
YTD 2016 as compared with YTD 2015
Land
Revenues decreased by $35.5 million, or 66%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased activity and demand in North America and Latin
America of 45% and 44%, respectively. The decrease in rig count and overall activity resulted in
a reduction of jobs being performed during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to
2015. Additionally, the continued decline in oil prices and tubular services competition
compressed pricing.
Offshore
Revenues decreased by $6.8 million, or 37%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the number of operating rigs within the Asia
Pacific region during the first half of 2016. This decrease was offset by offshore revenue in North
America as our mix of services performed continue to shift towards higher revenue generating
deepwater services.
CDS, Parts, & Accessories
Revenues decreased by $0.6 million, or 28%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to declining part sales driven by customers postponing capital
expenditures in light of the decline in market conditions. The decrease in revenues related to
parts and accessories is tied to the decreased land-based and offshore tubular services jobs
performed in primarily in North America and Latin America during the six months ended June 30,
2016.
Operating Loss
Tubular Services operating loss decreased by $14.6 million, for the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the aforementioned declines in revenue partially
offset by cost reductions achieved through aggressive cost rationalization efforts undertaken.
Significant contributors to the total decline were Latin America and Asia Pacific of 59% and 32%,
respectively. Reductions in workforce and offices closures resulted in charges of $2.2 million and
$2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Declines were
further offset by an adjustment in the amount of past due disputed accounts payable during the
three months ended March 31, 2016.
Research and Engineering Segment
We are a technology-based company deploying new technologies to increase the degree of rig
automation and mechanization and to enhance our field operations. We are working
aggressively to drive a more definitive integration between the drilling rig and tubular services
technology. We continue to invest in our research and engineering in order to continually
develop, commercialize and enhance our proprietary products relating to our current product
offerings and new technologies in development.

Q2 2016 as compared with Q2 2015
Operating expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 30%, during the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in spending related to targeted cost
rationalization efforts.
YTD 2016 as compared with YTD 2015
Operating expenses decreased by $1.9 million, or 39%, during the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in spending related to targeted cost
rationalization efforts.
Corporate and Other Segment
Corporate and other expenses primarily consist of overhead, general and administrative
expenses and certain selling and marketing expenses. Corporate and other expenses as a
percent of revenues were 17% and 8% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
Q2 2016 as compared with Q2 2015
Operating expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 4%, during the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to cost saving measures implemented in 2015 and
continuing in 2016. The benefits of these cost saving measures are visible primarily in personnel
costs and various discretionary spending accounts.
YTD 2016 as compared with YTD 2015
Operating expenses decreased by $1.7 million, or 11%, during the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to cost saving measures implemented in 2015 and
continuing in 2016. The benefits of these cost saving measures are visible primarily in personnel
costs and various discretionary spending accounts.

Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $0.2 million, or 46%, during the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the decrease in debt issue costs related to the
reduction of our Credit Facility's borrowing capacity.
Interest Income
Interest income increased by $0.3 million, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to interest received on short term investment of excess cash held
in Latin America.
Foreign Exchange Loss
Although our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, our operations have net assets and liabilities
not denominated in the functional currency which exposes us to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates that impact income. Foreign exchange losses decreased
20
Table of Contents
by $1.4 million, or 99%, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015
primarily due to relatively stable exchange rates and reductions in net monetary assets subject to
revaluation in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.
Other Expense (Income)
Other expense increased by $0.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to the fair market value adjustment recorded in 2015 for the
contingent earn-out obligation related to the acquisition of assets in 2014. The contingent earn-
out obligation expired in May 2016.
Income Tax Provision
Income tax provision decreased by $12.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $15.3 million valuation allowance
recorded against deferred tax assets during the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our effective
tax rates were a 1% benefit and a (79)% expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
YTD 2016 as compared with YTD 2015
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased by $0.1 million, or 14%, during the six months ended June 30, 2016
as compared to 2015 primarily due to the write off the unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.2
million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 related to the decrease in our Credit Facility's
borrowing capacity.
Interest Income
Interest income increased by $0.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to interest received on short term investment of excess cash held
in Latin America.
Foreign Exchange Loss
Although our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, our operations have net assets and liabilities
not denominated in the functional currency which exposes us to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates that impact income. Foreign exchange losses decreased by $3.4 million, or 74%,
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to relatively
stable exchange rates and reductions in net monetary assets subject to revaluation in Argentina,
Colombia, and Mexico.
Other Expense (Income)
Other expense increased by $0.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 primarily due to the fair market value adjustment recorded in 2015 for the
contingent earn-out obligation related to the acquisition of assets in 2014. The contingent earn-
out obligation expired in May 2016.
Income Tax Provision
Income tax provision decreased by $11.3 million, or 97%, for the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $15.3 million valuation
allowance recorded against deferred tax assets during the six months ended June 30, 2015. Our
effective tax rates were 0% and a (48)% expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing, and
financing activities. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations
and available cash and cash equivalents. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, cash and
cash equivalents increased by $46.0 million to $97.5 million, primarily due to the June 2016
secondary public equity offering of 7.0 million common shares of the Company that generated
proceeds of $46.7 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, issuance costs and
expenses. The offering proceeds provide Tesco optionality to address working capital and
capital spending needs in a potential market recovery while also funding strategic initiatives to
gain market share through technology offerings and possibly through acquisitions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the manufacturing
purchase commitments and letters of credit noted below, future interest payments on the
aggregate unused commitments under our revolving credit facility and lease commitments as
described in Part II, Item 7—"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
21
Table of Contents
Manufacturing Purchase Commitments
Our manufacturing purchase commitments, which represent executed purchase orders that have
been submitted to our respective vendors, have decreased from $8.5 million as of December 31,
2015 to $6.9 million as of June 30, 2016.  This decrease of $1.6 million, or 19%, is driven
primarily by the receipt of orders and the cancellation of prior orders with vendors due to the
decline in product demand caused by the decline in oil prices.
Letters of Credit
The Company enters into letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. The availability of
current borrowings is, and future borrowings may be, limited in order to maintain certain financial
ratios required by restrictive covenants in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,
dated as of April 27, 2012 (the "Credit Facility"). As of June 30, 2016, outstanding letters of credit
were approximately $3.0 million, of which $1.9 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility.
On August 9, 2016, we terminated the Credit Facility in order to eliminate certain fees and
expenses associated with maintaining an undrawn credit facility. Further, as of August 9, 2016,
we maintain $1.9 million on deposit in letters of credit outstanding , see Part 1, Item 1, “Financial
Statements, Note 9”, included in this Report.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
 
Accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
included in Part II, Item 7—"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10−K. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Results of
operations and financial condition, as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and related notes, are subject to management’s evaluation and
interpretation of business conditions, changing capital market conditions and other factors that
could affect the ongoing viability of the business and customers. While these issues require
judgments that may be subjective, they are generally based on a significant amount of historical
data and current market data. The most critical accounting policies are those described in “Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10−K.  During
the three and six ended June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the types of
judgments, assumptions and estimates upon which our critical accounting estimates are based.
Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
See Part I, Item 7A —"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the 2015
Annual Report on Form 10‑K for a detailed discussion of the risks affecting the Company. There
have been no material changes to the market risks described in Part I, Item 7A —"Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report on Form
10‑K.
Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures designed and maintained to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time period specified by the SEC’s rules and forms and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. As of June 30, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer participated with management in evaluating
the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-
15(e) under the Exchange Act). The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal
Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
