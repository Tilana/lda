<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>The visit<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice visited Peru from 11 to 19 September 2014 at the invitation of the 
</p>
<p>Government. It met with stakeholders in Lima and Ayacucho. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>wishes to thank the Government for its assistance in the organization of this visit and 
</p>
<p>for its cooperation during the mission. 
</p>
<p>2. In Lima, the Working Group met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the 
</p>
<p>Minister for Women and Vulnerable Groups, the Deputy Minister for Women, the 
</p>
<p>Office of the President of the Council of Ministers, the chairperson of the National 
</p>
<p>Elections Board, two judges, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the 
</p>
<p>Attorney General, representatives of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion , the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Health, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Labour and Job Creation  and the 
</p>
<p>National Network of Women Authorities. It also met with members of Congress and 
</p>
<p>the female Peruvian member of the Andean Parliament. In Ayacucho, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group met with the President of the regional government, the mayor of the provincial 
</p>
<p>municipality of Huamanga and the local branch of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. It also 
</p>
<p>visited the Women&#8217;s Emergency Centre. 
</p>
<p>3. During its visit, the Working Group also met with representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and of civil society. In Lima, it visited and met with a group of 
</p>
<p>women from soup kitchens and visited a school in San Juan de Lurigancho. In 
</p>
<p>Ayacucho, it met with civil society and a nun. It also met with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>country team and wishes to thank in particular the Human Rights Adviser of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Programme for her very valuable support.  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Context<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. In the past decade, Peru has experienced rapid and sustained economic growth 
</p>
<p>and has been classified by the World Bank as an upper-middle-income country. The 
</p>
<p>poverty rate fell from 58.7 per cent in 2004 to 23.9 per cent in 2013. However, the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s human development index has barely improved. Peru is characterized by 
</p>
<p>marked inequalities, regional inequalities in particular; in rural areas, the poverty rate 
</p>
<p>is 54 per cent. The rate of chronic malnutrition in urban areas is 18 pe r cent, whereas 
</p>
<p>in rural areas it is 32 per cent. 1  People who belong to ethnic minorities, have 
</p>
<p>disabilities, who live in rural areas of the highlands and the jungle or whose mother 
</p>
<p>tongue is an indigenous language have neither access to public services nor the 
</p>
<p>opportunities available to those whose mother tongue is Spanish and who live in urban 
</p>
<p>areas. 
</p>
<p>5. The increasing economic development has not brought decent work opportunities 
</p>
<p>for the vast majority of the population, and the lack of job security affect s women 
</p>
<p>greatly, particularly in rural and Amazonian areas and in the highlands. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group was informed that many women are emigrating as a result of economic 
</p>
<p>hardships, which sometimes puts them in situations of increased vulnerability and 
</p>
<p>fragility (trafficking and labour exploitation). The Working Group notes that the 
</p>
<p>percentage of households headed by women rose from 23.8 per cent in 2009 to 26.5 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>per cent in 2013 (28.5 per cent in urban areas and 21.2 per cent in rural areas). 2 These 
</p>
<p>households are more likely to be affected by poverty: 31 per cent of them are poor, as 
</p>
<p>opposed to 26.4 per cent of those headed by a man.

</b></p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Legal framework<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>1.<b> </b>Progress<b> 
</b> </p>
<p> At international and regional level  
</p>
<p>6. Peru has ratified nearly every international and regional human rights 
</p>
<p>instrument, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (in 1982) and the Optional Protocol thereto (in 2001) 
</p>
<p>and the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;), and has committed to the 
</p>
<p>Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action as well as the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals. Peru has also ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Equal 
</p>
<p>Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100), ILO Discrimination (Employment and 
</p>
<p>Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111), ILO Workers with Family Responsibilities 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1981 (No. 156), ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 
</p>
<p>(No. 169), and ILO Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183). 3 Peru has not 
</p>
<p>yet ratified the ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189).  
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> At national level  
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group recognizes the considerable efforts made by the State in 
</p>
<p>recent years to strengthen its legal framework in relation to the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality. The Peruvian Constitution 
</p>
<p>enshrines the right to equality and non-discrimination on the grounds of sex.  
</p>
<p>8. The Act on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men of 2007 was a significant 
</p>
<p>legislative development. That Act adopts definitions of equality and discrimination 
</p>
<p>consistent with those of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women. It states that the legislature should adopt rules that 
</p>
<p>ensure the equal rights of men and women in the employment, economic, cultural, 
</p>
<p>social, political and other spheres and provides for oversight of the implementation 
</p>
<p>and enforcement of those rules and policies.  
</p>
<p>9. The Act aims, inter alia, to ensure the right to productive work, incorporating 
</p>
<p>measures to prevent discrimination of any kind, guaranteeing equal access to 
</p>
<p>employment, training, promotion and appropriate working conditions and equal pay 
</p>
<p>for work of equal value.4 The Act also guarantees the right to health in terms of the 
</p>
<p>availability, quality, acceptability and accessibility of services, with special emphasis 
</p>
<p>on sexual and reproductive rights, the prevention of teenage pregnancy and, in 
</p>
<p>particular, the right to safe pregnancy and birth. It guarantees access to public 
</p>
<p>education and the right to remain in school at all levels of the school system, on a 
</p>
<p>basis of equality, especially in rural areas.

<p> 4 Se incluye entre los derechos laborales la protecci&#243;n frente al hostigamiento sexual y la 
</p>

</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>5/22 </b>GE.15-10576 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Act on Equal Opportunities provides for the development of policies, plans 
</p>
<p>and programmes to prevent, address and eliminate violence against women in all its 
</p>
<p>forms and in all areas. It guarantees access to justice, driving changes to the 
</p>
<p>discriminatory ideas, attitudes and values of judicial officials. It provides for the 
</p>
<p>development of training programmes for judicial and law enforcement personnel that 
</p>
<p>include material on gender, intercultural relations and human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. The Working Group also welcomes the Act, adopted in 2013, guaranteeing equal 
</p>
<p>inheritance rights to men and women who are in de facto marriages. 5 It affords legal 
</p>
<p>protection that contributes to equality by putting cohabitation on a par with marriage. 
</p>
<p>12. One significant achievement is the Act of 2011 that incorporates into the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code the crime of femicide, which it penalizes with the utmost severity, 
</p>
<p>providing for aggravating circumstances and eliminating such prison benefits as semi-
</p>
<p>liberty and parole.6 
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group welcomes the Act of 2013 establishing the irrevocable 
</p>
<p>dismissal of teaching or administrative personnel for acts of sexual violence; dismissal 
</p>
<p>is a measure that aims to penalize sexual violence in the education system and at the 
</p>
<p>same time create a deterrent. 7  It also welcomes the recent adoption of the Act 
</p>
<p>amending the Criminal Code to make sexual harassment in the street an offence.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>2.<b> </b>Challenges<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p>14. The working group notes that articles 3 and 5 of the Act on Equal Opportunities 
</p>
<p>refer to &#8220;equidad de g&#233;nero&#8221; (gender equity) rather than &#8220;igualdad&#8221; (equality), the 
</p>
<p>more appropriate term. The State is obliged by various international instruments to 
</p>
<p>respect, protect and implement women&#8217;s right to equality and to prohibit 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women on the basis of sex. 8  The promise of equity is not 
</p>
<p>sufficient to ensure the right to equality and to live a life free from discrimination of 
</p>
<p>all kinds. The Working Group also regrets that sexual orientation and gender identity 
</p>
<p>were excluded from the list of protected categories. Many informants expressed regret 
</p>
<p>that this ambitious and promising Act has not been systematically and effectively 
</p>
<p>implemented. 
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group notes with concern the absence of a comprehensive legal 
</p>
<p>framework for employment matters. By law, domestic workers and women working in 
</p>
<p>export-oriented agricultural industries and the handicrafts sector have significantly 
</p>
<p>fewer rights - for example, as far as minimum wages and working hours are concerned 
</p>
<p>(see paragraph 47). The Working Group was informed of the preparation of various 
</p>
<p>bills on the rights of domestic workers that propose, inter alia, reforms related to 
</p>
<p>minimum wages, compensation for length of service, holidays and written contracts, 
</p>
<p>as well as a ban on making the recruitment of female workers contingent on their 
</p>
<p>wearing uniforms in public places. The Working Group regrets that these bills have 
</p>
<p>not been adopted. 
</p>
<p>16. While the Working Group welcomes the adoption in 2009 of the Act giving 
</p>
<p>public and private sector workers the right to parental leave,9 which is a positive step 
</p>
<p>towards promoting shared parental responsibility, it regrets that it provides for leave of 
</p>
<p>only four consecutive working days for fathers.10

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Working Group regrets the failure to develop exhaustive legislation to 
</p>
<p>comprehensively address the many forms taken by violence against women and the 
</p>
<p>different areas in which it occurs. The Working Group was informed that a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive bill on combating violence against women and the family, which 
</p>
<p>establishes new protective measures for victims, is still pending adoption. 
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group regrets the failure to adopt bills aimed at rectifying the scant 
</p>
<p>participation of women in public life, including Bill No. 3670, which proposed that 
</p>
<p>the seven members of the Constitutional Court should include at least three women, 
</p>
<p>Bill No. 3682 on the implementation of gender quotas in the appointment of judges 
</p>
<p>and magistrates and Bill No. 4708 on the implementation of gender quotas. 11 The 
</p>
<p>Group hopes that Bill No. 268-2011-JNE on regulating gender quotas for elections and 
</p>
<p>setting up a mandatory system of rotating the candidates on electoral lists will be 
</p>
<p>adopted.12 
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group notes that despite an impressive legal framework promoting 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights and gender equality, there are still significant gaps in de jure and de 
</p>
<p>facto equality. Although existing legislation strengthens the guarantee of access to 
</p>
<p>justice, victims of discrimination face several obstacles to exercising their rights under 
</p>
<p>that legislation, which seriously complicates enforcement of the anti -discrimination 
</p>
<p>laws. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Access to justice<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20. During its visit, the Working Group found that access to the judicial system by 
</p>
<p>Peruvian women, especially rural and indigenous women, still faces significant 
</p>
<p>obstacles that include the cost, distance and language barriers, lack of knowledge of 
</p>
<p>their rights, lack of trust in the judiciary and the police, re-victimization and the threat 
</p>
<p>of ostracism or stigma.  
</p>
<p>21. Although the Government has made some attempts to ensure that judicial 
</p>
<p>personnel are trained on gender issues, there are still no clear mandates or procedures 
</p>
<p>for them to follow to enforce anti-discrimination laws. The lack of adequate and 
</p>
<p>sustained funding to make the administration of justice more gender -sensitive is also a 
</p>
<p>major barrier. In 2014, a certification course on gender violence and women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>fundamental rights was offered to sitting judges. The Working Group hopes that such 
</p>
<p>initiatives to train members of the judiciary will take root and that they will expand to 
</p>
<p>include the issue of gender equality, starting with initial training.  
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group notes that there has been no sign of a sustained and effective 
</p>
<p>strategy to make judges more aware of gender issues. On several occasions, women &#8217;s 
</p>
<p>groups informed the Working Group that judges and other judicial officials are not 
</p>
<p>gender-sensitive and do not treat women as subjects of rights. According to the 
</p>
<p>information provided, in addition to the obstacles women face in reporting gender-
</p>
<p>based violence, the judicial system and the authorities still share a conservative 
</p>
<p>outlook that gives priority to keeping the family together rather than protecting the 
</p>
<p>rights of women. 
</p>
<p>23. Despite efforts to increase the number of women in the police and judiciary, 
</p>
<p>there is an evident shortage of women at the highest levels of the judicial system (see 
</p>
<p>paragraph 43). Nor does the Supreme Court or the National Council of the Judiciary

<p>systems, to ensure the appointment of female judges and monitor the incorporation of 
</p>
<p>a gender-based approach in the practice of the courts. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group notes that the State has made progress with regard to 
</p>
<p>recognition of the terrible consequences of the internal conflict between 1980 and 
</p>
<p>2000, as shown by the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the 
</p>
<p>Comprehensive Reparations Plan launched in 2011 and the Central Register of 
</p>
<p>Victims, the implementation of collective and individual economic reparations 
</p>
<p>programmes, the construction of a memorial and other measures. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group was informed, however, that crimes against women during 
</p>
<p>the conflict have not been adequately punished and their victims have not been 
</p>
<p>compensated. 13  The compensation required by the National Compensation Plan o f 
</p>
<p>2005 has not been systematically paid to the relatives of the thousands of missing 
</p>
<p>persons, leaving many mothers, wives and children who lost male members of their 
</p>
<p>families without proper redress.14 Only a few of the many cases of sexual violence 
</p>
<p>have been examined by the courts, and there have been no convictions, even though 
</p>
<p>several cases are with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. Individual financial 
</p>
<p>compensation was first paid in 2011, through Supreme Decree No. 051 -2011-PCM, 
</p>
<p>which capped compensation at 10,000 nuevos soles, including for rape victims. 
</p>
<p>Measures demanded by the victims themselves, such as health care, symbolic, 
</p>
<p>collective and educational reparations, have not been put in place. Associations of 
</p>
<p>relatives of the victims of the internal conflict are pressing for crimes against women  
</p>
<p>to be classified as crimes against humanity as a means of prosecuting the perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>26. During its visit, the Working Group was informed of numerous women who had 
</p>
<p>been forcibly sterilized in the 1990s as a means of controlling the number of children 
</p>
<p>born to women living in poverty.15 The Working Group notes with regret that their 
</p>
<p>cases have not been effectively investigated and that there have been no convictions or 
</p>
<p>compensation. It regrets that, according to the testimonies of victims with whom the 
</p>
<p>Working Group met, the women affected by the forced sterilizations carried out in 
</p>
<p>inhumane conditions and with serious consequences for their physical and mental 
</p>
<p>health continue to be denied the right to due process.16

<p>Strategic Plan for National Development, the Bicentennial Plan, is the elimination of 
</p>
<p>gender discrimination. The National Human Rights Plan 2014-201617 has among its 
</p>
<p>objectives the consolidation of a public policy for gender equality and the elimination 
</p>
<p>of discrimination against women. 18  The Working Group regrets that the Equal 
</p>
<p>Opportunities Plan for Persons with Disabilities 2009-2018 does not include measures 
</p>
<p>to address the problems of women with disabilities.19 
</p>
<p>28. The National Gender Equality Plan 2012-2017, adopted within the framework of 
</p>
<p>the Act on Equal Opportunities, is a public policy tool for gender mainstreaming at the 
</p>
<p>national, regional and local levels.20 This Plan&#8217;s eight strategic objectives are to: (a) 
</p>
<p>promote and strengthen mainstreaming of the gender approach at the three levels of 
</p>
<p>government; (b) strengthen a culture of respect for and appreciation of gender 
</p>
<p>differences; (c) narrow educational gaps between women and men; (d) improve 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s health and ensure the sexual and reproductive rights of women and men; (e) 
</p>
<p>ensure the economic rights of women in conditions of fairness and equal opportunities 
</p>
<p>with men; (f) reduce the various forms of gender-based violence; (g) increase the 
</p>
<p>participation of women in decision-making and political and civic life; and (h) 
</p>
<p>highlight women&#8217;s contributions to the sustainable management of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>To measure progress, policy outcomes, targets and indicators, for which public 
</p>
<p>agencies are responsible, have been put in place.  
</p>
<p>29. The National Plan to Combat Violence against Women (2009 -2015), which 
</p>
<p>recognizes domestic violence, sexual violence, femicide, sexual harassment, 
</p>
<p>trafficking and homophobia as forms of violence against women, stresses the need to 
</p>
<p>promote the transformation of sociocultural patterns that exacerbate violence against 
</p>
<p>women, with a view to developing new forms of interaction, although the Working 
</p>
<p>Group notes with regret that women with disabilities do not benefit from special 
</p>
<p>protection under the Plan. 21  In addition, the National Plan of Action to Combat 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons 2011-2016, whose guiding principles are a gender perspective 
</p>
<p>and equality, was adopted in 2011.  
</p>
<p>30. As a result of its sustained economic growth since 2000, Peru has increased 
</p>
<p>public investment, with the national budget doubling between 2006 and 2013. This has 
</p>
<p>had a positive impact on the monies earmarked for policies, programmes and 
</p>
<p>operations aimed at social development and to some extent gender equality (for 
</p>
<p>example, the direct cash transfers through the Programme for the Very Poor 
</p>
<p>(JUNTOS), the Pension 65 National Assistance and Solidari ty Programme and the 
</p>
<p>Cooperation for Social Development Fund). 22  However, the Working Group was 
</p>
<p>informed that these benefits reach only a fraction of the eligible population; it is to be 
</p>
<p>hoped that budgets will increase suitably. In addition to direct cash transfers, which 
</p>
<p>are temporary measures that do not in themselves lead to changes in the long -term 
</p>
<p>situations of the beneficiaries, the Working Group stresses the need to implement 
</p>
<p>measures that result in lasting improvements.  
</p>

<p>sustainable public policies. Many emphasized barriers such as the persistence and

</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>D.<b> </b>Institutional framework<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32. The Ministry for Women and Vulnerable Groups, made up of three directorates 
</p>
<p>general, is the country&#8217;s lead agency for gender equality. 24  It has taken many 
</p>
<p>initiatives aimed at promoting and protecting women&#8217;s rights and gender equality, 
</p>
<p>including the design, development, implementation, follow-up and monitoring of 
</p>
<p>policies, thereby making possible progress in the field of regulation and in the 
</p>
<p>development of sectoral, regional and local mechanisms. The Working Group regrets, 
</p>
<p>however, that the Ministry does not have a budget large enough to thoroughly fulfil its 
</p>
<p>mandate. 
</p>
<p>33. According to the information received, many ministries and public agencies have 
</p>
<p>adopted gender-related policies or regulations. The Ministry of the Economy and 
</p>
<p>Finance has provisions incorporating a gender focus into public investment plans. 
</p>
<p>Although the budget framework needs to be strengthened, Peru is one of the countries 
</p>
<p>in the region with the deepest commitment to gender-sensitive budgets. 
</p>
<p>34. The regional governments have developed policies on gender, as well as local 
</p>
<p>structures and mechanisms, to ensure that a gender perspective is mainstreamed into 
</p>
<p>the administrative processes of regional governments. Regional councils for women 
</p>
<p>have been set up in most regional governments as forums for consultation and 
</p>
<p>dialogue. However, laws and policies affecting women and girls are made at national 
</p>
<p>level, and the Working Group was informed that the national budget for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of these policies is not systematically adjusted to the current needs of 
</p>
<p>the population in the regions. Several informants expressed regret that the regional 
</p>
<p>authorities who are responsible for drawing up budgets, including the budgets for 
</p>
<p>health and education, do not treat women&#8217;s needs as a priority. 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group notes with satisfaction the establishment of Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Emergency Centres which, by offering legal, psychological and social support, 
</p>
<p>provide multidisciplinary care to women victims of violence. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>nonetheless found that they do not always have the human and financial resources to 
</p>
<p>provide the necessary services. 
</p>
<p>36. Peruvian civil society also plays a crucial role in the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights. In some cases it stands in for the State or holds it to account when it 
</p>
<p>fails to meet its responsibilities.  
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group welcomes the Ministry for Women and Vulnerable Group &#8217;s 
</p>
<p>annual reports on the implementation of the Act on Equal Opportunities, which 
</p>
<p>describe progress and challenges in 11 strategic areas of gender equality.25 Since 2010,

<p>the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, within the framework of its role in monitoring the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Act on Equal Opportunities, has submitted three reports on the 
</p>
<p>budgets of regional governments and the extent to which their institutions incorporate

</p>
<p>and was able to observe during its meetings with state agencies that despite constant 
</p>
<p>use of the phrase &#8220;mainstreaming the gender perspective&#8221;, there was no indication that

<p>the concept had been genuinely understood or assimilated.

</b></p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Participation in political and public life<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>38. The State has made significant efforts in terms of the political participation of 
</p>
<p>women. Their participation has increased as a result of the acts on gender quotas, 
</p>
<p>which call for women to make up at least 30 per cent of the candidates on electoral 
</p>
<p>lists (the Congress, the Andean Parliament, the regional councils of regional 
</p>
<p>governments and the councils of provincial and district municipalities). 26 This quota 
</p>
<p>has led to some progress but has not managed to remedy a situation in which women 
</p>
<p>clearly lag behind, as it fails ensure that women are elected to the offices for which 
</p>
<p>they stand. 
</p>
<p>39. The major constraints include the fact that political parties assign women to 
</p>
<p>places in which they are unlikely to be elected, as well as the limited framework for 
</p>
<p>enforcing the Quotas Act and gender stereotypes that limit women&#8217;s access to 
</p>
<p>decision-making posts. The Working Group also received reports that female 
</p>
<p>candidates or authorities were subjected to widespread political harassment, a new 
</p>
<p>way of discouraging them from participating in politics. This serious problem hinders 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s equal participation in political life. To prevent, eradicate and penalize this 
</p>
<p>form of violence against women, the National Network of Women Local and Regional 
</p>
<p>Authorities of Peru has proposed a bill that has not yet been debated.27 
</p>
<p>40. After having risen steadily to 29.2 per cent in 2006 the proportion of persons 
</p>
<p>elected to Congress, fell to 21.5 per cent in the 2011 elections. After the 2010 
</p>
<p>elections, the proportion of women on regional government coordinating councils fell 
</p>
<p>to less than 30 per cent, no woman was president of a region and only two held 
</p>
<p>positions as regional vice-presidents; women accounted for only 28 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>regional councillors. At local government level, women accounted for only 4.6 per 
</p>
<p>cent of those elected mayor of a provincial municipality and 23.9 per cent of those 
</p>
<p>elected councillor. They accounted for only 3.7 per cent of those elected mayor of a 
</p>
<p>district municipality and 28 per cent of those elected councillor. 
</p>
<p>41. After the local elections of October 2014, women accounted for only 2.78 per 
</p>
<p>cent of those elected mayor of a district municipality, 3.11 per  cent of those elected 
</p>
<p>mayor of a provincial municipality and 16 per cent of those elected vice-president of a

<p>44. Women continue to face numerous obstacles that prevent them from fulfilling 
</p>
<p>their economic potential. Despite having increased by almost 10 per cent since 1997 
</p>
<p>(from 54.7 per cent to 64.5 per cent), the economic activity rate for women is still

<p>women (58.8 per cent) than for men (37.6 per cent).30 
</p>
<p>45. Government programmes for technical assistance and employment do not

<p>systematically take a gender-focused approach to encouraging the training and

<p>encourage women&#8217;s economic participation (adequate public childcare, for instance) 
</p>
<p>are not always available.31 The Working Group notes with satisfaction the creation of 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion&#8217;s Cradle Plus (Cu&#241;a M&#225;s) national 
</p>
<p>programme, the aim of which is to improve the care of children under 3 years of age in 
</p>
<p>areas of poverty and extreme poverty. The Working Group hopes that such 
</p>
<p>programmes will expand and become widespread.  
</p>
<p>46. Another major problem facing women is the high rate of informal employment. 
</p>
<p>In all, 78.4 per cent of Peruvian women who work do so in the informal sector. Their 
</p>
<p>income is 30 per cent of that of women in the formal sector. 32 There are specific 
</p>
<p>challenges associated with the conditions of informal employment in rural areas, 
</p>
<p>especially in traditional farming and in the modern agricultural establishments 
</p>
<p>producing for the export market (often with no contractual relationship). In the former, 
</p>
<p>women often find themselves as unpaid family workers; in this situation , they remain 
</p>
<p>invisible and their contribution to the household economy cannot be measured. The 
</p>
<p>informal labour of women leads to unstable work, without social insurance, annual 
</p>
<p>leave, maternity or breastfeeding leave, health coverage or a retirement pensi on. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group regrets to note that only 25.3 per cent of women who work (as 
</p>
<p>opposed to 38.9 per cent of men) are enrolled in a pension plan - that is, a social

<p>protection system that includes the right to benefits for families and children, 
</p>
<p>maternity, sickness or disability payments and an old-age pension. 33  The Working 
</p>
<p>Group believes that the creation of more jobs for women in the formal sector is 
</p>
<p>urgently needed and welcomes recent efforts made by the Government in this regard. 34 
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group was informed that domestic workers, who make less than 
</p>
<p>the minimum wage, are excluded from the Comprehensive Health Insurance System 
</p>
<p>because they cannot enrol as formal workers, owing either to their employers&#8217; refusal 
</p>
<p>or to their inability to pay the 13 per cent of the minimum wage in order to qualify; at 
</p>
<p>the same time, however, they do not qualify as indigent. 35  The Working Group 
</p>
<p>welcomes a recently adopted plan of action to promote compliance with the labour 
</p>
<p>rights of domestic workers and the establishment of a working group to oversee and 
</p>
<p>monitor their implementation. There is still a long way to go as far as schedules, sick 
</p>
<p>leave and vacations are concerned.  
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group notes with great concern the existence of wide disparities in 
</p>
<p>the average incomes from wages or self-employment of men and women. According to 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Development Programme, Peru has the fourth largest gender pay 
</p>
<p>gap in the region.36 The pay gap between men and women is 30.3 per cent.37 It also 
</p>
<p>notes that a woman with a secondary education has approximately the earnings 
</p>
<p>potential of a man with a primary education and that a woman with a post -secondary 
</p>
<p>education has an average income that is much less than that of a man with the same 
</p>
<p>educational level. 
</p>
<p>49. In the formal labour market, despite the provision of article 26 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution on equality of opportunity without discrimination and of Act No. 27270 
</p>
<p>of 2000, which makes discrimination an offence, awareness of women&#8217;s rights to equal 
</p>
<p>employment opportunities and to equal pay for equal work or for work of equal value 
</p>
<p>is greatly lacking. During its visit, the Working Group found that victims of 
</p>
<p>discrimination do not feel able to initiate civil proceedings to assert their rights.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>2.<b> </b>Education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group congratulates Peru on the significant achievement of 
</p>
<p>attaining gender parity in primary education. However, the dropout  rates for girls at 
</p>
<p>secondary school level, while not much higher than those for boys, are still worrying. 
</p>
<p>The challenges in education have to do with its quality, the gap between urban and 
</p>
<p>rural education, especially among girls who are growing up in different linguistic 
</p>
<p>environments, and the rate of teenage pregnancy (see paragraph 66). Although Act No. 
</p>
<p>29600 requires that pregnant girls and teenage mothers should be given the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to stay in school, there are still problems of stigmatization, disc rimination 
</p>
<p>and prejudice, which, together with the burden of childcare, contribute to dropout 
</p>
<p>rates. Some 36.8 per cent of women have managed to study up to secondary school, as 
</p>
<p>opposed to 46.5 per cent of men.38 Rates of enrolment in higher education, at around 
</p>
<p>23 per cent in 2011, are still low.39 Although the prevalence of illiteracy is falling, it 
</p>
<p>still affects more women than men. According to the latest census, women accounted 
</p>
<p>for 75 per cent of the illiterate population of Peru.40

<p>51. In the highlands and the jungle, girls have to travel long distances to school and 
</p>
<p>are vulnerable to abuse and sexual violence on the way. Violence against girls in 
</p>
<p>school, including sexual violence inflicted by teachers, is a serious problem. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group was informed that the Government has taken a number of legal and 
</p>
<p>policy measures to address violence, that some teachers have been convicted and 
</p>
<p>given prison sentences and that others are being prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group believes that significant investment in education is 
</p>
<p>necessary, particularly in remote areas, to ensure that girls stay in and finish secondary 
</p>
<p>school. It also stresses the need to promote a democratic school culture that 
</p>
<p>encourages gender equality in the teaching processes (curricula, teacher training, texts 
</p>
<p>and material, comprehensive sex education) and combats any form of violence at 
</p>
<p>school (stereotypes, discrimination, harassment, and abuse). In this regard, it is 
</p>
<p>important to ensure the availability of texts and material free of discrimin atory 
</p>
<p>connotations and gender stereotypes, as well as separate toilets for each sex.

<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Participation in the family and in cultural life<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. During its visit, the Working Group noted that patriarchal patterns of behaviour, 
</p>
<p>attitudes, expectations, beliefs and practices discriminating against and denigrating 
</p>
<p>girls and women remain widespread. Women living in rural areas and women 
</p>
<p>members of ethnic minorities (indigenous, Amazonian and Afro-Peruvian peoples) are 
</p>
<p>among those worst affected by oppression and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>54. Although gender role models have changed for the better and much has been 
</p>
<p>done by the State to promote such changes, men are still expected to be the family 
</p>
<p>bread-winners while women do the housework, raise the children and look a fter any 
</p>
<p>other dependants. 
</p>
<p>55. Notwithstanding government41 efforts to promote responsibility-sharing, one of 
</p>
<p>the reasons women rarely have the time to attend training courses is because they are 
</p>
<p>expected to do most of the domestic chores. Unpaid work takes up more than half (52 
</p>
<p>per cent) of women&#8217;s time, compared to only 24 per cent for men. On average, women 
</p>
<p>spend 39 hours and 28 minutes a week performing unpaid work, while the figure for 
</p>
<p>men stands at 15 hours and 53 minutes. The Working Group believes  that existing 
</p>
<p>legislation and policies on the work-life balance must be improved. Above all, a 
</p>
<p>sustainable awareness-raising strategy must be developed to make responsibility-
</p>
<p>sharing between men and women a reality in terms of childrearing, housework and 
</p>
<p>caring for other adult dependants, enabling all to benefit from personal and 
</p>
<p>professional development. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group notes with concern the link between the inequality affecting 
</p>
<p>women within the family and their limited participation in political and economic life. 
</p>
<p>Patriarchal attitudes in Peru also perpetuate domestic violence and other forms of 
</p>
<p>violence committed outside the home (see paragraphs 76 to 80 below).  
</p>
<p>57. The media play a key role in forming attitudes towards gender. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group was informed that Peruvian television channels and advertising in general 
</p>
<p>continue to reinforce sexist gender stereotypes, which link men to intelligence, sport 
</p>
<p>and toughness while portraying women as either housewives or sexual objects keen to 
</p>
<p>attract men&#8217;s attention. 42  The Working Group notes with satisfaction the ongoing 
</p>
<p>efforts of the Advisory Council on Radio and Television to develop ways of dealing

<p>with information on the basis of respect for rights, gender equality and non -
</p>
<p>discrimination. 
</p>
<p>58. In addition to those degrading stereotypes, there are other forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination that target ethnic minority women. For example, women from Andean 
</p>
<p>communities tend to be presented as being dirty, ignorant, violent and rude. 43 Women 
</p>
<p>of African descent are invariably portrayed as being slender, young and tall and 
</p>
<p>capable only of dancing or playing sports.  
</p>
<p>59. The issue of gender equality is almost completely ignored by the written press, 
</p>
<p>radio and television, constituting only 0.5 per cent of coverage. Gender violence is 
</p>
<p>reported in a graphic manner but no attempt is made to raise the issue with the 
</p>
<p>authorities. News stories on gender issues refer, in 95.8 per cent of cases, to the 
</p>
<p>decriminalization of abortion or to same-sex civil union. The media are heavily 
</p>
<p>influenced by conservative elements of the catholic church, discouraging any positive 
</p>
<p>discussion of women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality. Although the Peruvian 
</p>
<p>Constitution stipulates that the State44 is secular in nature, the Working Group was 
</p>
<p>informed that conservative religious groups exert considerable influence over political 
</p>
<p>decision-making bodies and public opinion. Family life and women&#8217;s reproductive 
</p>
<p>health and general well-being are affected as a result.

<p><b> </b>IV.<b> </b>The right to health<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Working Group welcomes government efforts to introduce universal health 
</p>
<p>coverage through a comprehensive health insurance scheme for women living in 
</p>
<p>poverty. According to official figures, 67 per cent of the population enjoys 80 per cent 
</p>
<p>coverage. However, a number of sources reported that adequate health services are 
</p>
<p>available only on a limited basis; consequently, public health service coverage does 
</p>
<p>not guarantee access to appropriate diagnosis, treatment or medicines. Many women 
</p>
<p>are unable to use health services for financial reasons, or because they live far from 
</p>
<p>the nearest health centre. Although very low, medical fees affect women living in 
</p>
<p>poverty in particular, limiting their access to care.

<p>61. The maternal mortality rate, a particularly telling indicator of the situation of 
</p>
<p>women, of their access to health services and the extent to which the health -care 
</p>
<p>system caters for their needs, remains extremely high. Notwithstanding the State &#8217;s 
</p>
<p>efforts, Peru still has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the region, a 
</p>
<p>situation which affects the country&#8217;s mountain and jungle regions and pregnant 
</p>
<p>indigenous women in particular. The State has developed a national strategic plan for 
</p>
<p>reducing maternal and perinatal mortality (2009-2015), together with a range of 
</p>
<p>measures to provide early care for pregnant women that reduced the maternal 
</p>
<p>mortality rate by 36 per cent between 2000 and 2010 (from 160 maternal deaths to 93 
</p>
<p>maternal deaths per 100,000 live births).

<p>62. The Working Group is deeply concerned by the flagrant violations of Peruvian 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive rights. The experts were informed that exceptions to 
</p>
<p>the criminalization of abortion45 are limited to therapeutic abortions performed to save 
</p>
<p>the life and protect the health of pregnant women. The Working Group finds it 
</p>
<p>regrettable that no exception is made to the criminalization of abortion when there is a 
</p>
<p>risk to the mental health of the woman, or in cases of rape, incest, severe fo etal 
</p>
<p>abnormalities or non-viable foetuses. It regrets that the bill on the decriminalization of 
</p>
<p>abortion in cases of pregnancy resulting from rape was shelved by the Justice and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee of the Congress of the Republic in May 2015. In its 
</p>
<p>concluding observations, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women reiterated its concerns that abortion in cases of pregnancy resulting from 
</p>
<p>rape46 or incest is criminalized and that the restrictive interpretation of therape utic 
</p>
<p>abortion may lead women to seek unsafe and illegal abortions. According to 
</p>
<p>information provided by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, a total of 717 offences of 
</p>
<p>abortion were recorded between 2010 and 2013.  
</p>
<p>63. Unwanted pregnancies may lead women to seek an abortion, an operation carried 
</p>
<p>out in unhealthy and dangerous conditions in the case of poor women. It is estimated 
</p>
<p>that each year around 370,000 clandestine abortions are performed in Peru and that a 
</p>
<p>large number of registered cases of maternal death, particularly those linked to 
</p>
<p>infections or haemorrhages, are caused by complications brought on by an abortion.  
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group welcomes the adoption of the national technical manual on 
</p>
<p>the harmonization of comprehensive care procedures for women undergoing a 
</p>
<p>voluntary therapeutic termination of pregnancy up to the twenty -second week of 
</p>
<p>gestation. Given the lack of any relevant rules or protocols, many physicians 
</p>
<p>previously refused to carry out abortions and a large number of women opted for 
</p>
<p>clandestine procedures. In the absence of regulations ensuring access to legal abortion 
</p>
<p>services, women were forced to continue pregnancies that placed them at risk, as in 
</p>
<p>the case of the adolescent K.L., whose case against the Peruvian State gave rise to a 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee decision in 2005.47 
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group is particularly concerned at the discrimination experienced 
</p>
<p>by women living in poverty in respect of their reproductive rights. The Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Court banned the distribution of free emergency contraception in 2009, even in cases 
</p>
<p>of rape, despite the fact that private pharmacies are authorized to sell emergency 
</p>
<p>contraception to those who can afford it. Moreover, according to information received, 
</p>
<p>the public health system does not have sufficient stocks of contraceptives. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group was informed that women with enough money could access abortion 
</p>
<p>services in private clinics in Peru or by simply travelling abroad, underlining the fact 
</p>
<p>that women living in poverty suffer from higher levels of discrimination.

<p> Adolescent pregnancy </p>
<p>66. Adolescent pregnancy is a persistent problem in Peru. The rate remains 
</p>
<p>alarmingly high, despite preventive efforts. In all, 15 per cent of Peruvian girls and 
</p>
<p>women aged between 15 and 20 years are or have been pregnant. The rate is 
</p>
<p>particularly high in the regions of Loreto (30 per cent), Ucayali (28 per cent), San 
</p>
<p>Martin (28 per cent), Madre de Dios (27 per cent) and Amazonas (26 per cent).48 
</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, adolescent pregnancy entails a high level 
</p>
<p>of risk and an increased probability of complications or death. Minors are unable to 
</p>
<p>obtain methods of contraception through the public health system unless accompanied 
</p>
<p>by a guardian, a measure which dissuades adolescents from requesting it. 49  A 
</p>
<p>multisectoral adolescent pregnancy prevention plan for 2013-2021 was adopted in 
</p>
<p>2013. As a part of the plan, a number of ministries 50  and regional and local 
</p>
<p>governments were assigned responsibilities for reducing the adolescent pregnancy 
</p>
<p>rate. 
</p>
<p>67. Adolescent pregnancy leads to school dropout among young expectant mothers. 
</p>
<p>Nine out of ten adolescent mothers do not attend school. The legislation that exists to 
</p>
<p>protect and promote the right of girls to remain in or return to school has not been 
</p>
<p>sufficiently disseminated or implemented. 51  Unlike its predecessor, the new 
</p>
<p>curriculum includes comprehensive sex education as a part of basic personal skills 
</p>
<p>development. However, the subject has reportedly not yet been introduced across the 
</p>

<p>68. Peru has a wealth of cultural diversity but has not always valued it as an asset. 
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the State&#8217;s efforts to improve the situation of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, as a result of discrimination and oppression, they rarely exercise 
</p>
<p>their rights or take part in decision-making processes.52 During its visit, the Working

<p>Group met with various indigenous women&#8217;s groups, who drew attention to the 
</p>
<p>increase in precariousness and human rights violations affecting indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>For example, as regards access to education, the school dropout rate among 
</p>
<p>indigenous girls aged between 12 and 16 years is 89.1 per cent. In 2011, the maternal 
</p>
<p>mortality rate of 160.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in the jungle region of

<p>deaths per 100,000 live births).  
</p>
<p>69. Notwithstanding their beneficial effect on the Peruvian economy and despite the 
</p>
<p>regulatory efforts of the Ministry of Energy and Mining, the extractive industries have 
</p>
<p>had a devastating social and environmental impact on indigenous and campesino 
</p>
<p>communities, which has been exacerbated by illegal informal mining operations. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group notes with concern that highly misogynistic attitudes are widespread.

</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>A number of indigenous women&#8217;s groups informed the Working Group that the impact 
</p>
<p>of the extractive industries was akin to a form of violence against both themselves and 
</p>
<p>their cultural heritage. They are deprived of their lands, drinking water and means of 
</p>
<p>subsistence and agricultural production. Compensation payments for communal land 
</p>
<p>are mainly paid to men heads of households. Jobs created by the extractive industries 
</p>
<p>are usually reserved for men, 54  although there is significant demand for related 
</p>
<p>services,55 usually provided by women. However, the large number of men and the 
</p>
<p>absence of public security agencies have created problems such as a demand for 
</p>
<p>prostitutes (including girls), trafficking in persons, a high rate of alcohol consumption 
</p>
<p>and an increase in violence against women. Little has been done by the authorities to 
</p>
<p>tackle these issues, which harmfully affect the health and security of local 
</p>
<p>communities. 
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group was also informed that women forced from their lands have 
</p>
<p>no option but to move to the cities, and that the authorities do nothing to provide them 
</p>
<p>with the skills they require to support themselves and their children in an alien 
</p>
<p>environment in which they face extreme poverty, severe discrimination and both 
</p>
<p>sexual and labour exploitation.  
</p>
<p>71. Under the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989, (No. 169) of the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization (ILO), Peru has a duty to consult with indigenous 
</p>
<p>and tribal peoples, without discriminating on the basis of gender, before authorizing 
</p>
<p>any programmes for the exploitation of natural resources pertaining to their lands . The 
</p>
<p>Working Group was informed that during previous consultations on the granting of 
</p>
<p>concessions to actors in the extractive industries, no measures were taken to involve 
</p>
<p>women in the process and a request for a quota of women participants was turned 
</p>
<p>down. According to a number of sources, indigenous women are generally excluded 
</p>
<p>from joint consultations, including those focusing on issues that affect only them.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Women of African descent<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Working Group notes with concern the paucity of studies on the Afro -
</p>
<p>Peruvian population and the consequent lack of specific information on the group &#8217;s 
</p>
<p>living conditions and access to public services. However, a number of sources 
</p>
<p>described the discrimination, complete lack of visibility and stagnation affecting those 
</p>
<p>communities. According to the United Nations Development Programme, although the 
</p>
<p>illiteracy rate in Peru has fallen, 8.6 per cent56 of illiterate persons in the country are 
</p>
<p>Afro-Peruvian (in statistical terms, this figure is similar to that for indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples). The illiteracy rate for Afro-Peruvian women is 6.7 per cent higher than that 
</p>
<p>for Afro-Peruvian men, proof of the inequalities they face in terms of education.  
</p>
<p>73. A report published by the Office of the Ombudsman criticized the way in which 
</p>
<p>health-care staff interact with women of African descent. According to a number of 
</p>
<p>testimonies, women of African descent experience verbal abuse and insults. In all, 
</p>
<p>54.5 per cent of Afro-Peruvians report that they have experienced discrimination and 
</p>
<p>verbal abuse in public, with Afro-Peruvian women being the group most affected.57

<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Rural women<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Working Group notes with concern the extreme vulnerability of women in 
</p>
<p>rural areas and in particular their limited access to ownership of land. Women own 
</p>
<p>only 21 per cent of the agricultural land in Peru. Furthermore, 27.3 per cent of women 
</p>
<p>farmers are illiterate, a figure three times higher than that for men farmers (8.7 per 
</p>
<p>cent).58 One of the main reasons why women cannot obtain loans is their lack of title 
</p>
<p>deeds and they still do not enjoy the same level of access to technical assistance as 
</p>
<p>men; in 2012, 11.5 per cent of men, but only 7 per cent of women, received technical 
</p>
<p>assistance. 
</p>
<p>75. While the net secondary school attendance rate for both sexes is 85.7 per cent in 
</p>
<p>urban areas (86.6 per cent for girls and 84.7 per cent for boys), in rural areas the figure 
</p>
<p>is 71.4 per cent for girls and 71.1 per cent for boys; 59 this shows the huge disparities 
</p>
<p>between women in different geographical areas. The secondary school completion rate 
</p>
<p>for girls aged between 17 and 18 years is 77 per cent in urban areas and only 43 per 
</p>
<p>cent in rural areas.60 Women working in rural areas are the most vulnerable; only 4.7 
</p>
<p>per cent have pensions while the corresponding figure for women working in urban 
</p>
<p>areas is 32.1 per cent. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>D.<b> </b>Women victims of violence<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>76. It is unanimously agreed that violence against women is a serious and 
</p>
<p>widespread issue, requiring urgent action at all levels. The Working Group was 
</p>
<p>informed that women and girls are subjected to violence in all spheres of life - at 
</p>
<p>home, at school, in the workplace and in public spaces. According to the 2013 
</p>
<p>Demographic and Family Health Survey, at the national level, 71.5 per cent of women 
</p>
<p>currently or formerly involved in an intimate relationship have been victims of some 
</p>
<p>form of partner violence, be it sexual (8.4 per cent), physical (35.7 per cent) or 
</p>
<p>psychological (67.5 per cent). Although the overall level of violence registered has 
</p>
<p>fallen by 5.4 per cent compared to 2009 (76.9 per cent), the fact that Peru is one of the 
</p>
<p>countries in the region most affected by gender-based violence gives cause for 
</p>
<p>concern. According to information provided by the Economic Commission for Latin 
</p>
<p>America and the Caribbean, in 2013 alone, 83 women were murdered by their partners 
</p>
<p>or former partners in Peru and the country has the second-highest rate of such offences 
</p>
<p>in Latin America. According to the Ministry for Women and Vulnerable Groups , only 
</p>
<p>4 out of 10 cases are actually reported. Consequently, Peru has one of the highest rates 
</p>
<p>of violence against women in the region. 
</p>
<p>77. The Government&#8217;s approach to the various forms of violence against women has 
</p>
<p>been fragmented, consisting of a series of stand-alone legal measures and 
</p>
<p>programmes. Furthermore, Peru has not yet brought its Criminal Code into line with 
</p>
<p>the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, under which a wide range of 
</p>
<p>offences of sexual violence are categorized as crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p>78. The Public Prosecution Service has adopted a gender-based approach to sexual 
</p>
<p>offences. However, the approach has not been effectively applied to the gathering of 
</p>
<p>evidence, including forensic evidence, and the arrest, trial and punishment of alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrators by all the actors involved in the criminal justice process, including the 
</p>
<p>police and the judiciary.

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>79. Although progress has been made at the official level and there is political 
</p>
<p>support for action to tackle violence against women, this is not matched by a 
</p>
<p>corresponding level of budgetary funding or by a policy shift ensuring prevention, 
</p>
<p>quality care and access to justice. Many interviewees pointed to the continued 
</p>
<p>existence of widespread traditional patriarchal attitudes and values (machismo ), which 
</p>
<p>perpetuate a culture of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>80. The Working Group also notes with concern allegations of violations of the 
</p>
<p>rights of lesbians, who are subjected to discrimination, high levels of violence, 
</p>
<p>harassment, stigmatization and exclusion. During its visit, the Working Group noted 
</p>
<p>that this group is completely ignored and was barely referred to. The State has not yet 
</p>
<p>developed an appropriate approach to the situation of vulnerability affecting lesbians, 
</p>
<p>and bisexual and transgender women.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>VI.<b> </b>Good practices<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Working Group welcomes the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Groups&#8217; 
</p>
<p>initiative to encourage private companies to prevent violence through the award of the 
</p>
<p>Safe, gender-based violence and discrimination-free company label, designed to 
</p>
<p>strengthen actions to prevent violence against women. The label is awarded in 
</p>
<p>recognition of good practices in the private sector in the fields of gender equality and 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence prevention. The scheme shows recognition for the fact that 
</p>
<p>violence has an impact on women&#8217;s overall well-being, performance at work and 
</p>
<p>productivity. In 2013, the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Groups awarded the 
</p>
<p>label for the first time to 7 companies, along with 16 distinctions. In addition, more 
</p>
<p>evidence of the costs incurred by companies as a result of violence against women has 
</p>
<p>been produced. 
</p>
<p>82. The Working Group also draws attention to the integration of women into 
</p>
<p>community organizations, such as the Qali Warma National School Meals Programme. 
</p>
<p>Capacity-building work has been carried out with women working for communal 
</p>
<p>kitchens, such as the Federation of Women Working for Independent Community 
</p>
<p>Kitchens and Related Bodies in Metropolitan Lima. These women work with 
</p>
<p>populations in situations of extreme poverty and promote women&#8217;s human rights.

</p>
<p><b> </b>VII.<b> </b>Conclusions and recommendations<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Conclusions<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>83. In recent years, Peru has made considerable efforts and progress in terms of 
</p>
<p>gender equality and the empowerment of women in areas such as the 
</p>
<p>strengthening of the legal and institutional framework. However, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group has identified a gap between the rhetoric and the reality. Although, in law, 
</p>
<p>women have the right to equal treatment in public, political and economic life, 
</p>
<p>there are no effective mechanisms in place to enable them to file complaints of 
</p>
<p>discrimination. 
</p>
<p>84. Women in Peru have been oppressed and silenced by the prevailing culture 
</p>
<p>of religious conservatism and machismo, which undermines their well<b>-</b>being and 
</p>
<p>especially the full realization of their sexual and reproductive rights. Violence 
</p>
<p>against women is a scourge that persists thanks to a high level of impunity and 
</p>
<p>social acceptance. Furthermore, the huge gender gap affects in particular women 
</p>
<p>and girls living in poverty, indigenous women living in rural areas in the 
</p>
<p>highlands and in the Amazon region, women of African descent and women with </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-10576 <b>20/22 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>disabilities. Racism and stereotypes deeply rooted in Peruvian society and 
</p>
<p>disseminated through the media, targeting indigenous, campesino and Afro <b>-
</b></p>
<p>Peruvian communities in particular, are also major obstacles to the achievement 
</p>
<p>of equality.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Recommendations<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>85. In a spirit of cooperation and collaboration, the Working Group makes the 
</p>
<p>following recommendations to the Government of Peru with a view to 
</p>
<p>strengthening measures designed to guarantee gender equality, and the protection 
</p>
<p>and promotion of women&#8217;s human rights.  
</p>
<p>86. With regard to legislation, the Working Group recommends that the 
</p>
<p>Government should:<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> </b>Approve a comprehensive law on violence against women, including 
</p>
<p>interculturally appropriate prevention, protection and rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, and increased budgetary funding to tackle this scourge; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> </b>Decriminalize abortion in cases of rape, incest or risk to the mental 
</p>
<p>health of the mother and in cases of non<b>-</b>viable foetuses. Exceptions should also 
</p>
<p>be made for pregnant girls under the age of 16 years, given the high risk to their 
</p>
<p>health;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> </b>Ensure distribution of free emergency contraception and free and 
</p>
<p>systematic access to contraceptives;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> </b>Include sexual orientation and gender identity as legally protected 
</p>
<p>categories;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(e)<b> </b>Adopt bills to increase the scant participation of women in public life, 
</p>
<p>including the bill amending quota requirements through the rotation of 
</p>
<p>candidates on electoral lists on the basis of gender and the bill on the prevention 
</p>
<p>and penalization of political harassment. Reconsider new bills on quotas for the 
</p>
<p>membership of the Constitutional Court and the appointment of judges and 
</p>
<p>magistrates;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(f)<b> </b>Adopt a comprehensive legal framework covering labour issues, 
</p>
<p>including urgent measures to guarantee decent work for all women workers, 
</p>
<p>enacting a law on equal employment opportunities accompanied by effective 
</p>
<p>implementation mechanisms;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(g)<b> </b>Ratify the ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189) and 
</p>
<p>adopt legislative reforms to protect domestic workers. Immediately implement 
</p>
<p>the minimum wage and guarantee health insurance for all domestic workers; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(h)<b> </b>Ensure that laws and policies formulated at the national level that 
</p>
<p>affect women and girls are systematically tailored to the actual needs of all 
</p>
<p>groups of women, in particular those living in rural areas.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>87. As to the institutional framework, the Working Group recommends that the 
</p>
<p>Government should:<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> </b>Ensure appropriate budgetary funding and greater intersectoral 
</p>
<p>coordination and joint monitoring, involving all the relevant ministries and 
</p>
<p>bodies, in order effectively to implement laws and policies on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of women&#8217;s rights and gender equality;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> </b>Ensure that women&#8217;s emergency centres have the human and financial 
</p>
<p>resources required to provide the necessary services; <b> </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>21/22 </b>GE.15-10576 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> </b>Ensure that abortion services are made available and provide women 
</p>
<p>with access to quality post<b>-</b>abortion care, in particular in cases involving 
</p>
<p>complications arising from unsafe abortions; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> </b>Implement all the measures requested as a part of the decisions of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee in the cases L.C. v. Peru and K.L. v. Peru.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>88. As to access to justice, the Working Group recommends that the 
</p>
<p>Government should:<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> </b>Ensure access to the formal justice system for all women on a non<b>-
</b></p>
<p>discriminatory basis, by removing financial and linguistic barriers and providing 
</p>
<p>appropriate and sustained funding for the training of members of the judiciary 
</p>
<p>and ensuring that they are more gender<b>-</b>sensitive;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> </b>Establish a centralized statistics system that makes it possible to build 
</p>
<p>up an accurate picture of women&#8217;s access to justice, in particular relating to the 
</p>
<p>number of reported cases that are judged and the proportion that are 
</p>
<p>discontinued;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> </b>Increase the number of women in the police force and at the highest 
</p>
<p>levels of the judicial system;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> </b>Ensure the prosecution of and reparation for acts of sexual violence &#8212; 
</p>
<p>in particular those committed during the internal conflict &#8212; revise and improve 
</p>
<p>the system for the award of reparations, including collective reparations, and 
</p>
<p>implement measures requested by the victims themselves, such as health, 
</p>
<p>symbolic, collective and educational reparations. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>89. As to policies, the Working Group recommends that the Government 
</p>
<p>should:<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> </b>As a matter of urgency, create jobs for women in the formal sector; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> </b>Ensure that policy initiatives result in lasting improvements; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> </b>Develop essential services to encourage women&#8217;s economic 
</p>
<p>participation (such as adequate public childcare), taking into account women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>specific needs in terms of schedules, distances to be travelled and languages used 
</p>
<p>to deliver training;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> </b>Extend the coverage of the social welfare system to include the right to 
</p>
<p>family and child benefits, maternity, sickness and disability payments and an old <b>-

<p>age pension;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(e)<b> </b>Ensure access to health<b>-</b>care services, including preventive services for 
</p>
<p>all women, and in particular for women in precarious social and economic 
</p>
<p>situations;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(f)<b> </b>Strengthen the adolescent pregnancy prevention strategy, ensuring that 
</p>
<p>sex education is provided from primary school level onward and providing

</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(g)<b> </b>Invest heavily in education, in particular in remote areas, in order to
