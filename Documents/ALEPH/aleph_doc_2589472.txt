Interim Results 2016
Rio Tinto delivers strong cash flow generation of $3.2 billion and declares 
interim dividend of 45 US cents per share, equivalent to $0.8 billion 
 
3 August 2016 
 
Rio Tinto chief executive J-S Jacques said: “Rio Tinto has generated net cash from operating activities 
of $3.2 billion and reported underlying earnings of $1.6 billion, against a backdrop of continued volatility 
and lower commodity prices.
“We focus on delivering value to shareholders. This focus is unrelenting, with further cost reductions 
achieved in the half and EBITDA margins of 33 per cent. With our strong operating cash flows, tight 
control over capital expenditure and progress on divestments, the balance sheet remains robust. Having 
paid the 2015 final dividend of $1.9 billion in April 2016, we reduced net debt during the half to $12.9 
billion.
“Our balance sheet strength and Tier 1 assets provide a stable foundation in these uncertain and volatile 
markets, which is fundamental in a cyclical and capital-intensive industry. We will generate cash at every 
opportunity, which we will then allocate in a disciplined way to deliver returns to shareholders, while also 
investing in compelling growth.
“The board, today, has announced an interim dividend of 45 US cents per share, consistent with our 
commitment to no less than 110 US cents per share for the full year.”

Continued focus on maximising free cash flow
Revenues and earnings
–  Consolidated sales revenues of $15.5 billion in the first half, $2.5 billion lower than the same period of
last year, reflecting a $2.6 billion reduction due to the decline in commodity prices.
–  EBITDA1 margin of 33 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in 2015 and 38 per cent in 2015 first half.  
–  Underlying earnings of $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion lower than 2015 first half, with cash cost improvements,
lower energy costs and positive currency and other movements (totalling $0.5 billion) partly offsetting 
the $1.9 billion (post-tax) impact of lower prices.
–  Underlying earnings per share of 87.0 US cents compared with 159.1 US cents in 2015 first half.
–  Net earnings of $1.7 billion reflecting net gains on disposals of businesses of $0.2 billion, non-cash 
exchange rate and derivative gains of $0.6 billion, an onerous contract provision of $0.5 billion and 
restructuring costs of $0.1 billion.
Production
–  Delivered strong operational performances in iron ore, bauxite and aluminium, with all key
commodities on track to meet full year guidance.
Cash flow and balance sheet
–  Generated net cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion, as taxes paid and further cash cost
improvements partly offset the impact of lower prices and higher interest.
–  Achieved $0.6 billion of sustainable operating cash cost improvements2 (including exploration and
evaluation savings) in 2016 first half. On track to meet full year target.
–  Capital expenditure of $1.3 billion, of which $0.7 billion was sustaining capex. 
–  Generated free cash flow3 of $2.0 billion. 
–  Completed $0.6 billion of divestments, with a further $0.2 billion announced and expected to complete
in the second half of 2016.
–  Maintained a strong balance sheet with net debt of $12.9 billion and gearing of 23 per cent, in the
lower half of the targeted range.
Growth projects
–  Silvergrass iron ore development costs of $338 million approved by the board, to maintain the Pilbara
blend and lower unit costs.
–  Development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground copper mine in Mongolia for $5.3 billion announced on  
6 May 2016: first tonnes expected in 2020, with average production of 560 thousand tonnes between 
2025 and 2030.4
–  Amrun bauxite project in Queensland remains on track: it is expected to increase exports by around 10
Mt/a5, with first production in the first half of 2019.
Capital returns
–  Paid 2015 final dividend of $1.9 billion in 2016 first half.
–  Declared 2016 interim dividend of 45 US cents per share, equivalent to $809 million, to be paid in
September 2016.
1 EBITDA margin is defined as Group underlying EBITDA divided by Product Group total revenues as per the Financial Information 
by Business Unit on page 10 where it is reconciled to profit on ordinary activities before finance items and taxation. This financial 
metric is used by management internally to assess performance, and therefore is considered relevant to users of the accounts.  
2 Operating cash cost improvements represent the difference between the current and prior year full cash cost of sales per unit 
based on the prior year volume sold. 
3 Free cash flow is defined as Net cash generated from operating activities less Cash used in investing activities, excluding 
proceeds from divestments. 
4 This production target was disclosed in a release to the market on 6 May 2016. All material assumptions underpinning that target 
continue to apply and have not materially changed. 
5 This production target was disclosed in a release to the market on 27 November 2015. All material assumptions underpinning that 
target continue to apply and have not materially changed.

Guidance
–  As announced in February 2016, for 2016 only, the intention of the board is that the total full year
dividend will be not less than 110 US cents per share, equivalent to $2 billion.
–  Operating cash cost improvements (including exploration and evaluation savings) of $2 billion (pre-tax)
expected over 2016 and 2017, in line with previous guidance.
–  Capital expenditure expected to be around $4.0 billion in 2016, around $5.0 billion in 2017 and around
$5.5 billion in 2018. Each year includes around $2.0 billion of sustaining capex.
–  Continuing to target 20 to 30 per cent gearing ratio through the cycle.
–  Underlying effective tax rate of approximately 27 to 30 per cent expected in 2016.
–  Production guidance is unchanged from the Second Quarter Operations Review, except for mined 
copper which is now expected to be between 545 and 595 thousand tonnes in 2016, following the 
revision to Freeport’s guidance for Grasberg.

Economy and commodities
Global economy 
In the first half of 2016, the global economy was more resilient than markets had anticipated. The broadly 
negative sentiment about China, which caused financial markets to move into lower risk sectors at the 
start of the year, turned quickly back to a higher tolerance for risk after Chinese New Year. It became 
increasingly apparent that less restrictive macro-economic policies introduced by the Chinese 
government in the second half of 2015, and a strong credit boost at the start of 2016, had been 
successful in reviving a moribund property sector. This enabled China’s economic slowdown to stabilise, 
with GDP growth remaining above six and a half per cent.
The pick-up in China’s construction activity benefited commodity demand and pulled commodity prices up 
from multi-year cyclical lows, but the recovery has not been broad-based. The property market revival has 
itself been unbalanced, with sales rising most strongly in the large tier 1 and 2 cities while inventories in 
lower tier 3 and 4 cities remain at elevated levels. Growth in the industrial and manufacturing sectors 
continued to face some headwinds, resulting in a further slowdown in corporate investment. The 
performance in these sectors was hindered by weak exports, which were constrained by slow global trade 
growth. This reflects a global macro-economic environment that is still fragile.
Global growth forecasts for 2016 have been downgraded to around three per cent, matching the pace of 
the past few years. The US carried some weak momentum into the start of the year with the 
manufacturing sector under pressure from a stronger dollar. Despite improvements in investment and the 
labour market, the Federal Reserve delayed a rise in its policy rates, which had been widely expected by 
financial markets. Europe continued to build on its solid performance in 2015, but the UK’s Brexit vote in 
June risks further undermining confidence across the Eurozone, with the resilience of some European 
banks once again being questioned. 
 
Commodities 
With the China upturn affecting construction materials disproportionally, iron ore led the commodity price 
rebound in the first half of 2016. Having dipped below $40 per dry metric tonne (CFR) throughout 
January, the iron ore price briefly reached above $60 in early April and averaged close to $50 over the 
first six months of the year. Over that period China imported close to 520 million tonnes of iron ore, an 
increase of about nine per cent compared with the first half of 2015, with Chinese crude steel production 
reaching annualised run-rates above 850 million tonnes during the second quarter of 2016. These high 
production rates were partly accommodated by continued strong Chinese steel exports. Despite the more 
favourable demand context and delays to some project ramp-up schedules, more new tonnes are 
expected to come onto the market over the near to medium-term.
Metallurgical coal prices benefited from the same steel dynamics as iron ore, with prices recovering from 
lows of near $70 per tonne in February to again touch $100 per tonne during the second quarter of 2016. 
The rebound in base metals prices has been more muted. Inventories and excess capacity kept pressure 
on aluminium, with LME prices trading within a narrow band between $1,500 per tonne and $1,650 per 
tonne. Copper prices held above $2 per pound throughout the first half and, unlike most other 
commodities, have remained well above the third quartile of the industry cost curve.
The bauxite, thermal coal and titanium dioxide markets were more strongly influenced by supply-side 
developments. The temporary bauxite export ban in Malaysia was extended twice and is currently due to 
run until late into the third quarter of 2016. Stronger supplies of Guinean and Australian bauxites into 
China closed the supply gap. Thermal coal prices were mostly stable, at just over $50 per tonne during 
most of the first half of 2016 but a combination of supply disruptions and Chinese production cutbacks 
started to push prices back above $55 per tonne by the end of June. Titanium dioxide feedstock prices 
have stabilised over the past six months, while pigment prices have started to rise again. There are 
increasing signs indicating that excess feedstocks inventories are falling across the value chain.
As with commodities, currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars started the year under 
significant downward pressure. However, the rebound in commodity prices, combined with shifting 
expectations over the US Federal Reserve policy rate rises led to renewed appreciation of these 
currencies. The Australian dollar recovered from a low of 68 US cents in January 2016 to 75 cents.

Conclusions 
The credit-fuelled bounce in Chinese construction activity has had a positive impact on commodity 
markets in the first half of 2016, but its impact has been uneven, benefiting most steel raw materials. This 
has pulled prices up from the multi-year lows seen at the start of the year, as markets continue to 
rebalance. Growth in China has stabilised, but it is on a long transition path of slower and less 
commodity-intensive growth. Meanwhile the global economy seems stuck in a subdued low-productivity 
growth pattern which would indicate that continued caution is required for the second half of 2016.

2016 first half 
 
Prices 
The effect of price movements on all major commodities in 2016 first half was to decrease underlying 
earnings by $1,899 million compared with 2015 first half. A table of prices and exchange rates is included 
on page 60.
1,563
1,713
The Platts price for 62 per cent iron Pilbara fines was 14 per cent lower on average compared with 2015 
first half while hard coking coal benchmark prices were 26 per cent lower and thermal coal spot prices 
averaged 19 per cent lower. Average copper and LME aluminium prices were down 21 and 13 per cent 
respectively, while gold prices averaged one per cent higher. 
 
Exchange rates 
Compared with 2015 first half, the US dollar, on average, strengthened by seven per cent against the 
Canadian dollar, by six per cent against the Australian dollar and by 29 per cent against the South African 
rand. The effect of all currency movements was to increase underlying earnings relative to 2015 first half 
by $241 million. 
 
Volumes  
Movements in sales volumes lowered earnings by $24 million compared with 2015 first half. Volumes 
were higher in iron ore, following the increase in capacity at the Pilbara ports and mines, and in bauxite, 
from increased production at all four mines. These gains were outweighed by volume declines in refined 
copper at Kennecott, as a result of the drawdown in inventory in 2015 first half, and lower gold production 
at both Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi.  
 
Energy 
Lower input energy prices during the period improved underlying earnings by $61 million compared with 
2015 first half mainly related to oil, where the price fell approximately 31 per cent half-on-half to average 
$40 per barrel during 2016 first half.

Cash costs, exploration and evaluation 
Rio Tinto made further progress on its cost reduction programme and has now achieved  
$6.8 billion pre-tax ($4.7 billion post-tax) in total operating cash cost improvements and reductions in 
exploration and evaluation expenditure compared with the 2012 base.
In 2016 first half, the Group realised $0.6 billion pre-tax ($0.4 billion post tax) in operating cash cost 
savings and reductions in exploration and evaluation expenditure. This was in addition to the $6.2 billion  
pre-tax ($4.3 billion post-tax) achieved in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
The Group continued to refine its exploration and evaluation expenditure, building on the savings 
achieved in prior years whilst progressing the highest priority projects. In 2016 first half, approximately 38 
per cent of this expenditure was incurred on Energy & Minerals, 28 per cent by central exploration, 25 per 
cent by Copper & Diamonds and the balance on Aluminium and Iron Ore.  
 
Tax / non-cash / interest / other 
The 2016 first half effective corporate income tax rate on underlying earnings, excluding equity accounted 
units, was 25 per cent compared with 28 per cent in 2015 first half. The Group expects an underlying 
effective tax rate of approximately 27 to 30 per cent in 2016.
The Group interest charge (net of tax) of $328 million increased by $182 million compared with 2015 first 
half, following completion of some major capital projects in 2015 first half and early redemption costs from 
a bond buy-back in 2016 first half. Interest is capitalised during the construction period. In 2016 first half, 
$22 million of interest was capitalised, compared with $122 million in 2015 first half. The Group 
successfully completed two bond buy-back programmes in 2016 first half, reducing gross debt by $4.5 
billion (nominal value). The early redemption costs are reflected in the interest charge and decreased first 
half earnings by $125 million. 
 
Items excluded from underlying earnings 
Non-cash exchange and derivative gains in 2016 first half of $558 million (post-tax) arose primarily on US 
dollar debt in non-US dollar functional currency Group companies, intragroup balances, and on the 
revaluation of certain derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting. These exchange gains in 
2016 first half were in contrast to net exchange losses in 2015 first half of $1,306 million, giving rise to a 
positive period-on-period movement of $1,864 million. The exchange gains are largely offset by currency 
translation losses recognised in equity and the quantum of US dollar debt, which will be repaid from US 
dollar sales receipts and US dollar divestment proceeds, is therefore largely unaffected.
A review of the infrastructure capacity requirements in Queensland, Australia, has confirmed that it is no 
longer likely that Rio Tinto will utilise the Abbot Point Coal Terminal and associated rail capacity 
contracted under take-or-pay arrangements. Accordingly, an onerous contract provision has been 
recognised based on the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a post-tax real 
rate of two per cent, resulting in a post-tax onerous contract charge of $496 million.
In 2016 first half, the Group incurred $88 million (post-tax) of restructuring costs associated with its costs 
reduction programme.
In 2015 first half, the Group recognised impairment charges of $421 million, primarily relating to the write-
down of its shareholding in Energy Resources of Australia (ERA). This followed Rio Tinto’s 
announcement that it supported ERA’s decision not to progress any further study or development of 
Ranger 3 Deeps, due to the project’s economic challenges.
In 2015 first half, the Group recorded a post-tax charge of $242 million for the remediation of legacy 
properties, including the Holden mine in Washington State, and incurred $135 million (post-tax) of 
restructuring costs associated with its costs reduction programme.   
 
Cash flow 
Net cash generated from operating activities of $3.2 billion was 27 per cent lower than 2015 first half, 
mainly reflecting the impact of lower prices, partially offset by cash cost improvements, stable current 
working capital and lower tax payments in line with lower underlying profits.
Page 7 of 62
The Group continued to focus its efforts on working capital in 2016 first half to reduce inventories and 
receivables, which were partly offset by a reduction in payables, mostly from actions taken to reduce 
capital and operating expenditures during the year.
Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets declined by $1.2 billion or 47 per cent 
to $1.3 billion in 2016 first half, following the completion of some major capital projects in 2015 first half, 
including the expansion of the Pilbara iron ore infrastructure and the expansion of the Kitimat aluminium 
smelter. Major capital projects in 2016 first half included the commencement of earth moving works at the 
Amrun bauxite project in Queensland and the power systems upgrade in the Pilbara.
Dividends paid in 2016 first half of $1.9 billion reflected the final 2015 dividend paid in April 2016.
In 2016 first half, net proceeds from the disposal of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates of  
$0.6 billion related primarily to amounts received following the disposal of the Group’s 40 per cent interest 
in the Bengalla coal Joint Venture which completed on 1 March 2016.  
 
Balance sheet 
Net debt (see page 44) decreased from $13.8 billion at 31 December 2015 to $12.9 billion at 30 June 
2016. Net debt to total capital (gearing ratio) was 23 per cent at 30 June 2016 (31 December 2015: 24 
per cent) and interest cover was five times, down from seven times coverage in full year 2015.
Adjusted total borrowings at 30 June 2016 were $21.2 billion (refer to page 44). At 30 June 2016, 
approximately two thirds of Rio Tinto’s total borrowings were at floating interest rates, the weighted 
average cost of total borrowings was approximately 4.1 per cent and the weighted average maturity was 
around ten years. The maximum amount, within non-current borrowings, maturing in any one calendar 
year was $2.6 billion, which matures in 2022.
In 2016 first half, the Group repaid $6.3 billion of borrowings and drew down $4.4 billion of funds, mainly 
from the Oyu Tolgoi project financing. Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2016 were $8.3 billion  
(31 December 2015: $9.4 billion).
Profit for the period 
Net earnings and underlying earnings, which are the focus of the commentary in this report, refer to 
amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. The net profit attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto in 
2016 first half totalled $1,713 million (2015 first half: $806 million). The Group recorded a profit in 2016 
first half of $1,741 million (2015 first half: $799 million) of which a profit of $28 million (2015 first half: loss 
of $7 million) was attributable to non-controlling interests.

Dividends 
In February 2016, the board announced a new dividend policy. At the end of each financial period, the 
board will determine an appropriate total level of ordinary dividend per share, taking into account the 
results for the financial year, the outlook for our major commodities, the board’s view of the long-term 
growth prospects of the business and the Company’s objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
The board expects total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40 to 60 per 
cent of underlying earnings in aggregate through the cycle.
The board is committed to maintaining an appropriate balance between cash returns to shareholders and 
investment in the business, with the intention of maximising shareholder value.
Acknowledging the cyclical nature of the industry, in periods of strong earnings and cash generation, it is 
the board’s intention to supplement the ordinary dividends with additional returns to shareholders.
For 2016 only, in transition to the new policy, the intention of the board is that the total full year dividend 
will be not less than 110 US cents per share, equivalent to $2 billion. The 2016 interim dividend has been 
determined at 45 US cents per share, equivalent to $809 million, in line with the intention that the balance 
between the interim and final dividend be weighted to the final.
Dividends are determined in US dollars. Rio Tinto plc dividends are declared and paid in pounds sterling 
and Rio Tinto Limited dividends are declared and paid in Australian dollars, converted at exchange rates 
applicable on 2 August 2016 (the latest practicable date prior to the declaration of the dividend).

holders will be 11 August 2016 and the ex-dividend date for Rio Tinto plc ADR shareholders will be 10 
August 2016.
Rio Tinto plc shareholders may elect to receive their dividend in Australian dollars, and Rio Tinto Limited 
shareholders may elect to receive their dividend in pounds sterling. Currency conversions will be 
determined by reference to the exchange rates applicable to pounds sterling and Australian dollars five 
business days prior to the dividend payment date. Currency elections must be registered by 1 September 
2016 for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shareholders.
ADR holders receive dividends in US dollars, which will be converted from pounds sterling by reference to 
the exchange rate applicable on 15 September 2016. This is likely to differ from the US dollar determining 
rate due to currency fluctuations.
As usual, Rio Tinto will operate its Dividend Reinvestment Plans, details of which can be obtained from 
the Rio Tinto website (www.riotinto.com). The last date for receipt of the election notice for the Dividend 
Reinvestment Plans for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shareholders is 1 September 2016. Purchases 
under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan are made on or as soon as practicable after the dividend payment 
date and at prevailing market prices. There is no discount available.

Notes to financial information by business unit
Business units are classified according to the Group’s management structure. The financial information by business 
unit has been recast in accordance with the organisational restructure announced on 21 June 2016. The main impacts 
are as follows: Iron Ore Company of Canada has moved from the Iron Ore Product Group to the Energy & Minerals 
Product Group; Coal businesses have moved from the previous Copper & Coal Product Group to the Energy & 
Minerals Product Group; and, Diamonds businesses have moved from the previous Diamonds & Minerals Product 
Group to the Copper & Diamonds Product Group.
(a)  Gross sales revenue includes the sales revenue of equity accounted units on a proportionately consolidated basis
(after adjusting for sales by EAUs to subsidiaries) in addition to consolidated sales. Consolidated sales revenue 
includes subsidiary sales to equity accounted units which are not included in gross sales revenue.
(b)  EBITDA of subsidiaries and the Group’s share of EBITDA relating to equity accounted units represents profit
before: tax, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation charged to the income statement in the period. 
Underlying EBITDA excludes the same items that are excluded from underlying earnings.
(c)  Represents profit after tax for the period attributable to the owners of the Rio Tinto Group. Business unit earnings
are stated before finance items but after the amortisation of discount related to provisions. Earnings attributed to 
business units do not include amounts that are excluded in arriving at underlying earnings.
(d)  Pilbara represents the Group’s 100 per cent holding in Hamersley and 65 per cent holding of Robe River Iron
Associates. 30 per cent of Robe River Iron Associates is held through a 60 per cent owned subsidiary and 35 per 
cent is held through a 100 per cent subsidiary. Therefore the Group’s net beneficial interest is 53 per cent.
(e)  Presented on an integrated operations basis splitting activities between Bauxite & Alumina, Primary Metal, Pacific
Aluminium and Other integrated operations (which in total reflect the results of the integrated production of 
aluminium) and Other product group items, which relate to other commercial activities.
(f)  Under the terms of a contractual agreement, Rio Tinto is entitled to 40 per cent of material mined as a
consequence of expansions and developments of the Grasberg facilities since 1998.
(g)  Rio Tinto’s interest in Oyu Tolgoi is held indirectly through its 50.8 per cent investment in Turquoise Hill
Resources Ltd (TRQ) which in turn owns 66 per cent of Oyu Tolgoi LLC, which owns the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold 
mine.  The principal asset of TRQ, as at 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2015, was its interest in Oyu Tolgoi LLC.
(h)  Includes Rio Tinto’s interests in Argyle (100 per cent) and Diavik (60 per cent). Murowa (77.8 per cent) was
included until its disposal to RZ Murowa Holdings Limited on 17 June 2015.
(i)  As at 30 June 2016, includes Rio Tinto’s 100 per cent shareholding in Coal & Allied Industries Limited and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries and in Hunter Valley Resources Pty Ltd.   Rio Tinto, as a 100 per cent owner of Coal & 
Allied, holds 67.6 per cent, 80 per cent and 55.6 per cent respectively, with management rights, in Hunter Valley 
Operations, Mount Thorley and Warkworth; and holds a 100 per cent interest in the Mount Pleasant project.
As at 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2015, this represented Rio Tinto’s 80 per cent interest in Coal & Allied, 
through which Rio Tinto held its beneficial interests in Bengalla, Mount Thorley and Warkworth of 32 per cent, 64 
per cent and 44.5 per cent respectively.
Mitsubishi has moved from holding a 20 per cent stake in Coal & Allied (as at 30 June 2015 and 31 December 
2015) to holding a direct 32.4 per cent stake in the Hunter Valley Operations mine.
(j)
Includes Rio Tinto’s interests in Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (100 per cent), QIT Madagascar Minerals (80 per cent) 
and Richards Bay Minerals (attributable interest of 74 per cent).
(k)  Includes Rio Tinto’s interests in Energy Resources of Australia (68.4 per cent) and Rössing Uranium Limited (68.6
per cent).
(l)  Simfer Jersey Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey in which the Group has a 53 per cent interest, has an
87.88 per cent interest in Simfer S.A. the company that operates the Simandou mining project in Guinea. The 
Group therefore has a 46.58 per cent indirect interest in Simfer S.A. These entities are consolidated as 
subsidiaries and together referred to as the Simandou iron ore project.
(m)  Other Operations include Rio Tinto’s 100 per cent interest in the Gove alumina refinery and Rio Tinto Marine.

Notes to financial information by business unit (continued) 
 
(n)  Capital expenditure comprises the net cash outflow on purchases less disposals of property, plant and equipment, 
capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less disposals of other intangible assets. The details provided include 
100 per cent of subsidiaries’ capital expenditure and Rio Tinto’s share of the capital expenditure of joint 
operations and equity accounted units.
(o)  Operating assets of subsidiaries comprise net assets excluding post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax,
and are before deducting net debt. Operating assets are stated after deduction of non-controlling interests, which 
are calculated by reference to the net assets of the relevant companies (i.e. inclusive of such companies’ debt 
and amounts due to or from Rio Tinto Group companies).
(p)  Assets and liabilities held for sale at 30 June 2016 comprise Rio Tinto’s interests in the Blair Athol coal project,
Mount Pleasant, and certain separate assets at Rio Tinto Kennecott. Carbone Savoie and Bengalla were 
disposed of during the period.

Performance 
The Iron Ore group’s underlying earnings of $1,743 million in 2016 first half were 17 per cent or  
$357 million lower than 2015 first half. This was primarily attributable to lower prices, reflected in the 14 
per cent fall, on average, in the Platts 62 per cent index, which reduced earnings by $744 million. The 
price impact was partly offset by higher sales volumes, a weaker Australian dollar, lower energy costs and 
the realisation of further cost savings.

Pre-tax cash cost improvements in the Iron Ore group were $138 million in 2016 first half and have now 
delivered $1,191 million of cumulative savings compared with the 2012 base. This is reflected in a 
reduction in Pilbara unit cash costs to $14.30 per tonne in 2016 first half (2015 first half: $16.20 per 
tonne), attributable to exchange rate movements, increased volumes, reduced fuel prices, lower selling 
costs and increased labour productivity. Pilbara operations delivered a free on board (FOB) EBITDA 
margin of 58 per cent in 2016 first half, compared with 61 per cent in 2015 first half.
Gross sales revenues for Pilbara operations in 2016 first half of $6,303 million included freight revenue of  
$344 million (2015 first half: $372 million).
Net cash generated from operating activities of $1,690 million benefited from strong shipments from the 
Pilbara, combined with lower operating costs through realised cost savings initiatives and improved 
productivity.
Free cash flow of $1,332 million was $163 million higher than 2015 first half, mainly attributable to the 57 
per cent decline in capital expenditure, reflecting the completion of the Pilbara infrastructure expansion in 
2015 first half. 
 
Markets 
First half sales of 158.9 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 129.8 million tonnes) were eight per cent higher 
than the same period of 2015 with a strong rail performance and no major weather events in contrast to 
last year. Bulk inventories built up at the mines during the infrastructure expansion phase were largely 
exhausted by the end of 2015.
Approximately 21 per cent of sales in 2016 first half were priced with reference to the prior quarter’s 
average index lagged by one month. (The second quarter reference price for these sales was December 
2015 to February 2016 at $39.40 per dry metric tonne FOB). The remainder was sold either on current 
quarter average, current month average or on the spot market. Approximately 61 per cent of 2016 first 
half sales were made on a cost and freight (CFR) basis, with the remainder sold FOB.
Achieved average pricing in 2016 first half was $44.50 per wet metric tonne on an FOB basis (2015 first 
half: $54.40 per wet metric tonne). This equates to $48.40 per dry metric tonne (2015 first half: $59.10 per 
dry metric tonne), which compares with the average FOB Platts price of $48.10 per dry metric tonne for 
62 per cent iron Pilbara fines during the half (2015 first half: $55.30 per dry metric tonne).

Operations 
Pilbara operations produced 160.8 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 131.3 million tonnes) in 2016 first half, 
ten per cent higher than the same period of 2015. This performance reflects minimal weather impacts as 
well as the successful implementation of operational improvements and the ramp-up of expanded and 
new mines across the Pilbara. 
 
New projects and growth options 
On 2 August 2016, the Group approved $338 million to complete the development of Silvergrass, to 
maintain the Pilbara blend and reduce unit costs. The initial phase of the Nammuldi Incremental Tonnes 
project, NIT1, (with a five million tonne per annum capacity) commenced production in the fourth quarter 
of 2015 and the second phase, NIT2, (which will take annual mine capacity from five to ten million tonnes) 
is expected to come into production in the fourth quarter of 2016. With this $338 million approval, the road 
haulage used in the NIT projects will be replaced by a conveyor, which is expected to take annual mine 
capacity from 10 to 20 million tonnes1 from the fourth quarter of 2017, with full production in 2018. 
 
Guidance 
Rio Tinto’s expected Pilbara iron ore shipments in 2016 are around 330 million tonnes (100 per cent 
basis), subject to weather conditions. As announced in the First Quarter Operations Review, the delay in 
AutoHaul® means production from the Pilbara is expected to be between 330 and 340 million tonnes in 
2017, subject to final productivity and capital expenditure plans.

The Gove alumina refinery is curtailed and reported separately from Aluminium within Other Operations. 
 
Performance 
The Aluminium group had a strong first half operationally, with higher production in all three products 
compared with 2015 first half. Several sites achieved production records, including Yarwun for alumina, 
Gove and CBG for bauxite and Kitimat for aluminium.
The group’s underlying earnings of $377 million decreased 52 per cent compared with 2015 first half, due 
to a decline in prices, which lowered earnings by $656 million, and an increase in depreciation expense 
following the commissioning of the modernised Kitimat smelter. Despite the weaker pricing environment, 
the Aluminium group increased its free cash flow generation to $660 million (first half 2015: $646 million), 
through a combination of strong volumes, cash cost and working capital improvements and reduced 
capital  expenditure, following the completion of the Kitimat smelter expansion. The product group’s 
relentless focus on cost reduction efforts and productivity improvement initiatives and a strong operational 
performance, partly mitigated this price impact and generated an EBITDA margin from integrated 
operations of 25 per cent (2015 first half: 35 per cent).
Pre-tax cash cost improvements in the Aluminium group were $223 million in 2016 first half and the group 
has now delivered $1,355 million of cumulative savings compared with the 2012 base.   
 
Markets 
The 2016 first half cash LME aluminium price averaged $1,544 per tonne, a decrease of 13 per cent on 
2015 first half.  Market premia in all regions fell from their record highs in early 2015.  In the US, the Mid-
West market premium averaged $181 per tonne in 2016 first half, compared with an average $395 per 
tonne in 2015 first half, a 54 per cent decrease.
Overall, the group achieved an average realised aluminium price of $1,805 per tonne in 2016 first half 
(2015 first half: $2,292 per tonne). This includes premia for value-added products (VAP), which 
represented 53 per cent of primary metal produced in 2016 first half and generated attractive product 
premia averaging $226 per tonne of VAP sold (2015 first half: $259 per tonne) on top of the physical 
market premia.
Rio Tinto’s share of third party bauxite sales in 2016 first half increased by five per cent to 13.9 million 
tonnes (2015 first half: 13.2 million tonnes). Bauxite prices decreased during this period due to increased 
bauxite supply and lower freight rates.  
 
Operations 
Bauxite delivered strong production in 2016 first half, up nine per cent compared with 2015 first half, with 
Weipa, Gove and CBG all reaching new production records for the half. The higher volumes, combined 
with cash cost reductions, absorbed 67 per cent of the bauxite price decline and led to the bauxite 
business recording a 48 per cent FOB EBITDA margin in 2016 first half. Bauxite underlying earnings 
declined 11 per cent to $243 million in 2016 first half.
Gross sales revenues for bauxite in 2016 first half decreased five per cent to $962 million and included 
freight revenues of $93 million (2015 first half: $93 million).
Page 16 of 62
Alumina production increased by six per cent compared with 2015 first half. Yarwun achieved record 
production as process improvement initiatives were completed. The transformation of the Alumina 
business gathered pace during 2016 first half, and resulted in the Alumina business significantly reducing 
its cash costs. Alumina managed to offset 53 per cent of the price decrease it incurred during 2016 first 
half through enhanced volumes and reduced cash costs. Overall, the Alumina business recorded a loss 
of $83 million, compared with a loss of $52 million in 2015 first half.
First half aluminium production of 1.8 million tonnes was ten per cent higher than 2015 first half, with the 
modernised and expanded Kitimat smelter delivering its first full quarter at nameplate capacity. The 
Primary Metal business managed to offset 28 per cent of the price decrease it incurred during 2016 first 
half through enhanced volumes and reduced cash costs. Primary Metal earnings (Canada, Europe, 
Middle East) declined by 65 per cent to $107 million, while earnings from Pacific Aluminium (Australia, 
New Zealand) decreased by 81 per cent to $29 million. 
 
New projects and growth options 
The expanded Kitimat smelter commenced production in June 2015, reached nameplate capacity of 420 
thousand tonnes per annum in March 2016 and is driving its production costs down into the first decile of 
the industry cost curve.
On 27 November 2015, the Group approved the $1.9 billion Amrun (South of Embley) bauxite mine and 
associated processing and port facilities on the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland. The planned 
initial annual output of 22.8 million tonnes a year1 is expected to replace production from the depleting 
East Weipa mine and increase annual bauxite exports from Cape York by around 10 million tonnes. 
Production and shipping are expected to commence in the first half of 2019.  
 
2016 production guidance 
Rio Tinto’s expected share of production is 45 million tonnes of bauxite, 7.8 million tonnes of alumina and 
3.6 million tonnes of aluminium.

The decline in earnings, compared with $393 million in 2015 first half, was principally driven by the $236 
million impact of lower prices and $114 million of non-cash asset write-downs, following the conclusion of 
the review of the asset portfolio at Rio Tinto Kennecott. Operationally, lower sales volumes for copper, 
gold and molybdenum were partly offset by further cost savings at Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi and an 
improved operational performance in Diamonds.
During the period, an agreement was reached for the sale of undeveloped land in the community of 
Daybreak, located five miles to the west of the Kennecott mine. The sale transaction was completed on 
16 July 2016 and the net proceeds have been subsequently received. As at 30 June 2016, the land was 
classified an asset held for sale and revalued to fair value.
Over $140 million of pre-tax cash cost improvements were achieved by Rio Tinto managed operations 
during the first half. This was fully offset by the lower volumes at Escondida in conjunction with the 
operation’s programme to release working capital with the processing of lower grade stockpiles. Despite 
this programme creating value, it resulted in higher unit cash costs which are reflected in the results. 
Hence the net pre-tax cash cost improvements for the group were minimal in 2016 first half. Pre-tax cash 
cost savings delivered across the Copper & Diamonds group since 2012 totalled $999 million.
The free cash flow during the half is net of investments in development capital and exploration and 
evaluation spend of $370 million across the business.  
 
Markets 
Average copper prices declined 21 per cent to 213 cents per pound and gold increased one per cent to 
$1,221 per ounce.
In 2016 first half, the US consumer market was steady, however demand from India and China continued 
to be slower due to local market factors. Industry rough diamond prices varied across product segments.
The total impact of price changes on the Copper & Diamonds group, including the effects of provisional 
pricing movements, resulted in a decrease in underlying earnings of $236 million compared with 2015 first 
half.
Page 18 of 62
At 30 June 2016, the Group had an estimated 189 million pounds of copper sales that were provisionally 
priced at US 214 cents per pound. The final price of these sales will be determined during the second half 
of 2016. This compared with 252 million pounds of open shipments at 31 December 2015, provisionally 
priced at US 217 cents per pound. 
 
Operations - Copper 
Mined copper production was one per cent higher than 2015 first half, as a result of increased output at 
Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi, and a contribution from Grasberg, largely offset by a decrease in production at 
Escondida. Lower mined gold production was driven by lower grades at Oyu Tolgoi and reduced mine 
throughput at Kennecott, partly offset by a contribution from Grasberg. Refined copper and gold 
production at Kennecott was lower than 2015 first half, when volumes were boosted by a drawdown in 
inventory.
Mined copper production at Kennecott for the first half was significantly higher than the same period of 
2015 as mining progresses through areas of higher copper grades. The focus continued on the de-
weighting and de-watering of the east wall of Bingham Canyon and the development of the south wall 
pushback. Refined copper and gold production at Kennecott were 36 per cent and 43 per cent lower, 
respectively, compared with 2015 first half, when a drawdown in inventory occurred.
Kennecott continues to toll third party concentrate to optimise smelter utilisation, with 199 thousand 
tonnes received for processing in the first half of 2016. Tolled copper concentrate, which is smelted and 
returned to customers, is excluded from reported production figures.
Mined copper production at Escondida in the first half was 23 per cent lower than the same period of 
2015, primarily due to lower copper grades, partly offset by higher throughput from the new concentrator.
At Oyu Tolgoi, mined copper production was 23 per cent higher than 2015 first half, attributable to higher 
grades and throughput, along with productivity improvements.
On 19 July 2016, Rio Tinto reported its share of Grasberg’s production for the half of 17.1 thousand 
tonnes of mined copper and 29.4 thousand ounces of mined gold, in line with Freeport’s publicly stated 
guidance at the time.
On 30 June 2016, Rio Tinto announced that it had transferred its 53.8 per cent shareholding in 
Bougainville Copper Limited to an independent trustee, to be distributed between the Autonomous 
Bougainville Government for the benefit of all the Panguna landowners and the people of Bougainville, 
and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.  
 
Operations – Diamonds  
Diamonds production was two per cent higher than 2015 first half, with higher volumes at Argyle from the 
continued ramp-up of production from the underground mine offsetting lower carats recovered at Diavik, 
reflecting lower grades.  
 
New projects and growth options 
On 6 May 2016, Rio Tinto, the Government of Mongolia and Turquoise Hill Resources announced the 
approval of the $5.3 billion development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine. Project activities have 
started, with the engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) agreement awarded 
and mobilisation in progress. Following approval of the project, over $4 billion of project financing has 
been drawn down, and represents one of the largest project financing facilities in the industry.
At Escondida, the new concentrator (OGP1, a 152 thousand tonne per day concentrator) has been 
commissioned and continues to ramp up to nameplate capacity. On 30 June 2016, the Escondida 
Owners Council approved the Los Colorados Extension project for $180 million (100 per cent basis). First 
production is expected in the first half of 2017, adding incremental annual capacity of approximately 200 
thousand tonnes of copper in the near term. 
 
2016 production guidance 
Following Freeport’s announcement of its revised 2016 production guidance for Grasberg, Rio Tinto now 
expects its share of mined copper production in 2016 to be between 545 and 595 thousand tonnes. 
Expectations for refined copper production are unchanged at 220 to 250 thousand tonnes. Diamond 
production for 2016 is expected to be between 18 and 21 million carats.

Performance 
The Energy & Minerals group’s underlying earnings of $82 million, which were 11 per cent higher than 
2015 first half, benefited from further cash cost improvements and weaker exchange rates, partly offset 
by lower prices, while sales volumes were generally flat. Excluding the impact of the Simandou costs 
associated with completing the bankable feasibility study, Energy & Minerals earnings were 35 per cent 
higher at $124 million.

Pre-tax cash cost improvements in the Energy & Minerals group were $152 million in 2016 first half and 
the group has now delivered $1,215 million of cumulative savings compared with the 2012 base.
Net cash generated from operating activities of $469 million was 31 per cent lower than 2015 first half due 
to lower prices, higher tax payments and the expensing of all Simandou study costs, partly mitigated by 
cost improvements and further reductions in working capital.
Free cash flow during the half was $332 million, $77 million lower than 2015 first half, reflecting lower 
operating cash flow partly offset by reduced capital expenditure, which declined by $129 million, or 49 per 
cent, to $134 million with continued capital discipline across the product group. From the start of 2016, all 
Simandou study costs are being expensed.  
 
Markets 
Thermal and hard coking coal prices declined in 2016 first half, averaging $51 and $84 per tonne, 
respectively.
Thermal coal revenues of $611 million in 2016 first half (2015 first half: $769 million) represented 3.8 per 
cent of the Rio Tinto Group total (2015 first half: 4.3 per cent).
Titanium dioxide feedstock demand remained subdued throughout 2016 first half as the industry 
continued to absorb excess inventories, although there is positive demand growth for specific grades. The 
market for zircon has recently stabilised following an initial period of weak demand in China.
Demand for borates has remained stable globally, with robust demand in the Americas and India partly 
offset by weaker growth in China and weather-related demand constraints in south-east Asia.
The uranium market continues to suffer from high inventory levels throughout the supply chain, with soft 
prices declining during 2016 first half and remaining under pressure.
Page 20 of 62
Operations - Energy 
Hard coking coal production for 2016 first half was eight per cent lower than 2015 first half primarily due 
to the timing of the longwall changeover at Kestrel.
Semi-soft coking coal production reflects the Coal & Allied restructure in early 2016 and mine production 
sequencing at Hunter Valley Operations and Mount Thorley Warkworth, resulting in eight per cent higher 
production for the first half of 2016 than the first half of 2015.
Thermal coal production for the first half was broadly in line with the same period last year.
Despite lower prices, all coal operations were free cash flow positive in 2016 first half.
Uranium production was 41 per cent higher than 2015 first half, with higher mill throughput and mill 
recoveries at Energy Resources of Australia and a stronger half at Rössing following a fire in the final 
product recovery plant in 2015 first half.
On 30 September 2015, Rio Tinto reached a binding agreement for the sale of its interest in the Bengalla 
Joint Venture to New Hope Corporation Limited. The sale completed on 1 March 2016 for $617 million.
On 27 January 2016, Rio Tinto announced that it had reached a binding agreement for the sale of its 
Mount Pleasant thermal coal assets to MACH Energy Australia Pty Ltd for $224 million plus royalties. The 
conditions precedent of the sale have been met and the sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 
2016.  
 
Operations – Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) 
IOC achieved first half of production of 8.5 million tonnes of concentrate and pellets (Rio Tinto share 5.0 
million tonnes), a six per cent increase over the first half of 2015. This improvement was driven by 
increased asset reliability and performance. The improvement in production boosted first half sales by 17 
per cent over last year’s levels, to 8.6 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 5.0 million tonnes). 
 
Operations - Minerals 
Titanium dioxide slag production in the half was 23 per cent lower than in the first half of 2015. Rio Tinto 
Iron & Titanium continues to optimise production in line with demand, with two of nine furnaces at Rio 
Tinto Fer et Titane and one of four furnaces at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) currently idled.
Borates and salt production were broadly in line with 2015 first half. 
 
New projects and growth options  
Work continues on the feasibility study for the Zulti South development at RBM, which is one of the best 
undeveloped assets in the mineral sands industry.
The Jadar project in Serbia is a potentially world-class lithium-borate deposit discovered by Rio Tinto in 
2004. Findings so far are encouraging and pre-feasibility assessments are ongoing to confirm the 
economic business case.
Simfer (owned 42.7 per cent by Rio Tinto) completed the integrated Bankable Feasibility Study for the 
mine, rail and port and infrastructure elements of the Simandou iron ore project in May 2016 on time and 
as required by the Investment Framework. Extensive engagement with potential infrastructure investors 
has taken place, but deteriorating market conditions have had a negative impact on investors’ appetite for 
the project and have prevented Simfer from assembling a funding consortium. The group is working with 
its partners to restructure the project so as to facilitate access to infrastructure funding from China.   
 
2016 production guidance 
In 2016, Rio Tinto’s share of production is expected to be 17 to 18 million tonnes of thermal coal, 3.3 to 
3.9 million tonnes of semi-soft coking coal, seven to eight million tonnes of hard coking coal, 12 million 
tonnes of iron ore pellets and concentrates (equivalent to 20 million tonnes on a 100 per cent basis), one 
million tonnes of titanium dioxide slag, 0.5 million tonnes of boric oxide equivalent and five to six million 
pounds of uranium.

Price & exchange rate sensitivities
The following sensitivities give the estimated effect on underlying earnings assuming that each individual 
price or exchange rate moved in isolation. The relationship between currencies and commodity prices is a 
complex one and movements in exchange rates can affect movements in commodity prices and vice 
versa. The exchange rate sensitivities quoted below include the effect on operating costs of movements 
in exchange rates but exclude the effect of the revaluation of foreign currency working capital. They 
should therefore be used with care.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
for the half year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Review of operations and important events 
A detailed review of the Group’s operations, the results of those operations during the half year ended 30 
June 2016 and likely future developments are given on pages 1 to 23. Important events that have 
occurred during the period and up until the date of this report are set out below.
On 27 January 2016, Rio Tinto announced that it had reached a binding agreement for the sale of its 
Mount Pleasant thermal coal assets to MACH Energy Australia Pty Ltd for US$224 million plus royalties.
On 1 March 2016, the Group announced that it had completed the sale of its 40 per cent interest in the 
Bengalla coal Joint Venture in Australia to New Hope Corporation Limited for US$616.7 million.
On 17 March 2016, the Group announced that Rio Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh would retire from the 
business on 1 July 2016 and would be succeeded by Copper & Coal chief executive Jean-Sébastien 
Jacques. Jean-Sébastien joined the board and became deputy chief executive with effect from the same 
date.
On 15 April 2016, the Group announced that Rio Tinto and Sinosteel Corporation had extended their 
historic Channar Mining Joint Venture in Australia’s Pilbara region. The Channar joint venture extension, 
together with a separate agreement for Rio Tinto to supply iron ore from the Pilbara, will enable sales of 
up to 70 million tonnes of iron ore to Sinosteel Corporation over the next five years. This extension will 
see 30 million tonnes of iron ore supplied into the joint venture, with Sinosteel making a one-off payment 
of US$45 million to Rio Tinto and providing additional production royalties linked to the iron ore price. In a 
separate agreement, Rio Tinto will sell up to 40 million tonnes of iron ore to Sinosteel between 2016 and 
2021.
On 21 April 2016, the Group announced a proposed transaction, using its strong liquidity position, to 
reduce gross debt through the early repayment of some near term maturing debt, by commencing cash 
tender offers to purchase $1.5 billion of its 2017 and 2018 notes.
On 27 April 2016, the Group announced that it had progressed plans to reduce gross debt through the 
early repayment of some near term maturing debt, pricing its Any and All Offer. The total consideration

On 28 April 2016, the Group announced that under its plan to reduce gross debt through the early 
repayment of some near term maturing debt, it had accepted for purchase a total of $1.359 billion in debt 
pursuant to its Any and All Offer, which commenced on 21 April 2016 and expired on 27 April 2016.  $339 
million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.000 per cent Notes due 2017 would be purchased at a price 
of $1,006.91 per $1,000 principal amount of notes. $1.020 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 
1.625 per cent Notes due 2017 would be purchased at a price of $1,005.85 per $1,000 principal amount

On 5 May 2016, the Group announced that under its plan to reduce gross debt through the early 
repayment of some near term maturing debt, it had accepted for purchase a total of $141 million of debt

On 6 May 2016, the Group announced that Rio Tinto and its partners, the Government of Mongolia and 
Turquoise Hill Resources, had approved the next stage in the development of the world-class Oyu Tolgoi 
copper and gold mine in Mongolia. The development of the underground mine will start in mid-2016 
following the approval of a $5.3 billion investment by the partners and the recent granting of all necessary 
permits. First production from the underground, which has an average copper grade of 1.66 per cent, 
more than three times higher than the open pit, is expected in 2020. When the underground is fully 
ramped up in 2027, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce more than 500,000 tonnes of copper a 
year, compared with current annual production of 175,000-200,000 tonnes. The mine also benefits from 
significant gold by-products, with an average gold grade of 0.35 grams per tonne.
On 24 May 2016, the Group announced that it had appointed Stephen McIntosh as the acting Group 
executive, Technology & Innovation to succeed Greg Lilleyman, who left the company after 25 years of 
service.  Stephen has been with Rio Tinto for almost 30 years working on projects in more than 45
Page 24 of 62
countries spanning the A-Z of minerals and metals. Most recently, he was head of Exploration, leading a 
450-strong global team of employees operating in 20 countries.
On 7 June 2016, the Group announced a proposed transaction, continuing to use its strong liquidity 
position, to reduce gross debt, by commencing cash tender offers to purchase up to $3 billion of its 2018, 
2020, 2021 and 2022 US dollar-denominated notes.
On 13 June 2016, the Group announced that it had progressed plans to reduce gross debt as part of its 
ongoing capital management, by pricing its Any and All Offer announced on 7 June 2016. The total 
consideration payable in connection with the Any and All Offer pursuant to the Offer to Purchase dated 7 
June 2016 was set at $1,108.33 for the 6.500 per cent Notes due 2018 and at $1,024.36 for the 2.250 per 
cent Notes due 2018, in each case per $1,000 principal amount of notes.

are part of Rio Tinto’s ongoing capital management.  The final aggregate principal amount of Securities 
purchased under the Any and All Offer that expired on 13 June 2016 was $1.748 billion, including the 
notes purchased under the guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Offer to Purchase.
On 21 June 2016, the Group announced that it had priced the Maximum Tender Offer under its plan to 
reduce gross debt by $3 billion.  The Maximum Tender Total Consideration payable in connection with 
the Maximum Tender Offer was set at $1,069.72 for its 3.500 per cent Notes due 2020, $1,094.06 for its 
4.125 per cent Notes due 2021 and $1,078.46 for its 3.750 per cent Notes due 2021. The Maximum

On 21 June 2016, the Group announced that it would strengthen its organisational structure to continue to 
drive performance under its new chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques. From 2 July 2016, Rio Tinto’s 
product group structure was adjusted to better align the Group’s assets with the business strategy to help 
drive further efficiencies and optimise performance. The Group’s world-class assets have been placed 
firmly at the centre of the business, supported by efficient and agile global functions. 
Under the new arrangements, Rio Tinto’s organisational structure includes four product groups –
Aluminium, Copper & Diamonds, Energy & Minerals and Iron Ore. These groups are complemented by a 
newly shaped Growth & Innovation group, which focuses on future assets and technical support. 
Under the new structure:
  Aluminium retains its focus on safety, cash and value creation from its high-quality bauxite, alumina and

aluminium businesses. Alfredo Barrios would remain as chief executive, based in Montreal. 
Iron Ore is exclusively focused on the Group’s world-class iron ore operations in Western Australia. Chris 
Salisbury, previously acting Copper & Coal chief executive, became Iron Ore chief executive based in 
Perth.
  Copper & Diamonds combines our two marketing-led businesses into a single product group, which helps
us maximise our technical underground mining expertise. Arnaud Soirat joined the Executive Committee 
as Copper & Diamonds chief executive. Arnaud, previously Aluminium Primary Metal president and chief 
executive officer, with more than 24 years of industry experience across three continents, is based in 
London.
  Energy & Minerals re-shaped Alan Davies’ portfolio, bringing together Rio Tinto’s coal, uranium, salt,
borates and titanium dioxide businesses, as well as the Iron Ore Company of Canada. Alan, previously 
Diamonds & Minerals chief executive, remains based in London.
  Growth & Innovation  provides strategic leadership and technical expertise for the end-to-end delivery and
management of growth from exploration to projects. Stephen McIntosh, previously acting Technology & 
Innovation Group executive, takes up the role of Growth & Innovation Group executive, based in 
Brisbane. 
In addition, reflecting the Group’s increased focus on health and safety, accountability for safety as a 
discrete unit sits with an Executive Committee member for the first time.
Page 25 of 62
Joanne Farrell, previously the global head of Health, Safety, Environment and Communities takes on the 
role of Group executive, Health, Safety & Environment based in Perth. Joanne, who has more than 35 
years’ experience in the mining sector, also became managing director of Australia. 
Andrew Harding, previously Iron Ore chief executive, left the business with effect from 1 July 2016.
On 30 June 2016, the Group announced that it had transferred its 53.8 per cent shareholding in 
Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) to an independent trustee. Equity Trustees Limited would manage the 
distribution of these shares between the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) for the benefit of 
all the Panguna landowners and the people of Bougainville, and the Independent State of Papua New 
Guinea (PNG). Under the trust deed, the ABG would have the opportunity to receive 68 per cent of Rio 
Tinto’s shareholding (which equates to 36.4 per cent of BCL’s shares) from the independent trustee for no 
consideration and PNG would be entitled to the remaining 32 per cent (which equates to 17.4 per cent of 
BCL’s shares). The ABG and PNG would both hold an equal share in BCL of 36.4 per cent if the transfers 
are completed. This ensures both parties are equally involved in any consideration and decision-making 
around the future of the Panguna mine.
On 2 August 2016, the Group announced the approval of the development of the Silvergrass iron ore 
mine to maintain the Pilbara blend. The Group will invest $338 million to complete the development, 
adding ten million tonnes of annual capacity.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
The principal risks and uncertainties that could materially affect Rio Tinto’s results and operations are set 
out on pages 16 to 21 of the 2015 Annual report and are listed under the risk factor headings below. The 
Group’s view of its principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year 
remains substantially unchanged. There may be additional risks unknown to Rio Tinto and other risks, 
currently believed to be immaterial, which could turn out to be material. These risks, whether they 
materialise individually or simultaneously, could significantly affect the Group's business and financial 
results.
(i)
Financial Risks
Market risks: 
Commodity prices, driven by demand and supply for the Group’s products, vary outside of expectations 
over time. Exchange rate variations and geopolitical issues may offset or exacerbate this risk. 
 
China’s development pathway could impact demand for the Group’s products outside of expectations. 
 
Financial risks: 
External events and internal discipline may impact Group liquidity. 
 
Strategic risks: 
Rio Tinto’s ability to secure planned value by successfully executing divestments and acquisitions may 
vary. 
 
The Group’s ability to develop new projects successfully may vary. 
 
(ii) 
 
HSEC risk: 
Our operations and projects are inherently hazardous with the potential to cause illness or injury, damage 
to the environment, disruption to a community or a threat to personal security. 
 
Resource risks: 
The success of the Group’s exploration activity may vary. In addition, estimates of ore reserves are based 
on uncertain assumptions that, if changed, could result in the need to restate ore reserves. 
 
Operations, projects and people risks: 
Commercial excellence is derived from high operational and human productivity. Productivity is driven by 
optimization of the balance of people, process and systems.
Operational Risks
Compliance Risks
(iii) 
Stakeholder risks: 
Strategic partnerships and third parties influence the Group’s supply, operations and reputation. The 
Group’s ability to control the actions of these parties varies. 
 
The Group’s operations are located across a number of jurisdictions, which exposes the Group to a wide 
range of economic, political and regulatory risks.
Page 27 of 62
Governance risks: 
The Group’s reputation and regulatory licences are dependent upon appropriate business conduct and 
are threatened by a public allegation or regulatory investigation. 
 
Corporate governance 
The directors of Rio Tinto believe that highest standards of corporate governance are essential to its 
pursuit of greater shareholder value and have continued to apply the standards discussed under 
‘Corporate governance’ on pages 55 to 66 of the 2015 Annual report which is available on the Rio Tinto 
Group website www.riotinto.com. 
 
Publication of half year results 
In accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance & Transparency Rules and 
the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules, the half year results will be made public and are 
available on the Rio Tinto Group website. 
 
Auditor’s independence declaration 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditors of Rio Tinto Limited, have provided the auditor’s independence 
declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 in Australia. This has been 
reproduced on page 56 and forms part of this report.

Approved in July 2013, the project is 
designed to provide a long-term 
sustainable supply of water for the 
operations. It remains on schedule and on 
budget and is 93 per cent complete, with 
commissioning scheduled in 2017.
Investment to continue the pre-production 
construction of the Grasberg Block Cave, 
the Deep Mill Level Zone underground 
mines, and the associated common 
infrastructure. Rio Tinto’s final share of 
capital expenditure will be influenced in 
part by its share of production over the 
2012 to 2016 period.
Following the pit wall slide in 2013, mine 
operations have focused on remediation 
from the slide and the east wall of 
Bingham Canyon, including significant de-
weighting and de-watering activities. 
These activities are continuing in 2016.
Funding for the continuation of open pit 
mining via the push back of the south wall 
has been approved and will largely 
consist of simple mine stripping activities.
Approved in November 2014, the 
development of the A21 pipe is expected 
to ensure the continuation of existing 
production levels. First carats are planned 
for late 2018.
Approved in May 2015, first production 
from the underground is expected in 
2020. Project activities have commenced, 
with the EPCM agreement awarded and 
mobilisation in progress.

Forward-looking statements 
 
This announcement includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this 
announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding Rio Tinto’s financial position, business 
strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans and 
objectives relating to Rio Tinto’s products, production forecasts and reserve and resource positions), are 
forward-looking statements. The words “intend”, “aim”, “project”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “believes”, 
“expects”, “may”, “should”, “will”, “target”, “set to” or similar expressions, commonly identify such forward-
looking statements.
Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which 
may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Rio Tinto, or industry results, to be 
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such 
forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions 
regarding Rio Tinto’s present and future business strategies and the environment in which Rio Tinto will 
operate in the future. Among the important factors that could cause Rio Tinto’s actual results, 
performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are levels 
of actual production during any period, levels of demand and market prices, the ability to produce and 
transport products profitably, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and 
operating costs, operational problems, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant areas of 
the world, the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as changes in taxation or 
regulation and such other risk factors identified in Rio Tinto's most recent Annual Report and Accounts in 
Australia and the United Kingdom and the most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the United 
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or Form 6-Ks furnished to, or filed with, the 
SEC. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue 
reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak 
only as of the date of this announcement. Rio Tinto expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking 
(except as required by applicable law, the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of 
the Financial Conduct Authority and the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange) to release 
publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change 
in Rio Tinto’s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on 
which any such statement is based.
Nothing in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Rio Tinto 
plc or Rio Tinto Limited will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.

(b)  For the period to 30 June 2016, a pre-tax gain of US$410 million was recognised by Rio Tinto on the
sale of its 40 per cent interest in the Bengalla Joint Venture on 1 March 2016. This was partially offset 
by a loss on disposal of the 100 per cent interest in Carbone Savoie on 31 March 2016. 
 
The 2015 gain related mainly to the sale by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ) of 25.7 per cent of its 
holdings in SouthGobi Resources (SGR) on 23 April 2015. Rio Tinto also sold its 77.8 per cent 
interest in Murowa Diamonds and 50 per cent interest in Sengwa Colliery Ltd to RZ Murowa Holdings 
Limited on 17 June 2015.

(c)  Finance costs in the income statement include hedging adjustments and are net of amounts
capitalised of US$35 million (30 June 2015: US$171 million).
(d)  Rio Tinto completed two bond buyback programmes during April 2016 and June 2016 for US$1.5
billion and US$3 billion (nominal values) respectively.  The early redemption of these bonds 
accelerated the recognition of future interest payments associated with them.  Included in finance 
costs is a net charge of US$175 million attributable to early redemption of bonds.
There was no early redemption of bonds completed for the six months ended 30 June 2015.
(e)  For the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share, the weighted average number of Rio Tinto 
plc and Rio Tinto Limited shares outstanding during the period was 1,797.1 million (30 June 2015: 
1,838.9 million), being the average number of Rio Tinto plc shares outstanding of 1,373.5 million (30 
June 2015: 1,409.3 million), plus the average number of Rio Tinto Limited shares outstanding of 
423.6 million (30 June 2015: 429.6 million). The profit figures used in the calculation of basic and 
diluted earnings per share are the profits attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. 
 
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the effect of dilutive securities is added to 
the weighted average number of shares. This effect is calculated under the treasury stock method.

Group balance sheet (continued)
(a)  Assets and liabilities held for sale at 30 June 2016 comprise Rio Tinto’s interests in the Blair Athol
coal project, Mount Pleasant, and certain separate assets at Rio Tinto Kennecott.  Carbone Savoie 
and Bengalla were disposed of during the period. 
 
Assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2015 comprised Rio Tinto’s interests in the Blair 
Athol coal project, Carbone Savoie, Bengalla and Molybdenum Autoclave Process assets.
(b)  A review of the infrastructure capacity requirements in Queensland, Australia, has confirmed that it is
no longer likely that Rio Tinto will utilise the Abbot Point Coal Terminal and associated rail capacity 
contracted under take or pay arrangements. Accordingly, an onerous contract provision has been 
recognised based on the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a post-tax real 
rate of two per cent, resulting in a pre-tax onerous contract charge of US$709 million.  The increase 
to the onerous contract provisions has been taken through net operating costs in the income 
statement and is excluded from underlying earnings.  Refer to Reconciliation of net earnings to 
underlying earnings on page 61.
(c)  At 30 June 2016, Rio Tinto plc had 1,374.6 million ordinary shares in issue and held by the public,
and Rio Tinto Limited had 424.2 million shares in issue and held by the public. No shares in Rio Tinto 
Limited were held by Rio Tinto plc at 30 Jun 2016 (31 December 2015: nil).  As required to be 
disclosed under the ASX Listing Rules, the net tangible assets per share amounted to US$18.43 (31 
December 2015: US$18.42).

Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as defined on page 54, 
which differs in certain respects from the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia, referred to as 
Australian Accounting Standards ('AAS'). 
 
Prior to 1 January 2004, the Group's financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. 
Under IFRS, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the 
Group's UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated. This was permitted under the rules 
governing the transition to IFRS set out in IFRS 1. The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not 
provide for the netting of goodwill against equity. As a consequence, shareholders' funds under AAS 
include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$562 million at 30 June 2016 (31 December 
2015: US$560 million). 
 
Save for the exception described above, the Group's financial statements drawn up in accordance with 
IFRS are consistent with the requirements of AAS.

(a)  Consolidated net debt is stated net of the impact of certain funding arrangements between equity
accounted units (EAUs) and partially owned subsidiaries (EAU funded balances). This adjustment is 
required in order to avoid showing borrowings twice in the net debt disclosure, where funding has 
been provided to an EAU by the Group and subsequently on lent by the EAU to a consolidated Group 
subsidiary.
(b)  Total borrowings are combined with other current financial liabilities of US$214 million (31 December
2015: US$231 million) and non-current financial liabilities of US$309 million (31 December 2015: 
US$330 million) in the balance sheet.

(a)  Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
This category includes listed equity shares and other quoted funds.
(b)  Valuation is based on inputs that are observable for the financial instruments; these include quoted
prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be 
active, or inputs, either directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
(c)  Valuation is based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).
(d)  Other investments, including loans, comprise: cash deposits in rehabilitation funds, government
bonds and royalty amounts receivable. The royalty receivables are valued based on an estimate of 
forward sales subject to the royalty agreement.
(e)  Trade receivables includes provisionally priced receivables relating to sales contracts where selling
price is determined after delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation 
point stipulated in the contract. Revenue is recognised on provisionally priced sales based on the 
forward selling price for the period stipulated in the contract.
(f)  Level 3 derivatives consist of derivatives embedded in electricity purchase contracts linked to the 
LME with terms expiring between 2016 and 2030. The embedded derivatives are measured using 
discounted cash flows and option model valuation techniques. Long-term embedded derivatives with 
a fair value of US$397 million at 30 June 2016 are valued using significant unobservable inputs as 
the term of the derivative extends beyond the forward curve for aluminium. 
 
Aluminium prices are flat lined beyond the market forward curve and increased by projected inflation 
up to the date of expiry of the contract. 
 
The range of market prices is US$2,104 per metric tonne in 2026 to US$2,304 in 2030. 
 
The other contracts with a fair value of US$21 million at 30 June 2016 are categorised as level three 
as the market premium assumptions used represent unobservable inputs.
Page 48 of 62
Fair value disclosure for financial instruments (continued)
(g)  Interest rate and currency interest rate swaps are valued using applicable market quoted swap yield 
curves adjusted for relevant basis and credit default spreads. Currency interest rate swap valuations 
also use market quoted foreign exchange rates. A discounted cash flow approach is applied to the 
cash flows derived from the inputs to determine fair value.
(h)  There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 or between Level 2 and Level 3 for the six
months to 30 June 2016 or the year to 31 December 2015.
Level 3 Financial instruments
The table below shows the summary of changes in the fair value of the Group's Level 3 financial assets 
and financial liabilities for the six months to 30 June 2016 and the year ended 31 December 2015.

Sensitivity analysis in respect of level 3 derivatives
Forward contracts and options whose carrying value are valued using unobservable inputs are calculated 
using appropriate discounted cash flow and option model valuation techniques. 
 
The most significant of these assumptions relate to long term pricing wherein internal pricing assumptions 
are used after the 10 year LME curve. A 10 per cent increase in long term metal pricing assumptions 
would result in a US$31 million (31 December 2015: US$38 million) decrease in carrying value. A 10 per 
cent decrease in long term metal pricing assumptions would result in a US$42 million (31 December 
2015: US$39 million) increase in carrying value.

Other disclosures
Capital commitments at 30 June 2016
Capital commitments, excluding the Group’s share of joint venture capital commitments, were US$912 
million (31 December 2015: US$834 million). 
 
The Group’s share of joint venture capital commitments was US$243 million (31 December 2015: 
US$357 million). 
 
The Group has a commitment to purchase and market a portion (in excess of the Group’s ownership 
interest) of the output of Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., an aluminium smelter in which the Group is a 
joint venturer. The Group immediately sells the purchased products to third parties.  
 
For Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C. the Group, along with the other joint venturers, has made various 
commitments to provide shareholder funding as required, subject to approved thresholds.  
 
At 30 June 2015, Minera Escondida Limitada held a shareholder line of credit for US$225 million (Rio 
Tinto share) which was undrawn at that date. This line of credit matured during the year ended 31 
December 2015.

Other disclosures (continued)
Contingent liabilities (subsidiaries and joint operations)
Contingent liabilities, indemnities and other performance guarantees were US$292 million at 30 June 
2016 (31 December 2015: US$226 million). 
 
Indemnities and other performance guarantees represent the potential outflow of funds from the Group for 
the satisfaction of obligations including those under contractual arrangements (for example undertakings 
related to supplier agreements) not provided for in the balance sheet, where the likelihood of the 
guarantees or indemnities being called is assessed as possible rather than probable or remote. There 
were no material contingent liabilities arising in relation to the Group’s joint ventures and associates. 
 
Marketing of iron ore is undertaken in the Singapore Commercial Centre by Rio Tinto Iron Ore Asia Pte 
Ltd (RTIOA), which is remunerated on an arm’s length basis by the Group’s iron ore product group. The 
arrangements are under review by the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Rio Tinto considers the arrangements 
to be in accordance with transfer pricing law, and will therefore vigorously defend its position in the event 
of any ATO challenge.  
 
The Group is subject to certain legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations arising out of the 
ordinary course of business. Legal proceedings include, but are not limited to, alleged breach of contract 
and alleged breach of environmental, competition, securities and health and safety laws. The Group may 
not be insured fully, or at all, in respect of such risks. The Group cannot predict the outcome of individual 
legal actions. The Group may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings prior to a final judgment or 
determination of liability. The Group may do so to avoid the cost, management efforts or negative 
business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing to contest liability, even when it believes 
it has valid defences to liability. The Group believes that no material loss to the Group is expected to 
result from these legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations.
Contingent assets
The Group has, from time to time various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers. These include a 
claim relating to the Manefay slide at Rio Tinto Kennecott in April 2013. An interim progress payment was 
received on this claim in 2013 and a second in 2015. Further receipts are considered possible but the 
amount cannot currently be reliably estimated.

Other disclosures (continued)
Related party matters
Purchases relate largely to amounts charged by equity accounted units for toll processing of alumina and 
purchases of bauxite and aluminium. Sales relate largely to charges for supply of coal to jointly controlled 
marketing entities for onward sale to third party customers. Details of the Group's principal equity 
accounted units are given in the 2015 Annual report.

Rio Tinto plc guarantees to pay the Rio Tinto Pension Fund (UK) any contributions due from Group 
companies participating in that fund, pro rata to its ownership of those companies and subject to certain 
conditions, in the event that the companies fail to meet their contribution requirements. Furthermore, Rio 
Tinto plc has in place a guarantee for the Rio Tinto Pension Fund, in the standard form required by the 
Pension Protection Fund ('PPF'), to cover 105 per cent of the Fund's liabilities measured on the PPF's 
prescribed assumptions. Other similar guarantees in place include a Rio Tinto plc guarantee to the Rio 
Tinto 2009 pension fund, with no limit on liabilities. 
 
In February 2011 an agreement between Alcan Holdings Switzerland and the Alcan Schweiz pension 
fund was executed whereby the funding deficit as at 31 December 2010 in relation to the pensioner 
population will be funded by Alcan Holdings Switzerland over a six year period.
Events after the balance sheet date 
 
No events were identified after the balance sheet date which could be expected to have a material impact 
on the consolidated preliminary financial information included in this report.
Page 52 of 62
Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this interim report have been 
prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard ('IAS') 34 'Interim financial reporting' as 
adopted by the European Union ('EU'), the Disclosure and Transparency Rules ('DTR') of the Financial 
Conduct Authority ('FCA') applicable to interim financial reporting and an Order under section 340 of the 
Australian Corporations Act 2001 issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 14 
December 2015. 
 
These condensed interim financial statements represent a ‘condensed set of financial statements’ as 
referred to in the DTR issued by the FCA. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required 
for a full annual financial report and are to be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 and any public announcements made by the Group 
during the interim reporting period. These annual financial statements were prepared on a going concern 
basis in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under International 
Financial Reporting Standards and in accordance with applicable UK law, applicable Australian law as 
amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 14 December 2015 and 
Article 4 of the European Union IAS regulation and with: 
 

International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) and interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(IFRS IC) both as adopted by the European Union and which were mandatory for EU reporting as at 
31 December 2015; and 
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB and interpretations issued from 
time to time by the IFRS IC which were mandatory as at 31 December 2015.

The condensed financial statements are unaudited and do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in 
Section 434 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. The financial information for the year to 31 
December 2015 included in this report has been extracted from the full financial statements filed with the 
Registrar of Companies and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The Auditors' report on these full financial statements was unqualified, did not 
include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis of matter and 
did not contain statements under section 498 (2) (regarding adequacy of accounting records and returns), 
or under section 498 (3) (regarding provision of necessary information and explanations) of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Page 53 of 62
Accounting policies
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been drawn up on the basis of accounting 
policies, methods of computation and presentation consistent with those applied in the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, and in the corresponding interim period, except for the 
adoption of a number of amendments issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') 
and endorsed by the EU which apply for the first time in 2016. This basis of accounting is referred to as 
‘IFRS’ in this report. The new pronouncements do not have a significant impact on the accounting 
policies, methods of computation or presentation applied by the Group and therefore the prior period 
consolidated financial statements have not been restated. The Group has not early adopted any 
amendments, standards or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective. 
  
The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty for the half year are the 
same as those disclosed in the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2015. 
  
The financial information by business unit and the geographic analysis of sales by destination provided on 
pages 10 to 13 and 45 of this press release respectively, satisfy the disclosure requirements of IFRS 8 
'Operating Segments' for interim financial statements and also provide additional voluntary disclosure 
which the Group considers is useful to the users of the financial statements.
Going concern
After making enquiries and having reassessed the principal risks, the directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the interim financial information.
Non-GAAP measures
The Group presents certain non-GAAP financial measures, including underlying earnings, which are 
reconciled to directly comparable IFRS financial measures on page 61 of this report. These non-GAAP 
measures are used internally by management to assess the performance of the business and may 
therefore be useful to investors. They are not a substitute for the IFRS measures and should be 
considered alongside those measures.
Page 54 of 62
Directors' statement of responsibility
In the directors' opinion: 
 
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements on pages 33 to 54 including the notes have 
been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the European 
Union, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules ('DTR') of the Financial Conduct Authority in the United 
Kingdom, applicable accounting standards and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as modified by an 
order of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued on 14 December 2015, using the 
most appropriate accounting policies for Rio Tinto's business and supported by reasonable and prudent 
judgements. 
 
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements give a true and fair view of the Rio Tinto 
Group's financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of its performance, as represented by the results of its 
operations, comprehensive income and expense and its cash flows for the six months then ended. 
There are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the Rio Tinto Group, Rio Tinto Limited and Rio 
Tinto plc will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable. 
 
The interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 and DTR 
4.2.8, namely: 
  an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on the
condensed set of consolidated financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and
  material related-party transactions in the first six months and any material changes in the related-
party transactions described in the last annual report.
Signed in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors.

Independent review report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to the members 
of Rio Tinto plc and PricewaterhouseCoopers to the members of Rio Tinto 
Limited
Introduction 
For the purpose of this report, the terms ‘we’ and ‘our’ denote PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in relation to 
UK legal, professional and regulatory responsibilities and reporting obligations to Rio Tinto plc and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers in relation to Australian legal, professional and regulatory responsibilities and 
reporting obligations to Rio Tinto Limited.
We have been engaged by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (the ‘Companies’) to review the interim 
financial information in the interim report of the Rio Tinto Group comprising the Companies and their 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (the ‘Group’) for the six months ended 30 June 2016, which 
comprises the Group income statement, Group statement of comprehensive income, Group cash flow 
statement, Group balance sheet, Group statement of changes in equity and related notes (including the 
financial information by business unit). We have read the other information contained in the interim report 
and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
information in the interim financial information.
PricewaterhouseCoopers has also reviewed the directors’ declaration set out on page 55 in relation to 
Australian regulatory requirements.
Directors' responsibilities 
The interim report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors of the Companies. The 
directors are responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and the Corporations Act 2001 
in Australia as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 14 
December 2015 (the ‘ASIC Order’ described in the Australian Corporations Act – Summary of ASIC relief) 
and for such internal control as the directors determine necessary to enable the preparation of the interim 
report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As disclosed in Note 1 Principal Accounting Policies of the 2015 Annual Report, the financial statements 
of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as 
adopted by the European Union. The interim financial information included in this interim report has been 
prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as 
adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s 
Financial Conduct Authority.
Our responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial information in the interim report 
based on our review. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have prepared this review report, including the 
conclusion, for and only for Rio Tinto plc for the purpose of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority and PricewaterhouseCoopers have prepared this review report, including the 
conclusion, for and only for Rio Tinto Limited for the purpose of the Corporations Act 2001 in Australia as 
amended by the ASIC Order and for no other purpose. We do not, in producing this report, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of review 
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and 
Ireland) ISRE 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom and the Auditing Standard on 
Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of 
the Entity. As the auditor of the Group, ISRE 2410 and ASRE 2410 require that we comply with the 
ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report.
A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) or Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to
Page 57 of 62
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence   
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 
2001 in Australia.
Conclusion of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for Rio Tinto plc 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial 
information in the interim report of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is not prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial 
Reporting as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United 
Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
Conclusion of PricewaterhouseCoopers for Rio Tinto Limited 
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us 
believe that the interim report of Rio Tinto Limited is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 in 
Australia as amended by the ASIC Order, including:
a)  giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of its
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
b)  complying with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as
adopted by the European Union and the Corporations Regulations 2001 in Australia.

Underlying earnings is reported by Rio Tinto to provide greater understanding of the underlying business 
performance of its operations. The measure of underlying earnings is used by the chief executive of Rio 
Tinto to assess the performance of the product groups. Underlying earnings and Net earnings both 
represent amounts attributable to owners of Rio Tinto.
The following items are excluded from net earnings in arriving at underlying earnings in each period 
irrespective of materiality:
– Net gains on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses.
– Impairment charges and reversals of cash generating units.
– Profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations.
– Certain exchange and derivative gains and losses (as defined in the table above).
Exclusions from underlying earnings relating to equity accounted units are stated after tax and included in 
the column 'Pre-tax'. Items (a) to (f) below are excluded from net earnings in arriving at underlying 
earnings.
(a)  Impairment charges during the period to 30 June 2015 included impairment at Energy Resources of
Australia, Carbone Savoie and other businesses in the Aluminium portfolio.
(b)  For the period to 30 June 2016, a pre-tax gain of US$410 million (post-tax US$268 million) was 
recognised by Rio Tinto on the sale of its 40 per cent interest in the Bengalla Joint Venture on 1 
March 2016. This was partially offset by a loss on disposal of the 100 per cent interest in Carbone 
Savoie on 31 March 2016. 
 
The 2015 net post-tax gains on disposal of interests in businesses of US$11 million relate mainly to 
Turquoise Hill Resources partial disposal of its shareholding in SouthGobi Resources.

Reconciliation of net earnings to underlying earnings (continued)
(c)  Valuation changes on currency and interest rate derivatives, which are ineligible for hedge
accounting, other than those embedded in commercial contracts, and the currency revaluation of 
embedded US dollar derivatives contained in contracts held by entities whose functional currency is 
not the US dollar.
(d)  Valuation changes on commodity derivatives, including those embedded in commercial contracts,
that are ineligible for hedge accounting, but for which there will be an offsetting change in future 
Group earnings.
(e)  A review of the infrastructure capacity requirements in Queensland, Australia, has confirmed that it is
no longer likely that Rio Tinto will utilise the Abbot Point Coal Terminal and associated rail 
infrastructure capacity contracted under take or pay arrangements.  Accordingly, an onerous contract 
provision has been recognised based on the net present value of expected future cash flows 
discounted at a post-tax real rate of two per cent, resulting in a post-tax onerous contract charge of 
US$496 million.
(f)  Other credits and charges that individually or in aggregate, if of a similar type, are of a nature or size
to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into business performance.
