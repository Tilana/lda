1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX.
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a corporate 
governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a statement is located. The 
corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate 
Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate 
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not 
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period.
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must 
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. The corporate governance 
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3.
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 which discloses the 
extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during a particular reporting period.
3 Mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web page, where the entity’s 
corporate governance statement can be found. You can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable.
Throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not applicable and just 
retain the option that is applicable. If you select an option that includes “OR” at the end of the selection and you delete the other options, you can 
also, if you wish, delete the “OR” at the end of the selection.

For the Year Ended 30 June 2016

The  objective  of  the  Board  of  Advanced  Nano  Technologies  Limited  (“the  Company”)  is  to  create  and 
deliver  long  term  shareholder  value  through  a  range  of  diversified  but  interrelated  activities  around  the 
manufacturing and distribution of zinc oxide dispersions, zinc oxide powder products, Alusion products and 
end formulation products through its ZinXation brand. 
 
Advanced Nano Technologies Limited and its subsidiaries operate as a consolidated entity under a unified 
Board and management. As such, the Board’s corporate governance arrangements apply to all entities with 
the Group (“the Group”). 
 
Principle 1: Lay solid foundations for management and oversight 
 
Role of the Board and Management 
 
The  Board of Directors  is  responsible  for  the  corporate  governance  of the  Company.  The  Board  provides 
strategic  guidance  for  the  Company,  and  effective  oversight  to  management.  The  Board  guides  and 
monitors the business and affairs of the Group on behalf of the shareholders by whom they are elected and 
to whom they are accountable. 
 
The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Board  (Board  Charter),  Board  Committees  and  senior  management 
have  been  established  through  Board  approved  Charters  that  are  available  in  the  Corporate  Governance 
section of the website at www.antaria.com. 
 
To assist it in carrying out its responsibilities, the Board has established several standing Board Committees 
of its members. The Chairman of each Board Committee reports on any matters of substance at the next 
full  Board  Meeting.  Membership  of  Board  Committees  and  attendance  at  Board  and  Board  Committee 
meetings is tabulated in the Directors’ Report in the Annual Report.

with approval from all Directors at a Director’s meeting. A copy of advice received by the Director is made 
available to all other members of the Board.

The Board is fully aware of the ASX Corporate Governance Council Principles and Recommendations, and 
the  reasons  behind  them.  However,  as  the  ASC  Corporate  Governance  Council  (“Council”)  expressly 
recognises,  different  entities  may  legitimately  adopt  different  governance  practices,  based  on  a  range  of 
factors, including their size, complexity, history and corporate culture. For that reason, the Principles and 
Recommendations  are  not  mandatory  and  do  not  seek  to  prescribe  the  corporate  governance  practices 
that a listed entity must adopt. 
 
The diversity and skill set of the Board, as set out in the skills matrix, highlights the level of industry and 
commercial  experience  currently  on  the  Board.  The  skills  matrix  of  the  Board  is  detailed  in  the  Board 
Charter on the Company’s website. 
 
The current Directors of the  Company are listed in the Directors’ Report with a brief description of their 
qualifications, experience, special responsibilities and status.

one of whom is independent:

Principle 3: Promote ethical and responsible decision-making 
 
Code of conduct 
 
The Company has a Code of Conduct which sets out the behaviour required of all Board members, senior 
management, employees and contractors.  The Code of Conduct is detailed on the website. 
 
Dealing in Advanced Nano Technologies Limited Shares 
 
The  Company’s  Securities  Trading  Policy,  which  can  be  found  on  our  website,  places  restrictions  on  the 
ability  of  Directors,  officers  and  employees  to  trade  in  the  Company’s  shares  whilst  in  the  possession  of 
price sensitive information that has not been made public. 
Ethical Standards 
 
The Board is committed to its core governance values of integrity, respect, trust and openness among and 
between Board members, management, employees, customers and suppliers. 
 
Principle 4: Safeguard integrity in financial reporting 
 
Audit and Risk Committee 
 
The Board has established an Audit and Risk Committee which operates under a charter approved by the 
Board. It is the Board’s responsibility to ensure that an effective internal control framework exists within 
the Group. 
 
The  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  Charter  sets  out  its  role,  responsibilities,  composition,  structure  and 
membership requirements and is posted on the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website. 
 
At  least  one  member  of  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  must  have  financial  expertise  (i.e.  is  a  qualified 
accountant or other financial professional with expertise in financial and accounting matters). 
 
The  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  comprises  of  a  minimum  of  three  non-executive  Board  members,  one  of 
whom is independent. The Audit and Risk Committee is chaired by a non-executive Director, who is not the 
Chairman of the Board. 
 
The members of the Audit and Risk Committee  were:
  Geoff Acton (Chairman) 
  Rade Dudurovic 
Lev Mizikovsky  

The names and qualifications of those appointed to the Audit and Risk Committee and their attendance at 
meetings of the committee are included in the Director’s Report. 
 
The Audit and Risk Committee meets at least twice a year with the auditors.  The Audit and Risk Committee 
met three times during the year. 
 
Under  the  ASX  Principles  and  Recommendations,  if  the  board  of  a  listed  entity  considers  that  a 
recommendation is not appropriate to its particular circumstances, it is entitled not to adopt it. If it does so, 
the Board should explain why it has not adopted the recommendation – the “if not, why not” approach. In 
respect  of  Mr  Acton’s  appointment  as  chair  of  the  Audit  Committee,  the  Board,  considering  all  the 
circumstances  at  the  time,  determined  that  Mr  Acton  was  the  most  appropriately  qualified  and  suitable 
person to fill that role. Based on the financial resources of the Company, its small size, and coupled with the 
wealth  of  accounting  and  audit  experience  that  Mr  Acton  brings  to  the  Board  it  was  determined  by  the

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Board that  it was  appropriate  not  to adopt the ASX Principles and Recommendations so far as having an 
Independent Chair of the Audit Committee is concerned. 
 
External Auditors 
 
The  Company  and  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  policy  is  to  engage  auditors  who  clearly  demonstrate 
independence. 
 
The  performance  of  the  external  auditors  is  reviewed  annually.    External  auditors  will  be  available  to 
answer questions at the Annual General Meeting. 
 
For the Year End Financial Report the General Manager has provided:
  A written declaration regarding the integrity of the financial statements of the Company. 
  Assurance that the Company’s risk management and internal compliance and control systems are
operating effectively in all material respects.
Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure 
 
A  continuous  disclosure  regime  operates  throughout  the  Group.  Policies  and  Procedures  are  in  place  to 
ensure  matters  that  a  person  could  reasonably  expect  to  have  a  material  effect  on  the  share  price  are 
announced to the ASX in a timely manner. 
 
These  policies  and  procedures  have  been  formally  communicated  to  all  relevant  staff.  The  Company 
Secretary is the nominated Continuous Disclosure Officer. The Board approves, or is advised of, all releases 
that are made to the ASX.

Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk 
 
The  Board  has  ultimate  responsibility  for  risk  management,  compliance  and  control  functions  across  the 
Group.  These  functions  are  aligned  with  the  Company’s  business  objectives.  The  Company  has  in  place 
internal controls intended to identify and manage significant business risks.
