<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in accordance

</b></p>
<p><b>I.  SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 8th meeting, on 7 May 2009, the Deputy Minister of Justice<b> </b>opened his statement 
by referring to Afghanistan&#8217;s State report, prepared in a participatory process based on principles 
of transparency, participation, responsibility, accountability, nondiscrimination and 
inclusiveness. His delegation included representatives from law enforcement institutions, 
national human rights watch agencies and civil society.   
</p>
<p>6. Following almost three decades of war and disorder, Afghanistan&#8217;s legal, political, social 
and cultural infrastructure is weakened. Nevertheless, in direct cooperation with the international 
community, Afghanistan managed to make a number of important achievements, including the 
adoption of the 2004 Constitution which laid the foundation of Afghanistan&#8217;s legal framework. It 
bound the Government to monitor and observe the Charter of the United Nations, the 
International Declaration of Human Rights, international treaties and human rights conventions 
ratified by Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation provided additional information on measures taken to enhance the 
professional capacity of national human rights institutions, the efforts made to entrench human 
rights and challenges encountered.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8. The Supreme Court has trained some 800 judges on fair trial and more then 750 modern 
and Sharia law graduates have been employed in the justice sector. Lack of security remains the 
main challenge for courts and judges. The Ministry of Justice<b> </b>has established the Bar Association 
and registered 102 political parties and 1,348 social organizations. However, despite these efforts 
some problems remain, including the failure to meet human rights standards inside the prisons. 
The Attorney-General&#8217;s Office faces problems due to lack of availability of lawyers especially in 
the provinces, lack of security for prosecutors, shortage of technical equipment during 
investigation, interference of powerful people and low salary levels for prosecutors. The 
Ministry of the Interior has made efforts in training the Afghan National Police to protect human 
rights in discharging its duties. Nevertheless, a number of complaints show that further work is 
needed in this area.  
</p>
<p>9. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) with support from 
the Government has been able to monitor prisons and detention centres without prior notice. In 
agreement with a number of international military forces it has also able to monitor the situation 
of Afghans detained accused of having links with terrorists. A number of additional, specialized 
commissions have been established recently to ensure security of human rights, including  the 
anti-corruption and civil administration reform commission, commission to address capital 
punishment cases, board for addressing complaints of prisoners transferred from Bagram airbase 
and Guantanamo prison, board for addressing the situation of prisoners in Kabul&#8217;s main prisons 
and detention centres, and commission for elimination of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>10. Civil society plays an important role in conducting research on different human rights 
issues.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation mentioned some of the most important national policies and strategies 
adopted to systematically support human rights, including the Afghan National Development 
Strategy approved by the President on 21 April 2008.   
</p>
<p>12. The Transitional Justice Strategy and Action Plan on Peace, Justice and Reconciliation 
was adopted in 2005.  With regard to implementation of transitional justice, judicial actions were 
not taken due to lack of suitable conditions, for example, insecurity, lack of required capacity in 
the Government and the influence of powerful violators of human rights.  
</p>
<p>13. The delegation provided further information regarding measures for social protection. 
The Government was providing shelter to 9,312 orphan children in 54 orphanages, a total of 362 
kindergartens were fully functional throughout the country. Concerning the right to food and to 
an adequate standard of living and shelter, in 2005, 44 per cent of Afghans lived under the 
poverty line, and 75 per cent did not have food security. The Ministry of Agriculture has 
developed a special food security programme in May 2008. Additionally, the rapid growth of 
urban dwellings, the return of new groups of refugees and internally displaced people, the 
expansion of poverty and slums in the cities put the Government in a difficult situation when 
considering citizen&#8217;s right to shelter.  
</p>
<p>14. Achievements in the last seven years on the right to health included a reduction in 
mortality rate of children under five. Health service coverage increased to 85 per cent of the 
population through 1,688 functioning medical facilities. Yet, malnutrition remained one of the 
most challenging public health issues.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15. On the right to education, the delegation provided information on some positive 
developments. In 2008 more than 6 million students attended schools, one third of whom were 
girls with 15,842 attending schools in rural areas. Adult literacy courses for women had opened 
all over the country. However, major challenges remained, including the destruction of schools 
by armed anti-Government forces, the shortage of qualified teachers particularly in rural areas, 
the shortage of financial and technical resources and low salaries for teachers.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation pointed out that ensuring the right to life of citizens has been one of the 
biggest challenges. It is often violated through civilian casualties and suicide bombings.  
</p>
<p>17. Concerning media and freedom of expression, the delegation explained that there were 
three national and 21 local television stations in the country, only one was State-run. Some 57 
radio stations operated throughout the country and hundreds of newspapers and pamphlets 
published in an environment free of fear and censorship. He noted some of the main challenges, 
such as the lack of professionalism in some journalistic circles and the intimidation of journalists 
by armed anti-Government forces.  
</p>
<p>18. Regarding efforts in the area of non-discrimination and equality, over the last seven years 
Afghanistan made some major achievements in ensuring women&#8217;s rights, including the 
formation of the Ministry of Women Affairs. Twenty-eight per cent of the National Assembly 
members were women, the highest proportion in the region. However, due to insecurity in some 
provinces, a culture of immunity from punishment, low awareness of women&#8217;s rights, 
particularly among women themselves, old and harmful superstitious customs and lack of job 
opportunities were among the most pressing challenges.  
</p>
<p>19. Reference was made to measures taken concerning the rights of minorities, human 
trafficking and the rights of the child. Afghanistan has about 1,000,000 disabled persons. The 
Government cannot extend sufficient assistance to them due to lack of resources and facilities. 
However, the Law on the rights and benefits of disabled people and the Law on victims of war 
and their families have been adopted.  
</p>
<p>20. Currently a total of 3.3 million Afghans live in neighboring countries. The Government 
has made efforts to alleviate the situation but success depends on the level of cooperation by the 
host countries.  
</p>
<p>21. The delegation considered that<b> </b>the UPR State reporting process provided a unique 
opportunity to highlight the achievements and the challenges of human rights in Afghanistan and 
a good opportunity for the international community and other human rights actors in the world to 
put the situation of Afghanistan in a realistic comparative analytical perspective and consider its 
problems and challenges.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>22. During the interactive dialogue 59 delegations made statements<b>. </b>A number of delegations 
appreciated the balanced report prepared by Afghanistan, indicating, inter alia, progress made 
and remaining constraints and challenges.   
</p>
<p>23. Algeria expressed concern about the situation of civilians affected by armed conflict,

recommendations concerning: the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, achieving </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the national development strategy, and seeking assistance for report preparation and achieving 
the MDGs. 
</p>
<p>24. Qatar<b> </b>noted that human rights in Afghanistan are guaranteed by a number of political and 
judicial mechanisms and that the Constitution ensures the rights and freedoms of citizens. 
Afghanistan ratified most of the core human rights conventions and attaches great importance to 
the protection of minorities and the development of rural areas. Noting that grave challenges face 
the country, Qatar asked about the priorities of the Government to build the capacities in the field 
of human rights, about the legal basis for the judiciary and to what extent the judiciary respects 
human rights norms. 
</p>
<p>25. India<b> </b>noted that much more needed to be done, especially in capacity building, improving 
civilian oversight of security forces, enhancing justice administration and combating adverse 
social practices against women and children. Pointing out its USD 1.2 billion assistance since 
2002, crucial in the fulfilment of basic human rights in Afghanistan, India noted its serious 
concern at increasing terrorist activities by Taliban that targeted development efforts by the 
international community, like the attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul in July 2008.

discrimination against women are still persistent. The growing number of IDPs and returnees is

progress in the area of governance and towards the achievement of the MDG targets in health 
and education were encouraging. Afghanistan&#8217;s joining the South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation in April 2007 was a natural extension of historical linkages and regional 
cultural affinities.

measures of this process are, and what kind of assistance and support Afghanistan would like to 
receive from the international community. 
</p>
<p>75. Maldives noted the efforts of Afghanistan such as the ratification of a Constitution that 
embodies the fundamental human rights; the establishment of AIHRC; ratification of six 
international human rights instruments; reopening of schools and providing educational 
opportunities for 6 million students in 2008/2009; and the formation of a Ministry of women&#8217;s 
Affairs for effective implementation of CEDAW and active participation of women in politics, 
the judiciary and social economic and cultural spheres. It acknowledged the positive engagement 
of Afghanistan with OHCHR, the special procedures, UNHCR and other United Nations 
agencies.  
</p>
<p>76. Argentina noted progress in the human rights field as well as some concerns and made a 
number of recommendations. It noted that, according to the national report, there are serious 
inadequacies in the judicial system and that the Government has not replied to any 
communications transmitted by special procedures.  
</p>
<p>77. Jordan said that Afghanistan continues to take steps to effectively address many political, 
economic and social problems as well as to improve the human rights situation. Jordan made a 
number of recommendations to Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>78. Japan noted that anti-corruption measures should be strengthened and the security 
situation improved. Japan noted that the re-examination of the Shia Personal Status Law is now 
being carried out and hoped the proposed legislation is appropriately received in a way </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>consistent with the promotion and protection of human rights, especially those of women. Japan 
made a number of recommendations to Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>79. The Czech Republic recognized the utmost importance of the election processes and 
made a number of recommendations, including on  torture, arbitrary detention and human rights 
abuses by security forces. 
</p>
<p>80. Greece noted that the intensification of the conflict and the lack of infrastructures and 
facilities in rural areas constitute an obstacle to the realization of the right to education. 
Furthermore, it referred with concern to the increase in the number of child victims resulting 
from attacks against schools by insurgents. Greece made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>81. Albania<b> </b>noted with satisfaction the creation of special committees responsible for 
monitoring the human rights situation in Afghanistan, including six commissions in charge of 
assuring the respect of human rights during investigations, interrogations and detention. In 
Afghan prisons, the commissions examine the problems of children and youth, death penalty 
cases, detainee complaints and the elimination of violence against women. Albania also 
expressed concern about the situation of Afghan women and made a recommendation in that 
regard.  
</p>
<p>82. Addressing the concerns expressed regarding the Shia Personal Status Law, the 
Afghanistan delegation stated that the President ordered the review of the law, which will be 
done in consultation with the international community in order to make it consistent with 
Afghanistan&#8217;s international commitments. 
</p>
<p>83. The existing law, which complies with all international commitments, and has been 
enforced for the last four years, removed all restrictions on freedom of expression. The new press 
law also remained consistent international commitments. Its implementation has been delayed 
due to some technicalities. 
</p>
<p>84. With regard to the moratorium on executions, the delegation said that Afghanistan&#8217;s 
criminal law recognized the death penalty as did the law of other Islamic countries. However, the 
penalty is rarely applied; it can only be applied after the decision of the trial court and two stages 
of appellate courts, including the Supreme Court. The application of the sentence further requires 
the consent of the President, who scrutinizes the whole case with the intention of finding reason 
to commute the sentence.  
</p>
<p>85. The delegation noted that UNAMA was assisting in the process of establishing the 
Human Rights Unit in the Ministry of Justice. This unit will gather information on human rights 
from other ministries and localities and monitor the Government&#8217;s implementation of human 
rights principles.  
</p>
<p>86. The delegation indicated that new prisons would be built by 2012 to improve prison 
conditions and the treatment of prisoners. About $10 million has been allocated to implement the 
new reform.   
</p>
<p>87. While laws drafted under the present Government were consistent with human rights 
standards, resources and personnel were needed to review earlier laws to ensure their conformity 
with international commitments.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>88. The delegation noted that Afghanistan acceded to the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption in 2003 and that the fight against corruption is mainstreamed in the work of 
Government.  A special unit and prosecutor&#8217;s office has been established to fight corruption.  
The Government is committed to the protection and promotion of women&#8217;s rights and has 
established a National Action Plan for Women to promote gender equality and enforce gender 
mainstreaming in governmental institutions. The Ministry of Women provides capacity-building 
classes, microcredit opportunities and literacy classes. Afghan women participate in 34 
provincial councils and are active members of various political parties. Additionally, AIHRC is 
currently headed by a woman. Initial steps have been taken to prepare an initial report for the 
Committee on Discrimination against Women.   
</p>
<p>89. The delegation of Afghanistan responded to the observations of the Philippines and New 
Zealand, noting that article 52 of the Constitution stresses the right to health. The Government 
has the obligation to provide free health care and the Ministry of Health is authorized to ensure 
medical and preventive measures for public safety. Several strategies and public-private 
partnerships further this aim. Between 2004 and 2008, approximately 148 policy guidelines, 
laws, regulations and protocols were developed, applying to different aspects of health. 
Afghanistan&#8217;s achievements in the years following the Taliban&#8217;s rule have resulted in reduced 
mortality rates of children under 5 years of age (from 257 in 2001 to 191 in 2007), the expansion 
of public service coverage (from 9 per cent in 2001 to 85 per cent in 2007) and expansion of 
immunization to cover 83 per cent of the population.  The Government stressed that the top 
health priority now is to improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality. 
</p>
<p>90. In response to the observation made by Morocco, Afghanistan referred to the water law 
and the establishment of a programme to provide safe drinking water for 15 million people for 5 
years. Concerning people with HIV/AIDS, the delegation indicated that there are 556 cases in 
the country and the Government has established counselling programs, testing and treatment 
centres, drop-in programmes, outreach programmes and a strong effort to raise awareness among 
community and health workers. 
</p>
<p>91. Various reform processes are under way to improve of performance of the police.  Due to 
30 years of war and the existence of layers of laws and practices inherited from various regimes, 
some laws might not conform to international human rights standards. The delegation 
emphasized that all police officers are expected to respect human rights and follow the rule of 
law and that the in-service training provided to them at all training centres and schools 
emphasize these expectations. When a complaint is filed alleging violation of human rights by 
police officers, the case is referred to the Inspector-General who investigates the charges. If 
evidence of misconduct is found, penalties are imposed.   
</p>
<p>92. The Inspector-General reports directly to the Minister of the Interior and has a human 
rights unit in headquarters and human rights offices in the provinces to ensure proper police 
conduct across the country.  
</p>
<p>93. Since March 2008 private security companies are subject to administrative regulations. 
There are currently 39 legally registered companies regulated under this law. The remaining 
private security companies are considered illegal armed groups and are being disarmed. A draft 
law seeking to strengthen regulation of private security forces is being debated in Parliament. 
</p>
<p>94. The delegation emphasized that the Afghan Constitution prohibits torture under any 
circumstances. If a court were to discover that an admission were obtained under torture, that </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>admission would be considered invalid and those who commit an act of torture would face 
prosecution. The Government further mentioned that it has received the support of international 
donors to set up legal aid programmes and offices in different provinces in Afghanistan. The 
delegation concluded its intervention by thanking the Council for the opportunity to discuss 
human rights developments and challenges facing Afghanistan and stressed the Government&#8217;s 
determination to improve the human rights situation with the assistance of the international 
community.<b>
