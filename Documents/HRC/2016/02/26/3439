 Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism and, in 
</p>
<p>that regard, calls upon States and other relevant actors, as appropriate, to continue to 
</p>
<p>implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its four pillars, 
</p>
<p>which reaffirm, inter alia, respect for human rights for all and the rule of law to be the 
</p>
<p>fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism;  </p>
<p> 4.  <i>Deeply deplores</i> the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their 
</p>
<p>families, and expresses its profound solidarity with them, and stresses the importance of 
</p>
<p>providing them with proper support and assistance; <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 5. <i>Welcomes</i> the holding, on 1 June 2011 and pursuant to decision 16/116 of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, of a panel discussion on the issue of human rights of victims of 
</p>
<p>terrorism, which raised awareness on the importance of addressing the human rights of 
</p>
<p>victims of terrorism in the determined effort by the international community to deal with 
</p>
<p>the scourge of terrorism and as part of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy that 
</p>
<p>respects human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Reaffirms</i> that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
</p>
<p>religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group; 
</p>

</p>
<p>Rights Council in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>while countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p> 8.<i>  Acknowledges</i> that the active participation of civil society can reinforce 
</p>
<p>ongoing governmental efforts to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
</p>
<p>countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to ensure that any person 
</p>
<p>whose human rights or fundamental freedoms have been violated has access to an effective 
</p>
<p>remedy and that victims will receive adequate, effective and prompt reparations where 
</p>
<p>appropriate, including by bringing to justice those responsible for such violations;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to protect all human rights, 
</p>
<p>including economic, social and cultural rights, bearing in mind that certain counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism measures may have an impact on the enjoyment of those rights;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to safeguard the right to 
</p>
<p>privacy in accordance with international law, and urges them to take measures to ensure 
</p>
<p>that interferences with the right to privacy are regulated by law, subject to effective 
</p>
<p>oversight and appropriate redress, including through judicial review or other means; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Notes with concern</i> measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of 
</p>
<p>law, such as the detention of persons suspected of acts of terrorism in the absence of a legal 
</p>
<p>basis for detention and due process guarantees, the unlawful deprivation of the right to life, 
</p>
<p>the deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of 
</p>
<p>the law, the trial of suspects without fundamental judicial guarantees, the illegal deprivation 
</p>
<p>of liberty and transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activities, and the return of 
</p>
<p>suspects to countries without individual assessment of the risk of there being substantial 
</p>
<p>grounds for believing that they would be in danger of subjection to torture, and limitations 
</p>
<p>to effective scrutiny of counter-terrorism measures;   
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Stresses</i> that all measures used in the fight against terrorism, including the 
</p>
<p>profiling of individuals and the use of diplomatic assurances, memorandums of 
</p>
<p>understanding and other transfer agreements or arrangements, must be in compliance with 
</p>
<p>the obligations of States under international law, including international human rights, 
</p>
<p>refugee and humanitarian law; </p>


<p> 14. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to respect the rights to be equal 
</p>
<p>before the courts and tribunals and to a fair trial, as provided for by international law, 
</p>
<p>including international human rights law, such as article 14 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee 
</p>
<p>law;  
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Reiterates</i> the concerns expressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 
</p>
<p>64/168 with regard to measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of law, and 
</p>
<p>urges all States to take all necessary steps to ensure that persons deprived of their liberty, 
</p>
<p>regardless of the place of arrest or detention, enjoy the guarantees to which they are entitled 
</p>
<p>under international law, including the review of their detention and other fundamental 
</p>
<p>judicial guarantees;

</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism;1

</p>
<p> 19. <i>Requests</i> all States to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the 
</p>
<p>performance of the tasks and duties mandated, including by reacting promptly to the urgent 
</p>
