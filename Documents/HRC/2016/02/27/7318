<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions conducted 
</p>
<p>an official visit to Papua New Guinea from 3 to 14 March 2014. This report presents his 
</p>
<p>main findings and proposes recommendations to ensure better protection of the right to life 
</p>
<p>in Papua New Guinea.  
</p>
<p>Many formal steps have already been taken to ensure the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>and the right to life in Papua New Guinea, but they are not properly implemented.  
</p>
<p>A package of reforms is required; a piecemeal approach will not work. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recommends, inter alia, that Papua New Guinea establish: a national human 
</p>
<p>rights institution which could help to facilitate the introduction of human rights in school 
</p>
<p>curricula and police training; a centre for human rights within the University of Papua New 
</p>
<p>Guinea; and witness and victim protection programmes; as well as encourage the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a human rights-focused non-governmental organization. Also, a larger and 
</p>
<p>better trained police force would strengthen the certainty of conviction for criminal 
</p>
<p>offences, which, in turn, would contribute to countering calls for the reintroduction of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Papua New Guinea, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions conducted an official visit to the country 
</p>
<p>from 3 to 14 March 2014. The aim of the visit was to examine the level of protection of the 
</p>
<p>right to life in Papua New Guinea, including government efforts to prevent unlawful 
</p>
<p>killings and to ensure justice and redress in such cases. The report focuses on the situation 
</p>
<p>at the time of the visit and reference is made to subsequent developments. The draft report 
</p>
<p>was sent to the Government on 6 February 2015. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Papua New Guinea for its 
</p>
<p>invitation and for the open cooperation and support provided during his visit by officials 
</p>
<p>from the Department of Foreign Affairs, particularly, the late Dennis Bebego, former 
</p>
<p>Acting Director-General of the Multilateral Development and Cooperation Division. He is 
</p>
<p>also grateful to the United Nations Country Team, in particular, the Resident Coordinator 
</p>
<p>and the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR) in Papua New Guinea for their invaluable support during both the preparation 
</p>
<p>and conduct of his visit. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Port Moresby (National Capital District), Goroka 
</p>
<p>(Eastern Highlands Province), Kundiawa (Simbu Province), Lae (Morobe Province), 
</p>
<p>Manus Island and Buka (Autonomous Region of Bougainville). He met with the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice and Attorney-General, the Minister of Police, secretaries, commissioners and high-
</p>
<p>level officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Constabulary (RPNGC) and the Office of the Public Prosecutor. He also met with the Chief 
</p>
<p>Justice, the Public Solicitor and the Chief Ombudsman, and held discussions with the judge 
</p>
<p>in charge of the Human Rights Track of the National Court. In the provinces and the 
</p>
<p>Autonomous Region of Bougainville, he met with governors, provincial administrators, 
</p>
<p>provincial police commanders, other police force officials, representatives of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the Public Prosecutor and the Office of the Public Solicitor, and judges, magistrates and 
</p>
<p>clerks of the National Court, district courts and village courts. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>visited the Regional Processing Centre on Manus Island and the Barawagi Prison in Simbu.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations (NGOs), human rights defenders, academics, as well as victims of 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and their relatives. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses regret that no official of the private security firm 
</p>
<p>G4S was available to meet with him in Port Moresby and Manus Island, and that he was not 
</p>
<p>given the opportunity to meet with asylum seekers at the Manus Island Regional Processing 
</p>
<p>Centre &#8212; the Australian government offshore immigration detention and processing centre. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>6. Papua New Guinea faces a high level of violence, which often has lethal 
</p>
<p>consequences. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to build a robust and 
</p>
<p>effective system to break the cycle of violence and to take measures to protect the right to 
</p>
<p>life.  
</p>
<p>7. The authorities must have the political will to make significant strides to protect 
</p>
<p>human rights, including the right to life. Although there are many challenges, during his 
</p>
<p>visit, the Special Rapporteur identified some positive factors. 
</p>
<p>8. Those factors include the fact that:  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b> 
</p>
<p>(a) The Constitution and legal system provide strong protection, at the formal 
</p>
<p>level, for civil and political rights, coupled with remarkably open provisions and procedures 
</p>
<p>on legal standing; 
</p>
<p>(b) The judiciary is well-respected; 
</p>
<p>(c) A significant percentage of government and other officials and leaders is 
</p>
<p>open to moving forward the protection of human rights in the country; 
</p>
<p>(d) The country has a strong development trajectory and potentially an important 
</p>
<p>role to play in the broader regional arena; and 
</p>
<p>(e) The Government has recognized and acknowledged the need for change; the 
</p>
<p>current challenge is implementation. 
</p>
<p>9. Papua New Guinea has immense natural resources that are increasingly being 
</p>
<p>exploited as the driver of one of the fastest growing economies in the world.1 The country is 
</p>
<p>becoming increasingly integrated into and asserting itself in the international economy. 
</p>
<p>Internal and external pressure to follow and uphold international human rights standards is 
</p>
<p>increasing. Now is the time to set a solid framework for sustained growth and an inclusive 
</p>
<p>society, based on human dignity and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>10. A piecemeal approach that addresses only parts of the system will not suffice. 
</p>
<p>Rather, a visionary and comprehensive process, driven by the leaders of Papua New 
</p>
<p>Guinea, with the support of the international community is needed. No single reform 
</p>
<p>measure that is currently being implemented by the Government, or proposed in this report, 
</p>
<p>can take Papua New Guinea society forward on its own; a number of steps must be taken 
</p>
<p>simultaneously in order for the synergy to make a difference. 
</p>
<p>11. It is particularly important to ensure that the institutions and procedures required to 
</p>
<p>steer Papua New Guinea society in the right direction are in place. While some such 
</p>
<p>institutions and procedures already exist, most are weak or lacking. The Government is 
</p>
<p>taking steps to strengthen key institutions, including the judiciary, the police and national 
</p>
<p>oversight mechanisms, and those efforts should be continued. 
</p>
<p>12. Several interlocutors indicated that progress has begun in the area of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, owing to concerted joint efforts of activists, government officials and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. Although the level of domestic violence remains high, legislative and 
</p>
<p>structural developments, such as family sexual violence units in police stations, family 
</p>
<p>support centres in hospitals and various awareness-raising campaigns, provide national 
</p>
<p>leadership in effecting behavioural change.  
</p>
<p>13. Although the mandate of the Special Rapporteur focuses on a particularly dark side 
</p>
<p>of society, the purpose of the mandate is to facilitate a process of comprehensive change 
</p>
<p>which, in the case of Papua New Guinea, is both necessary and achievable with adequate 
</p>
<p>political leadership. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Systemic challenges  
</b></p>
<p>14. At around seven million, the population of Papua New Guinea is relatively low for 
</p>
<p>such a large landmass.2 The population is predominantly rural (only 13 per cent 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See www.businessinsider.com/worlds-fastest-economies-2012-10?op=1. 
</p>
<p> 2 See http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL; and http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ 
</p>
<p>EN.POP.DNST?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=asc. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>urbanization) and fragmented,3 and the level of literacy is around 63 per cent.4 A large part 
</p>
<p>of the country is difficult to reach and many communities are mostly closed to the outside 
</p>
<p>world. The country has more than 800 distinct languages and over 200 cultural groups. 
</p>
<p>15. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur encountered numerous references to the role 
</p>
<p>of the &#8220;wantok&#8221; system in Papua New Guinea society. &#8220;Wantokism&#8221; is the social glue, the 
</p>
<p>kinship of people from the same clan or group, whose customs are often stronger than that 
</p>
<p>of the law and the State, particularly in remote areas of the country, where the presence of 
</p>
<p>State institutions is limited. 
</p>
<p>16. There were also many references to the practice of &#8220;payback&#8221; between individuals 
</p>
<p>or groups which often result in killings. &#8220;Payback&#8221; is an act of retaliation carried out 
</p>
<p>usually by a group whose members have been harmed on the individual, his or her relatives 
</p>
<p>or group that perpetrated the harm. In many cases, the harm is considered resolved once the 
</p>
<p>perpetrator has paid a financial compensation to the family of the victim, which may, in 
</p>
<p>some instances, benefit only the family and not the victim or society at large. In the context 
</p>
<p>of the right to life, the practice of payback can lead to impunity in the case of murder.  
</p>
<p>17. Impunity is further enhanced by the fact that many payback cases are not reported, 
</p>
<p>due to the sense of solidarity among the group, so that a member may not report the acts of 
</p>
<p>other members of the group or testify against them. Witnesses are often reluctant to testify  
</p>
<p>out of fear of retaliation from within the group. The police, prosecutors and local 
</p>
<p>magistrates are part of their own group, outside of their careers, and can be influenced or 
</p>
<p>pressured in their professional duties. 
</p>
<p>18. Of special importance to the right to life is the strong belief in the power of the 
</p>
<p>supernatural, particularly sorcery and witchcraft, among large parts of the population and 
</p>
<p>the consequent perceived need to defend oneself and one&#8217;s group against such powers &#8212; 
</p>
<p>often by using deadly force. 
</p>
<p>19. Papua New Guinea is in many ways a country of paradoxes. Although there are 
</p>
<p>many challenges, positive elements, such as the close ties that bind people, respect for each 
</p>
<p>other and commitment to the common good must be recognized and acknowledged. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Use of force by the police 
</b></p>
<p>20. The right to life is protected in section 35 of the 1975 Constitution of the 
</p>
<p>Independent State of Papua New Guinea. However, section 35 also provides that the right 
</p>
<p>to life may be limited in certain circumstances, including as the result of the use of force 
</p>
<p>that is reasonable in the circumstances of the case and is permitted by any other law: for the 
</p>
<p>defence of any person from violence; to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a 
</p>
<p>lawfully detained person; to suppress a riot, an insurrection or a mutiny; to prevent a person 
</p>
<p>from committing an offence; to suppress piracy or terrorism or similar acts; or as a result of 
</p>
<p>a lawful act of war. Section 35 expressly states that the use of reasonable force in the 
</p>
<p>aforementioned scenarios does not absolve anyone from any liability in respect of killing 
</p>
<p>another. 
</p>
<p>21. Section 14 (1) (c) of the Arrest Act, 1977, enables authorized persons to use all 
</p>
<p>reasonable means to effect an arrest where a suspect resists arrest. However, section 14 (2) 
</p>
<p>limits the use of force to that which is reasonable in the circumstances, and any force 
</p>
<p>greater than what is reasonable is not justified. Similar provisions are contained in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 See http://apps.who.int/gho/data/?theme=country&amp;vid=15600.  
</p>
<p> 4 See http://apps.who.int/gho/data/?theme=country&amp;vid=15600. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 </b> 
</p>
<p>section 16 (1) (b) and (2) of the Act, which relate to private citizens effecting arrests, and 
</p>
<p>section 17 (1) (b) and (2), which concern the duties of a policeman after an arrest. 
</p>
<p>Sections 16 and 17 of the Arrest Act provide that when a private citizen or policeman 
</p>
<p>arrests a suspect, the suspect must be taken to a police station and only force that is 
</p>
<p>reasonable in the circumstances may be used to prevent the suspect from escaping. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the excessive use of force is outlawed by section 281 of the Criminal Code Act, 
</p>
<p>1974, which proscribes &#8220;the use of more force than is justified by law under the 
</p>
<p>circumstances&#8221;, including in circumstances where force is lawfully used. International law 
</p>
<p>clearly states that only such force as is necessary and proportionate to the circumstances 
</p>
<p>may be used and, in extreme circumstances, intentional lethal force may only be used 
</p>
<p>where it is absolutely necessary in order to protect life. Those provisions are open to 
</p>
<p>different interpretations. 
</p>
<p>22. During his meeting with the Police Commissioner of RPNGC, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed that new standing orders had been developed and would soon be 
</p>
<p>issued. The Police Commissioner indicated that a copy of the orders would be forwarded to 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur to analyse its compliance with international standards. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has not yet received a copy of the new orders. While new standing orders are 
</p>
<p>important, the ultimate test will be their impact.  
</p>
<p>23. From interviews with the police and members of the public, it appears that neither 
</p>
<p>the police nor the public has a clear idea of when police officers are allowed to fire live 
</p>
<p>ammunition. Several allegations have been made of police using excessive force against 
</p>
<p>suspects during arrest, interrogation and pretrial detention, and when carrying out raids of 
</p>
<p>illegal informal settlements. The Special Rapporteur was deeply concerned at reports that 
</p>
<p>police officers who use excessive force which results in death are rarely disciplined, 
</p>
<p>suspended from office or prosecuted in court.  
</p>
<p>24. Another area of concern is the treatment of individuals in police custody. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was alerted to cases where police had brought wounded individuals to 
</p>
<p>police lock-ups and failed to provide them with medical assistance. It seems that, in 
</p>
<p>practice, proper records are often not kept of who are held in the cells, why they are held, 
</p>
<p>for how long and their medical conditions. The Papua New Guinea authorities are required 
</p>
<p>to ensure the protection of persons in custody as States are held to a high level of diligence 
</p>
<p>to protect the lives of detainees and must take adequate measures to do so.5 It is hoped that 
</p>
<p>the new cell management system will bring some relief. 
</p>
<p>25. It is widely perceived that police in Papua New Guinea are prone to using high 
</p>
<p>levels of unwarranted force. Several reasons were put forward, including poor working and 
</p>
<p>living conditions of the police; understaffing; the perception by police that they must assert 
</p>
<p>themselves in a violent environment; cases of misuse of the wantok system where police 
</p>
<p>officers may use their position to protect their relatives; corruption; low remuneration; lack 
</p>
<p>of training on human rights standards regarding the use of force; and lack of accountability. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur heard the testimony of one individual who was accused by the 
</p>
<p>Commander of a police station in the area of performing sorcery, which killed the 
</p>
<p>Commander&#8217;s son. The Commander allegedly carried out a series of attacks, which 
</p>
<p>destroyed four of the accused&#8217;s houses. 
</p>
<p>26. It is alleged that many police officers have at least one firearm in their possession at 
</p>
<p>all times, even when off duty. The RPNGC Administrative Review Committee raised 
</p>
<p>concern about this in its September 2004 report. It stated that the rules and regulations for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 See Human Rights Committee, communication No. 84/1981, <i>Dermit Barbato </i>v.<i> Uruguay</i>, 
</p>
<p>Communication no. 84/1981, Views adopted on 21 October 1982, para. 9.2.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the storage and handling of firearms were clear and adequate, but were not being enforced. 
</p>
<p>It recommended that the relevant rules and regulations be enforced and that supervisors be 
</p>
<p>held personally responsible for enforcing them. It also recommended that firearms be stored 
</p>
<p>in secure armouries and that it should be an offence for police to carry a firearm while off 
</p>
<p>duty.6 However, those recommendations do not seem to have been implemented. 
</p>
<p>27. There seems to be widespread perception among the police that human rights and 
</p>
<p>policing are on opposing sides, instead of an understanding that the function of the police is 
</p>
<p>to protect human rights. That highlights the need for enhanced training of pre-service and 
</p>
<p>in-service police officers on the basic principles of human rights and their role in policing.  
</p>
<p>28. Police officers receive limited human rights training. The Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that the provisions on human rights in the Constitution are covered in pre-service 
</p>
<p>police training. However, from interviews conducted during his visit, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur had the impression that human rights was not a substantive part of the training. 
</p>
<p>The Minister of Justice and Attorney General stated in an interview that police training in 
</p>
<p>general was insufficient and that he was advocating a longer training period from the 
</p>
<p>current six months to 18 months. He also recognized the value of refresher courses.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Papua New Guinea police force 
</p>
<p>would be increased from 5,300 to 8,000 members, which would be a significant and 
</p>
<p>welcome development. However, a mass recruitment of police officers should not be at the 
</p>
<p>detriment of adequate training, including in human rights. In order to ensure that a new 
</p>
<p>police culture is created and that the old one is not merely transferred to the new arrivals, 
</p>
<p>recruits must be targeted for special human rights training and seasoned officers should be 
</p>
<p>required to take refresher courses. In discussions with the Police Commissioner of RPNGC, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur was assured that a stronger human rights approach would be taken 
</p>
<p>to policing, including in the training of new recruits. 
</p>
<p>30. There have been some positive initiatives in police training, but they do not seem to 
</p>
<p>have been sustainable. For instance, the Special Rapporteur was informed of an initiative 
</p>
<p>undertaken by NGOs in Simbu in 2009/2010 to provide human rights training to the police, 
</p>
<p>which had had a positive impact for a period of time.  
</p>
<p>31. Despite the problems in the police force, the senior management of the Constabulary 
</p>
<p>showed an openness to reform. There have also been attempts in the past to reform the 
</p>
<p>police; one example that appears to be widely respected is the review carried out by the 
</p>
<p>RPNGC Administrative Review Committee in 2004. However, the recommendations in the 
</p>
<p>Committee&#8217;s report remain largely unimplemented. Another positive development is the 
</p>
<p>collaboration between the Constabulary and the Ombudsman Commission and the move to 
</p>
<p>adapt the Memorandum of Agreement signed in 2007 by the Ombudsman Commission and 
</p>
<p>the RPNGC into legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Community Auxiliary Police 
</b></p>
<p>32. In some areas of the country, there was an initiative called the Community Auxiliary 
</p>
<p>Police. In terms of the Police Act, 1998, the Auxiliary Police is afforded the same powers 
</p>
<p>as the regular police force. However, since they are volunteers, they do not receive payment 
</p>
<p>for their services unless otherwise prescribed in Regulations (see section 129 (1) of the 
</p>
<p>Act). The exercise of their powers is limited to the geographical area in which they are

<p>appointed (see section 127). The Special Rapporteur was informed that the majority of 
</p>
<p>Community Auxiliary Police sections had been closed throughout the country, due to 
</p>
<p>complaints of abuse. Nonetheless, the Community Auxiliary Police in Bougainville, which 
</p>
<p>is supported by New Zealand, is noteworthy. The Auxiliary Police in Bougainville has 
</p>
<p>approximately 337 members, all of whom are paid staff who assist in alleviating the 
</p>
<p>pressure on the regular police force. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Correctional services 
</b></p>
<p>33. Section 112 (3) of the Correctional Services Act, 1995, authorizes a correctional 
</p>
<p>officer to use a firearm if he or she &#8220;believes it to be necessary to maintain the good order 
</p>
<p>and security of the correctional institution or the custody of a detainee&#8221;. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>section 112 (4) provides that a correctional officer shall not be &#8220;liable for injury or damage 
</p>
<p>caused by the use of force, instruments of restraint or firearms when acting in accordance 
</p>
<p>with this section.&#8221; Such provisions allow for scenarios where excessive use of force can be 
</p>
<p>regarded as lawful, as well as the avoidance of accountability. 
</p>
<p>34. There have been frequent reports in the media about prison breakouts to which the 
</p>
<p>authorities have sometimes responded with deadly violence.    
</p>
<p><b> V. Private security firms and the right to life 
</b></p>
<p>35. Private security companies are widespread in Papua New Guinea, and employ more 
</p>
<p>guards than there are police officers in the country. According to the Security Industries 
</p>
<p>Authority, there are approximately 400 licensed security firms in Papua New Guinea, with 
</p>
<p>approximately 20,000 employees.7  
</p>
<p>36. Private security companies are governed by the Security (Protection) Industry Act,  
</p>
<p>2004, which contains provisions on, inter alia, the granting of licenses and permits in 
</p>
<p>relation to security services. Licensed security officers and security guards may undertake 
</p>
<p>duties relating to crowd control. 
</p>
<p>37. Although restrictions are placed on the carrying of firearms by employees of private 
</p>
<p>security companies, the Special Rapporteur was informed of cases in which their employees 
</p>
<p>had used excessive force and, in some instances, their conduct resulted in the death of 
</p>
<p>individuals. There have been several complaints that employees of private security 
</p>
<p>companies do not receive appropriate training and that many are often employed because 
</p>
<p>they know someone in the company, regardless of their skills. Members of the police 
</p>
<p>indicated that private security companies did not have manuals or standing orders to guide 
</p>
<p>their conduct, and that they hired anyone. While the Security (Protection) Industry Act 
</p>
<p>contains provisions relating to training and restricting the authority granted to private 
</p>
<p>security companies, the information received from witnesses regarding the conduct of the 
</p>
<p>employees of private companies calls into question the extent to which the Security 
</p>
<p>(Protection) Industry Act is actually implemented, especially insofar as training and holding 
</p>
<p>individuals and companies accountable are concerned. 
</p>
<p>38. Several stakeholders stressed the need for a regulatory framework for private 
</p>
<p>security companies and some consider their existence to be an indictment of the State and 
</p>
<p>its duty to provide security, claiming that they send the wrong message to the community. 
</p>
<p>One problem with private security companies is that, although they perform the same 
</p>
<p>functions that the State would normally perform, they are not accountable in the same way.  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur noted that there have been instances in which private 
</p>
<p>security companies arrived at the scenes of domestic violence before the police.  
</p>
<p>40. Regardless of whether such companies are purely private enterprises, the State has 
</p>
<p>an obligation to ensure the right to life of its citizens, which includes taking measures to 
</p>
<p>ensure that those carrying out policing tasks do so only after receiving appropriate training 
</p>
<p>and that they are held to account when they act outside of the law. In that regard, it is 
</p>
<p>important that existing legislation is enforced, specifically in relation to training. It may 
</p>
<p>also be useful to create a framework which provides greater clarity relating to the 
</p>
<p>accountability of private security companies, including, for instance, the reporting of their 
</p>
<p>activities. 
</p>
<p>41. Submissions are currently being accepted on the amendments to the Security 
</p>
<p>(Protection) Industry Act, 2004. This is a prime opportunity for stakeholders to make their 
</p>
<p>voices heard and to actively contribute to the formulation of the law. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Manus Island Regional Processing Centre 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur visited the Regional Processing Centre for asylum seekers 
</p>
<p>on Manus Island &#8212; an Australian initiative &#8212; to gain a better understanding of the events 
</p>
<p>that took place there from 16 to 18 February 2014, during which riots broke out, leaving 
</p>
<p>one detainee, Reza Barati, dead and approximately 62 others injured. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed that a second person later died, apparently due to lack of 
</p>
<p>treatment for an infected leg wound. The Special Rapporteur was not allowed to enter the 
</p>
<p>camp itself or speak to any of the detainees, but he was able to discuss the riots with 
</p>
<p>relevant authorities from Papua New Guinea and Australia. 
</p>
<p>43. Based on that brief and limited visit, the Special Rapporteur established that the 
</p>
<p>detainees were in a possible dead-end situation: there was uncertainty as to their future and 
</p>
<p>whether they would be resettled in Papua New Guinea. On the one hand, the camp 
</p>
<p>authorities indicated that detainees would be resettled in Papua New Guinea if they 
</p>
<p>qualified as refugees; on the other hand, the highest authorities in the country stated that 
</p>
<p>that was a misunderstanding. The uncertainty is fuelled by the fact that the process itself is 
</p>
<p>very slow. 
</p>
<p>44. Claims that a bullet was lodged in the buttocks of one of the injured raise the issue 
</p>
<p>of why less lethal weapons were not used in what amounted to a foreseeable and foreseen 
</p>
<p>situation of crowd control. It would be important to analyse ballistic evidence in order to 
</p>
<p>evaluate the claims made by the police that only warning shots were fired during the riots. 
</p>
<p>45. Various investigations have been undertaken, four of which were launched by the 
</p>
<p>Government of Papua New Guinea, the Government of Australia, RPNGC and Justice 
</p>
<p>David Cannings, the latter, at his own initiative under section 57 of the Constitution of 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigration, Rimbink Pato, 
</p>
<p>reportedly stated in an interview that the report of the investigation by the Papua New 
</p>
<p>Guinea Government would be released soon and that the police was still in the process of 
</p>
<p>finalizing its investigation. The investigation initiated by Justice Cannings has been halted 
</p>
<p>and an application by the Government of Papua New Guinea, alleging bias on the part of 
</p>
<p>Justice Cannings, is pending before the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>46. On 5 March 2014, the Australian Senate tasked the Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
</p>
<p>References Committee with carrying out an inquiry into the incident at the Manus Island 
</p>
<p>Processing Centre from 16 to 18 February 2014 and requested that it present a report by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 </b> 
</p>
<p>26 June 2014. The final report was tabled in December 2014.8 Reportedly, this inquiry has 
</p>
<p>not received the cooperation of the Papua New Guinea Government and cannot operate 
</p>
<p>extraterritorially.9 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur recalls that all investigations should be prompt, impartial, 
</p>
<p>independent and transparent, and in order to ensure credible outcomes, such investigations 
</p>
<p>should receive the cooperation of all involved. Furthermore, in the event that the 
</p>
<p>investigations into the Manus Island incident point to the culpability of specific individuals, 
</p>
<p>they should be prosecuted and a serious effort should be made to improve the situation of 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers on Manus Island. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that there have not been any significant 
</p>
<p>changes since February 2014 to alleviate the situation at the detention centre. While there 
</p>
<p>have been media reports that initial refugee-status determination interviews have been 
</p>
<p>completed in relation to the majority of asylum seekers, no asylum seekers had been 
</p>
<p>resettled in Papua New Guinea as of January 2015. The situation at the Manus Island centre 
</p>
<p>is clearly very unhealthy and volatile, and both States remain responsible for protecting the 
</p>
<p>human rights &#8212; including the right to life &#8212; of the asylum seekers in the camp. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Killings by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violence related to sorcery and witchcraft accusations 
</b></p>
<p>49. Violence related to accusations of sorcery and witchcraft is a widespread problem in 
</p>
<p>many parts of Papua New Guinea. In some instances, when a person dies (generally of 
</p>
<p>unexplained causes or prematurely), someone is accused of having caused the death by 
</p>
<p>witchcraft and is attacked by community members as &#8220;payback&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>50. The reality of the terror, pain and suffering and social disruption caused by 
</p>
<p>accusations of sorcery and witchcraft is only fully understood when one is confronted with 
</p>
<p>the family of victims and the survivors who carry the scars of the attacks. The identification 
</p>
<p>of individuals as witches or sorcerers is arbitrary and subjective. According to many people 
</p>
<p>interviewed, the accusation may be motivated by considerations such as jealousy or greed 
</p>
<p>(e.g. wanting the property of the accused person); aimed against those who do not fully fit 
</p>
<p>in (e.g. not showing enough grief when someone dies); or intended to get rid of outsiders, 
</p>
<p>the elderly and the marginalized, often women. It is a vicious practice with no place in 
</p>
<p>today&#8217;s human rights era. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, on more than one occasion, the police 
</p>
<p>had been reluctant to intervene as they, themselves, were members of the community and 
</p>
<p>might face retributive attacks or were afraid of the alleged sorcery or witchcraft tool. In 
</p>
<p>some cases, police officers stated that they lacked the manpower to intervene against large 
</p>
<p>crowds. Sorcery-related killings are generally carried out by a group of people. In the rare 
</p>
<p>cases where perpetrators have been apprehended, it was often only those involved in the 
</p>
<p>actual killing that were charged, not the instigators of the violence, although the law is 
</p>
<p>flexible enough to prosecute instigators. 
</p>
<p>52. The law may offer some relief to persons accused of sorcery and witchcraft. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur learned that the Office of the Public Solicitor had helped four (elderly) 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>people to bring civil defamation suits in similar cases. One magistrate stated that she had 
</p>
<p>referred to section 7 of the Summary Offences Act, 1977, which prohibits the use of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;threatening, abusive or insulting words&#8221;, in, for instance, cases where a person has called 
</p>
<p>another a <i>sanguma </i>(witch or sorcerer). That would result in a fine and/or compensation. 
</p>
<p>While such cases are exceptions, they do provide a starting point. 
</p>
<p>53. The repeal of the Sorcery Act, 1971, was a positive development. Section 16 of the 
</p>
<p>Act allowed for sorcery as provocation to be raised as a defence in cases of sorcery-related 
</p>
<p>murder, for example, that the deceased was a sorcerer who provoked the murder, and if that 
</p>
<p>were proven, the accused might be found guilty of a lesser offence.10 
</p>
<p>54. While views differ in the legal profession, a senior judge informed the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur that, nowadays, in most cases of sorcery-related killings, the motive is seen as 
</p>
<p>an aggravating circumstance. That appears to be a sensible approach. 
</p>
<p>55. The Government has taken other steps to address sorcery-related violence, including 
</p>
<p>in particular the process led by the Department of Justice and Attorney General to develop a 
</p>
<p>multi-sectoral national action plan on sorcery and witchcraft accusation-related violence, 
</p>
<p>through consultation with a wide range of governmental and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. If formally adopted and implemented, the action plan would make an 
</p>
<p>important contribution towards eradicating the violence associated with belief in sorcery 
</p>
<p>and witchcraft. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings resulting from tribal fighting 
</b></p>
<p>56. Traditionally, tribal violence occurred in the villages. However, today, it has found 
</p>
<p>its way into the cities as well. Fights between members of different tribes occur regularly 
</p>
<p>and may be triggered for a variety of reasons, including sorcery and witchcraft, land and 
</p>
<p>territory-related issues, jealousy and inequality. Payback violence is regularly cited as being 
</p>
<p>linked to tribal disputes. 
</p>
<p>57. Tribal violence has become increasingly violent over the years as individuals have 
</p>
<p>greater access to firearms. 
</p>
<p>58. The Inter-group Fighting Act, 1977, prohibits certain conduct related to inter-tribal 
</p>
<p>fighting with a view to eradicating this problem; the mere fact of taking part in inter-tribal 
</p>
<p>fighting is an offence. Section 11 (2) of the Act provides for a punishment of between three 
</p>
<p>and six years imprisonment, where a person has taken part in inter-tribal fighting that has 
</p>
<p>resulted in death. However, that provision does not absolve a person from any other offence 
</p>
<p>that he or she may be guilty of in terms of another law (see section 11 (3). Furthermore, in 
</p>
<p>terms of section 11 (3A), where, after an inquiry, a Court determines that an individual is a 
</p>
<p>principal offender or a leader of the fight that results in death, he or she shall be liable to 
</p>
<p>imprisonment for a term of 20 to 30 years. While in some cases, individuals involved in 
</p>
<p>tribal fighting have been prosecuted, problems often arise in relation to securing witnesses 
</p>
<p>to support the prosecution, as many people fear that they will be subjected to payback if 
</p>
<p>they testify. 
</p>
<p>59. Tribal disputes are often brought before the village courts, rather than the higher 
</p>
<p>level courts. In Goroka, a Peace Park &#8212; a large open space &#8212; has been established, where 
</p>
<p>the magistrates of the Village Court, the tribal groups involved, the police and other 
</p>
<p>interested parties meet to mediate problems and reach a settlement. Generally, a cash 
</p>
<p>payment of is offered as compensation to resolve the dispute. However, it may happen that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 See Sorcery Act 1971, sects. 7 and 16. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 </b> 
</p>
<p>the communities are not satisfied with the financial compensation offered, which could give 
</p>
<p>rise to renewed fighting. In addition, Village Court mediations could foster impunity if the 
</p>
<p>tribal fight involved crimes such as killing or rape and serious physical injury.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>60. Domestic violence and rape are widespread and serious concerns in Papua New 
</p>
<p>Guinea. Although they do not always result in death, the threat thereof remains. 
</p>
<p>61. The Government has taken some positive steps to address violence against women, 
</p>
<p>including involvement in initiatives to highlight the issues relating to gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>and, notably, the passing of the Family Protection Act in September 2013, which 
</p>
<p>criminalizes domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur considers that much more education about and awareness of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence is needed and that the Family Protection Act must be enforced as a 
</p>
<p>matter of priority. School curricula should include positive values, for example, in life skills 
</p>
<p>courses. In the context of sorcery-related killings, education could take the form of ensuring 
</p>
<p>that proper medical explanations are given to the aggrieved relatives of those who were 
</p>
<p>killed. That could go a long way in curbing accusations that sorcery played a role in the 
</p>
<p>deaths. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that strengthening the police would help to 
</p>
<p>ensure that perpetrators are held accountable and would reduce recourse to acts of 
</p>
<p>vigilantism. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Institutions and procedures for protection and accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The police 
</b></p>
<p>64. One of the main problems relating to the police is the lack of both human and 
</p>
<p>financial resources. The number of police officers has increased marginally since 
</p>
<p>Independence, whilst the population has tripled. Police officers are housed in substandard 
</p>
<p>accommodations; their salaries are low and they need new uniforms. Addressing those 
</p>
<p>issues could have a positive impact on police behaviour and could contribute to addressing 
</p>
<p>the acceptance of bribes and general corruption within the force. 
</p>
<p>65. A general culture of accountability for violent crime is essential for the protection of 
</p>
<p>the right to life. On several occasions, the Special Rapporteur was told that the police do  
</p>
<p>not always carry out investigations and when they do, they are not done properly. In some 
</p>
<p>instances, &#8220;petrol money&#8221; or other payment must be given to the police before they even 
</p>
<p>consider investigating a matter or carrying out an arrest. Some interlocutors stated that the 
</p>
<p>police accepted bribes to overlook a particular matter. 
</p>
<p>66. There have been allegations of secondary victimization during the investigation 
</p>
<p>phase, whereby witnesses and/or victims have been mistreated by the police.  For that 
</p>
<p>reason, witnesses are often reluctant to come forward to testify or provide information. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was told that the police obtain confessions through coercion. In some 
</p>
<p>instances, cases have been thrown out for lack of evidence as such confessions are 
</p>
<p>inadmissible. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of a practice called &#8220;snake bail&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>whereby the police may arrest a person for a serious offence, but record it as a lesser 
</p>
<p>offence so that the person is released. Concern was also raised about whether, in practice, 
</p>
<p>the coroner investigated every case of death in custody. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes 
</p>
<p>that the police must carry out investigations properly, ensure that cases are brought to court </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>and that adequate evidence is presented to ensure proper prosecutions. Failure to do so 
</p>
<p>thwarts accountability and could amount to a violation of the State&#8217;s obligations under 
</p>
<p>international law.11 
</p>
<p>67. It was reported that police officers maintained allegiance to their tribes or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;wantoks&#8221;, which, in some instances, are valued more than their law enforcement duties. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, conduct such as that of the Commander mentioned in paragraph 25 above, where 
</p>
<p>police resources are used to exact a personal vendetta should not be tolerated, and 
</p>
<p>appropriate action should be taken against such abuse of power. 
</p>
<p>68. The Police Commissioner mentioned that officers had to give a report every time 
</p>
<p>they discharged a firearm. He acknowledged that, on occasion, police officers violate the 
</p>
<p>law, but claimed that delinquent officers were usually brought to task. That picture is very 
</p>
<p>different from the information received from victims and other stakeholders. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed of many cases of blatant use of excessive force by the police, for 
</p>
<p>which no action was ever taken to hold the police officers to account. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur was informed that complaints against the police were dealt 
</p>
<p>with by the Internal Investigation Unit (IIU), which is independent of police stations. 
</p>
<p>However, in practice, complaints must be lodged at a police station, which dissuades 
</p>
<p>victims of police abuse from lodging complaints as they would have to do so to the same 
</p>
<p>body that carried out the abuse. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a case where the 
</p>
<p>victim was too afraid to go to the police to lodge a complaint because he had received 
</p>
<p>threats. A similar internal investigation process also exists for correctional services staff; 
</p>
<p>however, it seems that correctional services officers are rarely, if ever, prosecuted or 
</p>
<p>convicted. 
</p>
<p>70. In general, an investigation can only be initiated after a person lodges a complaint to 
</p>
<p>the police. However, allegedly the police do not wear identification badges and, in some 
</p>
<p>instances, they do not even wear uniforms, which makes it difficult for a victim of police 
</p>
<p>violence to lodge a complaint since he or she cannot prove that the perpetrator is a police 
</p>
<p>officer. When complaints have been lodged, they have not always been followed up as 
</p>
<p>police officers are often unwilling to investigate or testify against their colleagues. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur emphasizes that allegations of serious misuse of force by police officers 
</p>
<p>must be properly investigated. While it is important to strengthen the internal investigative 
</p>
<p>system, improving discipline within the police force and improving the command and 
</p>
<p>control structure are equally important 
</p>
<p>71. In 2007, a Memorandum of Agreement was concluded between the RPNGC and the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman Commission for the Ombudsman to oversee internal investigations into 
</p>
<p>complaints against police officers.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur was informed that a process is under way to adapt the 
</p>
<p>Memorandum of Agreement into legislation so as to formalize the relationship between the 
</p>
<p>IIU and the Ombudsman Commission. That would offer an opportunity to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>system, and the authorities should also consider enhancing the independence of the Unit 
</p>
<p>Head, for example, conferring special powers and requiring that the Head report directly to 
</p>
<p>the Police Commissioner.

</p>
<p><b> B. Witness and victim protection 
</b></p>
<p>73. Witnesses are often reluctant to come forward to testify due to intimidation by 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of crimes or by members of the group to which the accused belongs. The 
</p>
<p>intimidation may not be immediate and may be directed at the witness or at someone in his 
</p>
<p>or her group. The system of payback was also raised as a reason why a standard witness 
</p>
<p>protection programme would not be feasible in Papua New Guinea. Indeed, the programme 
</p>
<p>would have to ensure protection for the witness and his or her family members for an 
</p>
<p>extended period of time. It has also been argued that resources are not available to provide 
</p>
<p>the level of protection that witnesses would require. Papua New Guinea does not have a 
</p>
<p>victim protection programme either. While there are bound to be problems with such 
</p>
<p>programmes, the benefits would outweigh the drawbacks and, in the long run, they would 
</p>
<p>save lives and facilitate accountability. A legislative framework for victim and witness 
</p>
<p>protection should be adopted based on the particular needs of the context in Papua New 
</p>
<p>Guinea.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a &#8220;rapid response&#8221; initiative in Simbu, 
</p>
<p>where NGOs, in collaboration with local State actors help individuals accused of sorcery, as 
</p>
<p>well as their family members, to relocate from their place of residence to another part of the 
</p>
<p>country. While that may appear to be a life-saving solution, such initiatives should be 
</p>
<p>viewed as a last resort measure to be employed only when State protection mechanisms fail. 
</p>
<p>The individuals relocated in such circumstances often face severe challenges, including the 
</p>
<p>lack of basic economic security. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Court proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>75. Legal proceedings take a long time, and it can take up to three years for some 
</p>
<p>serious cases to reach the court. There are allegedly over 4,000 arrest warrants currently 
</p>
<p>outstanding, some of which date back to the 1980s. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur was concerned about the lack of public awareness of human 
</p>
<p>rights and the mechanisms in place to protect them. It is imperative that human rights 
</p>
<p>awareness and education be carried out throughout the country in schools, for law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officers and especially for the public, so that they know what mechanisms are 
</p>
<p>available to them. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur was informed that it was very difficult to file civil claims 
</p>
<p>against the State as documents have to be served in person within six months on designated 
</p>
<p>State officials12 whose offices are in Port Moresby, and that some people have abandoned 
</p>
<p>their claims against the State because they were unable to serve documents on government 
</p>
<p>officials. It has been suggested that the State should accept documents served by post; 
</p>
<p>however, some people have stated that claims have been struck down due to incorrect 
</p>
<p>service.13 Even if the State has, on occasion, not raised objections to service by post, it is 
</p>
<p>merely an unwritten practice and the rule can be prohibitive. 
</p>
<p>78. With the establishment of the Human Rights Track in 2011, the issue of servicing 
</p>
<p>claims in person might to some extent be circumvented. In terms of section 57 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, human rights contained in the Constitution are enforceable through the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See Claims By and Against the State Act, 1996, section 5. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>National and Supreme Courts. The Human Rights Track deals with court cases relating to 
</p>
<p>the rights contained in the Constitution. Rule 6 of the Rules of the Courts elaborate upon 
</p>
<p>section 57 of the Constitution and establish standing before the court in respect of a broad 
</p>
<p>range of actors, including any person or body with an interest in protecting and enforcing 
</p>
<p>human rights and international organizations, such as the United Nations. The Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Track is user-friendly and enables anyone to bring human rights cases to court. 
</p>
<p>However, awareness-raising will be needed for the initiative to reach those who most need 
</p>
<p>it. 
</p>
<p><b> D. National human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>79. National human rights institutions have a promotional as well as a protective 
</p>
<p>function and play an important role in many societies around the world. The notion of 
</p>
<p>establishing a national human right institution in Papua New Guinea has been accepted for 
</p>
<p>some time. Such an institution must comply with the Principles relating to the status of 
</p>
<p>national institutions (the Paris Principles) (General Assembly resolution 48/134, annex) and 
</p>
<p>should have a broad mandate covering abuses by both State and non-State actors. While 
</p>
<p>significant work had been undertaken towards completing the draft Constitutional 
</p>
<p>amendments and the draft Organic Law providing for the establishment of a national human 
</p>
<p>rights institution,14 it seems that inexplicable delays have occurred. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>urges the Government to complete those laws as a matter of priority. He underlines that the 
</p>
<p>Government should also give strong consideration to establishing, at the same time, a 
</p>
<p>provincial office of the national human rights institution in at least one province, for 
</p>
<p>example, in Simbu. He is of the opinion that such an office could play an important role in 
</p>
<p>addressing the issue of witchcraft and sorcery-related violence in that province, and would 
</p>
<p>also provide invaluable support to the human rights defenders in that province. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Access to lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>80. A limited number of lawyers is available in Papua New Guinea and many people 
</p>
<p>simply cannot afford to pay their fees. The Office of the Public Solicitor provides free legal 
</p>
<p>assistance in respect of civil and criminal matters to those who are unable to afford a 
</p>
<p>private lawyer, and in the case of criminal matters to those facing a sentence of two or more 
</p>
<p>years. The Office also has a dedicated human rights desk. Private lawyers are expensive 
</p>
<p>and very few practice criminal law. 
</p>
<p>81. Few lawyers are interested in joining the Office of the Public Solicitor due to poor 
</p>
<p>benefits offered, in particular, inadequate housing. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
</p>
<p>improving the benefits would attract solicitors country-wide, which would ease the 
</p>
<p>workload of the existing ones. Civil society should also make efforts to obtain funding to 
</p>
<p>establish an NGO that employs human rights lawyers. The possibility of establishing a pro 
</p>
<p>bono system should also be considered. The Special Rapporteur noted that there was a vast 
</p>
<p>vacuum in that area and had held constructive discussions with the Papua New Guinea Law 
</p>
<p>Society in that regard. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Human rights-focused non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>82. While human rights defenders in Papua New Guinea are doing commendable work 
</p>
<p>in respect of specific human rights issues, there is no well-established NGO that addresses 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 See A/HRC/WG.6/11/PNG/1, para. 36; and A/HRC/WG.6/11/PNG/2, para. 12.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 </b> 
</p>
<p>general human rights matters. Knowing that there is a body that can take up the causes of 
</p>
<p>the people they interact with and which can serve as a watchdog would in part ensure the 
</p>
<p>accountability of the police and others. The same applies to a legal advice centre for people 
</p>
<p>who cannot afford private legal representation. There is a clear need for both in the country. 
</p>
<p>83. Ideally, the establishment of a local NGO as well as the establishment of an office 
</p>
<p>by an international human rights organization would cover both legal and human rights 
</p>
<p>issues. In that regard, the University of Papua New Guinea can play a role on both fronts &#8212; 
</p>
<p>by creating a legal clinic and establishing a centre for human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> G. University of Papua New Guinea  
</b></p>
<p>84. Experience worldwide has shown that universities are invaluable resources for 
</p>
<p>societies seeking to move forward their human rights agenda. Universities educate young 
</p>
<p>people to staff the system; keep in touch with international developments; carry out 
</p>
<p>research; advise role players, including the Government; inform the public; and in some 
</p>
<p>instances, assist with reporting to treaty and other international bodies. It would be a 
</p>
<p>significant development if the University of Papua New Guinea were to develop its human 
</p>
<p>rights capacity, by having on staff a lecturer dedicated to the topic, including human rights 
</p>
<p>in the curriculum, and establishing a centre for human rights. The University should also 
</p>
<p>ensure that its students participate in international human rights events, such as 
</p>
<p>international moot courts. The School of Law should take a pro-active approach in that 
</p>
<p>regard and consider creating a legal clinic. 
</p>
<p><b> H. United Nations  
</b></p>
<p>85. OHCHR currently has two professional staff in Papua New Guinea. It would be of 
</p>
<p>great value to the region if a fully-fledged OHCHR country office were to be set up in the 
</p>
<p>country. Such a team would be a valuable partner for many local human rights initiatives, 
</p>
<p>including the establishment of a national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>86. Upon meeting with officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur mentioned the difficulties he had encountered to correspond with the authorities 
</p>
<p>in Papua New Guinea while he was preparing for his visit. At present, Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>does not have a permanent mission in Geneva, therefore urgent appeals and allegation 
</p>
<p>letters are communicated through the Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New 
</p>
<p>York. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>87. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed of the legislative amendments 
</p>
<p>made to the Criminal Code in September 2013 concerning the death penalty. The death 
</p>
<p>penalty may now be imposed as a sentence for two new crimes, namely, &#8220;wilful murder of 
</p>
<p>a person on account of accusation of sorcery&#8221; and &#8220;aggravated rape&#8221;, and the sentence for 
</p>
<p>&#8220;aggravated robbery&#8221; has been amended from life imprisonment to the death penalty.15  
</p>
<p>88. There have been various reports about the Government&#8217;s intention to start 
</p>
<p>implementing capital punishment in response to the high level of violence in the country. 
</p>
<p>While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the magnitude of the challenge that the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2013, certified on 18 September 2013.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>Government faces in addressing the high level of killings and violence in the country, he 
</p>
<p>does not consider the death penalty to be the answer to the situation. Inter alia, 
</p>
<p>implementing capital punishment would provide a false sense of security and divert 
</p>
<p>attention away from effective long-term solutions such as better policing, economic 
</p>
<p>development, robust correctional institutions and education. 
</p>
<p>89. Currently, 13 people are on death row in Papua New Guinea, all convicted of wilful 
</p>
<p>murder. However, Papua New Guinea has long been considered a de facto abolitionist State 
</p>
<p>with regard to the imposition of the death penalty. The last execution in the country 
</p>
<p>occurred in 1954, 21 years prior to Independence.  
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the Government to maintain its 
</p>
<p>international positioning as an abolitionist State and refrain from implementing the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. There is a distinct and sustained global trend away from the death penalty as its 
</p>
<p>numerous weaknesses are now widely recognized. The reintroduction of the death penalty 
</p>
<p>by some outlier States are distinct exceptions which have attracted wide criticism. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>after many centuries of experimentation, humanity as a whole has lost faith in State-
</p>
<p>inflicted death as a form of punishment, inter alia, because it is no longer accepted that it 
</p>
<p>has distinct deterrent powers. The death penalty creates a false sense of security. Papua 
</p>
<p>New Guinea would be moving in the wrong direction by reinstituting the death penalty &#8212; 
</p>
<p>both in relation to the global trend and its own Supreme Court&#8217;s restrictive interpretation of 
</p>
<p>when the death penalty may be considered as appropriate punishment &#8212; and is likely to 
</p>
<p>damage its quest to curb violence by doing so. 
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that implementing the death penalty at the 
</p>
<p>present time could lead to numerous violations of international standards. In that regard, 
</p>
<p>international law requires that the death penalty may be imposed only in the context of the 
</p>
<p>stringent functioning of the law and order system, in order to ensure the highest respect of 
</p>
<p>due process and fair trial guarantees for the defendants, at least equal to those contained in 
</p>
<p>article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.16 During his visit, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed of shortcomings in that area, such as extraction of 
</p>
<p>confessions under duress, ill-treatment of persons in custody, lengthy proceedings, or high 
</p>
<p>levels of corruption among various authorities. 
</p>
<p>92. The right to appeal is a crucial safeguard that must be applied to all persons facing 
</p>
<p>the death penalty. According to information received, at least one of the 13 individuals 
</p>
<p>currently on death row received the death sentence on appeal before the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was informed that the decisions of the Supreme Court cannot be 
</p>
<p>appealed. If that is the case, the execution of persons sentenced to death at the level of the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court would be a violation of international law if their right to appeal their 
</p>
<p>sentence is not ensured. 
</p>
<p>93. International law also states that the death penalty may be imposed only for the most 
</p>
<p>serious crimes, which is interpreted as being the crime of intentional killing. The amended 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code provides for the death penalty for the offences of aggravated robbery, 
</p>
<p>aggravated rape and piracy or treason, which do not constitute most serious crimes. 
</p>
<p>94. The legal framework regarding the death penalty in Papua New Guinea also lacks 
</p>
<p>provisions that would prohibit the imposition of the death penalty on juvenile offenders,17 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 See Safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, approved by 
</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50.  
</p>
<p> 17 The SR was informed that the Juvenile Justice Act has been passed in Parliament. The final version of 
</p>
<p>the text is not yet available, however, it is alleged that an earlier version prohibited imposition of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty on juveniles. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 </b> 
</p>
<p>new mothers and persons with psycho-social disabilities, which opens the way for another 
</p>
<p>violation of international standards, should the death penalty be imposed on such persons. 
</p>
<p>95. Furthermore, the current text of the Criminal Code (Amendment) Act, 2013, 
</p>
<p>providing for the death penalty in cases of wilful murder, killings related to sorcery 
</p>
<p>accusations and aggravated rape may be interpreted as imposing capital punishment in a 
</p>
<p>mandatory way.18 The mandatory imposition of the death penalty is contrary to 
</p>
<p>international standards and appears to be contrary to the interpretation of the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court which, in the case of <i>Steven Loke Ume </i>v.<i> The State</i> (2006) SC 836, assessed whether 
</p>
<p>the law provided for mandatory death sentences and found that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the law as it stands today is quite clear &#8212; that the imposition of the death penalty 
</p>
<p>since 1965 has always remained discretionary. The death penalty is the maximum 
</p>
<p>penalty for wilful murder (or for that matter, the three (3) other crimes which carry 
</p>
<p>the death penalty) and therefore discretionary&#8221; (para. 39). 
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur remains unconvinced of the deterrent effect of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. In addition to studies at the international level which prove that the death penalty is 
</p>
<p>not necessarily an effective deterrent of crime, several interlocutors shared the opinion that 
</p>
<p>the death penalty might actually lead to further killings in Papua New Guinea, given the 
</p>
<p>payback culture. While the Special Rapporteur condemns the existence of the payback 
</p>
<p>culture, he acknowledges that payback-related killings might increase if the death penalty is 
</p>
<p>carried out. Some members of the judiciary and prosecutors indicated that they would have 
</p>
<p>to give very careful consideration to the reimposition of the death penalty, due to fear of 
</p>
<p>lethal reprisal against them and their families. 
</p>
<p>97. At the time of writing this report, the Special Rapporteur learned that the 
</p>
<p>Government plans to rethink the death penalty. The Prime Minister had stated, &#8220;We 
</p>
<p>certainly do not want to be seen as a country that is actively promoting the death penalty as 
</p>
<p>a means of enforcing law and order in the country. We are actively debating the death-
</p>
<p>penalty issue &#8230; and there may be some need for review.&#8221;19 Insofar as that represents a new 
</p>
<p>approach, the Special Rapporteur welcomes that statement.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Role of extractive industries 
</b></p>
<p>98. Space does not permit a full discussion of this topic, but it is important to raise the 
</p>
<p>issue. Extractive industries are an important component of the economic development of 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea, but they pose significant risks to the protection of life. In the extreme 
</p>
<p>case, the history of Bougainville is a telling reminder of the dangers associated with the 
</p>
<p>exploitation of natural resources, where the underlying legal and normative framework has 
</p>
<p>not yet been settled. Concern that the necessary framework to meet the expected economic 
</p>
<p>growth is not in place in the country as a whole is in fact the broader point of this report.  
</p>
<p>99. The stakes are high, as are the risks that government forces or private security firms 
</p>
<p>will become entangled in the protection of the underlying interests through the use of force. 
</p>
<p>That underscores the need for discipline and control in those sectors. 
</p>

<p><b> XI. Killings during the Bougainville crisis 
</b></p>
<p>100. An important element of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was to examine the progress 
</p>
<p>made in the peacebuilding and redress processes in the Autonomous Region of 
</p>
<p>Bougainville following the conflict that erupted in 1989 and lasted 10 years. The conflict 
</p>
<p>took an unaccounted for number of lives and resulting in a yet unknown number of mass 
</p>
<p>graves. 
</p>
<p>101. A former Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</p>
<p>visited the region in 1995. In his report20 to the Human Rights Commission in 1996, he 
</p>
<p>presented a comprehensive overview of the conflict and the violations of the right to life, as 
</p>
<p>well as made recommendations relating to the killings that occurred during the crisis. In 
</p>
<p>relation to the peace and reconciliation process, he recommended that education, training 
</p>
<p>and the administration of justice be enhanced. The current Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was 
</p>
<p>therefore an opportunity to examine the follow-up to those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>102. Important developments have taken place since 1995 in relation to building peace in 
</p>
<p>the Region. The Bougainville Peace Agreement was signed in 2001, which paved the way 
</p>
<p>for elections in 2005 for the establishment of the Autonomous Bougainville Government. 
</p>
<p>Among the most recent initiatives, are 2011 Konnou Peace Agreement between factions, 
</p>
<p>the Bougainville Peace and Security Framework and its Implementation Strategy, in 2012, 
</p>
<p>and the eligibility of Papua New Guinea and Bougainville as a beneficiary of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Peacebuilding Fund, in 2013. 
</p>
<p>103. Nonetheless, a considerable number of grievances still persist and the application of 
</p>
<p>various transitional justice measures may be necessary. In that regard, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed, in particular, of the need of the families of the many disappeared 
</p>
<p>persons to locate the graves of their relatives and to ensure proper burial. 
</p>
<p><b> XII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>All the issues raised in this report present formidable challenges. However, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur remains convinced that the prospects of investment of time, effort 
</b></p>
<p><b>and resources to advance human rights having a positive impact on the society as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>whole are probably greater in Papua New Guinea than in countries in comparable 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations. Papua New Guinea has the opportunity to set a vibrant and burgeoning 
</b></p>
<p><b>society on a solid human rights foundation. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Papua New Guinea to adopt a visionary approach in that regard and 
</b></p>
<p><b>calls on the international community to support the Government of Papua New 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guinea in achieving that objective. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>It is clear that a number of steps needs to be taken to move the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>and, in particular, the right to life agenda forward. It is important that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Papua New Guinea take cognizance of how the interplay between 
</b></p>
<p><b>different components can benefit society, for instance, the establishment of a national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights institution can help to introduce human rights in school curricula and 
</b></p>
<p><b>police training; a human rights centre within the University and the establishment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a human rights-focused NGO would contribute to strengthening protection of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights; a witness and victim protection programme would help to make the criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice system more efficient; a larger and better trained police force could strengthen 
</b></p>
<p><b>the certainty of conviction for criminal offences, which, in turn, would contribute to

</p>
<p><b>countering calls for the reinstatement of the death penalty. All of the aforementioned 
</b></p>
<p><b>proposals are interlinked; therefore, it is important that the challenges facing Papua 
</b></p>
<p><b>New Guinea are approached holistically and not viewed in isolation from each other. 
</b></p>
<p><b> XIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. To the Government of Papua New Guinea 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>In collaboration with other stakeholders, a focused, realistic human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy should be developed.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The adoption and implementation of the National action plan on sorcery and 
</b></p>
<p><b>witchcraft accusation-related violence should be fully supported by an holistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach that draws on various sectors. A national awareness-raising and education 
</b></p>
<p><b>campaign, involving high-level representatives of the Government, churches, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>education system, as well as prosecutors and public solicitors, members of the village 
</b></p>
<p><b>courts and the media should be embarked upon. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>As a matter of priority, a national human rights institution should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>established and serious consideration should, at the same time, be given to establishing 
</b></p>
<p><b>a provincial office of the human rights institution, for example, in Simbu Province. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Human rights and, in particular, the right to life should be included in school 
</b></p>
<p><b>curricula and the necessary steps should be taken to ensure that school curricula 
</b></p>
<p><b>include education on the unacceptability of all forms of interpersonal violence, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, in the context of accusations of sorcery and witchcraft, tribal affiliations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and domestic violence. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>A adult education programme to promote and raise awareness about human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and mechanisms, including the Human Rights Track of the National Court, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be established. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Better and regular institutionalized training on human rights for police and 
</b></p>
<p><b>correctional services officers, including refresher courses, should be ensured and  
</b></p>
<p><b>police officers should be trained on the use of firearms. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Increased resources should be made available to the police so as to strengthen
