Gryphon Gold Corporation  
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY
Gryphon Gold Corporation was incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2003 and wholly owns its subsidiary, Borealis Mining Company (collectively, “Gryphon Gold” or “the 
Company”). The Company has historically reported as an exploration and development company. On June 6, 2011, the Company began constructing an oxide heap leach mine
and  related  processing  facility  on  its  Borealis  property  (the  “Borealis  Oxide  Heap  Leach  Project”).  During  the  period  ended  December  31,  2011,  the  Company  commenced 
mining  operations,  and  the  Company  has  determined  the  Company  is  no  longer  in  the  exploration/development  stage.  Accordingly,  the  Company  has  ceased  its  financial
reporting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 915 “Development Stage Entities,” during the nine months ended December 31, 2011.
Going Concern
The audit opinion for the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 includes a going concern qualification. Additional financing will be required
to  complete  the  Adsorption  Desorption  Recovery  Plant  (“ADR”),  to  provide  capital  for  the  expansion  of  crushing  and  procession  facilities,  to  fund  additional  bonding
requirements and to provide working capital until the Company receives positive cash flow from sales of gold. The Company is currently conducting negotiations with multiple
parties to obtain the needed financing, subject to its ability to obtain the necessary consent and approvals. If future revenues do not result in positive cash flow, and the Company
is unable to raise additional capital, we will not be able to meet our obligations and may have to suspend or cease operations. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital 
may be inhibited by the restrictive covenants of the debentures the Company issued in November of 2011, which restrict the Company’s ability to issue equity and debt securities
absent consent of the Noteholders. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in achieving profitability, generating positive cash flow or raising additional
capital through placements of debt or equity. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $40,493,750 as at December 31, 2011, ($37,950,801 as at March 31, 2011), and without
positive operating cash flow or additional financing, the Company does not have sufficient cash on hand to fund normal operations for the next twelve months or satisfy the
current $7 million notes payable. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such assumption contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The recoverability of amounts shown for mineral property interests in the Company’s 
consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to arrange appropriate financing to complete the
development of its properties, the receipt of necessary permitting and upon achieving future profitable production or receiving proceeds from the disposition of properties. The
timing of such events occurring, if at all, is not yet determinable. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Basis of Presentation
The unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim
financial information, as well as the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring 
accruals)  considered  necessary  for  a  fair  presentation  of  the  interim  financial  statements  have  been  included.  Operating  results  for  the  three  and  nine  month  periods  ended
December 31, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2012.
For further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2011.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Loss per share
Loss per common share is determined based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is calculated by the treasury
stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that the
proceeds to be received on the exercise of diluted stock options and warrants classified as equity instruments are applied to repurchase common shares at the average market price
for the period.

Gryphon Gold Corporation  
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:
Loss per share, continued:
In addition, outstanding convertible promissory notes are assumed to be converted into common stock at the then applicable rate. Stock options and warrants are dilutive when the
Company has income from continuing operations and when the average market price of the common shares during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and
warrants. The convertible promissory notes are dilutive when the Company has income from continuing operations, and the impact from the dilution exceeds the impact from the
reduction in interest expense resulting from the conversion of the notes.
Fair value measurements
Accounting principles require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC establishes a fair
value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair 
value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure
fair value:
(cid:122) Level 1: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
(cid:122) Level 2: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar 
assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or 
model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
(cid:122) Level 3: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the
assets or liabilities.
Our financial instruments consist principally of cash, reclamation bond, long-term debt and notes payable. The table below sets forth our assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value, on a recurring basis and the fair value calculation input hierarchy level that management has determined applies to each asset and liability category.

The Company records gold in process, gold doré, and saleable gold on carbon at average cost, less provisions required to reduce inventory to market value. Costs capitalized to in
process and finished goods inventory include the cost of mineralized material processed; direct and indirect materials and consumables; direct labor; repairs and maintenance;
utilities; amortization of property, plant and equipment; and local mine administrative expenses.
Supplies Inventory
Mine operating supplies are recorded at the lower of purchase cost or net realizable value. The Company records provisions to reduce inventory to net realizable value to reflect
changes in economic factors that impact inventory value or to reflect present intentions for the use of slow moving and obsolete supplies inventory.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues and the corresponding accounts receivable for sales of gold and silver products are recorded upon shipment.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Reserves are a key component in our valuation of our property, plant and equipment. Reserve estimates in our pre-feasibility study entitled “NI 43-101 Pre-Feasibility Study 
Update  of  the  Mineral  Resources  of  the  Borealis  Gold  Project  Located  in  Mineral  County,  Nevada,  USA”  dated  April  25,  2011,  (the  “Pre-Feasibility  Study”)  are  used  in

3. NEVADA EAGLE RESOURCES LLC
On  August  21,  2007,  Gryphon  Gold  closed  the  acquisition  of  Nevada  Eagle  Resources  LLC  (“Nevada  Eagle”).  On  April  23,  2010,  Gryphon  Gold  sold  its  wholly  owned 
subsidiary,  Nevada  Eagle  Resources  LLC  to  Fronteer  Development  (USA)  Inc.  (“Fronteer”)  for  $4,750,000.  Fronteer  paid  $2,250,000  in  cash  and  $2,500,000  by  assuming 
Gryphon  Gold's  obligations  under  a  convertible  note,  which  was  retired.  In  addition,  Gryphon  Gold  retained  the  Copper  Basin  property  located  in  Idaho.  The  Company
recognized a gain of $653,949 in connection with the sale.
The Company completed the sale of Nevada Eagle during the six months ended September 30, 2010; Nevada Eagle’s results have been classified and presented as Discontinued 
Operations.
4. INVENTORIES
The recovery of gold and silver from certain oxide ores is achieved through the heap leaching process. Under this method, mineralized material is placed on leach pads where it is
treated with a chemical solution, which dissolves the gold or silver contained in the material. The resulting “pregnant” solution is further processed in a plant where gold and 
silver are recovered. For accounting purposes, costs are added to material on leach pads based on current mining and leaching costs, including applicable depreciation, depletion
and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or
silver on the leach pad.
Estimates of recoverable gold or silver on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of material placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade
of material placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and an estimated recovery percentage (based on ore type). Although the quantities of recoverable gold or silver placed
on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of material placed on pads to the quantities of gold or silver actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of
the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is regularly monitored and estimates are
refined based on actual results over time. As of December 31, 2011 the Company had a limited operating history and actual results only over that short period of time. Due to this,
estimates of recoverable gold and silver are based primarily on initial tests and only limited refinements derived from metallurgical balancing.
Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for
on  a  prospective  basis.  The  ultimate  recovery  of  gold  or  silver  from  a  leach  pad  will  not  be  known  until  the  leaching  process  is  concluded.  The  quantification  of  material
inventory on the leach pad is based on estimates of the quantities of gold or silver at each balance sheet date that the Company expects to recover during the next 12 months.
During the third quarter the Company estimated its recoverable material on the leach pad and its gold in carbon inventory based on net realizable value less processing and selling
costs of the inventories, as third quarter production costs exceed net realizable value.
At December 31, 2011, our inventories were as follows:

Gold in carbon inventory 
Supplies inventory

10. OPTION TO REDUCE ROYALTY
In August 2008, Gryphon and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Borealis Mining Company, entered into an option agreement with the lessors of the Borealis property to amend the
mining lease for the Borealis Property to fix the gold price based sliding scale royalty at a 5% Net Smelter Royalty. Effective May 20, 2011, the Company exercised the option to
fix the Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty on its Borealis property at 5%.
Under the terms of the option agreement, as amended, Gryphon exercised the option by paying the lessors aggregate consideration of $7,000,000 (less the $250,000 previously
paid by Gryphon to the lessors upon execution of the option agreement) as follows:
(a) 
 
(b)
(c)
(d)
$150,000 in cash; 
 
7,726,500 shares of common stock at an agreed value of $0.40 per share (an agreed value of $3,090,500, and a fair value of $1,081,675 based on the market 
price of the Company’s common shares at the date the option was exercised);
 
5% promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,600,000, due May 20, 2013, with installment payments due upon commencement of production on 
the Borealis property; and 
 
5% convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,909,500, due May 20, 2014, convertible into shares of Gryphon common stock at $0.70 per share 
through May 20, 2012, $0.80 per share through May 20, 2013 and $0.90 per share through May 20, 2014.
Accordingly, at December 31, 2011 and at March 31, 2011, the Company’s mineral properties include the following payments made to the Borealis Property lessors:

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period. The
Company’s total employees are relatively few in number and turnover is considered minimal, therefore the Company currently estimates forfeitures to be 20%. Estimate
of forfeitures is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Stock-based compensation is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

Valuation assumptions
Compensation and consulting expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted 
average assumptions used in the pricing model include:
Dividend yield 
Expected volatility 
Risk free interest rate 
Expected lives
Nine months

Nine months
Ended
December 31, 2010
0% 
99% -119% 
0.52% -1.62% 
2-3 years
The risk-free interest rate was determined based on the rate at the time of grant for US government zero-coupon bonds for a 2-3-year term, which is a term equal to the 
estimated life of the option. Dividend yield was based on the stock option’s exercise price and expected annual dividend rate at the time of grant. Volatility was derived
by measuring the average share price fluctuation of the Company’s stock. The period of historical volatility is the same period as the expected life of the options being
three years.
The Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model for fair value measurement of options. This model was independently developed to estimate the fair value of
freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from the Company’s stock option awards. Option pricing models require 
the input of highly subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. Changes in
these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and therefore it is management’s view that the existing models do not necessarily provide a single reliable 
measure of the fair value of the Company’s equity instruments.

13. COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES
[a] A portion of the Borealis Property is subject to a mining lease. The Company was required to make advanced royalty payments monthly of $9,869, adjusted annually based on
the Consumer Price Index. The last advance royalty payment was made in November 2011 as the Company moved from exploration to production. In addition, production of
precious metals from the Borealis Property will be subject to the payment of a royalty under the terms of the mining lease. The Company deducts advance royalty payments from
production  royalties  due  under  the  mining  lease,  pursuant  to  the  mining  lease.  The  Company’s  royalty  holders  have  disputed  this  practice  [See  Note  14].  The  Company  is 
currently preparing a response to the  complaint.. The mining lease expired on January 24, 2009, but was and is automatically  renewed thereafter, so long as mining related
activity, including exploration drilling, continues on the Borealis Property.
[b] The Company rents office space in Vancouver, BC for a 5-year term, commencing September 2008, office space in Hawthorne, Nevada for a one year term, and office space
in Carson City, Nevada for a two year term. The following are the remaining rental lease commitments in relation to the office leases:

Act”), issuers are required to disclose specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. On October 
22,  2011,  a  worker  was  injured  at  the  Borealis  oxide  gold  heap  leach  worksite.  The  Company  took  immediate  actions  to  mitigate  risks  of  future  actions  and  terminated  3
employees, who failed to comply with mine safety regulations at Borealis. On November 2, 2011, MSHA inspected our Borealis operation following the accident and issued the
Company three Section 104(a) citations and three Section 104(d) citations. Section 104(a) citations, include citations for health or safety standards that could significantly and
substantially contribute to a serious injury if left unabated, and Section 104(d) citations, include citations for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety
standards. When the MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. No such
penalty  or  fine  has  yet  been  proposed.  Citations  and  orders  can  be  contested  and  appealed,  and  as  part  of  that  process,  are  often  reduced  in  severity  and  amount,  and  are
sometimes dismissed. Subsequent to quarter end we received a fee of $200.
[d] Due to the size, complexity, and nature of the Company’s operations, various legal and tax matters are outstanding from time to time. In the opinion of management, these
matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On January 31, 2012, the Company was served with a complaint alleging breach of contract that was filed in the First Judicial District Court for the State of Nevada in Carson
City by Borealis royalty holders which include the Cavell Trust, Hardrock Mining Company and John W. Whitney. The royalty holders allege that “advance royalties” which 
have been paid by Gryphon Gold are not recoverable and are payable during the duration of the mining lease. Gryphon Gold deducts previously paid “advance royalties” from 
production  royalties  payable  under  the  Borealis  mining  lease  agreement.  The  Company  believes  their  claims  are  without  merit  and  intends  to  vigorously  defend  against  the
claims. The Company is currently preparing a response to the complaint. As of December 31, 2011, no accrual had been made for an unfavorable outcome as the Company does
not have sufficient information to base an accrual on.
15. NON-CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES
During the nine months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company engaged in the following non-cash investing and financing activities:
Issuance of 7,726,500 shares at a fair value of $0.14 per share related to exercise of the option to fix the royalty at 5% 
Promissory and convertible notes issued related to exercise of the option to fix the royalty at 5% 
Capitalized construction in progress purchased with accounts payable 
Discount on notes payable by issuing warrants 
Shares issued for settlement of accounts payable 
Extinguishment of note payable by sale of discontinued operations 
Share consideration paid to former owners of discontinued operations

Cautionary Note Regarding Management’s Discussion and Analysis
This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes. The discussion and analysis of the
financial condition and results of operations are based upon the interim consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we review our estimates and assumptions. The estimates were based on historical experience
and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions,
but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Critical accounting policies, the policies we believe are most important
to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, are outlined below in “Critical Accounting Policies,” and have 
not changed significantly.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimates
The pre-feasibility study referenced in this quarterly report use the terms "mineral resource," "measured mineral resource," "indicated mineral resource" and "inferred mineral 
resource". We advise investors that these terms are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under the SEC’s Industry 
Guide 7 (“Guide 7”) and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. As a reporting issuer in Canada, we are required to 
prepare reports on our mineral properties in accordance with NI 43-101. We reference the report in this quarterly report for informational purposes only. Investors are cautioned
not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in the above categories will ever be converted into Guide 7 compliant reserves. "Inferred mineral resources" have a great
amount of uncertainty as to their existence,  and great uncertainty as to  their  economic and legal  feasibility.  It  cannot  be  assumed that all or any part of an inferred  mineral
resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, 
except  in  rare  cases.  Investors  are  cautioned  not  to  assume  that  all  or  any  part  of  an  inferred  mineral  resource  exists  or  is  economically  or  legally  mineable.  Disclosure  of
"contained pounds" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not
constitute "reserves" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.
Overview
Business Objectives
Gryphon Gold is in the business of acquiring, exploring, and developing gold properties in the United States, emphasizing the State of Nevada. Our objective is to increase value
of our shares through the exploration, development and extraction of gold from deposits, beginning with our Borealis property, located in Nevada’s Walker Lane Gold Belt (the 
“Borealis Property”). The development and extraction may be performed by us or by potential partners. We will also consider the acquisition and exploration of other potential
gold bearing properties within Nevada or areas that have a similar political risk profile.
The business plan for the Borealis Property is to develop, operate and efficiently produce gold and silver from identified leachable oxide reserves and to further expand the
sulphide resource through exploration, metallurgical design and project permitting and development. The successful development of the Borealis Oxide Heap Leach Project is
anticipated  to  provide  the  revenue  that  would  allow  for  the  further  development  of  the  Borealis  Property.  The  Borealis  Property  consists  of  unpatented  mining  claims  of
approximately 20 acres each, totaling about 15,020 acres, from which there was production in the past. The Borealis Property is a property that we believe has excellent potential
exploration targets as defined by past exploration success, geophysical targets and past successful mining.
On April 25, 2011, we released an the Pre-Feasibility Study which was furnished to the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed on April 26, 2011 and filed pursuant to 
Canadian securities laws and available on www.sedar.com. The Pre-Feasibility Study provided updated capital and operating cost estimates for a scaled down version of the mine 
start-up.
The Company raised capital for Phase 1 activities to construct the mine and processing plant and begin gold recovery; however, additional financing will be required to complete
the ADR, as well as capital for the expansion of crushing and processing facilities, to meet additional bonding requirements, and to provide working capital until cash from sales
of gold begins to flow to the Company. The Company is conducting negotiations with multiple parties to obtain the needed financing, subject to its ability to obtain the necessary
consent and approvals.
17
Phase 1 contemplates the completion of construction of a new leach pad and ponds and anticipates the startup of heap leach operations to extract gold from partially leached
heaps already identified on the Borealis Property. Construction of the project began in June 2011 and the leaching cycle began in late September 2011 with the first shipment of
loaded carbon accomplished in October 2011. Despite the rapid move to commercial shipments of loaded carbon and ultimately gold, the Project has faced a number of startup
issues resulting in considerably lower than expected production in the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011.
In the course of operations we experienced three key challenges that have resulted in less than anticipated production rates. As previously disclosed in a release dated November
9, 2011, the Borealis Oxide Heap Leach Project was severely limited in the amount of material that could be placed on the leach pad as result of the contractor being unable to
produce overliner in a timely manner. The delay in adding material to the leach pad resulted in reduced volumes of pregnant solution for the carbon process. This first challenge
was remedied in mid December. The second challenge we faced was the lower than planned delivery of leach pad material as a result of its crusher being removed from site in
early December for approximately two months for unscheduled maintenance. During that time, we were provided with a temporary crusher that did not meet the specifications for
planned production levels and resulted in an average of just over 33% of crusher utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the majority of January 2012. Thirdly, we were
advised that the pump that delivers barren solution to the leach pad was not the correct size and could not meet current operating requirements. As installed, it has been providing
only about 50% of original operating requirements, thus severely reducing the volume of flows to the leach pad. We are working towards positive cash flow from Phase 1, but
will likely require additional financing to complete the development of Phase 1.
Phase 2  is anticipated to expand  the leach pad;  mobilize the crushing  and  mining equipment; construct the  permanent gold recovery  plant and begin mining in  the Borealis
Property’s Borealis open pit. The main activities associated with full production are:
(cid:122) development of roads and infrastructure, and  
(cid:122) pre-stripping and development of the remaining oxide reserves  
(cid:122) Efficient mining and processing of 2 million tons of ore per year  
(cid:122) Processing of pregnant solutions from heap leach operations to produce gold and silver doré
The expected cash flow generated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 is anticipated to provide the resources needed to continue the exploration required to expand the oxide resources for
extending the mine life.
The mine life is estimated at 6 years with additional gold recovery in year seven with heap wash down. Expansion of the mine life past the initial 6-year estimate is dependent on 
the expansion of current mineralization or the discovery of additional mineralization through additional drilling on the property.
As anticipated in our plan under the Pre-Feasibility Study, groundbreaking occurred for the construction of the Borealis Oxide Heap Leach Project on June 6, 2011. Six deliveries
of loaded carbon containing 605 ounces of gold were made to Just Refiners, Inc. of Reno, NV during the quarter ended December 31, 2011. The approximate average settlement
price was $1,700 per ounce of gold. Just Refiners, Inc. advised us they could no longer take deliveries thus causing us to build inventories we could not covert in to cash until the
after the end of the quarter.
A successful Borealis Oxide Heap Leach Project is expected to provide the cash required to fulfill the long-term plan to further explore the Borealis Property with the objective of 
expanding its current known mineralization; however, additional financing will be required to complete the ADR, as well as capital for the expansion of crushing and procession
facilities, and provide working capital until cash from sales of gold begins to flow to the Company. The Company is conducting negotiations with multiple parties to obtain the
needed financing, which contain restrictive covenants regarding the Company’s ability to issue equity and debt securities.
The plan for the Borealis Property is based on the Plan of Operations approved by the U.S. Forest Service. The Plan of Operations does not present an economic analysis, and we
have not placed any information in the Plan of Operations regarding capital expenditures, operating costs, ore grade, anticipated revenues, or projected cash flows. The Plan of
Operations was based on the general economic concepts as presented in the Pre-Feasibility Study.
Borealis Property
During the nine months ended December 31, 2011, we completed construction of new leach pads, ponds, carbon columns, roads and infrastructure. Direct costs of materials,
labor,  equipment  and  supplies  used  in  construction  activities  are  capitalized  during  the  period  incurred.  Additionally,  certain  indirect  costs  are  capitalized  in  the  period  of
allocation. Interest expense during the construction period is allocated and capitalized in the period it is accrued. Loading of the leach pads began in early August and the leaching
process began on September 26, 2011.
For a complete history of our Borealis Property, please see our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 filed with the SEC on June 30, 2011.

Administration and Capital Resource Activities
May Unit Offering
On May 18, 2011, we closed a public offering of 80,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.125 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $10,000,000. As part of
the  offering,  the  underwriters  were  granted  an  over-allotment  option  to  cover  over-allotments.  One  underwriter  exercised  its  over-allotment  option  in  full  for  an  additional
6,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.125 per share for additional gross proceeds of $750,000. On May 24, 2011, the second underwriter exercised its over-allotment 
option in part for an additional 3,060,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.125 per share for additional gross proceeds of $382,500. After fulfilling the over-allotment 
options, we issued 89,060,000 shares and received $9.6 million in net proceeds.
July Debenture Offering
On July 27, 2011, we closed a $3,169,514 debt offering of units at a price of $1,000 CAD per unit. The offering was led by Acumen Capital Finance Partners Limited in Canada
and by Roth Capital Partners in the United States. Each unit consists of $1,000 CAD principal amount of 10% secured subordinated debentures maturing July 28, 2012 and 1,500
warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one common share in the capital of the Company at a price of $0.20 USD per share. The warrants expire on January
27, 2013.
The debentures bear interest from the date of issue at 10.0% per annum, payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing on
September 30, 2011. The debentures will mature 12 months from the closing date of the offering on July 28, 2012. The debentures were issued under a Trust Indenture, which
contains customary terms, conditions and covenants. The debentures are secured by a pledge of the shares of Borealis Mining Company and a general security interest in the
assets of the Company under the terms of a Pledge and Security Agreement.
November Debenture Offering
On November 22, 2011, the Company closed another $4.3 million debt offering of units of the Company. The offering was led by Acumen Capital Finance Partners Limited in
Canada and by Roth Capital Partners in the United States. Each unit consists of $1,000 CAD principal amount of 10% secured subordinated debentures maturing November 23,
2012 and 750 warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one common share of the Company at a price of $0.40 USD per share. The warrants expire on May
22, 2013.
The debentures bear interest from the date of issue at 10.0% per annum, payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, and September 30. The debentures will mature 12 months from
the  closing  date  of  the  offering  on  November  22,  2012.  The  debentures  were  issued  under  a  Trust  Indenture,  which  contains  terms,  conditions,  covenants  and  restrictive
covenants. The note indenture dated November 22, 2011, which governs the debentures includes restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the Company to issue equity and
debt securities. The debentures are secured under the terms of a Pledge and Security Agreement by a pledge of the shares of Borealis Mining Company and a general security
interest in the assets of the Company, which is subordinate to the security interest granted to holders of the debentures issued on July 27, 2011.
Acumen and Roth Capital were paid a cash commission of 6.5% of the gross proceeds of the offering
Fiscal 2012 Plan of Operations
Our long-term plan is to focus on the Borealis Property production through the Borealis Oxide Heap Leach Project. To further advance the Borealis Property, we expect to
continue exploration in the pediment areas of the Borealis Property.
We intend to continue to take all steps necessary to preserve our rights to the Borealis Property under the existing terms of the property lease. We also expect to work with the
United States Forest Service with the objectives of maintaining our permits under the plan of operations.
We currently plan to accomplish the following activities for the duration of fiscal 2012, which ends March 31, 2012 and the first quarter of fiscal 2013:
(cid:122) Complete construction of the Adsorption, Desorption and Recovery Plant (ADR) and commence the production of doré;  
(cid:122) Begin construction of Phase 1B elements, primarily the leach pad expansion.

Results of Operations
Three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to three months ended December 31, 2010
For the three months ended December 31, 2011, we had a net loss of $1,155,027 or $0.006 per share from continuing operations compared to a net loss of $655,013 or $0.007 per
share from continuing operations in the same period in the prior year. Construction of the project began in June 2011 and the leaching cycle began in late September 2011 with
the first shipment of loaded carbon accomplished in October 2011. Despite the rapid move to commercial shipments of loaded carbon and ultimately gold, the Project has faced a
number of startup issues resulting in considerably lower than expected production in the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011. In the course of operations we experienced
three key challenges that have resulted in less than anticipated production rates.
(cid:122) The amount of material placed on the leach pad was severely limited due to the contractor being unable to produce overliner in a timely manner;  
(cid:122) Lower than planned material delivered to the leach pad due to our crusher being removed from site for approximately two months and the temporary crusher not meeting
specifications for planned production levels; and
(cid:122) The pump delivering the barren solution to the leach pad is not the correct size and has only been providing approximately 50% of original operating requirements.
During the third quarter a total of 199,674 tons of material was placed on the heap leach pad for processing. The material is estimated to contain 6,223 ounces of gold and
estimated to recover approximately 2,800 ounces of gold. We sold loaded carbon containing 605 ounces of gold compared to no sales in same period of the previous year. The
approximate average settlement price was $1,700 per ounce of gold.
Exploration expenses during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 were $(26,394) compared to $115,930 in the same period in the prior year. The decrease is due to Company
resources  directed  towards  the  commencement  of  production,  with  a  majority  of  the  costs  incurred  on  the  property  being  capitalized  as  construction  in  progress.  The  credit
amount in exploration expenses in the current quarter was a result of a refund of $63,920 from the Bureau of Land Management for claim maintenance fees, which were expensed
in the prior year.
Management salaries and consulting fees in the quarter ended December 31, 2011 were $334,297 compared to $303,421 incurred in the quarter ended December 31, 2010. Total
non-cash compensation expense due to the recognition of costs related to stock options was $82,389 in the quarter ended December 31, 2011 compared to the prior year’s fiscal 
third quarter of $42,812.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $381,212 in the quarter ended December 31, 2011 compared to $123 in the same period in the prior year. This increase is due to
the interest incurred on the promissory and convertible notes issued to reduce the potential future obligations under the royalty and the debt offering completed in July 2011 and
November 2011.
Nine months ended December 31, 2011 compared to nine months ended December 31, 2010
For the nine months ended December 31, 2011, we had a net loss of $2,542,949 or $0.014 per share from continued operations and nil from discontinued operations compared to
a net loss of $2,495,617 or $0.028 per share from continued operations and net income of $635,708 or $0.007 per share from discontinued operations in the same period in the
prior year. Construction of the project began in June 2011 and the leaching cycle began in late September 2011 with the first shipment of loaded carbon accomplished in October
2011. Despite the rapid move to commercial shipments of loaded carbon and ultimately gold, the Project has faced a number of startup issues resulting in considerably lower than
expected  production  in  the  third  fiscal  quarter  ended  December  31,  2011.  In  the  course  of  operations  we  experienced  three  key  challenges  that  have  resulted  in  less  than
anticipated production rates.
(cid:122) The amount of material placed on the leach pad was severely limited due to the contractor being unable to produce overliner in a timely manner;  
(cid:122) Lower than planned material delivered to the leach pad due to our crusher being removed from site for approximately two months and the temporary crusher not meeting
specifications for planned production levels; and
(cid:122) The pump delivering the barren solution to the leach pad is not the correct size and has only been providing approximately 50% of original operating requirements.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2011 a total of 243,970 tons of material was placed on the heap leach pad for processing. The material is estimated to contain 7,886
ounces of gold and estimated to recover approximately 3,548 ounces of gold. We sold loaded carbon containing 605 ounces of gold compared to no sales in same period of the
previous year. The approximate average settlement price was $1,700 per ounce of gold.
20
Exploration expenses during the nine months ended December 31, 2011 were $68,860 compared to $694,358 in the prior year. The decrease is due to Company resources directed
towards commencement of production, with a majority of the costs incurred on the property being capitalized as construction in progress.
Management salaries and consulting fees in the nine months ended December 31, 2011 were $836,465 compared to $845,552 incurred in the 2010 nine-month period. Total non-
cash compensation expense due to the recognition of costs related to stock options was $181,401 in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $142,022 in the nine months ended
December 31, 2010.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $466,814 in the nine months ended December 31, 2011 compared to $997 in the same period in the prior year. This increase is
due to the interest incurred on the promissory and convertible notes issued to reduce the potential future obligations under the royalty and the debt offering completed in July
2011and November 2011.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal source of liquidity is cash from operations and cash raised by way of sale of common stock from treasury and other equity instruments, debt instruments or forms of
securities. Until we are able to complete the installation of our ADR plant, our ability to generate cash from production is dependent on our ability to process loaded carbon
through a third party processor or to sell loaded carbon.
Going Concern
The audit opinion for the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 includes a going concern qualification. Additional financing will be required
to  complete  the  Adsorption  Desorption  Recovery  Plant  (“ADR”),  to  provide  capital  for  the  expansion  of  crushing  and  procession  facilities,  to  fund  additional  bonding
requirements and to provide working capital until the Company receives positive cash flow from sales of gold The Company is currently conducting negotiations with multiple
parties to obtain the needed financing, subject to its ability to obtain the necessary consent and approvals. If future revenues do not result in positive cash flow, and the Company
is unable to raise additional capital, we will not be able to meet our obligations and may have to suspend or cease operations. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital 
may be inhibited by the restrictive covenants of the debentures the Company issued in November of 2011, which restrict the Company’s ability to issue equity and debt securities
absent consent of the Noteholders. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in achieving profitability, generating positive cash flow or raising additional
capital through placements of debt or equity. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $40,493,750 as at December 31, 2011, ($37,950,801 as at March 31, 2011), and without
positive operating cash flow or additional financing, the Company does not have sufficient cash on hand to fund normal operations for the next twelve months or satisfy the
current $7 million notes payable. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such assumption contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The recoverability of amounts shown for mineral property interests in the Company’s 
consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to arrange appropriate financing to complete the
development of its properties, the receipt of necessary permitting and upon achieving future profitable production or receiving proceeds from the disposition of properties. The
timing of such events occurring, if at all, is not yet determinable. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability

Subsequent Events
On January 31, 2012, the Company was served with a complaint alleging breach of contract that was filed in the First Judicial District Court for the State of Nevada in Carson
City by Borealis royalty holders which include the Cavell Trust, Hardrock Mining Company and John W. Whitney. The royalty holders allege that “advance royalties” which 
have been paid by Gryphon Gold are not recoverable and are payable during the duration of the mining lease. Gryphon Gold deducts previously paid “advance royalties” from 
production  royalties  payable  under  the  Borealis  mining  lease  agreement.  The  Company  believes  their  claims  are  without  merit  and  intends  to  vigorously  defend  against  the
claims. The Company is currently preparing its response to the complaint.
On February 3, 2012, Mr. John L. Key, Chief Executive Officer, and the Company entered into a mutual termination agreement under which Mr. John L. Key terminated his
employment and resigned as a director. The Board of Directors  also announced the termination by mutual agreement of John K. Key, General Manager of Borealis Mining
Company, our wholly owned subsidiary. Both of these terminations were effective immediately.
The  Company  announced  on  February  3,  2012,  the  appointment  of  James  T.  O’Neil  Jr.,  Chief  Financial  Officer,  as  Interim  Chief  Executive  Officer.  Mr.  O’Neil  was  also 
appointed to the Board of Directors. Marvin Kaiser, Director, was appointed as Chairman of the Board.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
At the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of, and with the participation of, our management, including the Interim Chief

the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report,  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  adequately  designed  and  effective  in  ensuring  that  (i)  information  required  to  be
disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in
applicable  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  material  information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  our  reports  filed  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our
management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, to allow for accurate required disclosure to be made on a timely basis.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
On January 31, 2012, the Company was served with a complaint alleging breach of contract that was filed in the First Judicial District Court for the State of Nevada in Carson
City by Borealis royalty holders which include the Cavell Trust, Hardrock Mining Company and John W. Whitney. The royalty holders allege that “advance royalties” which 
have been paid by Gryphon Gold are not recoverable and are payable during the duration of the mining lease. Gryphon Gold deducts previously paid “advance royalties” from

For more information on past legal proceedings, please see our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 filed with the SEC.
Item 1A. Risk Factors and Uncertainties
Other than as provided below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2011 which was 
filed with Securities and Exchange Commission on June 30, 2011.
Covenants  in  the  note  indenture  governing  the  debentures  we  issued  in  July  2011  and  November  2011  may  inhibit  our  ability  to  raise  capital  through  equity  or  debt
financings.
On July 27, 2011, we closed a $3,169,514 debt offering of units at a price of $1,000 CAD per unit, consisting of debentures and warrants. The debentures will mature 12 months
from the closing date of the offering on July 28, 2012. The debentures were issued under a Trust Indenture, which contains customary terms, conditions and covenants. The
debentures are secured by a pledge of the shares of Borealis Mining Company and a general security interest in the assets of the Company under the terms of a Pledge and
Security Agreement.
On November 22, 2011, we completed a $4.3 million debt offering of units of the Company consisting of debentures and warrants. The debentures will mature 12 months from
the  closing  date  of  the  offering  on  November  [23],  2012.  The  debentures  were  issued  under  a  Trust  Indenture,  which  contains  terms,  conditions,  covenants  and  restrictive
covenants. The note indenture limits the ability of the Company to issue any shares of capital stock of the Company or any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire
shares of capital stock or to issue certain types of debt securities or obtain certain types of loans. The debentures are secured under the terms of a Pledge and Security Agreement
by a pledge of the shares of Borealis Mining Company and a general security interest in the assets of the Company, which is subordinate to the security interest granted to holders
of the debentures issued on July 27, 2011. If we cannot successfully raise additional capital to meet our ongoing operating costs we could be forced to curtail or cease operations.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2011, all transactions in which we offered and sold unregistered securities pursuant to exemptions under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended we reported on current reports on Form 8K.
Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities.
None.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Mining operations and properties in the United States are subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety 
and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), 
issuers are required to disclose specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. During our fiscal 
quarter ended December 31, 2011, on October 22, 2011, a worker was injured at the Borealis oxide gold heap leach worksite. The Company took immediate actions to mitigate
risks of future actions and terminated 3 employees, who failed to comply with mine safety regulations at Borealis. On November 2, 2011, MSHA inspected our Borealis operation
following the accident and issued the Company three Section 104(a) citations and three Section 104(d) citations. Section 104(a) citations, include citations for health or safety
standards  that  could  significantly  and  substantially  contribute  to  a  serious  injury  if  left  unabated,  and  Section  104(d)  citations,  include  citations  for  unwarrantable  failure  to
comply with mandatory health or safety standards. When the MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that
the operator is ordered to pay. A $200 fine has been issued. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and
amount, and are sometimes dismissed.
