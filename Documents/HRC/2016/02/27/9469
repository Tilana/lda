<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> During 2006, four international workshops were convened to assist the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises in clarifying some of the key legal issues raised by 
his mandate.  The workshops addressed the following issues:  government regulation of 
corporate human rights issues; corporate complicity in human rights violations; the role of 
extraterritorial jurisdiction in improving the accountability of transnational corporations (TNCs); 
and the bases for attributing human rights responsibilities to TNCs under international law.  
Participants included academic experts, legal practitioners and representatives from 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and at each workshop best efforts were made to 
achieve broad regional representation. 
</p>
<p> Summaries of all four workshops are available on the Special Representative&#8217;s website.<b>1</b>  
This addendum to the 2007 report of the Special Representative combines the summaries of the 
New York workshop on corporate responsibility under international law and the Brussels 
workshop on extraterritorial jurisdiction (which expanded on the first workshop on government 
regulation).  A detailed report of the complicity workshop is being produced by the convenors 
and should be available in early 2007.  The Special Representative and his team have benefited 
greatly from all these discussions and wish to thank the convenors of each workshop, as well as 
the participants, for their time and contributions. 
</p>
<p> The New York workshop considered four issues:  whether corporate responsibility for 
human rights already exists under international law; how State human rights obligations might 
otherwise be translated into corporate obligations; the problem of regulating TNCs in &#8220;weak 
governance zones&#8221;; and the extent to which States&#8217; duty to protect against human rights abuses 
by non-State actors requires them to regulate the overseas activities of TNCs.   
</p>
<p> On the one hand, there was a broad consensus among the participants that the problem is 
not simply one of under-enforcement of existing corporate duties:  substantial work is needed to 
adequately define the scope and content of corporate responsibility for human rights violations 
under international law.  Specifically, should corporate responsibility vary depending on the 
right at issue, or on the corporation&#8217;s nexus to the affected &#8220;rights-holders&#8221; - and how should this 
nexus be assessed?  Corporate duties may also need to be balanced against other considerations, 
such as the respective functions and capacities of TNCs and States.  On the other hand, 
participants cautioned against over-simplifying the current state of international law, as this is 
one area in which legal doctrine appears to be lagging behind practice.   
</p>
<p> One proposal was to develop an international statement of public policy that would 
define a minimum corporate duty to respect (and possibly protect) human rights, with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights seen as a good starting point for identifying appropriate 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>standards.  There was broad agreement that a corporate duty to fulfil rights would only be 
appropriate in very limited circumstances, such as where corporations have effective control of 
an area or assume government functions.   
</p>
<p> There was consensus that the concept of &#8220;weak governance zones&#8221; - that is, areas in 
which the territorial (or host) State is unwilling or unable to exercise its authority - was of little 
help in defining the respective legal responsibilities of home and host States in regulating TNCs 
operating in such areas, or the legal responsibilities of those TNCs themselves.  Participants 
noted the need to avoid modern-day imperialism on the part of home States, while at the same 
time acknowledging that home State action may often be necessary to ensure that violations are 
actually addressed.  One option that was discussed was increasing home State leverage over 
TNCs through various &#8220;points of control&#8221; in the home State itself, such as export credit agency 
financing or listing on national stock exchanges.  Participants agreed on the need for public and 
private sector actors to pressure Governments for leadership on these and other issues, in order to 
move beyond an individual liability model to one involving shared responsibility for corporate 
human rights issues among all relevant actors. 
</p>
<p> The final topic in New York was whether States are under any constraints in regulating 
the overseas activities of their TNCs.   
</p>
<p> This was also the central issue at the Brussels workshop, which focused on three areas of 
inquiry:  clarifying the general international law principles governing the exercise of 
extraterritorial jurisdiction by States; specific questions raised by the regulation of the 
extraterritorial activities of TNCs; and the provision of effective sanctions against TNCs and 
remedies for victims.   
</p>
<p> Participants in Brussels agreed that, apart from the principle of non-intervention in the 
internal affairs of another State, there are no significant international legal impediments to States 
exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction.  However, whether they are <i>required</i> to do so remains an 
open question.  While there may be an obligation to do so in situations involving serious 
international crimes subject to universal jurisdiction (where the suspect is present on the State&#8217;s 
territory), it is not clear whether this would require action against legal as well as natural 
persons.  It is also unclear whether such regulation would have to take a particular form (that is, 
criminal, civil or administrative). 
</p>
<p> The workshop discussed two particular challenges in regulating TNCs:   the need to 
determine corporate nationality in order to establish State jurisdiction, and the need to look 
beyond the formal separation of legal entities in a corporate group to attribute liability (for 
example, by &#8220;piercing the corporate veil&#8221; to hold the parent company accountable for its 
subsidiaries&#8217; acts, or by holding the parent directly liable for its own acts and omissions in 
relation to its subsidiaries).  There was real interest in home States requiring increased human 
rights reporting and impact assessments from &#8220;their&#8221; TNCs. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> With respect to meeting the needs of victims, participants debated whether particular 
sanctions against TNCs were either required by, or were more likely to be accepted as being less 
intrusive under, international law.  They discussed measures to resolve jurisdictional conflicts 
between States, as well as incentives to encourage States to exercise jurisdiction in the first 
place.  Complementary market-based mechanisms (including the &#8220;contractualizing&#8221; of human 
rights requirements) were also considered.  The workshop concluded that practical measures are 
required to ensure that victims have access to home country remedies; attention should also be 
given to improving victims&#8217; access to law-making institutions and not just after-the-fact 
determinations of liability.  While host State legal systems should generally be respected and 
strengthened, it was agreed that the overarching goal must always be to provide victims with 
justice. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Over the course of 2006, four international workshops were convened to assist the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General in clarifying some of the key legal issues raised 
by his mandate.  In addition to the Special Representative&#8217;s team, participants included academic 
experts, legal practitioners and representatives from non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  
At each workshop, best efforts were made to achieve broad regional representation. 
</p>
<p>2. The first workshop was convened on 15 June 2006 at Chatham House (The Royal 
Institute of International Affairs) in London, and chaired by Elizabeth Wilmshurst of the 
Institute&#8217;s International Law programme.<b>2  </b>The workshop explored government regulation of 
corporate human rights issues; two areas of particular concern were the potential uses of 
extraterritorial legislation and civil litigation against transnational corporations (TNCs).   
</p>
<p>3. The second workshop was held on 23-24 October in Oslo and was hosted by the Council 
on Ethics for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund.  The workshop explored political, legal 
and ethical perspectives on corporate complicity in human rights violations.  A detailed report on 
the workshop is being produced by the Council and is expected in Spring 2007.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>4. The third workshop was held on 3 and 4 November, in Brussels.<b>4</b>   It was co-hosted by 
Olivier De Schutter from the Catholic University of Louvain and Paul De Hert from the Free 
University of Brussels.  Financial support was also provided by the Belgian Federal Public 
Service Foreign Affairs, External Trade and Development Cooperation, and by the Human 
Security Policy Division of the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  
The workshop examined how extraterritorial legislation could be used to improve the 
accountability of TNCs for human rights violations, and was designed to build upon discussions 
from the June 2006 Chatham House workshop. 
</p>
<p>5. The fourth and last workshop took place at New York University on 17 November 2006.<b>5</b>  
Its purpose was to clarify the bases for attributing human rights responsibilities to TNCs under 
international law.  The one-day brainstorming session was convened jointly by the NYU Center 
for Human Rights and Global Justice and Realizing Rights:  the Ethical Globalization Initiative, 
with additional financial support from the Government of Canada.  Philip Alston (Co-Director of 
the NYU Center) and Mary Robinson (President of Realizing Rights) were the joint chairs.

<p>6. All the workshops were conducted on the basis of the internationally recognized 
&#8220;Chatham House Rule&#8221;, meaning that participants are free to use the information arising out of 
the meetings, but the identity and affiliation of the speakers and participants are kept 
confidential.  Accordingly, this Addendum provides a general record of the New York workshop 
on corporate responsibility under international law and the Brussels workshop on 
extraterritoriality, which expanded on the Chatham House meeting.  As noted above, a report of 
the Oslo workshop should be available in early 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>I. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW:   
SUMMARY OF THE NEW YORK WORKSHOP 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Summary of proceedings and introductory remarks 
</b></p>
<p>7. The workshop was organized around the following broad question:  in the absence of 
States acting to attach direct obligations for human rights to corporations, are there any potential 
grounds under international law for doing so?  The day was divided into four sessions, with 
individual participants asked to lead different ones: 
</p>
<p> (a) Framing the issue; 
</p>
<p> (b) Transposing State obligations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Exceptional cases;  
</p>
<p> (d) State responsibility. 
</p>
<p>8. The co-chairs opened the workshop by inviting participants to consider the ways in which 
international law has evolved from a purely State-based enterprise to a decision-making process 
involving a range of participants including individuals, NGOs, TNCs, and international 
organizations.  The last two decades have witnessed an evolution in societal notions of corporate 
responsibility at both the regional and national levels, as well as a proliferation of voluntary 
corporate codes of conduct and other market-based initiatives.  In what ways are, or should, 
these changes be reflected in international law?  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Framing the issue 
</b></p>
<p>9. The first session focused on whether the topic of the workshop was correctly framed:  are 
there already inherent obligations on TNCs, at minimum, to respect human rights in international 
law?  Is the issue simply one of underenforcement? 
</p>
<p>10. To stimulate debate, the discussion began with a presentation of the classic view of States 
in international law as the primary human rights duty holders.  According to this view, beyond a 
narrow category of international crimes (torture, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes 
and slavery), corporate accountability for human rights should be the responsibility of States.  
The international community should insist on robust enforcement by States of their duty to 
respect, protect and fulfil human rights norms through the regulation of private actors.  However, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>this needs to go beyond merely providing for &#8220;after the fact&#8221; judicial determinations of liability 
once violations have already occurred.  The boundaries of current doctrine determining when the 
actions of TNCs can be treated as State action, for example when a TNC is effectively exercising 
State authority or is controlled by the State, and when States can be held complicit in corporate 
abuses should also be further explored.   
</p>
<p>11. The classic view holds that the main obstacles to direct corporate responsibility under 
international law include:  a lack of State practice supporting such a development; likely 
resistance by States (especially States from the global South that are actively seeking foreign 
investment); the difficulty of TNCs in relying on the defences available to States confronted with 
new obligations (such as State sovereignty, the ability to opt out, lodge reservations, etc.); and 
problems with attributing international legal personality to corporations.   
</p>
<p>12. In response, other participants pointed out that this approach oversimplifies the existing 
state of international law.  First, it is important to distinguish between possible sources of 
obligations on TNCs within international human rights law, and particularly between the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the core human rights treaties (including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights).  This is because various key principles in the former (there is debate 
over how many) now form part of customary international law and do not depend on State 
consent for their binding effect.  The classic approach also fails to take into account 
developments in international environmental and labour law, that have already established direct 
obligations on TNCs, and it does not provide a coherent explanation for the imposition of human 
rights obligations on international organizations but not on TNCs.  Further, it ignores the 
importance of soft law (including public policy statements voluntarily adopted by Governments, 
such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Tripartite Declaration 
of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy) in the crystallization of 
standards.   
</p>
<p>13. Turning to the regional level, participants discussed provisions of the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, which imposes on individuals &#8220;horizontal duties&#8221; that are owed to 
other non-State actors, namely &#8220;family and society, the State and other legally recognized 
communities and the international community&#8221;.  And at the national level, United States courts 
have considered claims under the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) involving prolonged arbitrary 
detention and freedom of expression, in addition to the international crimes mentioned above.  
Participants also noted that the ATCA jurisprudence only establishes rules for incorporating 
international human rights norms within domestic United States law; the cases do not prevent the 
existence of other norms applying to TNCs, although they may not be judicially cognizable in 
United States federal courts.  Participants also discussed key examples from the national systems 
of India and South Africa. 
</p>
<p>14. Another participant argued that administrative law and regulation has a critical yet 
underappreciated part to play, giving law an instrumental rather than a purely standard-setting 
role in this area.   </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>15. A regulatory approach is relational in that it involves a range of actors (beyond the 
individual parties to a traditional legal dispute) and requires negotiation, balancing and 
compromise, processes that are not typically associated with a traditional human rights-based 
approach.  Several different models of emerging international regulation were identified, 
including:  regulation by intergovernmental organizations (such as the emissions trading system); 
what has been called &#8220;network governance&#8221; among leading actors in certain sectors (for 
example, within the financial services sector); hybrid public-private regulatory structures (such 
as the Montreal Protocol on ozone depletion); and purely private regulation (such as the fair 
trade certification system).  However, increased regulation obviously creates its own 
externalities, as it requires standards and processes for holding the regulators themselves 
accountable.  In this respect, classic administrative law procedural norms (such as transparency, 
the entitlement to a hearing, and proportionality in remedies) could be especially helpful. 
</p>
<p>16. As an alternative to a purely legal approach to corporate responsibility, a moral or ethical 
framework was also proposed.  On this view, corporations are moral agents.  As economic 
agents, however, they possess only relatively narrow moral personalities and, therefore, cannot 
be seen as having a general duty to fulfil human rights in the same way that States do.  Thus, 
their moral duties would include: 
</p>
<p> (a) To avoid depriving others of their human rights, or contributing to such 
deprivation;  
</p>
<p> (b) To help protect the human rights of others from deprivation where the TNC has a 
direct responsibility (as in the case of its employees), or where the protection of rights is 
otherwise a direct outcome of ordinary corporate activities;  
</p>
<p> (c) To aid those who have been deprived of their rights, but only where the TNC 
itself has done the depriving (as in the case of a community that has been required to move in 
order to make way for a company site). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Transposing State obligations 
</b></p>
<p>17. This session explored possible ways in which State obligations could be translated into 
corporate obligations under international law.  The issues included whether corporate 
responsibility would vary depending on the right at issue, or the corporation&#8217;s nexus to the 
affected rights-holders, as well as the need to balance other considerations such as sovereignty, 
and the functions and capacity of TNCs. 
</p>
<p>18. Participants debated whether to &#8220;move up&#8221; from existing obligations on individuals under 
international law or &#8220;down&#8221; from State obligations.  It was acknowledged that the former would 
lead to an incomplete set of rights but would at least start with the most accepted set of duties, 
i.e. those relating to international crimes.   
</p>
<p>19. One proposal for determining the extent of corporate responsibility was to consider the 
following factors:  the relationship between the TNC and the Government; the nexus between the 
TNC and the affected population; and a balancing of the right at issue with the legitimate 
interests of the corporation (except in the case of certain non-derogable rights).   </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>20. The nexus element could be based on geographical proximity, control (e.g. via contract), 
or market power.  The common law tort standard of &#8220;reasonable foreseeability&#8221; was debated as a 
potential tool for determining proximity, although this might lead to an industry-based approach 
(with what was &#8220;reasonable&#8221; in each case depending on industry practice).  The point was made 
that TNCs should not be able to use a demand for specificity as a pretext for avoiding liability, 
and that they already engage in risk management in relation to what is reasonably foreseeable.   
</p>
<p>21. An alternative approach to deriving corporate liability was proposed.  This would start 
with a &#8220;do no harm&#8221; standard, requiring corporations to respect human rights and extending this 
to the corporation&#8217;s contractors, based on the rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights.  It would expand into a duty to fulfil where the corporation has effective control 
of an area or assumes government functions.  One participant proposed that a declaration of 
&#8220;international public policy&#8221; to this effect be drafted.   
</p>
<p><b>D.  Exceptional cases 
</b></p>
<p>22. This session considered the usefulness of the concept of &#8220;weak governance zones&#8221; - areas 
where the territorial State is  &#8220;unable or unwilling&#8221; to exercise its authority - in defining 
corporate responsibility under international human rights law, as well as the respective roles of 
home and host (territorial) States in regulating TNCs operating in weak governance zones. 
</p>
<p>23. There was a general consensus that the concept of weak governance zones was unhelpful 
in this context.  Defining a weak governance zone is an inherently political process, which 
creates more rather than less uncertainty about corporate obligations, although it might be made 
less political, for example by linking it to the definition of refugee-generating countries or 
adopting a sector-specific rather than regional approach.  The concept also ignores the potential 
for corporate power (and abuse) in developed countries where, for example, extractive industry 
operations often pit local, frequently disempowered, communities against the central 
Government.  Some participants also queried the usefulness of distinguishing &#8220;unable&#8221; from 
&#8220;unwilling&#8221;, and were concerned by the potential for Governments to abuse the concept to evade 
their responsibilities.   
</p>
<p>24. The option of home State courts exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction in relation to weak 
governance zones but applying host State laws was considered; however, some participants felt 
that this was too close to modern-day imperialism.  Another alternative would be to base judicial 
enforcement on the international obligations of either the home or host State, or on their shared 
obligations, but this raises the obvious problem of differential ratification of international 
treaties. 
</p>
<p>25. Participants also discussed how to identify the home State of a TNC:  one suggestion was 
that beyond incorporation, financing through export credits or the national stock exchange 
provided an obvious point of control, creating a political responsibility on the home State to 
regulate such corporations.  These and other levers may become increasingly relevant if 
incorporation starts to lose its traditionally territorial aspect:  for example, two jurisdictions in 
Canada no longer require the physical presence of company headquarters or directors in that 
jurisdiction for incorporation to occur. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p><b>E.  State responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>26. The final session examined whether State responsibility could be pushed further to 
require States to regulate the activities of their TNCs abroad. 
</p>
<p>27. Given the problems flowing from inconsistent ratification of the core human rights 
treaties, the workshop considered whether the customary international law rules on State 
responsibility provided an alternative basis for State regulation of corporate human rights 
responsibilities.  Under customary international law, States are obliged to exercise due diligence 
in protecting foreigners on their territory, including from action by non-State actors.  Even 
assuming that this obligation now extends to a State&#8217;s own nationals, there was broad agreement 
that it would be hard to stretch it to require States to provide a remedy for the extraterritorial 
activities of TNCs. 
</p>
<p>28. Participants debated whether, where a home State acts in a positive way to contribute to 
an extraterritorial violation by a TNC (for example, by providing financing to the TNC, or 
support through its embassy in the host State), the home State will be in breach of its 
international obligations.  Even if it was in breach, it is unclear whether another State would be 
willing to bring an action against the home State for the breach, although it might provide 
stronger grounds for domestic social pressure on the home State.  Where a State has done 
nothing to regulate the overseas activities of its TNCs, there was broad agreement that neither 
the treaty regime nor customary international law currently impose an obligation on States to 
regulate, as opposed to allowing States the freedom to do so (which they clearly have under the 
doctrine of &#8220;active personality&#8221;).<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>29. One participant questioned whether, if a State does decide to exercise this freedom, it is 
then required to provide a remedy, and whether that remedy must be adjudicative in nature. 
</p><p>30. There was strong support for looking beyond national law and the human rights treaty 
mechanisms, and thinking creatively about additional avenues for pursuing these issues.  Other 
potential venues in which these issues could be raised include: 
</p>
<p> (a) The existing framework of OECD National Contact Points; 
</p>
<p> (b) The ILO Subcommittee on Multinational Enterprises; 
</p>
<p> (c) The terms of international investment treaties (for example, including human 
rights clauses which provide for either a financial penalty by the company or allow the State to 
sue the company in the event of a violation, or which, at a minimum, require an international 
arbitrator to take human rights considerations into account as part of their assessment); 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p> (d) National human rights commissions (which, to date, have not tended to focus on 
private actors); 
</p>
<p> (e) The main regional human rights mechanisms.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>F.  Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>31. The workshop concluded with reflections by the co-chairs and the Special 
Representative.  The co-chairs emphasized the lack of government leadership on these issues, 
and the real need for private and public sector actors to pressure Governments for change and for 
clarity.  They noted that it was important to simultaneously push for improved State 
responsibility in this area (for example, through the regional human rights systems and the 
United Nations treaty bodies), while also encouraging greater participation by non-State actors in 
the debate (as is being increasingly done through the Human Rights Council individual mandate 
system).  Such an approach recognizes the need for &#8220;shared responsibility&#8221;, discussed below, and 
would help build relationships among the relevant actors. 
</p>
<p>32. The point was made that, from a legal perspective, doctrine is lagging well behind rapidly 
developing practice; it is not surprising that attention, and legal responses, have focused on the 
worst cases of abuse but this should not preclude a more comprehensive and principled 
approach. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Representative then summed up broad themes and areas of agreement from 
the workshop: 
</p>
<p> (a) As important as litigation is, it is vital to look beyond it to identify as many 
leverage points as possible, including public policy regulation, market-based mechanisms and 
social processes, in developing a coherent approach to corporate human rights responsibility; 
</p>
<p> (b) There was debate over the possibility, desirability and/or necessity of specifying a 
list of discrete human rights obligations on TNCs by going &#8220;article by article&#8221; through the 
existing human rights treaties.  However, there was consensus among the participants that the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights provided a good starting point for identifying 
appropriate standards; 
</p>
<p> (c) There was a general sense that TNCs should not be subject to a duty to fulfil, 
except in certain limited situations, where TNCs may need to act to restore a right of which they 
had deprived others; 
</p>
<p> (d) While the concept of weak governance zones was generally considered unhelpful, 
it was recognized that Governments were likely to continue to use it in framing their own 
regimes for regulating the extraterritorial activity of their TNCs; 
</p>
<p> (e) Greater clarity is needed on how the relevant nexus between a corporation and an 
affected population should be defined; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p> (f) The potential role of incentives (ranging from market-based mechanisms to the 
recognition of &#8220;corporate culture&#8221; in criminal law and sentencing guidelines) should be further 
considered; 
</p>
<p> (g) There is a general need for increased attention to these issues within existing 
mechanisms, particularly the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>34. Finally, the Special Representative drew attention to the notion of &#8220;shared responsibility&#8221; 
(drawing on the work of the political philosopher Iris Marion Young in an article distributed as 
background reading for the workshop).<b>7</b>  This view recognizes that the challenges arising from 
globalization are structural in character, involving governance gaps and governance failures.  
Accordingly, they cannot be resolved by an individual liability model of responsibility alone but 
also need to be dealt with in their own right.  This requires a model of strategically coherent 
distributed action focused on realigning the relationships among actors, including States, 
corporations and civil society.  Moreover, rule-making in this domain must factor in the likely 
reactions by all social actors that would be affected by the adoption of new rules.  In short, he 
stressed the need for both a systemic and dynamic framework in order to respond adequately and 
effectively to the human rights challenges posed by corporate globalization.

SUMMARY OF THE BRUSSELS WORKSHOP 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Summary of proceedings and introductory remarks

<p>35. The workshop was divided into the following areas of discussion: 
</p>
<p> (a) Extraterritorial jurisdiction under international law; 
 (b) Specific questions raised by exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction over TNCs; 
 (c) Sanctions and remedies, including comparisons between criminal, civil and

</p>
<p>international law where a national court applies the law of another State, and executive (or 
enforcement) extraterritorial jurisdiction, under which a State deploys its organs overseas. 
</p><p>38. In opening the workshop, the Special Representative noted that the issue of 
extraterritorial jurisdiction was a relatively small part of an extremely broad mandate.  He 
explained that the focus of the workshop on extraterritorial jurisdiction did not mean he was 
neglecting other pertinent issues.  The Special Representative noted an emerging trend to use 
extraterritorial responsibility as a potential tool for overcoming weaknesses in corporate 
accountability, but looked forward to constructive debate on the challenges involved. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Extraterritorial jurisdiction under international law 
Aims and introductory remarks 
</b></p>
<p>39. The main aim of this session was to understand better when States may, and/or are 
required to, exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction.  While the participants accepted that there was 
some overlap between these questions and substantive issues, such as what types of human rights 
obligations should be imposed by extraterritorial legislation, they agreed to focus on 
jurisdictional issues. 
</p><p>40. The discussion began at a very practical level, with the political feasibility of States 
exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction over companies.  It ranged over various issues including 
differing national approaches to holding legal persons criminally responsible; the potential role 
of civil litigation (with the ongoing Bhopal case as an example); and procedural issues such as 
international cooperation in relation to evidence-gathering. 
</p>
<p>41. Participants agreed to focus the discussion mainly on the exercise of extraterritorial 
jurisdiction by a home State over the overseas activities of TNCs with some link to that State. 
<b>Is it permissible to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction? 
</b>42. Participants explored whether States have unlimited latitude under international law to 
exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction.  There was general agreement that a nationality link adds 
support to the exercise of jurisdiction, unless the State is exercising universal jurisdiction, as may 
be invoked for a limited number of international crimes (crimes against humanity, genocide, war 
crimes, torture, forced disappearances).  There was also broad reference to an overarching 
requirement of &#8220;reasonableness&#8221;, including respect for the principle of non-intervention in the 
internal affairs of the territorial State. 
</p>
<p>43. In exploring this limitation, participants discussed whether exercising extraterritorial 
jurisdiction with the goal of protecting human rights could amount to intervention through 
coercion.  One participant argued that international law has developed to the extent that such an 
exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction would not amount to coercion.  Others agreed that until 
there is a definitive rule prohibiting the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction for human rights 
purposes, States are free to do so.  Nevertheless, some participants were less sure and sought 
more discussion of the meaning of reasonableness and coercion.  Nonetheless, participants 
generally agreed that apart from the non-intervention principle, there are no significant 
international legal impediments to exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p><b>Are States required to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction? 
</b>44. The discussion then turned to whether there are any situations in which States are 
required to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction.  Participants first questioned whether the duty to 
protect, incorporating the duty to exercise due diligence to prevent abuse and provide an 
effective remedy, somehow incorporates a duty to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
45. The participants looked to the concept of international cooperation and guidance 
in international human rights treaties as a starting point.  They questioned whether any 
United Nations human rights treaty bodies, such as the Human Rights Committee and the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), as well as any of the regional 
human rights bodies, provide guidance on whether the duty to protect requires the exercise of 
extraterritorial jurisdiction by a State, at least where the primary perpetrator is a national of 
that State. 
</p>
<p>46. While some participants considered a duty to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction could 
be implied from commentary from United Nations treaty bodies (namely the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) and regional human rights bodies, others were more 
sceptical.  Accordingly, the participants agreed that whether the duty to protect extends 
extraterritorially is an open question requiring further debate.  In this context, the Special 
Representative mentioned that his research team is mapping commentary from the core 
United Nations human rights treaties on State obligations regarding corporate human rights 
abuse, including any references to extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
</p><p>47. The debate then turned to whether other areas of international law support the existence 
of a general duty to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction.  At the outset, it seemed there was at 
least some agreement that States should exercise universal jurisdiction for breaches of 
international humanitarian law where the defendant is present on its territory.  However, 
participants then diverged as to whether there was a wider duty to exercise universal jurisdiction.  
They also debated which crimes trigger the duty and whether universal jurisdiction requires 
actions against legal persons rather than individuals. 
</p>
<p>48. Participants also discussed from where, and how, obligations other than those related to 
universal jurisdiction might arise.  Little agreement was found on this issue but there was some 
consensus that even if a general duty did exist, it was unlikely to require a particular form of 
action (i.e. civil or criminal) against legal persons, even if some kind of criminal regulation was 
required for natural persons.  Rather, the object might be to afford an effective remedy, instead 
of being required to facilitate either civil or criminal action. 
</p>
<p>49. Accordingly, the most definitive conclusion one could take out of this discussion is that 
States have certain obligations under universal jurisdiction, but that otherwise both the source 
and content of any general duties regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction remain unclear. 
<b>Ways in which the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction could be affected 
</b>50. Participants discussed how extraterritorial jurisdiction could be limited to safeguard the 
territorial State&#8217;s interests.  In particular, the background report prepared for the workshop 
referred to: </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p> (a) Prosecutorial expediency;  
</p>
<p> (b) The doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens<b></b></i><b>9 </b>and other subsidiarity doctrines designed 
to respect the primacy of the territorial State; 
</p>
<p> (c) Application of the <i>non bis in idem<b></b></i><b>10</b> rule where the territorial State has prosecuted 
the same acts; 
</p>
<p> (d) The doctrine of double criminality where a State may decide to exercise 
jurisdiction over an action only if that action is also criminalized in the territorial State; 
 (e) Situations where jurisdiction is limited because the territorial State mandated the 
actions of the TNC. 
</p>
<p>51. Participants highlighted that not all States are equipped to exercise extraterritorial 
jurisdiction.  They gave examples from developing countries where the State lacks both the 
ability and inclination to exercise jurisdiction, particularly where it seeks to encourage 
companies registered on its territory to expand their overseas operations.  There were also 
examples of developed countries choosing not to prioritize evidence-gathering for extraterritorial 
cases, especially where such practices are seen as too costly, time-consuming or politically 
hazardous. 
</p>
<p>52. Arguments were raised as to whether a duty to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction could 
impose unrealistic expectations on States to keep abreast of every overseas abuse by a related 
TNC.  Participants also suggested that another practical consequence could be TNCs delegating 
more activities to local companies to avoid liability. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Questions raised by exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction over TNCs 
Aims and introductory remarks 
</b></p>
<p>53. The discussion then turned to two key issues in holding TNCs accountable via 
extraterritorial jurisdiction, namely:  determining a company&#8217;s nationality; and looking beyond 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
  </b>Meaning, literally, a forum that is not convenient.  The doctrine is often used by defendants in 
</p>
<p>foreign court proceedings to argue that the forum chosen by the plaintiff creates an undue 
hardship, often because of difficulties in bringing witnesses or evidence to the foreign court.  The 
requirements for proving a <i>forum non conveniens </i>claim vary amongst common law jurisdictions.  
The doctrine does not exist in this exact form in civil law jurisdictions, although similar 
balancing tests may be carried out. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>Meaning, literally, not twice for the same thing.  The principle applies to limit proceedings 
where a party has already faced legal proceedings for the same matter.  For example, a court in 
the home State might decide to reject jurisdiction in a case against a corporation if the 
corporation has already faced legal proceedings in the host State or any other State that has 
assumed jurisdiction. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/35/Add.2

</p>
<p>its formal legal structure for the purposes of attaching accountability, such as where 
abuse may have been committed by the subsidiaries of a TNC or its contractual partners. 
</p>
<p><b>Determining the &#8220;nationality&#8221; of the corporation 
</b></p>
<p>54. There was general agreement that international law does not prescribe any particular 
method for determining the nationality of legal persons.  However, nationality is generally based 
on place of incorporation, location of registered main office or the principal centre of business.  
Participants debated whether other factors should be considered, such as whether there is a 
genuine link with the home State.  Participants also queried whether investment treaties provide 
any hints as to nationality and whether the parent company&#8217;s nationality should determine its 
subsidiary&#8217;s nationality.  The requirement for a genuine link was mentioned, both regarding a 
State&#8217;s ability to exercise jurisdiction, and to protest against regulations imposed on &#8220;their&#8221; 
TNCs by other States. 
</p>
<p><b>Piercing the corporate veil 
</b></p>
<p>55. Three solutions to the problem of the formal legal separation of corporate entities were 
discussed, together with some of their benefits and disadvantages: 
</p>
<p>Solution to the separation of 
legal entities within the 
multinational group 
</p>
<p>Description Advantages/disadvantages 
</p>
<p>Classic derivative liability 
(also known as &#8220;piercing the 
corporate veil&#8221;) 
</p>
<p>Close examination of the 
factual relationship between the 
parent and the subsidiary to 
identify abuse of the corporate 
form. 
</p>
<p>Real disincentive for parent 
companies to control the 
day-to-day operations of their 
subsidiaries, and may lead to 
competing attempts to exercise 
extraterritorial jurisdiction 
over foreign companies. 
</p>
<p>The &#8220;integrated enterprise&#8221; 
approach 
</p>
<p>Absolute presumption that the 
subsidiary&#8217;s acts are attributable 
to the parent because of the 
interconnectedness of what 
would otherwise be separate 
legal entities. 
</p>
<p>Clear incentive to the parent to 
control its subsidiaries but 
implies extraterritorial 
jurisdiction being exercised 
over foreign entities as part of 
the &#8220;integrated&#8221; multinational 
group, which may raise 
problems in terms of 
jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>Direct liability of the parent 
company 
</p>
<p>May arise from failure to 
exercise due diligence in 
controlling subsidiaries&#8217; acts 
and therefore may relate to both 
the parent company&#8217;s acts 
(where there is direct or indirect 
involvement in the subsidiary&#8217;s 
acts) and omissions through 
failing to control the subsidiary.  
</p>
<p>If only actions are relevant and 
omissions are ignored, there 
could be a disincentive for 
parent companies to control 
the day-to-day operations of 
their subsidiaries. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>56. At a more practical level, there was genuine interest in the proposal that home States 
should consider requiring their companies to conduct human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) 
and to report periodically on issues materially related to their human rights performance through 
their subsidiaries (and possibly also their contract partners).  However, participants recognized 
the obvious issues of inconsistent reporting standards and accountability mechanisms, associated 
costs and the need to consider whether such reporting could jeopardize commercial secrets. 
</p><p>57. Several participants also presented examples from their own countries, including 
situations where corporate culture is becoming increasingly relevant in deciding whether a 
corporation has the requisite knowledge of a crime. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Sanctions and remedies:  criminal, civil or administrative liability? 
</b></p>
<p><b>Aims and introductory remarks 
</b></p>
<p>58. Day two of the workshop turned to the issue of sanctions and remedies.  The aim was to 
discuss whether States are obliged to ensure that their transnational corporations operating 
abroad are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, whether criminal or civil, 
for human rights abuses.  Participants were also asked to explore the principle of <i>non bis in idem</i> 
and, more generally, how to resolve situations where more than one State seeks to exercise 
jurisdiction over alleged abuse. 
59. The discussion began with the implications of choosing one type of remedy and the types 
of penalties that could best deter TNCs.  Participants mentioned penalties such as depriving 
companies of export credits, disqualifying directors from certain activities, placing the TNC 
under supervision and closing certain corporate establishments. 
</p>
<p><b>Type of liability 
</b></p>
<p>60. Participants suggested that there was uncertainty as to whether a requirement exists to 
provide victims with a civil remedy for torts committed abroad, where a TNC of the nationality 
of the forum State is involved.  They also debated whether one form of liability is more likely to 
be permissible under international law, i.e. because it is less likely to be viewed as an intrusion 
into sovereignty.  One participant argued that civil liability could be seen as more acceptable 
than criminal liability in this regard. 
</p>
<p>61. Regional differences were also discussed, including whether some States were more 
likely to impose criminal or civil liability, simply because of more experience in using either 
type.  Participants suggested that one benefit of administrative liability was that it did not require 
either an individual plaintiff or a willing and able prosecutor.  They also debated whether it was 
better to leave States with discretion in choosing the type of liability, provided it is clear that an 
effective process should be chosen.  Some participants were unconcerned about the type of 
liability, or whether the liability attaches to a natural or legal person, provided some person or 
entity is held responsible.  Participants mentioned the importance of looking to the market for 
accountability and provided examples of market forces that could deter companies, such as a 
drop in the share price and shareholder motions to investigate certain officers of the company. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>62. The concept of &#8220;contractualizing&#8221; human rights was highlighted, with the suggestion that 
States could then allege breach of contract where a TNC fails to abide by its contractual 
promises regarding human rights.  The implication was that a contractual action could be more 
effective than a civil tort action as there would be no need for a willing plaintiff.  As part of this 
discussion, participants also spoke of making the provision of export insurance and other 
government services conditional on human rights compliance. 
</p>
<p><b>Jurisdictional conflicts 
</b></p>
<p>63. The background report mentioned a number of ways to resolve such disputes, such as 
utilizing the principle of <i>forum non conveniens</i> and even entering into agreements with other 
States, which set out when jurisdiction should be exercised.  Participants suggested that such 
agreements could specify the types of corporation each State intends to regulate, including 
whether regulation would extend to foreign subsidiaries, and the scope of consultation with other 
States, particularly before a prosecution commences. 
</p>
<p>64. In relation to the <i>non bis in idem</i> doctrine, the debate also focused on whether States are 
obliged to respect another State&#8217;s decisions if they are contrary to human rights.  One participant 
referred to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court as establishing a clear precedent 
for the proposition that States should be permitted to disregard other States&#8217; decisions where they 
are contrary to the pursuit of justice and would frustrate human rights. 
65. Participants also wondered whether jurisdictional conflicts are probable:  they argued that 
the problem is generally that there are no States willing to prosecute or accept a civil case, rather 
than States competing for the same cases.  The Total SA litigation in Belgium and France was 
mentioned as an example of where there was little connection between the victims and either 
State and where, particularly in relation to France, the State had close ties with the TNC, 
probably making it even more unwilling to exercise jurisdiction.  Participants also mentioned 
that pressure from the business community in general can be a powerful deterrent to States 
exercising jurisdiction.  Participants suggested more creative thinking was needed on incentives 
to exercise jurisdiction. 
66. There was also some scepticism about the use of <i>forum non conveniens </i>and the ways in 
which both TNCs and State institutions might seek to exploit the concept, in order for the former 
to shop around for convenient forums and for the latter to avoid taking a case, whether for 
political or other reasons. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Sanctions and remedies:  access to justice by victims 
Aims and introductory remarks 
</b></p>
<p>67. The final session aimed to discuss three issues inherent in home States granting remedies 
to foreign victims: 
</p>
<p> (a) What mechanisms would ensure that victims who are geographically distant from 
the home State actually have effective access to justice? 
 (b) Where such remedies are provided, should they be provided without any 
restrictions or with a subsidiarity requirement, i.e. only where there is no domestic remedy? </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p> (c) Whether the principle of mutual assistance is relevant in ensuring that territorial 
countries assist in evidence-gathering and facilitating victims to file complaints in other 
jurisdictions. 
</p><p>68. From the outset, participants agreed that practical measures were required to ensure that 
victims have access to home State processes.  There was also support for mutual legal assistance 
and cooperation between States to facilitate such access, although it was noted that, in general, 
one should not assume that the host State authorities will cooperate. 
</p>
<p><b>Accessibility issues 
</b></p>
<p>69. Participants discussed practical impediments to victims seeking remedies in home States, 
such as facilitating travel by witnesses, finding advocates and raising funds.  Both local and 
international NGOs were highlighted as key players in helping to solve these issues. 
</p>
<p>70. Participants also mentioned the difficulty in knowing against whom to take action, 
particularly in the case of &#8220;disappearing corporations&#8221; where it becomes almost impossible to 
track the original entity responsible for the harm.  Some participants were concerned about 
tactics sometimes used by TNCs to intimidate victims or to stall processes and called for both 
territorial and home States to address this issue. 
</p>
<p>71. There was also a reminder to think carefully about the types of victims generally 
involved in such cases and their lack of access to institutions that make and enforce the law.  In 
this regard, it was suggested that more attention should be paid to access to lawmakers, rather 
than simply access to courts after the abuse has already occurred. 
</p>
<p><b>Avoiding restrictions on remedies 
</b></p>
<p>72. There was a suggestion that one should not assume that home States are the best forum 
for a remedy.  Where the victims&#8217; priority is to strengthen accountability mechanisms, an action 
in the territorial State could be more effective, even if monetary damages are unlikely to be 
awarded.  However, there was also a sense that home States might have a role to play where 
remedies in the territorial State are unlikely to be effective.  While territorial legal systems 
should be respected and strengthened, the overall aim should be to provide victims with some 
form of justice. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Representative noted that due to their complexity, it would take time to 
resolve many of the issues addressed by the workshop.  He suggested that any conclusions drawn 
from the discussion for the mandate would need to reflect the concerns of multiple stakeholders 
to be successful.  In this regard, the Special Representative spoke of building bridges among 
these stakeholders to facilitate common language and interests. 
</p>
<p>74. Finally, the Special Representative emphasized the importance of focusing not only on 
improving corporate conduct but also strengthening State institutions in order to ensure that 
governance institutions keep pace with corporate globalization.
