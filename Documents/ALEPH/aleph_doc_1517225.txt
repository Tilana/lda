1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Business Operations
Business Operations 
 
Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (“Thunder Mountain” or “the Company”) was originally incorporated under the laws 
of  the  State  of  Idaho  on  November  9,  1935,  under  the  name  of  Montgomery  Mines,  Inc.    In  April  1978,  the 
Montgomery Mines Corporation was obtained by a group of the Thunder Mountain property holders and changed 
its name to Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc., with the primary goal to further develop their holdings in the Thunder 
Mountain Mining District, located in Valley County, Idaho. Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. takes its name from the 
Thunder Mountain Mining District,  where its principal lode  mining claims were located.  For several years, the 
Company’s activities were restricted to maintaining its property position and exploration activities. During 2005, 
the Company sold its holdings in the Thunder Mountain Mining District. During 2007, the Company acquired the 
South  Mountain  Mines  property  in  southwest  Idaho  and  initiated  exploration  activities  on  that  property,  which 
continue today.
Basis of Presentation and Going Concern 
 
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, as 
well  as  the  instructions  to  the  Form  10-Q.  Accordingly,  the  financial  statements  do  not  include  all  of  the 
information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for 
complete  financial  statements.  In  the  opinion  of  our  management,  all  adjustments  (consisting  of  only  normal 
recurring  accruals)  considered  necessary  for  a  fair  presentation  of  the  interim  financial  statements  have  been 
included.  Operating  results  for  the  six  month  period  ended  June  30,  2015  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  the 
results  that  may  be  expected  for  the  full  year  ending  December  31,  2015.  For  further  information  refer  to  the 
financial statements and the footnotes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 
31, 2014.  
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company 
will  continue  as  a  going  concern.  The  Company  is  an  exploration  stage  company  and  has  historically  incurred 
losses and does not have sufficient cash at June 30, 2015 to fund normal operations for the next 12 months. The 
Company has no recurring source of revenue and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the 
Company’s ability to raise capital to fund its future exploration and working capital requirements. The Company’s 
plans  for  the  long-term  return  to  and  continuation  as  a  going  concern  include  financing  the  Company’s  future 
operations through sales of its common stock and/or debt and the eventual profitable exploitation of its mining 
properties.  Additionally,  the  current  capital  markets  and  general  economic  conditions  in  the  United  States  are 
significant  obstacles  to  raising  the  required  funds.  These  factors  raise  substantial  doubt  about  the  Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is currently investigating a number of alternatives for raising 
additional capital with potential investors, lessees and joint venture partners.  
 
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company 
be  unable  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  going  concern  basis  was  not  appropriate  for  these  financial 
statements, adjustments would be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses 
and the balance sheet classifications used.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Business Operations, continued:
Accounting Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts  of  revenues  and expenses  during  the  reporting period. The  more  significant  areas  requiring  the  use  of 
management estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of properties and mineral claims, environmental 
remediation  liabilities,  deferred  tax  assets,  stock  options  granted  and  the  fair  value  of  financial  and  derivative 
instruments. Management’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other assumptions 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
 
For  the  purposes  of  the  balance  sheet  and  statement  of  cash  flows,  the  Company  considers  all  highly  liquid 
investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be a cash equivalent. 
 
Investments in Joint Venture 
 
The Company’s accounting policy for joint ventures is as follows: 
 
1.  The  Company  uses  the  cost  method  when  it  does  not  have  joint  control  or  significant  influence  in  a  joint 
venture. Under the cost method, these investments are carried at cost. If other than temporary impairment in 
value is determined, it would then be charged to current net income or loss.
2.  If the Company enters into a joint venture in which there is joint control between the parties or the Company 
has significant influence, the equity method is utilized whereby the Company’s share of the ventures’ earnings 
and losses is included in the statement of operations as earnings in joint ventures and its investments therein 
are adjusted by a similar amount. If other than temporary impairment in value is determined, it would then be 
charged to current net income or loss.
3.  In a joint venture where the Company holds more than 50% of the voting interest and has significant influence, 
the  joint  venture  is  consolidated  with  the  presentation  of  non-controlling  interest.    In  determining  whether 
significant  influences  exist,  the  Company  considers  its  participation  in  policy-making  decisions  and  its 
representation on the venture’s management committee.
Share-Based Compensation 
 
Share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of employee stock options, are measured at fair 
value and expensed in the statement of operations over the vesting period.   
 
Net Income (Loss) Per Share 
 
The Company is required to have dual presentation of basic earnings per share (“EPS”) and diluted EPS.  Basic 
EPS is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the 
period. Diluted EPS is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the 
period  plus  the  effect  of  potentially  dilutive  common  stock  equivalents,  including  warrants  to  purchase  the 
Company’s common stock.

Reclassifications 
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform data from prior periods to the current presentation.  These 
reclassifications have no effect on the results of operations or stockholders’ equity.
Commitments
On  March  21,  2011,  the  Company  signed  an  exploration  agreement  with  Newmont  Mining  Corporation 
(“Newmont”)  on  the  Trout  Creek  Project  that  significantly  expands  the  Trout  Creek  target  area.  Newmont’s 
private mineral package added to the Project surrounds the Company’s South Mountain claim group and consists 
of about 9,565 acres within a thirty-square mile Area of Influence defined in the agreement.  Under the terms of 
the agreement, the Company is responsible for conducting the exploration program and is obligated to expend a 
minimum of $150,000 over the ensuing two years, with additional expenditures possible in future years.  In late 
2014, Newmont agreed to extend the date for completion of the work commitment, and is redrafting the agreement 
to allow the Company additional time to conduct the exploration.
South Mountain Project LLC
On  November  8,  2012,  the  Company,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  South  Mountain  Mines,  Inc., 
(“SMMI”), and Idaho State Gold Company II, LLC (“ISGC”) formed the Owyhee Gold Trust, LLC, (“OGT”) a 
limited liability company.
ISGC resigned as Manager and SMMI was inserted as Manager of the OGT as of January 27, 2015 by unanimous 
vote  of  Management  Committee  meeting,  under  the  terms  of  the  operating  agreement.  Beginning  on  that  date, 
SMMI began paying OGT’s expenses to ensure ongoing operations at the site.  Accordingly, there is a possible 
loss contingency or financial impairment from the ongoing default by ISGC.  The parties continue to engage in 
discussions as to possible courses of agreement and cure. Due to ongoing discussions with ISGC over the future of 
the venture, the Company decided to recognize these payments as its own expenses because it is not clear whether 
SMMI will be reimbursed by OGT.  
 
During the six months ending June 30, 2015, the Company has recognized expenses of $293,108 it has paid on 
behalf of OGT. Included in the total expenditures is $118,000 of payroll costs incurred during the quarter ended 
June  30,  2015.  These  costs  are  for  management  of  OGT  including  Eric  Jones  (Chief  Executive  Officer),  Jim 
Collord (Chief Operating Officer), and Larry Thackery (Chief Financial Officer). Payment of the salaries has been 
deferred until a later date.

June 30, 2015
Convertible Notes Payable
On  December  9,  2014  the  Company  executed  two  promissory  notes  payable  to  directors,  Eric  Jones  and  Jim 
Collard. The amount of the notes was $25,000 each for a total of $50,000, and identical in terms. The interest rate 
on these notes is 10% per month of the principal balance. The notes were due in full no later than July 1, 2015, and 
had a minimum amount due if the notes are paid back earlier (See Note 7). Interest expense recorded in connection 
with these notes was $29,696 during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The convertible notes contained a beneficial conversion feature of $13,492 which was recognized as a discount on 
the notes on the date of issuance. The discount was amortized over the note term using the straight-line method, 
which approximates the effective interest method. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded 
the full amount of $13,492 in interest expense related to the amortization of the discount.
Stockholders’ Equity
The Company’s common stock has a par value of $0.001 with 200,000,000 shares authorized. The Company also 
has 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001. 
 
On October 3, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a Private Placement financing of up to 5,000,000 units of the 
Company (“Unit”) at a price of $0.05 per Unit for gross proceeds of up to $250,000.  Each Unit consists of one 
share of the Company’s common stock and one-half of one common share purchase warrant.  Each whole warrant 
entitles the holder to purchase one additional share of common stock of the Company at a price of $0.15 for a 
period of 18 months.   
 
Pursuant to a Selling Agreement, the Selling Agent was entitled to compensation in the following form: (a) a cash 
commission  equal  to  10%  of  the  price  of  the  Units  sold;  (b)  an  additional  cash  commission  of  10%  of  gross 
proceeds received from the exercise of Warrants issued as part of such Units or any other equity investment made 
by investors introduced by the Agent within a 24 month period following closing; and (c) non-transferable broker 
warrants to purchase a number of additional Units equal to 5% of Units sold by the Agent in the initial offering.  
 
The Agent Warrants have the same exercise price and terms as the Warrants.  Through December 31, 2014, 15,000 
agent warrants have been issued, and $1,500 in commissions were paid based on the sale of 300,000 shares. 
 
Through  December  31,  2014  the  Company  received  $460,000  in  gross  proceeds  from  the  Private  Placement, 
issuing a total 9,240,000 in common stock and 4,620,000 common stock purchase warrants. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company received $417,000 in gross proceeds, issued 8,340,000 in 
shares of common stock and 4,170,000 common stock purchase warrants.  
 
During 2014, the Company awarded 300,000 in common shares and 150,000 common stock purchase warrants, in 
lieu of $15,000 cash for Professional services, legal and accounting.  
 
Pixellight of Boise, Idaho developed photos to be used in advertising and brochures by Thunder Mountain Gold. 
On  October  1,  2014,  in  lieu  of  payment  on  account  of  $3,000,  Pixellight  elected  to  participate  in  the  private 
placement, and received 60,000 common shares and 30,000 common stock purchase warrants.     
 
On February 28, 2015, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with a two individuals whereby the 
Company sold 4,000,000 shares at US $0.05 per share. There were no warrants associated with the subscriptions. 
As of March 15, 2015, the Company has issued the 4,000,000 shares under this agreement raising $250,000, and 
the placement is closed.

Stock Options
The Company has established a Stock Option Incentive Plan (“SIP”) to authorize the granting of stock options up 
to 10 percent of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock to employees, directors and 
consultants. Upon exercise of options, shares are issued from the available authorized shares of the Company. 
 
Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s stock 
at the date of grant.   
 
On February 6, 2015, the Board approved a grant of one million options to purchase shares of common stock under 
the  SIP  to  Directors,  Executive  Officers  and  other  non-employees  consultants.  The  granted  options  have  been 
valued and recorded using the Black Scholes model. The Black Scholes calculation on the 1,000,000 options that 
were issued was a fair value of $0.06 per option ($60,000 in total). The option certificates reflected the actual date 
of  the  issuance  of  February  6,  2015.    The  SIP  was  approved  by  shareholder  vote  during  the  January  20,  2015 
annual shareholder meeting. The options were fully vested and recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of the grant using the assumptions noted in the 
following table:
Stock price 
Exercise price 
Expected volatility 
Expected dividends 
Expected terms (in years) 
Risk-free rate

The average remaining contractual term of the options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2015 was 2.997 
years.  As of June 30, 2015 options outstanding and exercisable had no aggregate intrinsic value.
Subsequent Events
On July 1, 2015 when the convertible notes payable (see Note 4) became due and payable.  Eric Jones and Jim 
Collord extended their notes six months maturing December 31, 2015.  The Company converted accrued interest 
payable of $33,616 to principal in accordance with the extension agreement bringing the balance of each note to 
$41,808 on July 1, 2015 (total of $83,616).

Plan of Operation: 
 
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve 
a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: 
inability to locate property with mineralization, lack of financing for exploration efforts, competition to acquire mining 
properties;  risks  inherent  in  the  mining  industry,  and  risk  factors  that  are  listed  in  the  Company's  reports  and 
registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 
The  Company’s  financial  position  remained  unchanged  during  the  first  quarter  of  2015  and  the  metals  commodity 
markets  were  mostly  unchanged  during  the  year.    Equity  markets  will  likely  open  up  periodically  in  response  to 
favorable  price  movements  in  certain  metals  during  2015,  providing  some  companies  with  the  opportunity  to  take 
advantage of short periods of positive sentiment in the market. However, until markets provide more favorable metal 
prices,  equity  financing  in  the  mining  industry  will  remain  challenging.  Analyst  estimates  for  2015  are  for  volatile 
metals markets, with a positive outlook for future years. 
 
The Company continued to operate on a limited budget in 2015 while they seek additional financing for the South 
Mountain Mine. Due to ISGC`s choice not to continue with management of the South Mountain Project, SMMI was 
inserted as Manager of the OGT LLC as of Jan. 27th, 2015 by way of Management Committee meeting.  The parties 
are currently in discussions to determine the best path forward for advancing the mine. 
 
The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months, subject to business conditions, will be to continue to 
advance the development at the South Mountain Project.  This work may include the following:
  Finish the rehabilitation of the Laxey and Sonneman drifts, utilizing a mining contractor to conduct the mine

development.   
Initiate  a  drill  program  of  between  20,000  to  30,000  feet  of  underground  core  drilling,  mostly  from  the 
Sonneman level, at drill stations engineered to further define the mineralization on the up-dip and down-dip 
extensions of the historic Texas, DMEA-2, and Laxey ore zones.
  Continued baseline environmental work.
Although  the  South  Mountain  Project  will  still  remain  the  focus,  the  Company  will  continue  exploration  and 
advancement of the Trout Creek Project in 2015, with the following planned scope of work:
  Drill pre-defined drill target on the Joint Exploration area with Newmont Mining.  
  Analyze the drill data, and prepare for further exploration in the 2015/2016 seasons. 
  Continue  geophysical  interpretation  of  the  valley  area.  Define  potential  drill  targets  and  develop  additional
drill targets for remaining field season of 2015.
South Mountain Project, Owyhee County, Idaho  
 
The land package at South Mountain consists of a total of approximately 1,518 acres, consisting of (i) 17 patented 
claims (326 acres) and 360 acres of private land; (ii) lease on private ranch land (542 acres); and, (iii)  21 unpatented 
lode  mining  claims  on  BLM  managed  land  (290  acres).   All  holdings  are  located  in  the  South  Mountain  Mining 
District, Owyhee County, Idaho.
11
The property is located approximately 70 air miles southwest of Boise, Idaho and approximately 24 miles southeast of 
Jordan Valley, Oregon. It is accessible by highway 95 driving south from the Boise area to Jordan Valley Oregon, then 
by traveling southeast approximately 22 miles back into Idaho, via Owyhee County road that is dirt and improved to 
within 4 miles of historic mine site. The last 4 miles up the South Mountain Mine road are unimproved dirt road. The 
property is accessible year-round to within 4 miles of the property, where the property is accessible from May thru 
October without plowing snow. There is power to within 4 miles of the site as well. The climate is considered high 
desert. The Company has water rights on the property, and there is a potable spring on the property that once supplied 
water to the main camp. 
 
During  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Sonneman  Drift  during  2012-2013  several  massive  sulfide  mineralized  zones  were 
mined through.  Detailed rib sampling along some of these zones yielded the following results:

Other Underground Pre-Development Work 
 
The rehabilitation of the Sonneman and Laxey drifts continued successfully until January 2014, when the Project went 
into care and maintenance.  The Sonneman Level advanced 2,711 feet from the portal and is constructed to 12 feet X 
12 feet for future development and mining. There is approximately 350 feet of engineered drift to construct in order to 
reach the historic Texas ore zone located at the end of the old workings.  This advance to and through this zone will 
allow  for  drill  stations  and  underground  drilling  to  further  define  the  high-grade  resource  encountered  by  William 
Bowes group in the 1980s. 
 
The  historic  2,200-foot  long  Laxey  Level  drift  has  been  rehabilitated  to  10  feet  by  10  feet  for  a  distance  of 
approximately 720 feet.  At that point the old tunnel had recently collapsed in at an intrusive dike and preparations 
were  being  made  to  advance  through  the  caved  area.   This  old  tunnel  was  rehabilitated  and  accessed  along  its  full 
length in 2008, at which point it intercepted the historic Texas ore zone, one of many that had limited exploration and 
development during and after the World War II period.  Profound high grade massive sulfide is exposed in this area, 
and the surface drilling during 2013 helped confirm its continuity between the Laxey Level and the surface, an up-dip 
distance of nearly 400 feet. 
 
2013 Core Drilling Program 
 
The surface drilling program was completed in November, 2013.  Twelve core holes totaling 7,535.5 feet were drilled 
and targeted three separate ore shoots:
1.  Seven holes targeted the historic Texas Ore Zone from the surface to the Laxey Level, and between the Laxey 
and Sonneman Levels.  The continuity of sulfide mineralization was confirmed and the surface to Laxey Level 
offers  an  upside  to  the  ore  shoot  that  has  never  been  explored.    Additional  drilling,  primarily  from 
underground, will be necessary to move this into a reserve category.
12
2.  Three holes were drilled to test the DMEA 2 Ore Shoot between the two levels.  The best hole, DMEA13-09, 
intercepted 15 feet of massive sulfide with a grade of 0.22 opt gold, 2.67 opt silver, 20.2% zinc, 0.27% copper 
and 0.35% lead.
3.  Two holes tested the down dip extension of the ore shoot mined during World War II from the 800-foot deep 
Laxey Shaft.  Encouraging mineralization was intercepted in both holes, with the best being LX13-11 that cut 
34 feet of sulfide grading 0.004 opt gold, 4.41 opt silver and 7.18% zinc.
Long section looking north showing the Laxey and Sonneman tunnels and locations of some of the core drill holes.
A  detailed  underground  fan  drilling  program  commenced  as  soon  as  the  surface  drilling  program  was  completed.  
Drilling  on  the  historic  DMEA  2  and  Texas  Ore  zones  were  planned  in  order  to  define  a  mineable  resource,  but 
unfortunately the program was terminated after the first four holes were drilled in the DMEA 2 down dip target.  The

Results from the first drill fan testing the down dip extension of the historic DMEA ore zones.
This drilling confirms and enhances the DMEA 2 and DMEA 3 massive sulfide zone mined during the rehabilitation of 
the Sonneman Drift.  (The rib sample results from these zones are reported above.)  There is some indication that the 
two or three zones may be coalescing with depth.  Additional fans are planned, but were put on hold due to lack of 
funding.  
 
The advance of the Sonneman Level tunnel was stopped about 300 feet short of the primary target, the Texas  Ore 
Shoot.  The caved older tunnel built by Bowes around 1980 intercepted approximately 70 feet of sulfide grading 0.26 
opt gold, 7.42 opt silver, 14.0% zinc, 3.7% lead and 0.16% copper.  Once the new tunnel advances and drill stations 
construction, fan drilling is planned to test the up and down dip of this attractive zone. 
 
Management remains encouraged by results of the underground pre-development work completed to date. The South 
Mountain Model continues to prove that the continuation of the replacement sulfide mineralized ore shoots at depth.  
Detailed follow-up core drilling will be needed to better define the quality and quantity of the historic ore zones at 
depth.  
 
Other work on the Project included access road work, infrastructure facilities and some environmental remediation.  A 
440-foot 48-inch culvert was constructed for protection so that Williams Creek would flow beneath the waste rock 
without contacting the mine workings.   
 
Status of the Operating Agreement with Idaho State Gold Company (ISGC II) 
 
On November 8, 2012, the Company and Idaho State Gold Company II LLC (“ISGC”) formed Owyhee Gold Trust, 
LLC,  (“OGT”)  a  limited  liability  Corporation.   Details  of  this  Agreement  were  filed  by  Form  8K  on  November  9, 
2012. Currently, the project is in a care and maintenance status while new capital is sought. There is a possible loss 
contingency  or  financial  impairment  from  the  ongoing  default  by  ISGC,  as  the  parties  continue  to  engage  in 
discussions as to possible courses of agreement and cure. The Company remains very positive on commencing with 
development, with expectations that metals markets will strengthen in the coming months. 
 
Property History 
 
The limited historic production peaked during World War II when, based on smelter receipts, the production of direct 
shipped ore totaled 53,653 tons containing 3,118 ounces of gold, 566,439 ounces of silver, 13,932 pounds of copper, 
2,562,318  pounds  of  lead  and  15,593,061  pounds  of  zinc.    In  addition  to  the  direct-ship  ore,  a  flotation  mill  was 
constructed and operated during the late-1940s and early-1950s.

South Mountain Mines Inc. controlled the patented claims from 1975 to the time the Company purchased the entity in 
2007. They conducted extensive exploration work including extending the Sonneman Level by approximately 1,500 
feet to intercept the down-dip extension of the Texas sulfide mineralization mined on the Laxey Level some 300 feet 
above the Sonneman.  High grade sulfide mineralization was intercepted on the Sonneman Extension.  In 1985 they 
did a feasibility study based on polygonal ore blocks exposed in the underground workings and drilling.  This resulted 
in a historic resource of approximately 470,000 tons containing 23,500 ounces of gold, 3,530,000 ounces of silver, 
8,339,000 pounds of copper, 13,157,000 pounds of lead and 91,817,000 lbs of zinc. Although they determined positive 
economics, the project was shut down and placed into care and maintenance. 
 
In  2008,  the  Company  engaged  Kleinfelder,  Inc.,  a  nationwide  engineering  and  consulting  firm,  to  complete  a 
technical  report  “Resources  Data  Evaluation,  South  Mountain  Property,  South  Mountain  Mining  District,  Owyhee 
County,  Idaho”.  The  technical  report  was  commissioned  by  Thunder  Mountain  Resources,  Inc.  to  evaluate  all  the 
existing data available on the South Mountain property.  Kleinfelder utilized a panel modeling method using this data 
to  determine  potential  mineralized  material  remaining  and  to  make  a  comparison  with  the  resource  determined  by 
South Mountain Mines in the mid-1980s.   
 
Additional drilling and sampling will  be necessary before the resource  can  be classified  as a  mineable reserve, but 
Kleinfelder’s calculations provided a potential resource number that is consistent with South Mountain Mines’ (Bowes 
1985) reserve model.  
 
Late in 2009, the Company contracted with Northwestern Groundwater & Geology to incorporate all the new drill and 
sampling data into an NI 43-101 Technical Report.  This report was completed as part of the Company’s dual listing 
on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  in  2010.    The  NI  43-101  can  be  reviewed  on  the  Company`s  website  at 
www.thundermountaingold.com, or on www.SEDAR.com.  
 
Gold Breccia Area 
 
No additional work has been completed on the multi-lithic intrusive breccia outcrop that was identified and sampled in 
2008 on property leased by the Company.  An extensive ground magnetic survey consisting of approximately 81 line 
miles was completed over the project area by Jim  Wright Geophysics and was designed to tie the sediment hosted 
mineralization  with  the  Gold  Breccia  Zone.    Additional  geophysics  will  be  justified  and  will  consist  of  deep 
penetrating induced polarization work.  
 
This large area (approximately one mile long and one-half a mile wide) is located several thousand feet south of the 
main mine area.  The intrusive breccia is composed of rounded to sub-rounded fragments of altered intrusive rock and 
silicified fragments of altered schist and marble.  Initial rock chip samples from the outcrop area ranged from 0.49 ppm 
to 1.70 ppm gold, and follow-up outcrop and float sampling in 2009 yielded gold values ranging from 0.047 ppm to 
5.81 ppm.  A first pass orientation soil survey completed in 2008 was conducted near the “discovery’ breccia outcrop 
at a spacing of 100 feet over a distance of 800 feet east/west and 1,000 feet north/south.  The soil assays ranged from a 
trace to 0.31 ppm Gold.  Surface mapping indicates that the intrusive breccia covers an area of approximately 5,000 
feet x 1,500 feet.
15
Management  believes  that  the  “first-pass”  drill  results  from  the  intrusive  breccia  drilling  proves  the  existence  of  a 
significant gold system in an intrusive package that is related to the polymetallic mineralization in the carbonate in the 
historic mine area.  An IP survey is planned to isolate potential feeder structures and to evaluate the contact between 
the metasediments and the gold-bearing intrusive. 
 
Qualified Person – Edward D. Fields is the Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 responsible for 
the technical data reported in this news release. 
 
This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 
to  paragraph  (b)(5)  of  Industry  Guide  7.  There  are  currently  no  permits  required  for  conducting  exploration  in 
accordance with the Company`s current board approved exploration plan. 
 
Trout Creek Project, Lander County, Nevada 
 
The Trout Creek pediment exploration gold target is located along the eastern flank of Reese River Valley along the 
pediment  of  the  Shoshone  Range  in  Lander  County,  Nevada.  The  claim  package  consists  of  78  unpatented  mining 
claims (approximately 1560 acres) that are situated along a recognizable structural zone in the Eureka-Battle Mountain 
mineralized  gold  trend.    In  addition  to  the  claims,  a  joint  venture  exploration  agreement  with  Newmont  Mining 
covering approximately 25 square miles on which Newmont owns the mineral rights on about half that land package.  
The mineral rights consist of their ownership of the Continental Railroad sections.   
 
The Project is located approximately 155 air miles northeast of Reno, Nevada, or approximately 20 miles SW of Battle 
Mountain, Nevada, in Sections 10, 11, 14, 16, 21, 22, 27; T.29N.; R.44E. Mount Diablo Baseline & Meridian, Lander

An extensive data package was made available by Newmont to Thunder Mountain Gold, and follow-up fieldwork was 
undertaken  once  the  agreement  was  finalized.    This  fieldwork  consisted  of  mapping  the  altered  and  mineralized 
structures that can be followed through the Shoshone Range.   Of importance is that these structures align with the 
Cortez-Pipeline deposits and the Phoenix deposit (part of the Eureka-Battle Mountain-Getchell Trend).   
 
In addition to the geologic fieldwork, Wright Geophysics conducted a ground gravity survey and CSMAT over the 
pediment  target  area  and  this  provided  insight  into  the  gravel-bedrock  contact  as  well  as  defining  the  favorable 
structural setting within the buried bedrock.  An untested drill target was identified under the gravel pediment along 
these structures, and the geophysics showed that the bedrock was within a reasonable depth for exploration drilling and 
potential mining if a significant mineralization is encountered.
Lack of an adequate budget prevented drilling during 2014, but Newmont and the Company are currently amending 
the agreement to allow for a modified work commitment and timeframe.  It is anticipated that funding will be available 
during the latter part of the 2015 season, and one or two reverse circulation holes can test the bedrock beneath the 
gravel along the mineralized structures. 
 
The Trout Creek target is based on a regional gravity anomaly on a well-defined northwest-southeast trending break in 
the  alluvial  fill  thickness  and  underlying  bedrock.    Previous  geophysical  work  in  the  1980s  revealed  an  airborne 
magnetic anomaly associated with the same structure, and this was further verified and outlined in 2008 by Company 
personnel  using  a  ground  magnetometer.  The  target  is  covered  by  alluvial  fan  deposits  of  unknown  thickness  shed 
from the adjacent Shoshone Range, a fault block mountain range composed of Paleozoic sediments of both upper and 
lower  plate  rocks  of  the  Roberts  Mountains  thrust.  The  geophysical  anomaly  could  define  a  prospective  and 
unexplored target within a well mineralized region. 
 
The  ongoing  exploration  field  work,  including  claim  maintenance  and  assessment,  is  financed  by  the  Company 
through  sales  of  unregistered  common  stock  funded  by  the  Company  through  private  placements  with  accredited 
investors.    Future  work  will  be  funded  in  the  same  manner  or  through  a  strategic  partnership  with  another  mining 
company.    The  Company  is  attempting  to  consolidate  the  land  package  to  cover  a  larger  area  of  the  positive 
geophysical target in the pediment by acquiring and/or joint venturing adjoining mineral property.  
 
There are currently no environmental permits required for the planned exploration work on the property. In the future, 
a notice of intent may be required with the Bureau of Land Management.  This property is without known reserves and 
the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of Industry Guide 7.  
 
Competition 
 
We  are  an  exploration  stage  company.  We  compete  with  other  mineral  resource  exploration  and  development 
companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration 
and  development  companies  with  whom  we  compete  have  greater  financial  and  technical  resources  than  us. 
Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on 
exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to 
afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result 
in  competitors  having  mineral  properties  of  greater  quality  and  interest  to  prospective  investors  who  may  finance 
additional  exploration  and  development.  This  competition  could  adversely  impact  on  our  ability  to  finance  further 
exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties. 
 
Results of Operations: 
 
The Company had no revenues and no production for the quarter ending June 30, 2015. Total expenses for the six 
months ending June 30, 2015 increased from the same respective time frame ending 2014 by $253,159, up 183% in 
total  expenses  of  $391,585.  Exploration  expenses  for  the  six  months  ending  June  30,  2015,  increased  by  $63,017, 
when compared to the same period in 2014. Legal and accounting fees slightly increased from 2014 by the amount of 
$5,843  for  a total  of  legal  and  accounting  expenses  of  $96,644. Management  and  administrative  expense  increased 
$184,299 or 490%, for a total expense of $221,906. The increase in expenses is due to ongoing discussions with ISGC 
over the future of the OGT venture, the Company decided to maintain the cost, of the venture, as its own expenses 
because it is not clear whether SMMI will be reimbursed by OGT.   During the six months ending June 30, 2015, the 
Company has recognized expenses of $293,108 it has paid on behalf of OGT. Included in the total expenditures is 
$118,000 of deferred payroll costs incurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:  
 
The consolidated financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2015, have been prepared under the assumption 
that we will continue as a going concern. Such assumption contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of 
liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  Our  continuation  as  a  going  concern  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to 
generate  sufficient  cash  flow  to  meet  our  obligations  on  a  timely  basis,  to  obtain  additional  financing  as  may  be 
required, or ultimately to attain profitability. Potential sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include additional 
external  debt,  the  sale  of  shares  of  our  stock  or  alternative  methods  such  as  mergers  or  sale  of  our  assets.  No 
assurances can be given, however, that we will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash. We currently 
require additional cash funding from outside sources to sustain existing operations and to meet current obligations and 
ongoing capital requirements. 
 
Our plans for the long term continuation as a going concern include financing our future operations through sales of 
our common stock and/or debt and the eventual profitable exploitation of our mining properties. Our plans may also, at 
some future point, include the formation of mining joint ventures with senior mining company partners on specific 
mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in return for equity in the 
property. 
  
The Company`s management is confident that the continued operations of Thunder Mountain Gold can be assured by 
the following:
  At June 30, 2015, we had $63,528 cash in our bank accounts.
  Management and the Board have not undertaken plans or commitments that exceed the cash available to 
the Company.  We do not include in this consideration any additional investment funds mentioned below. 
Management is committed to manage expenses of all types so as to not exceed the on-hand cash resources 
of the Company at any point in time, now or in the future.
We firmly believe we can outlast the current disruptions in the investment markets and continue to attract investment 
dollars in coming months and years.  The Company will also consider other sources of funding, including potential 
mergers and/or additional farm-out of some of its exploration properties. 
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, net cash used for operating activities was $218,464, consisting of our  net loss 
of $432,922, reduced by non-cash expenses and net cash provided by changes in current assets and current liabilities. 
There was no cash provided by investing activities for the quarter.  
 
Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including timing, cost and progress of our 
exploration efforts, our evaluation of, and decisions with respect to, our strategic alternatives, and costs associated with 
the regulatory approvals. If it turns out that we do not have enough money to complete our exploration programs, we 
will try to raise additional funds from a second public offering, a private placement, mergers, farm-outs or loans.  
 
We  know  that  additional  financing  will be  required  in  the  future  to  fund  our planned  operations.  We  do  not  know 
whether additional financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise 
additional financing when necessary, we may have to delay our exploration efforts or any property acquisitions or be 
forced to cease operations. Collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our mining 
claims. 
 
Private Placement 
 
On October 3, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a Private Placement financing of up to 5,000,000 units of the 
Company (“Unit”) at a price of $0.05 per Unit for gross proceeds of up to $250,000.  Each Unit consists of one share 
of the Company’s common stock and one-half of one common share purchase warrant.  Each whole warrant entitles 
the holder to purchase one additional share of common stock of the Company at a price of $0.15 for a period of 18 
months. The Placement was closed on November 24, 2014, with an oversubscription of 5,000,000 units, for a total of 
10,000,000 units sold for gross proceeds of $500,000. 
 
Pursuant to a Selling Agreement, the Selling Agent was entitled to compensation in the following form: (a) a cash 
commission equal to 10% of the price of the Units sold.  At December 31, 2014, $1,500 in commissions was accrued
19
based on the sale of 300,000 shares; (b) an additional cash commission of 10% of gross proceeds received from the 
exercise of Warrants issued as part of such Units or any other equity investment made by investors introduced by the 
Agent within a 24 month period following closing; and (c) non-transferable broker warrants to purchase a number of 
additional Units equal to 5% of Units sold by the Agent in the initial offering. The Agent Warrants will have the same 
exercise price and otherwise be on the same terms as the Warrants.  At December 31, 2014, 15,000 agent warrants 
were issued. 
 
On  February  28,  2015,  the  Company  entered  into  a  subscription  agreement  with  a  two  individuals  whereby  the 
company sold 4,000,000 shares at US $0.05 per share. There were no warrants associated with the subscriptions. As of 
March 15, 2015, the Company has issued the 4,000,000 shares under this agreement, and the placement is closed.  
 
Subsequent Events 
 
On July 1, 2015 when the convertible notes payable became due and payable.  Eric Jones and Jim Collord extended 
their notes six months maturing December 31, 2015.  The Company converted accrued interest payable of $33,616 to 
principal in accordance with the extension agreement bringing the balance of each note to $41,808 on July 1, 2015 
(total of $83,616). 
 
Contractual Obligations
During 2008 and 2009, three lease arrangements were made with land owners that own land parcels adjacent to the 
Company’s South Mountain patented and unpatented mining claims.  The leases were for a seven-year period, with 
options to renew, with annual payments (based on $20 per acre years 1-7 and $30 per acre 8-17) listed in the following 
table.  The leases have no work requirements, and are the responsibility of the Owyhee Gold Trust formed in 2012. 
Pursuant to the JV Agreement, the assigned leases were by Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc and Thunder Mountain 
Gold to Owyhee Gold Trust. The original leases had terms of seven years with an option to extent for 10 years, and 
beyond if production commence.

We  have  identified  our  critical  accounting  policies,  the  application  of  which  may  materially  affect  the  financial 
statements, either because of the significance of the financials statement item to which they relate, or because they 
require management’s judgment in making estimates and assumptions in measuring, at a specific point in time, events 
which  will  be  settled  in  the  future.    The  critical  accounting  policies,  judgments  and  estimates  which  management 
believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below:
a)  Estimates.  Our  management  routinely  makes  judgments  and  estimates  about  the  effect  of  matters  that  are 
inherently  uncertain.    As  the  number  of  variables  and  assumptions  affecting  the  future  resolution  of  the 
uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex.  Although we believe that 
our  estimates  and  assumptions  are  reasonable,  actual  results  may  differ  significantly  from  these  estimates.  
Changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of 
operation and/or financial condition.
b)  Stock-based  Compensation.  The  Company  records  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  ASC  718, 
“Compensation  –  Stock  Compensation”  using  the  fair  value  method.  All  transactions  in  which  goods  or 
services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the 
fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more 
reliably measurable.
20
Income  Taxes.  We  have  current  income  tax  assets  recorded  in  our  financial  statements  that  are  based  on  our 
estimates relating to federal and state income tax benefits. Our judgments regarding federal and state income tax 
rates, items that may or may not be deductible for income tax purposes and income tax regulations themselves are 
critical to the Company’s financial statement income tax items.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
Not required for smaller reporting companies. 
 
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

13a – 15(e) and Rule 15d – 15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  
 
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  
 
During the quarter covered by this report, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting.

On October 3, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a Private Placement financing of up to 5,000,000 units of the 
Company (“Unit”) at a price of $0.05 per Unit for gross proceeds of up to $250,000.  Each Unit consists of one share 
of the Company’s common stock and one-half of one common share purchase warrant.  Each whole warrant entitles 
the holder to purchase one additional share of common stock of the Company at a price of $0.15 for a period of 18 
months. The Placement was closed on November 24, 2014, with an oversubscription of 5,000,000 units, for a total of 
9,240,000 units sold for gross proceeds of $462,000. 
 
Pursuant to a Selling Agreement, the Selling Agent was entitled to compensation in the following form: (a) a cash 
commission equal to 10% of the price of the Units sold.  At December 31, 2014, $1,500 in commissions was accrued 
based on the sale of 300,000 shares; (b) an additional cash commission of 10% of gross proceeds received from the 
exercise of Warrants issued as part of such Units or any other equity investment made by investors introduced by the 
Agent within a 24 month period following closing; and (c) non-transferable broker warrants to purchase a number of 
additional Units equal to 5% of Units sold by the Agent in the initial offering. The Agent Warrants will have the same 
exercise price and otherwise be on the same terms as the Warrants.  At December 31, 2014, 15,000 agent warrants 
were issued.
21
On  February  28,  2015,  the  Company  entered  into  a  subscription  agreement  with  a  two  individuals  whereby  the 
company sold 4,000,000 shares at US $0.05 per share. There were no warrants associated with the subscriptions. The 
Company received $200,000 in gross proceeds from the Private Placement. As of March 15, 2015, the Company has 
issued the 4,000,000 shares under this agreement, and the placement is closed.  
 
Under  Rule  501(a)  of  Regulation  D,  these  units  were  sold  to  "accredited  investors"  which  within  the  meaning  of 
section 2(15) of the Act and Rule 501, et seq. of Regulation "D", these transactions are intended to be exempt from 
registration  under  the  Act  by  virtue  of  section  4(2)  of  the  Act  and  the  provisions  of  Rule  506  of  Regulation  D  as 
promulgated thereunder. 
 
On December 1, 2013, the Company converted a note payable to Rolf Hess in the amount of $20,000 for a total of 
400,000 shares of common stock and 200,000 warrants.   
 
Use of proceeds from these unit sales were for general corporation expenses.  
 
Item 3.  Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 
None. 
 
Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures 
 
Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-
Frank Act”), issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the 
United  States  are  required  to  disclose  in  their  periodic  reports  filed  with  the  SEC  information  regarding  specified 
health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities.  
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company did not have any operating mines and therefore had no such 
specified health and safety violations, orders or citations, related assessments or legal actions, mining-related fatalities, 
or  similar  events  in  relation  to  the  Company’s  United  States  operations  requiring  disclosure  pursuant  to  Section 
1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
