</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and elaborated in other international human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties and instruments,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> the principles and commitments with regard to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing enshrined in the relevant provisions of declarations and programmes adopted

<p>Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda (A/CONF.165/14), and the Declaration

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>resolution 42/1 of 13 March 1998 of the Commission on the Status 
</p>
<p>of Women, in which, inter alia, the Commission urged States to design and revise 
</p>
<p>laws to ensure that women were accorded full and equal rights to own land and other 
</p>
<p>property, and the right to adequate housing, including through the right to inheritance, 
</p>
<p>and to undertake administrative reforms and other necessary measures to give women 
</p>
<p>the same right as men to credit, capital, appropriate technologies, access to markets 
</p>
<p>and information,

</p>
<p>significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> that any deterioration in the general housing situation 
</p>
<p>disproportionally affects the poor, including women and children, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that adequate housing is a key element for fostering family 
</p>
<p>integration, contributing to social equity and strengthening the feeling of belonging, 
</p>
<p>security and human solidarity, as stated in the outcome document of the twenty-
</p>
<p>seventh special session of the General Assembly, on children, entitled &#8220;A world fit for 
</p>
<p>children&#8221;, annexed to its resolution S-27/2 of 10 May 2002, and welcoming the 
</p>
<p>commitment stated in the document to attach high priority to overcoming the housing 
</p>
<p>shortage and other infrastructure needs, particularly for children in marginalized peri-
</p>
<p>urban and remote rural areas, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the work of the United Nations treaty bodies, in particular of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the promotion of the rights 
</p>
<p>related to adequate housing, and in this regard noting the affirmation in its general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 4 that the human right to adequate housing is of central importance for 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights, as well as general comments 
</p>

</p>
<p>conceptual understanding of the right to adequate housing;  </p>

<p> 2. <i>Also acknowledges </i>the work done by the Special Rapporteur in 
</p>

</p>
<p>housing; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the prevalence of homelessness and inadequate

<p>housing, the growth of slums worldwide, forced evictions, the increase in challenges

<p>faced by migrants in relation to adequate housing, as well as of refugees in conflict 
</p>
<p>and post-conflict situations, challenges to the full enjoyment of the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing caused by the impact of climate change, natural disasters and pollution, 
</p>
