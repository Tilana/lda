<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
undertook a visit to Belarus from 18 to 24 May 2009 at the invitation of the Government of 
Belarus. The Special Rapporteur conducted meetings and consultations with and visits to 
various stakeholders in Minsk and Brest. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its hospitality and collaboration 
in facilitating meetings with officials from its various branches and for its cooperation prior 
to, during and following the visit.  
</p>
<p>3. In Minsk, the Special Rapporteur met with high-level Government officials, 
including the First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration, ministers and 
representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Office of the 
Prosecutor-General, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, and 
Ministry of Health. The Special Rapporteur also met with members of the House of 
Representatives of the National Assembly and with judges of the Supreme Court. She held 
meetings with representatives of the National Centre of Legislation and Legal Studies, the 
State Border Committee and the Secretariat of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS). The Special Rapporteur visited the International Organization for Migration (IOM) 
Rehabilitation Centre for Victims of Trafficking, the International Training Centre for 
Migration and Combating Human Trafficking and the Minsk City Centre of Social Services 
for Family and Children. In Brest, the Special Rapporteur met with the Executive 
Committee of Brest Province and visited a centre for the temporary stay of migrants as well 
as the detention facilities adjacent to it. 
</p><p>4. The Special Rapporteur warmly thanks the United Nations Resident Coordinator and 
the staff from the United Nations country team for their strong support prior to, during and 
following the visit. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to meet with members of 
the United Nations country team and representatives of certain embassies in Minsk and 
international organizations (European Union delegation to Belarus, Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), International Federation of Red Cross and 
Red Crescent Societies and United States Agency for International Development (USAID)). 
5. In Minsk and Brest, the Special Rapporteur met with various non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). 
6. The objective of the visit was to explore the human rights aspects of trafficking in 
persons in Belarus. More specifically, she sought information on a variety of measures 
taken to address trafficking in persons, including legislation, statistical information, work 
on root causes, cooperation between the various actors and prevention efforts. She also 
explored the steps being taken by the Government and partners to rehabilitate, reintegrate 
and redress violations suffered by victims. At the close of the visit, the Special Rapporteur 
shared her preliminary thoughts with the Government. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-13102 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and situation 
</b></p>
<p>7. Belarus is located in the Eastern part of Europe and shares borders with Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Its territory is 207,600 km2 and the 
total population is estimated at 9,648,533 (July 2009).1 
8. According to the 1999 census, the ethnic composition of the population was 81.2 per 
cent Belarusian, 11.4 per cent Russian, 3.9 per cent Polish, 2.4 per cent Ukrainian and 1.1 
per cent other.2<b> </b>Belarus is divided into six provinces: Brest, Vitebsk, Gomel, Grodno, 
Minsk and Mogilev. 
</p>
<p>9. After seven decades as a constituent republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics (USSR), Belarus attained its independence in 1991. Belarus has formed a single 
economic area and labour market with the Russian Federation and there is freedom of 
movement between the two States. Aleksandr Lukashenko was elected as the first President 
of Belarus in July 1994 and won re-election to a third consecutive term in office in March 
</p><p>2006.  
</p>
<p>10. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been present in Belarus 
since 1992.3 The United Nations country team is comprised of 12 agencies, funds and 
programmes (UNDP, United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
(UNAIDS), World Health Organization, United Nations Population Fund, World Bank, 
International Finance Corporation, International Monetary Fund, International Labour 
Organization (ILO), IOM and the Department of Public Information).  
</p><p>11. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, at the beginning of the new 
millennium, Belarusians were travelling to other CIS States, Western Europe and the Baltic 
States seeking better job opportunities, and some were becoming victims of trafficking in 
persons. It was at that time that the Government felt the need to tackle economic and other 
structural issues and studied various international experiences to assist it in its fight against 
trafficking. Thus, in 2005, investigations were launched into the activities of 40 modelling 
agencies, which were allegedly recruiting and delivering Belarusian women across the 
border for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The Government concluded that the State 
should issue licences to any agency seeking to provide employment links for Belarusians 
abroad. The Special Rapporteur learned that there are currently 53 bodies licensed to invite 
Belarusian citizens to work abroad &#8212; 3 of which are modelling agencies &#8212; and fewer 
tourist agencies than before. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur received information that Belarus is a source and transit 
country for trafficking in persons to a number of countries in various regions of the world, 
and has recently started to become a destination country. One NGO that runs a hotline 
informed the Special Rapporteur that they receive calls from individuals from 77 
destination countries. IOM reports that it assisted the following numbers of victims of 
trafficking in Belarus between 2005 and March 2009:

</p>
<p>13. Due to the insidious nature of the phenomenon, the actual scale of trafficking in 
human beings around the world and, in this context, in Belarus (as either a source, transit or 
destination country) is difficult to measure. While official statistics indicate a downward 
trend in the number of victims identified in criminal prosecution cases, the Special 
Rapporteur warns that such statistics do not necessarily reflect the actual scale of trafficking 
in Belarus. Many victims may be improperly identified, others do not come forward at all 
owing to social taboos linked to having been trafficked and others have simply fallen 
through the cracks in the system. Most of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors agreed that 
trafficking in human beings was widespread and that exploitation of Belarusian men for 
forced labour was on the increase. 
</p>
<p>14. Trafficking may also be a cyclical phenomenon: some women who have been 
victims of trafficking reportedly recruit other women and become traffickers in an attempt 
to &#8220;free&#8221; themselves from their captors who have exploited and victimized them.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Laws 
</b></p>
<p>15. Belarus is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its 
First Optional Protocol, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and its Optional Protocol, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its 
Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the 
Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of 
Intercountry Adoption, the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. Belarus is also a party to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime (the &#8220;Palermo Protocol&#8221;), the ILO Convention 
concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour (Convention No. 29) and the Convention 
concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of 
Child Labour (Convention No. 182). Belarus has not signed the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. At the regional level, Belarus is a CIS founding member. It is a party to the 
Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States and the Agreement on the Cooperation of the CIS member States in 
Combating Trafficking in Persons, Human Organs and Tissues. The objective of this latter 
agreement is to develop a coherent strategy and adopt integrated joint legal, socio-
economic, informational and other measures to combat human trafficking, eliminate the 
causes and conditions conducive to its emergence and protect and rehabilitate victims. The 
parties also agree to cooperate to prevent, detect, deter and solve the crimes related to 
trafficking in persons and protect victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children, and their rehabilitation. Belarus has also ratified the CIS Convention on Legal Aid </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13102 
</p>
<p>and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Cases<b> </b>and is in active partnership with 
CIS in combating trafficking.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. Representatives of the National Assembly, among others, informed the Special 
Rapporteur that Belarus has been attempting to accede to the Council of Europe Convention 
on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, but that it has not been successful in this 
regard. The Special Rapporteur recalls that this Convention is open to ratification by non-
member States of the Council of Europe and consequently encourages Belarus to ratify it, 
given the fact that the country is located in Europe and many of its citizens have been 
trafficked to Western Europe, among others. Such ratification will encourage the necessary 
synergy for combating trafficking in that region. 
</p>
<p>19. In terms of the national legal framework in Belarus for combating trafficking, the 
President issued several laws and presidential decrees in 2005 to address the issue of 
trafficking in persons.4<b> </b>Act No. 15-3 of 4 May 2005 on amending certain codes of the 
Republic of Belarus to increase liability for human trafficking and other related offences 
introduced and/or amended provisions of the Criminal Code and the Code of 
Administrative Offences in respect of the following trafficking-related crimes. 
</p>
<p> (a) The crime of &#8220;Exploitation of prostitution or creating conditions for 
prostitution&#8221; (article 171 of the Criminal Code) provides that actions involving the removal 
of a person outside of the country for engagement in prostitution are punishable by 
imprisonment of 7&#8211;10 years with confiscation of property; 
</p>
<p> (b) &#8220;Incitement into prostitution and forcing into a continuation of prostitution&#8221; 
(article 171-1 of the Criminal Code) is punishable by imprisonment for a term of between 
one and three years, or three and five years if committed repetitively or with the use of 
force or the threat of force. If committed against a minor by a person performing parenting 
functions or by an organized group, the penalty is prison for a term of 7&#8211;10 years; 
</p>
<p> (c) The article on the offence of &#8220;Human trafficking&#8221; (article 181 of the Criminal 
Code) provides that the buying/selling of a person or other transactions committed against a 
person, as well as recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a person 
committed for exploitation purposes, are punishable by imprisonment for a term of between 
five and seven years with confiscation of property. If &#8220;human trafficking&#8221; is committed in 
the following circumstances, inter alia, then it is punishable by imprisonment for a term of 
10&#8211;12 years: 
</p>
<p> (i) Against a person who is known to be under age; 
 (ii) For the purposes of sexual exploitation; 
 (iii) Against two or more persons; 
 (iv) To remove organs or tissues of a victim for transplantation; 
 (v) By a group of persons by prior conspiracy; 
 (vi) For the purpose of transporting a victim outside of the country; 
 (vii) Taking advantage of a victim&#8217;s vulnerability (coincidence of difficult 
</p>
<p>personal, family or other circumstances); and 
 (viii) By deception, abuse of confidence or combined with the use of force, threat 
</p>
<p>or other forms of coercion; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Some of these laws were informed by the European Union and UNDP project &#8220;Combating 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Women in the Republic of Belarus&#8221;, financed by the European Commission. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13102 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Exploitation of a person implies illegally forcing a person into labour or requiring services 
in case he/she is unable to refuse this work (services) for reasons beyond their control, 
including slavery or slavery-like practices; 
</p>
<p> (d) Article 181-1 of the Criminal Code provides that the use of slave labour or 
other form of exploitation in the absence of a crime under article 181 of the Criminal Code 
is punishable with imprisonment for a term of between two and five years. If committed 
against a minor, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a term of 3&#8211;10 years with or 
without confiscation of property; 
</p>
<p> (e) Article 182, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code provides that the capture of a 
person in secret, in the open, by deception or the abuse of confidence or combined with the 
use of force or threat or other forms of coercion, in the absence of signs of an offence of 
&#8220;abduction&#8221;, is punishable by imprisonment for a term of between five and seven years 
with or without confiscation of property; 
</p>
<p> (f) Article 187 of the Criminal Code provides that if, as a result of illegal acts 
directed towards foreign employment of Belarusian citizens, persons who have been 
secured employment abroad were subjected to sexual or other exploitation against the will 
of a person in the absence of signs of the offence stipulated by article 181 of this Code are 
punishable by imprisonment for a term of between three and five years with the revocation 
of the right to hold certain offices or pursue certain activities. If committed by an organized 
group, such offences are punishable by imprisonment for a term of between six and eight 
years with the confiscation of property and with the revocation of the right to hold certain 
offices or pursue certain activities. 
</p>
<p>20. Presidential Decree No. 3 of 9 March 2005 on certain measures aimed at combating 
trafficking in human beings regulates all acts aimed at employing citizens of Belarus 
abroad. More specifically, any such acts may only be performed when a special permit has 
been issued by the Ministry of the Interior and under certain enumerated conditions. 
Furthermore, it provides that citizens who study at educational institutions in Belarus shall 
be sent to study abroad only upon written permission of the Ministry of Education. The 
decree regulates the activities of bridal, advertising and model agencies.  
</p>
<p>21. Decree No. 15 amends Decree No. 3 and contains procedures for documents 
required for marriage, travel agencies and those individuals planning to study abroad.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>22. Decree No. 352<b> </b>on prevention of the consequences of trafficking in human beings of 
8 August 2005<b> </b>establishes a legal and institutional framework for providing protection to 
persons who have suffered from criminal activities related to trafficking in human beings. It 
deals with social protection and rehabilitation (granting of temporary shelters, legal, 
medical and psychological assistance and other assistance in securing employment). 
Furthermore, this decree provides that criminal prosecution bodies shall send victims to 
regional public centres for social services to carry out those assistance measures (for those 
victims aged 15 and above), under the aegis of the Ministry of Labour and Social 
Protection. For children aged between 3 and 15 years, those services shall be carried out by 
social shelters for children, under the aegis of the Ministry of Education. Article 10 also 
provides that a foreign national or stateless citizen who is a victim of trafficking and is 
actively assisting the investigation of a crime entailing trafficking in human beings, and 
whose term for staying on the territory in Belarus has expired, shall be granted by the 
Ministry of the Interior a temporary permit to stay in Belarus for a period of no more than 
one year, to allow for his/her participation in the legal proceedings, social protection and 
rehabilitation.   
</p>
<p>23. Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Palermo Protocol provides that each State party shall 
adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal 
offences the conduct set forth in article 3 of the Protocol, when committed intentionally. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13102 
</p>
<p>The above decrees reflect the provisions of the Palermo Protocol, including with respect to 
the definition of trafficking, and provisions regarding prevention, assistance and 
prosecution. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur observed that there is currently no law on domestic violence 
in Belarus. She was informed by the National Centre of Legislation and Legal Studies that, 
while there is no bill pending on the issue, the Government is examining the question 
carefully. Representatives of the National Centre stated that regulation of this problem and 
its prevention are provided for in other norms which define violence in the family. 
Currently, cases of domestic violence are treated as cases of &#8220;assault&#8221; under relevant 
legislation. The Special Rapporteur recalls the recommendation of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women to Belarus to enact the draft law on the 
prevention and suppression of domestic violence and to ensure that violence against women 
is prosecuted and punished with the required seriousness and speed (A/59/38, part I, para. 
348).  
</p><p>25. The Special Rapporteur welcomed information received of a Council of Ministers 
directive (2008) establishing the National Action Plan on Gender Equality 2008&#8211;2010.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policies 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur noted the wide range of programmes and policies enacted 
by the Government and regional and international organizations to combat trafficking in 
persons. The first State programme to combat trafficking in persons and illegal migration 
and related criminal activities covered the period 2002&#8211;2007. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that Belarus is currently implementing the first stage of its second such State 
programme (2008&#8211;2010). The main objectives of the State programme are to: (a) decrease 
the rate of crime related to trafficking in persons, irregular migration, spread of prostitution 
and child pornography; (b) protect and rehabilitate victims of trafficking; (c) enhance the 
efficiency of State authorities&#8217; performance in prevention, exposure and suppression of 
trafficking, irregular migration and related illicit activities; (d) further improve legislation 
in these fields, based on real-life experience of its realization and taking into consideration 
international treaties; and (e) develop cooperation with concerned States, international, 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in these fields.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Ministry of the Interior is the main coordination body in the field of combating 
trafficking in human beings, and thus coordinates the work of 15 ministries involved in the 
implementation of the State programme and reports annually to the Council of Ministers 
and the President. The State programme provides a framework for addressing trafficking-
related crimes. Regarding implementation of the first programme of action (2007&#8211;2010), 
the CIS secretariat informed the Special Rapporteur that some objectives which were not 
achieved during the first programme of action have been carried over into the current, 
second programme. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur was informed about a CIS conference in collaboration with 
IOM scheduled for September 2009 in Moscow to review and adopt practical approaches to 
improving the efforts of CIS member States in tackling human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>29. In 2004, the Ministry of the Interior was reinforced with a special unit, renamed in 
2006 as the Department on Combating Intergovernmental Trafficking in Human Beings. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur notes the State Migration Programme (2006&#8211;2010), which 
includes a set of measures directed at the development of temporary safe labour migration.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13102 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur visited and met with representatives of the International 
Training Centre for Migration and Combating Human Trafficking in Minsk.5 The Centre 
was established in March 2007 and operational as of 2008 for the purpose of educating, 
sharing experiences, achievements and best practices in fighting human trafficking. 
Funding is provided mainly from IOM and the Government (Academy of the Ministry of 
the Interior). Its tasks include: training Government staff and law enforcement officials 
(e.g., prosecutors and judges), civil society representatives, law professors and members of 
international organizations; exchanging best practices; and enhancing cooperation with 
international organizations on the issues of migration and combating human trafficking. 
Courses are offered on countering trafficking (both national and international), labour 
migration, social and psychological assistance, migration trends and legal models to 
manage migration. The diploma issued by the Centre is recognized by the Ministry of 
Education. The Centre&#8217;s staff is composed mainly of members of management or 
specialists/researchers from the Academy with experience in public-speaking/teaching 
similar groups. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to address participants, who 
interacted with the Special Rapporteur on global efforts aimed at combating trafficking and, 
in particular, the role of the United Nations and the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in ensuring a human rights perspective is incorporated into all measures 
taken to counter human trafficking. The Special Rapporteur stands ready to provide 
assistance and advice to enhance the Centre&#8217;s effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>32. Field training also occurs at the airport and with the border committee. The Special 
Rapporteur learned that, in 2008, 108 specialists were trained by means of 17 seminars. 
Representatives of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the United Arab Emirates were also trained at 
the Centre and have asked for another course on the issue of countering trafficking in 
human beings. The Centre&#8217;s representatives requested greater technical cooperation from 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which could include sharing of 
documentation or assistance in organizing a course. The Special Rapporteur commended 
the Centre&#8217;s work and suggested that it share experiences with similar centres in other 
countries.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur also learned about a joint project of the European Union, 
UNDP and UNICEF entitled &#8220;Preventing, Fighting and Addressing the Social 
Consequences of Trafficking in Human Beings in the Republic of Belarus&#8221;, which was 
launched in July 2009. The project aims to enhance national capacities in fighting 
trafficking, with a focus on preventive measures and better protection and 
rehabilitation/recovery of victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Practices 
</b></p>
<p>34. Judges at the Supreme Court, the highest level of tribunal in Belarus, consider their 
domestic laws related to trafficking-related crimes to be sufficient. Sometimes, the courts 
may apply and/or refer to the Palermo Protocol.  
</p>
<p>35. The Supreme Court operates as a court of review of civil and criminal matters and 
has the competence to make recommendations to the Constitutional Court regarding the 
conformity of laws, decrees and edicts of the President, international agreements and other 
obligations of the Republic of Belarus with the Constitution.6 The Court also reported that it 
is active in a variety of events, meetings and conferences intended to exchange ideas on 
counter-trafficking laws and practices with counterparts in the Baltic States, Moldova, the 
Russian Federation and Ukraine.

<p>36. Since 2005, in cooperation with IOM, judges at all levels are provided with training 
on trafficking in persons, at the rate of approximately 120 judges per year. Judges also take 
part in human rights seminars organized by IOM, OSCE and UNDP and through the 
Judicial Further Training Institute and in partnership with IOM. Prosecutors, borders 
guards, regional field officers of the Ministry of Interior, and investigators and 
representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor-General also benefit from counter-trafficking 
training seminars conducted by IOM.  
</p>
<p>37. According to information provided, even though compensation is granted to victims 
of trafficking during criminal trials, they can in practice pursue further compensation by 
way of civil procedure or action.   
</p>
<p>38. Article 11 of Decree No. 352 provides that &#8220;measures on protecting the victims of 
trafficking in human beings, envisaged by this Decree, shall not be applied, and those being 
applied shall be revoked, if the victim of trafficking in human beings is impeding the initial 
investigation or the legal proceedings of the criminal case&#8221;. While she did not receive any 
allegations that this had occurred, the Special Rapporteur insists that the lack of capacity or 
willingness on the part of the victim of trafficking to participate in legal proceedings should 
never be interpreted as &#8220;impeding an initial investigation or the legal proceedings&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to recall Principle 8 of the 
Recommended Principles on Human Rights and Human Trafficking which provides that 
&#8220;States shall ensure that trafficked persons are protected from further exploitation and harm 
and have access to adequate physical and psychological care. Such protection and care shall 
not be made conditional upon the capacity or willingness of the trafficked person to 
cooperate in legal proceedings&#8221; (E/2002/68/Add.1, para. 8).  
</p><p>40. Some concerns were reported about violations of certain human rights in the name 
of counter-trafficking efforts, such as freedom of movement, right to privacy and right to 
work and earn a decent livelihood. It is reported that certain measures (such as the 
requirements to obtain a permit to study or work abroad) are repressive and, in some 
instances, can restrict the constitutionally protected right to freedom of movement and other 
internationally recognized human rights. A student is required to obtain an authorization 
permit from the Ministry of Education before pursuing studies abroad. Allegedly, the 
Ministry can refuse to issue such an authorization without giving reasons to the applicant. 
Although, an appeal procedure exists in case of rejection of an application, the Government 
must ensure that the rights and freedoms of applicants are fully respected. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur recalls that anti-trafficking measures should not operate to 
violate people&#8217;s human rights. A proper balance must be struck between measures to 
combat trafficking and the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>42. Strategies aimed at preventing trafficking in persons must take into account root 
causes, such as demand and factors which increase vulnerability to trafficking. The Special 
Rapporteur learned of various initiatives undertaken by the Government to raise awareness 
of the dangers associated with trafficking in persons. For instance, a course in schools was 
introduced to increase awareness of violence, where to get assistance and how to react. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur observed a widespread Government multimedia 
campaign in Minsk raising the awareness of the general population of the dangers of 
trafficking. She also noted a number of information, education and communication 
materials available on trafficking in persons and domestic violence against women at the 
Regional Social Service Centre of the Pervomaisky District of Minsk. Some NGOs work 
directly with high-risk groups (including the military), provide free films describing the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13102 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>problem, organize events for young people and competitions, etc. One NGO provides 
advice for those seeking opportunities abroad and assists in enhancing qualifications of 
students, such as by establishing links with teacher training institutes, training sessions and 
preventive work in schools.  
</p>
<p>43. Another NGO focuses on the prevention of domestic violence and promotion of 
gender equality. It reports that over 50 per cent of trafficking victims who approach it have 
been victims of domestic violence. Consequently, it organizes information sessions and 
training in small towns and currently trains trainers on: prevention of trafficking and 
domestic violence; promotion of gender equality in the workplace; how to find a job; and 
how individuals can defend their own rights. This NGO also runs a hotline; the majority of 
callers are those seeking to go abroad. Twenty per cent of calls are from women; 14 per 
cent are from those seeking information about marriage/divorce abroad; approximately 25 
per cent come from those who would like to access certain consulates abroad; and between 
5 and 8 per cent come from victims or relatives looking for family members. Another NGO 
reports that it has received 10,150 calls on its hotline since 2003. Of its callers, 69 per cent 
are women and 31 per cent from men. The hotline also receives calls from abroad. 
</p>
<p>44. IOM prevention activities include a toll-free hotline in Brest for consultations on 
safe work and travel abroad; dissemination of awareness-raising materials; holding a 
number of trainings and seminars for governmental officials, civil society organizations, 
journalists, diplomats and &#8220;at risk&#8221; groups including on job seeking; establishment and 
development of prevention and referral networks consisting of 13 civil society 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur received information that implementation of the current 
Government campaign against trafficking appears not to focus enough on prevention or 
addressing the root causes of the phenomenon. However, subsequent information from the 
authorities maintains that the second State Plan of Action for combating human trafficking, 
illegal migration and related wrongful acts for 2008&#8211;2010 focuses on prevention of 
trafficking, information campaigns and the eradication of the causes and conditions 
conducive to the emergence of &#8220;modern slavery&#8221;. While the Government must ensure that 
traffickers are prosecuted and charged accordingly, the Special Rapporteur insists that any 
such measures must also be coupled with effective preventive measures which tackle the 
root causes of trafficking, particularly since Belarus has traditionally been a source country 
for trafficking.  
</p>
<p>46. The root causes of trafficking in human beings are multiple and interlinked, and 
include such issues as gender inequalities, poverty and/or low economic conditions and 
employment opportunities and demand for exploitative services. Therefore, a multisectoral 
approach to tackling such root causes is crucial. Domestic violence is reportedly the second 
largest problem affecting Belarus. However, there are currently no specialized shelters for 
women suffering from domestic violence, no national hotline dedicated to the issue and, as 
already mentioned, no law on domestic violence. One interlocutor expressed a wish to be 
able to set up a legal aid clinic for victims of domestic violence. A robust law on domestic 
violence would help in decreasing the number of persons, especially women, who may 
become vulnerable to trafficking. The Special Rapporteur observed that levels of awareness 
on trafficking are high, but nevertheless insists that assistance and prevention programmes 
should be more targeted to particular vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>47. While recognizing certain efforts undertaken by Belarus and civil society 
organizations to strengthen skills and employment training, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about reports that, while official statistics indicate that unemployment levels are 
low, wages are still relatively low and underemployment continues to exist.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-13102 
</p>
<p>48. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about allegations of gender 
inequalities in employment and access to employment. The Ministry of Labour stated that 
women represent 52.2 per cent of the total economically active population and men 46.9 
per cent. While the Ministry of Labour reported that unemployment for women has 
decreased, the Special Rapporteur insists that the gender dimension should be taken into 
account in any efforts to combat gender inequalities in the labour market. The Special 
Rapporteur also encourages Belarus to examine ways of increasing opportunities for legal, 
gainful and non-exploitative labour migration. 
</p>
<p>49. Article 9, paragraph 5, of the Palermo Protocol provides that States parties shall 
adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or cultural 
measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage the 
demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, 
that leads to trafficking. The demand for trafficked men, women and children exists at three 
levels: employer demand, consumer demand (such as clients of the sex industry, corporate 
buyers or household members for domestic work) and third parties involved in the process 
(such as recruiters, agents, transporters and others who participate knowingly in the 
movement of persons for the purposes of exploitation).7 The fact that there is still a demand 
for labour that is exploitative or services which breach the human rights of the person 
delivering those services must be addressed urgently by the Government and civil society 
alike. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Identification, protection and assistance to victims of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Identification 
</b></p>
<p>50. The proper identification of victims of trafficking is vital in providing the assistance 
necessary to guarantee full, or at least substantial, recovery from harm suffered and to 
rehabilitate and reintegrate the victim socially and economically. The process of identifying 
a victim of trafficking is an increasingly complex endeavour, and is linked to the authorities 
and organizations involved in providing protection and assistance to the victim, as well as 
factors related to the victim him/herself. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the violence suffered as a result of being 
trafficked for sexual exploitation was often an extension of the violence suffered by some 
women at home. In such circumstances, it is difficult for a victim to identify herself as a 
victim of trafficking and to understand that she should be entitled to protection as a victim 
of trafficking. For male victims of labour exploitation, they often believe that their labour 
rights have been violated, rather than that they are entitled to protection as victims of 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>52. Such circumstances reinforce the importance and need for clear guidelines and 
procedures for relevant State authorities and officials (police officers, border guards and 
immigration officials) to permit the rapid and accurate identification of trafficked persons, 
as indicated in the Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking 
(E/2002/68/Add.1). Guidelines should also be developed on dealing with child victims of 
trafficking. Appropriate training must be provided to relevant authorities and officials as 
envisaged under article 10 of the Palermo Protocol. 
</p>
<p>53. The State Border Committee reported on its procedures for dealing with victims or 
possible or potential victims of trafficking. When border officials encounter such

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13102 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>individuals, they inform the Ministry of the Interior, the La Strada programme of the 
Belarus Young Women&#8217;s Christian Association (YWCA) and the Belarusian Red Cross. 
While border officials attempt to identify potential victims, psychologists are already 
working with them. They try to convince them not to cross borders by explaining the 
dangers of what lies ahead for them. The individuals then either remain in a shelter or other 
form of accommodation or are sent to the Ministry of the Interior. Representatives informed 
the Special Rapporteur that they have joint projects to improve the psychological services 
available within the border service. The border officials work within the framework of the 
presidential decrees on combating trafficking in human beings. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur learned that IOM provides training to law enforcement 
officials. La Strada/YWCA also reported that it organizes training for the police and border 
services and those officials who might be involved in identifying victims or potential 
victims of trafficking. The Special Rapporteur notes that training and information exchange 
must be carried out by the Government in collaboration with NGOs and other relevant civil 
society organizations or stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>55. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur shares the views expressed by some 
interlocutors for the need to increase the quantity and quality of training provided to 
relevant Government officials on identification of victims. Proper identification helps in 
reconciling statistical information on victims of trafficking received from the Government 
with those statistics received from NGOs and other service providers. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur learned that the Office for Democratic Institutions and 
Human Rights of OSCE is engaged in a project with the Belarus YWCA, IOM and the 
Ministry of the Interior with a view to assessing the anti-trafficking structures in Belarus, to 
identify and refer trafficked persons to support services, provide assistance and protection 
and assess the need for a national referral system on trafficking. The plan for such a 
mechanism is reportedly being discussed. An effective national referral mechanism must 
ensure an intersectoral approach to identifying and assisting victims of trafficking, sharing 
adequate and timely information and ensuring that trained professionals are at points of 
contact with individuals who could be potential victims of trafficking or who are already 
victims, and can be referred to relevant associations or authorities depending on the type of 
assistance or protection required.  
</p>
<p>57. Identifying victims and, more specifically, separating them from the perpetrators of 
the crime of trafficking is a complex process. One concern expressed to the Special 
Rapporteur is that in efforts to clamp down on trafficking, there is a risk that the 
Government treats certain individuals recovered in a trafficking operation as criminals 
rather than properly identifying them as victims. Article 6 of the Palermo Protocol provides 
that States parties shall provide assistance to and protection of victims of trafficking in 
persons. Furthermore, guideline 4, paragraph 4, of the Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking provides that States should ensure 
that legislation prevents trafficked persons from being prosecuted, detained or punished for 
the illegality of their entry or residence or for the activities they are involved in as a direct 
consequence of their situation as trafficked persons. This guideline is reflected in Decree 
No. 352 (art. 7), but the Special Rapporteur recalls the importance of a multisectoral 
approach to the identification and treatment of victims of trafficking, in order to ensure 
effective implementation of the Decree.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Protection and assistance  
</b></p>
<p>58. The Ministries of Labour, Education and Health are charged with providing 
assistance to victims of crimes and, in this regard, social assistance centres (or &#8220;territorial 
centres&#8221;) have been established by law and are funded by the State. Across the country, 156 
such centres are tasked with assisting individuals to find jobs and providing free legal aid </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-13102 
</p>
<p>and psychological and medical assistance. Article 5 of Decree No. 352 provides that 
criminal prosecution bodies will send victims of trafficking to these centres with the aim of 
restoring them to favourable living conditions. The authorities stated that only 7 of the 
victims seeking assistance at these territorial centres in 2008 were victims of trafficking, 
while an NGO reported that the number was even lower, at 10 people, between 2005 and 
</p><p>2008. Rather, the Special Rapporteur was informed that these centres provide assistance to 
victims of trafficking or of domestic violence indirectly, as a result of the victims having 
received financial assistance. The Special Rapporteur also learned that only 17 out of the 
total 156 territorial centres are in a position to provide assistance to victims of trafficking, 
as only the staff of those centres had attended relevant trainings.  
</p>
<p>59. The Ministry of the Interior reported that despite having sufficiently trained medical, 
psychological and legal specialists to assist with victim rehabilitation, the care provided at 
these centres needs improvement. Some NGOs, along with IOM, provide training to the 
staff of the territorial centres, but the latter do not have the opportunity to apply the skills 
and knowledge acquired. The centres allegedly do not have shelter space to accommodate 
victims. One NGO admitted that the existence of these centres is of value, that they have 
relatively good contact with them (e.g., it can send victims there if he/she so chooses) and 
that at least they operate in even the smallest towns in Belarus. Another civil society 
organization reported that an anti-crisis centre &#8212; consisting of a three-room flat 
functioning as a free shelter for victims &#8212; recently closed down due to the financial crisis. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit the Minsk City Centre of Social 
Services for the Family and Children. Throughout the visit, she observed and learned that 
the territorial centres are rarely seen as a point of reference for victims of trafficking for 
several reasons: limited trained human resources; a possible lack of confidence in the staff; 
the fact that centres work with a variety of vulnerable groups (e.g., large families) often 
means it is difficult to recognize and address individual cases; and, lastly, there is no 
specific desk at these territorial centres that addresses trafficking in persons. Furthermore, 
NGOs that rent rooms at these territorial centres have to pay fees, so these NGOs have had 
to seek subsidies elsewhere or close down. 
</p>
<p>61. Several anti-trafficking NGOs and civil society organizations provide protection and 
assistance services to victims of trafficking. The Belarusian Red Cross stated that it runs 
assistance centres in five regions of Belarus, with the support of IOM, known under the 
name &#8220;Helping Hand&#8221;. They have trained staff who monitor cases and provide 
rehabilitation and psychological services for victims of trafficking. They engage in 
awareness-raising, particularly with those individuals who are at highest risk of becoming 
victims. However, the representative was concerned that these centres are underfunded and 
that financial support has been decreasing. In the five regions, the only support remaining is 
psychological assistance, as reportedly even IOM is having financial difficulties. The 
Belarusian Red Cross is seeking more funds in order to support their work. The 
representative insisted that individuals trust these centres, noting the benefits of maintaining 
them at the local level, rather than consolidating them into a national rehabilitation centre. 
</p>
<p>62. Another NGO provides assistance services, such as meeting individuals at the 
airport and providing psychiatric, psychological, medical and legal assistance. Legal 
assistance includes help with participating in criminal trials and addressing issues of a civil 
nature, such as dealing with property, etc. The staff at this NGO provide emotional support 
and social workers develop a reintegration plan, along with some financial support. 
</p>
<p>63. One NGO reported that they provide the same assistance to men as they do to 
women, including psychological and legal assistance. Nevertheless, men tend to prefer 
vocational training and are often resistant to psychological help or accommodation in 
shelters. They will accept medical help, but would rather be outpatients. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13102 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>64. IOM protection and reintegration activities include providing assistance and support 
to victims of trafficking returning to, or leaving from, Belarus. Since 2002, IOM Minsk 
(alone and/or through its civil society organization partners) reportedly assisted 1,756 
victims of trafficking. The scope of such activities includes: assisted return to Belarus or to 
the country of origin; assistance in document restoration; running shelters; legal, medical 
and psychological assistance; employment counselling and grants for vocational training, 
scholarship and professional tools; and reintegration grants for the first three months after 
their return. 
</p>
<p>65. The following table illustrates certain elements of the profile of victims of 
trafficking assisted by IOM Minsk between 2006 and March 2009: 
</p>
<p><i> 2006 2007 2008 2009 
</i></p>
<p>Gender:     
Female 263 153 162 33 
Male 159 31 56 27 
Type of exploitation:     
Sexual 187 134 153 31 
Labour 229 47 63 28 
</p>
<p>Male victims accounted for 28.3 per cent of the IOM caseload between 2004 and 2006.8 
The vast majority of these cases are of Belarusian men trafficked to the Russian Federation 
for exploitation in forced labour, mostly in the construction, agriculture and factory work 
sectors. These men often hand over their passports to their employer while awaiting their 
work permit, and are informed that they will be paid their salary once the work is finished. 
However, they reportedly rarely see any salary. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur visited and met with representatives of the IOM 
Rehabilitation Shelter for Victims of Human Trafficking in Minsk, which provides 
accommodation, food, psychological, social care and assistance at a nearby medical centre 
where victims are directed. The shelter currently contains two bedrooms and can 
accommodate six persons at the same time. The shelter was occupied by 15 residents 
between January and May 2009, and there are approximately 70 residents per year, the 
average stay lasting two weeks. For the first time, male victims of labour exploitation were 
staying in the shelter. Children can also stay with their mothers at the shelter if necessary. 
Residents are free to come and go as they please. Men and women are not hosted at the 
shelter at the same time. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, in the absence of 
adequate arrangements to host women and men at the same time, some victims might have 
to be turned away. 
</p>
<p>67. According to information received, female victims of trafficking received at the 
shelter often come from homes affected by domestic violence and, frequently, the victims 
were sexually exploited. The average age is between 24 and 26 years. The Special 
Rapporteur was also informed that a number of the residents have sexually transmitted 
illnesses and receive treatment from the medical centre linked to the shelter. The 
representatives of the shelter insisted on the need to offer an environment for these victims 
where they could open up, feel like they are not being accused and have a space where they 
can bolster their self-esteem and remove their sense of guilt. The centre tries to encourage

<p><b>16</b> GE.10-13102 
</p>
<p>its residents to move from a sense of being a victim to one of being a survivor. The greatest 
challenge in running the shelter is gaining the trust of the victims when they arrive. Many 
victims feared the shelter would be a form of prison. Centre representatives inform victims 
of their rights, and encourage them to bring their case to court without exerting any undue 
pressure. 
</p>
<p>68. Most psychological work is done on a one-on-one basis with a psychologist, but 
group sessions are also offered. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that centre 
representatives keep in contact with the individuals after they leave the shelter, in the event 
that further care or follow-up is needed. Victims are referred from IOM Russia, IOM 
Belarus and NGOs in the Russian Federation or law enforcement agencies in the Russian 
Federation or Belarus. The team of experts at the shelter exchange experiences and share 
practices with similar structures from other countries (e.g., Moldova, the Russian 
Federation and Ukraine). 
</p><p>69. IOM had suggested to the Government that it should establish a State-run centre, 
with funds allocated for reintegrating victims, but there is still no clear answer on this from 
the Government. The Ministry of the Interior informed the Special Rapporteur that a 
presidential directive (2009) was being developed to provide for a more effective system 
for State rehabilitation of victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>70. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur echoes concerns expressed by some stakeholders to 
the effect that the Government should increase efforts to break down the stigma of being a 
victim of trafficking. To achieve such an objective, support to local NGOs, social services 
centres and other community organizations should increase through the provision of 
training on trafficking, its causes and consequences, which can be channelled into effective 
awareness-raising programmes at the grass-roots level. The work of territorial centres needs 
to expand and be more effective at the local level. 
</p>
<p>71. In view of the above, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts undertaken to 
provide protection and assistance to victims of trafficking. Nevertheless, she shares 
concerns that the burden on international and civil society organizations is extremely heavy 
in ensuring these services, especially given the limited financial resources at their disposal. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Access to justice 
</b>72. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that there are special rooms in some 
courts for confidential interview of victims of trafficking during the course of a trial. She 
encourages the Government to take measures to ensure that such rooms are available in all 
courts across the country. 
</p>
<p>73. The Ministry of Justice informed the Special Rapporteur that legal assistance is 
regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure and other laws, and provides for free legal 
assistance to victims of trafficking. A 2006 Government directive further indicates the areas 
and kinds of assistance which can be provided. This legal assistance is currently provided 
by the Bar Association. 
</p>
<p>74. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur learned that the question of setting up a legal 
aid fund is being examined by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Prosecution of cases of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Prosecution and punishment of traffickers 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Office of the Prosecutor-General informed the Special Rapporteur that it is an 
autonomous body not subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and supervises enforcement of 
laws against trafficking in persons. The Ministry of the Interior investigates criminal cases </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13102 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>(illegal migration, trafficking and prostitution), while the prosecutor&#8217;s office undertakes 
procedural monitoring of the legality of such investigations. It is the central body in charge 
of requests for legal assistance and explains victims&#8217; rights to them, including to 
compensation. Focal points responsible for counter-trafficking issues are appointed in 
Minsk and in the regions. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur also learned that the prosecutor&#8217;s office monitors effective 
implementation of child protection laws in cases where minors are victims of trafficking. 
The prosecutor&#8217;s office stated that Belarus has comprehensive child protection systems, 
including legislative measures, with an emphasis on prevention in order to identify 
problems early. It cited a 2003 presidential decree which enshrines the Convention on 
Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. 
</p>
<p>77. The Office of the Prosecutor-General informed the Special Rapporteur that, between 
2000 and 2008, there were a total of 580 prosecutions of trafficking in persons under article 
181 of the Criminal Code. This number increases to 1,308 if statistics on &#8220;export of 
individuals abroad&#8221; are included. In 2006, the number of victims increased to almost double 
that of previous years (because of the investigation into a case involving many victims). 
Half of the overall victims were identified in one single case and all those accused were 
convicted. Between 2005 and 2008, 503 individuals were convicted and in only one case 
was the defendant found not guilty. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the vast 
majority of offenders of trafficking are Belarusian citizens, who have attempted to procure 
or aid and abet trafficking in persons; however, some have international connections and, in 
some cases, extradition requests were successfully made. 
</p>
<p>78. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the following statistics reflect the number 
of victims of trafficking identified in the framework of criminal investigations between 
2006 and 2009: 
</p>
<p><i> 2006 2007 2008 2009

</p>
<p>79. While there are currently no specialized sections within the courts to deal with cases 
of trafficking, the Special Rapporteur learned from representatives of the Supreme Court 
that work is under way to set up juvenile courts. 
</p><p>80. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the great efforts undertaken by the 
Government to ensure prosecution and punishment of those individuals and groups 
involved in trafficking in human beings. Nevertheless, she reiterates the need for a strong 
intersectoral and integrated national referral mechanism in order to ensure that criminal 
cases are not improperly brought forward and that individuals are properly identified as 
either having violated trafficking-related crimes or as being victims. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.10-13102 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Compensation or remedies for victims 
</b></p>
<p>81. Article 6, paragraph 6, of the Palermo Protocol provides that each State party shall 
ensure that its domestic legal system contains measures that offer victims of trafficking in 
persons the possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that, since the Criminal Code provides that any victim of a crime 
is entitled to claim compensation for damage, there was no need to include it specifically in 
separate anti-trafficking legislation. The Ministry of Justice stated that compensation has 
been awarded in the past to victims of trafficking pursuant to the Criminal Code and that, 
while the sums do not seem considerable from an international perspective, they do 
correspond to the harm suffered. It is the duty of the prosecutor to raise such a claim at the 
investigative and trial stage. From January 2008 until May 2009, the Government reported 
that there had been 24 criminal cases initiated with the participation of 44 victims of 
trafficking. The court satisfied 23 claims and rejected 14 claims. The sums awarded vary 
from 500,000 to 2,000,000 roubles (from approximately US$ 176 to 724). Currently, funds 
for compensation are provided by those convicted and if nothing is recovered from them or 
no property is confiscated then compensation is delayed and may take several years to be 
recovered from the prisoner/trafficker. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, while 
there is currently no compensation fund, the issue of establishing one is being examined by 
the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Cooperation with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur observed that the level of cooperation between the 
Government and civil society is still relatively weak and that intersectoral work is still in its 
infancy in Belarus. Most interlocutors from civil society organizations were of the view that 
they have particular, specialized expertise and that the Government should be more 
receptive to real cooperation with them and view them as real partners in efforts to combat 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>83. It is reportedly difficult for NGOs to get information from the police, particularly 
with respect to victims of labour exploitation. Allegedly, if an individual does not want to 
lodge a complaint, then law enforcement authorities may not consider him/her to be a 
victim and thus will not share information about this individual to NGOs which may be in a 
position to assist him or her. One NGO thanked international organizations present in 
Belarus for having promoted its work and provided training and equipment, especially 
away from the capital. Unfortunately, it is alleged that the Government rarely draws on the 
experience and expertise of some NGOs. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about risks 
to the sustainability of civil society organizations owing to limited funding from the State. 
The Government&#8217;s authorization process for grants received by NGOs from donors to 
operate in the field of countering trafficking is reportedly very slow, making it difficult for 
NGOs to access and use grants provided to them and to accomplish tasks within the 
proposed timeline. These concerns once again raise the importance of an integrated, 
intersectoral, national referral mechanism. Also important is that the Government reach out 
to NGOs and view them as real partners rather than competitors. 
</p>
<p>84. The Ministry of the Interior informed the Special Rapporteur that it is currently 
examining the possibility of granting tax exemptions or tax breaks to NGOs. The directive 
in this regard has already been sent to the Council of Ministers. The Special Rapporteur 
was also informed about a draft law enabling the State to provide funding to civil society 
organizations on the basis of a call for tender. 
</p>
<p>85. OSCE focuses on increasing cooperation between law enforcement agencies and 
NGOs and has observed a positive change in the past two years, as the work of NGOs is 
increasingly recognized. </p>

<p><b> F. International, regional and bilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>86. International, regional and bilateral cooperation is essential for effective efforts to 
combat trafficking in persons. All interlocutors agreed that proper and effective data 
collection was necessary in order to establish the true extent of the problem of trafficking in 
persons and address it accordingly. In the course of her visit, the Special Rapporteur 
learned of a number of positive experiences of bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the 
field of combating human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>87. Belarus has bilateral cooperation agreements with Austria, Estonia, France, Finland, 
Germany and Hungary for exchanging information and organizing joint seminars. There are 
1,250 km of land borders with countries in the European Union, and the Ministry of the 
Interior reported on positive cooperation with its European Union neighbours such as 
Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. For instance, there is an agreement between the Ministry of 
the Interior and the Police Academy in Poland, whereby staff from the Ministry visit the 
academy to share experiences and discuss challenges and good practices when it comes to 
tackling crime, including trafficking in persons. Cooperation with the Russian Federation 
and with the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) was also cited as 
positive. The Ukraine Consul added that individuals leaving the Russian Federation and 
heading for Ukraine often end up in Belarus. 
</p>
<p>88. IOM reported on cooperation with the European Police Office (EUROPOL), which 
took the form of arranging for counter-trafficking experts from EUROPOL to conduct 
lectures on combating trafficking in human beings in the European Union and best practices 
in the European Union. Belarus also signed a cooperation agreement with the European 
Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders, Frontex. 
The State Border Committee also reported that a memorandum of understanding had been 
concluded with IOM, providing for the organization of seminars for all personnel of the 
State Border Committee, to increase knowledge of profiles of trafficking victims, migration 
and asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p>89. The Ministry of the Interior informed the Special Rapporteur that it works closely 
with customs and border control to obtain information on who is being monitored by the 
police in bordering countries. In this regard, the Ministry is currently seeking an agreement 
that would allow its customs services to have access to relevant computer software and 
information. 
</p>
<p>90. On the issue of international legal assistance (such as extradition), the prosecutor&#8217;s 
office reported that, between 2005 and 2008, Belarus received 14 requests and sent 21 
requests for trafficking-related crimes. Of those sent, 11 were for extradition, 7 of which 
were granted, and 2 have been refused. 
</p>
<p>91. At the regional level, CIS has a number of regional cooperation agreements, notably 
the Programme of Cooperation of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Combating 
Trafficking in Human Beings for 2007&#8211;2010. The objectives are, inter alia, to expand and 
strengthen the international legal framework of cooperation and improve and harmonize 
national legislation. Each member State under this programme of cooperation is to adopt a 
national programme of action to combat trafficking in persons and provide psychological, 
legal, medical, information and other assistance to victims of trafficking. Finally, the CIS 
Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Cases 
regulates the matters of extradition, criminal prosecution and special rules of legal 
assistance in criminal cases. </p>

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls that the insidious nature of the practice makes 
it difficult to measure the true scope of trafficking in persons, which affects both 
women and men in Belarus. She welcomes the political commitment of Belarus at the 
highest level to addressing trafficking in persons, the adoption of legislative and policy 
measures and efforts to bring perpetrators to justice. Furthermore, she notes the 
efforts of Belarus at the international level, especially within the United Nations, in 
promoting a global plan of action for combating human trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Nevertheless, the root causes of trafficking need to be tackled more vigorously. 
Stronger efforts must also be placed on ensuring a holistic, reintegrative and 
rehabilitative system of assistance to victims of trafficking, with full recognition of 
their human rights. Such a system must integrate civil society organizations as true 
partners, with a view to ensuring more complete protection of victims. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Lastly, the Special Rapporteur recalls that any efforts to combat trafficking 
must be anchored in human rights, and a children&#8217;s rights and gender perspective 
must be underscored. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur recommends the following to 
the Government of Belarus. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Regarding legislation, the Government should ensure: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The adoption and implementation, as a matter of urgency, of a law on 
domestic violence, ensuring that the law is gender-specific and addresses the root 
causes of domestic violence, prevention, assistance to victims and prosecution of the 
offence; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The setting up of a legal aid fund, in accordance with discussions already 
initiated in this regard; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The adoption and implementation of the draft law enabling the State to 
provide funding to civil society organizations on the basis of a call for tender; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Continuation of its effort to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on 
Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Government should establish a national special rapporteur on trafficking 
in persons, under the aegis of the Presidential Administration, with a view to 
enhancing coordination of all counter-trafficking activities between the various 
stakeholders and facilitating research and data collection into all forms of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>While recognizing certain efforts undertaken by Belarus and civil society 
organizations to increase employment and skills training, the Government should 
strengthen employment opportunities at home. The gender dimension must be taken 
into account in any such efforts. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13102 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Government should increase its efforts to address the root causes of 
trafficking in human beings, including gender inequality and the demand for labour 
that is exploitative or services which breach the human rights of the person delivering 
those services. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Government should ensure that anti-trafficking measures do not operate to 
violate human rights. A proper balance must be struck between measures to combat 
trafficking and to protect other human rights, such as every individual&#8217;s right to 
movement, association, exchange of information, education, privacy and right to work 
and earn a decent livelihood. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Government should adopt clear guidelines and procedures for relevant 
State authorities and officials (police officers, border guards and immigration 
officials) to permit the rapid and accurate identification of trafficked persons, as 
indicated in both the Palermo Protocol and the Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking. Specific guidelines should also 
be adopted for identification and protection of child victims of trafficking in 
accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Training provided to relevant Government officials on identification, assistance 
to and protection of victims of trafficking should be enhanced in quality and quantity 
in collaboration with other stakeholders including NGOs and civil society 
organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Government should promote and institute a multisectoral approach to the 
identification and treatment of victims of trafficking; inter alia, through the 
strengthening of a national referral mechanism. This mechanism should include all 
relevant stakeholders, including civil society organizations and international 
organizations, and should ensure adequate and timely information-sharing. Trained 
professionals should be the contact points for victims or potential victims of 
trafficking and should refer victims to relevant associations or authorities according 
to the type of assistance or protection required. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Although levels of awareness of trafficking are high, assistance and prevention 
programmes should be strengthened, in particular by targeting specific vulnerable 
groups. Broad-based, awareness-raising initiatives should also be strengthened and 
properly evaluated to avoid stigmatization or re-victimization of victims of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Efforts to break down the stigma of being a victim of trafficking should be 
strengthened. To achieve such an objective, support to NGOs, social services centres 
and other community organizations should increase, using trainings on trafficking in 
persons, its causes and consequences, which can then be channelled into effective 
awareness-raising programmes at the grass-roots level. The work of territorial centres 
needs to expand and be more effective and relevant to victims of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Government should strengthen State structures with respect to protection 
and assistance to victims of trafficking. This would include creating new State-run 
shelters and/or increasing subsidies to civil society organizations to enable them to 
carry out their functions effectively and over the long-term. The Special Rapporteur 
calls on the Government to keep her informed of all developments regarding the 
presidential directive providing for a more effective system of State rehabilitation for 
all victims of trafficking, whether woman, child or man. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The territorial centres should appoint a focal point in charge of cases of 
trafficking in persons. The Government should ensure that these centres have 
sufficient human and financial resources to carry out their work effectively with 
respect to addressing trafficking in human beings. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> GE.10-13102 
</p>
<p>108. <b>The Government should take measures to ensure that special rooms for 
confidential interview of victims of trafficking during the course of a trial are 
available in all courts across the country. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts undertaken by the 
Government to ensure prosecution and punishment of those individuals and groups 
involved in trafficking in human beings. She insists that victims should be properly 
identified as such and never assimilated with traffickers or prosecuted for trafficking-
related crimes. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Government should continue strengthening its cooperation with 
international and civil society organizations, ensuring that such cooperation is 
intersectoral, integrated and coordinated and that the responsibilities of each partner 
are clear. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Government should adopt and implement the Government directive 
providing for the possibility of granting tax exemptions or tax breaks to NGOs and a 
speedy authorization process for the use of grants received by NGOs to implement 
actions to combat trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The Government should keep the Special Rapporteur informed of all 
developments regarding the establishment of a legal aid fund. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Government should establish a compensation fund for victims of 
trafficking, which can, inter alia, be composed of State funds and proceeds from the 
crimes of trafficking in persons.
