TopTung Limited 
Directors’ Report 2016
Operating and Financial Review
(a)  Operations.
(i)
Torrington Tungsten and Topaz Project
TopTung (the Company) is a Junior Explorer in the high-risk, high-reward Australian mining industry. 
The Group’s sole focus is on the Torrington Tungsten and Topaz Project. 
 
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Torrington Minerals Pty Ltd, holds only EL 8258 
and  EL  8355  which  comprise  the  Torrington  Tungsten  and  Topaz  Project  (Project)  in  north-eastern 
New South Wales. These tenements which are contiguous cover an area of approximately 54 square 
kilometres  were  acquired  from  Resolve  Geo  Pty  Ltd  in  August  2015  through  the  issue  of  ordinary 
shares in the Company and reimbursement of exploration expenditure. 
The Company’s stated aim is to prove up and develop an operation processing in the order of 
500,000 to 750,000 tpa of ore. This will require proven resources of up to 10Mt to allow for a 10-year 
project life with production of approximately 1,000 tpa of tungsten concentrate. This will require the 
Company to approximately double the amount of the presently known resources.
The present JORC Code 2012 compliant Mineral Resource estimate completed for the Project 
comprises an Indicated and Inferred Resource totalling 2,146,000 tonnes at 0.23% WO3 for 4,965 
tonnes WO3 (at 0.063% WO3 cut-off).
At a processing rate of 500,000 tpa, it is theoretically possible to co-produce in the order of 90,000 tpa 
of topaz (at an average grade of 18% topaz in the silexite host rock) as a by-product from tungsten 
extraction  and  recovery  by  gravimetric  processing.  Topaz  is  a  complex  fluoro-silicate  of  aluminium 
and the sheer volume of it that will be produced makes a compelling case to undertake research into 
its  potential  markets  and  products  as  both  a  bulk  industrial  feedstock  material  or  high-added  value 
small volume commodity (or both). Success in this research endeavour will contribute to the financial 
robustness on the project and remove the reliance of producing one product (tungsten) only.
Operational  progress  in  evaluating  the  Project  during  the  past  year  has  included  the  following 
milestones:
  Approval of the Right to Negotiate (RTN);
  Access agreements concluded with NSW Forestry Corporation and a private landowner;
  Completion  and  approval  of  the  Review  of  Environmental  Factors  (REF)  and  approval  of  the
planned exploration activities;
  Final discussions held  with DPI Water and the district Mines Inspector on applications due for
completion;
  Three  tonne  bulk  sample  collected  from  Mt  Everard  for  metallurgical  testwork  on  fine-grained
disseminated tungsten mineralisation;
  Process  route  that  achieves  +80%  of  the  tungsten  in  the  feed  material  (ore)    reporting  in  a
concentrate after magnetic separation now finalised;
  Collection  and  verification  of  project  specific  assay  standard  reference  material  for  use  in
laboratory analytical instrument calibration; and

TopTung Limited 
Directors’ Report 2016
Operating and Financial Review (cont)
  Topaz research intensified and discussions with marketing groups for bulk concentrate products 
and  also  with  industry  and  scientific  research  institutions  commenced  and  are  expected  to  be 
finalised shortly.
Planned exploration and associated activities that will occur during the period to 30 June 
2017comprise:
An intensive RC percussion and diamond drilling programme as approved by the DRE. The drill rigs 
will have a small footprint so as to minimise environmental disturbance and given that the holes are 
not expected to exceed 50m depth this will be possible. Diamond drilling will use mobile mud tanks to 
contain  drill  fluids.  It  is  estimated  that  the  programme  will  entail  in  the  order  of  10,000m  of  RC  and 
3,000m  of  diamond  drilling.  This  initial  drilling  programme  will  be  designed  to further  expand  on the 
present  JORC  2012  Code  resource  areas  and  to  evaluate  potential  continuation  of  mineralisation 
under cover between them, which has not previously been tested. 
 
Ongoing updates of JORC resource estimations.
Metallurgical  testwork  on  both  tungsten  and  topaz  recovery  will  continue  on  the  bulk  sample  until 
diamond  core  is  available  for  proof  of  concept,  or  verification  studies.  Methodologies  to  raise  the 
tungsten  content  of  the  concentrate  after  magnetic  separation  will  be  studied.  Topaz  recovery  and 
concentrate  characteristics  will  be  undertaken  and  research  on  topaz  derived  mullite  uses  including 
fibre production will be committed to. 
 
Baseline  environmental  and  related  studies  for  ML  application  purposes  in  order  to  progress  the 
assessment  of  mine  development  and  production  within  a  5-year  timeframe  (subject  to  results, 
approvals and financing). 
Other general Project information and risks:
Although the Torrington area has been subjected to intermittent mining for tungsten for more than 
100  years  and  the  metallurgical  recovery  of  the  coarse  grained  and  large  masses  of  tungsten 
processed  is  known  to  be  by  simple  gravimetric  processing,  hence  removing  one  of  the  major 
project  risks  for  that  style  of  mineralisation.  However,  the  Company  is  also  interested  in  the 
recovery of tungsten from the fine-grained disseminated style of mineralisation which is thought 
to  hold  bulk  mining  potential  versus  the  more  irregular  high-grade  vein  and  coarse-grained 
mineralisation  worked  by  the  previous  tenement  holders  and  miners.  Significant  progress  has 
been  made  during  this  reporting  period  on  the  metallurgical  processing  of  this  fine-grained 
disseminated style of mineralisation as well. 
 
Commodity  prices  are  of  concern  to  any  mineral  Company,  tungsten  however  is  not  a  bulk 
commodity and not dominated by large multinationals and it is also a recognised strategic mineral 
by  most  western  countries  given  the  dominance  of  China  in  the  mining  and  production  of 
tungsten and its compounds. Topaz as an industrial mineral and feedstock is different to metals 
as there is no ready market and hence determinable value until produced and marketed.
The  biggest  hurdle  the  Company  has  faced  until  recently  has  been  the  extraordinary  time 
required in the NSW permitting and approvals processes. Admittedly the Company management 
has gone through a steep learning which will stand it in good stead as the Project evolves.

TopTung Limited 
Directors’ Report 2016
Operating and Financial Review (cont)
In summary the key risks to be managed over the forthcoming year, include:
  Regulatory compliance with permitting obligations and retaining the Company’s ELs in good
standing;
  Contractor management during the drilling programmes;
  Workplace Health and Safety at the Project site;
  Community Relations;
  Resource estimation; and
  Evaluation of economic processing technologies
The 2016-2017 financial year stands to be an interesting and hopefully rewarding period for the 
Company and its shareholders.
(ii)
Change of Company Name
Following the acquisition of the Torrington Tungsten and Topaz Project, the Board resolved to change 
the  Company’s  name  to  TopTung  Limited  to  be  consistent  with  the  new  exploration  focus  on 
Tungsten  (and  Topaz).  This  change  of  name  was  approved  by  shareholders  at  an  EGM  held  in 
August 2015.
(iii)
Return of Capital
On  14  August  2015,  the  shareholders  in  general  meeting  overwhelmingly  approved  a  Return  of 
Capital being $0.05 per fully paid ordinary share. Payment of the Return occurred on 27 August 2015 
and totalled $4,027,155.
(iv)
Northern Territory Summons for Unauthorised Exploration and Drilling
The Company received a summons from the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy on 
the  25  June  2015  concerning  a  breach  of  the  Mining  Management  Act  (NT)  relating  to  illegal 
exploration activities permitted by the previous Board and management.
On 25 August 2015 the Court of Summary Jurisdiction in the Northern Territory found the Company 
guilty of breaching section 35(4) of the Mining Management Act (NT) and was ordered to pay a fine of 
$300,000. The breach related to drilling at the Company’s Tobermorey Project (EL 28710) which has 
subsequently been relinquished. This drilling project was authorised and conducted in 2014 under the 
former Board of Directors.
The Company appealed the decision in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and submissions 
were  delivered  to  the  Chief  Justice  at  a  hearing  held  on  13  October  2015.  The  Company  was 
informed on 22 October 2015 that the fine would be reduced from $300,000 to $150,000 on the basis 
that the original ruling was manifestly excessive. The Company was awarded a refund of legal costs 
of $10,000 by the Supreme Court due to the initial court’s ruling being successfully appealed.

TopTung Limited 
Directors’ Report 2016
Operating and Financial Review (cont)
However, the judgement against the Company remains, together with the undeserved implications of 
guilt for both the Company and its directors.
Subsequent  to  the  outcome  of  the  appeal,  the  Company  engaged  legal  advisors  to  assess  the 
possible  options  and  likelihood  of  success  for  recovery  of  these  and  related  costs  from  previous 
management and directors. The Company’s assessment of these options remains open.
(v)
Options
During  the  year  16,384,675  Listed  Options  (ASX:  TTWO)  were  converted  to  ordinary  shares  for  no 
consideration. This occurred after the Return of Capital approved by shareholders in general meeting 
reduced the exercise price from 5 cents to nil.
On  23  January  2016,  the  Company’s  Listed  Options  (ASX:  TTWO)  expired.  There  were  2,592,687 
unexercised TTWO options at the time of expiry.
Given the expiry of the Company’s unlisted options on 28 November 2015, the Company now has no 
options on issue.
(b)  Operating Loss
Key financial variances relating to the 2016 financial year include the following:
  Decrease  in  interest  revenue  from  $258,240  to  $153,576  as  a  result  of  a  lower  cash  balance 
during  the  year  arising  from  the  Return  of  Capital  in  August  2015  and  the  lower  interest  rate 
environment;
  Decrease in other income from $97,878 to $1,967 as a result of not being eligible for an R&D
Offset claim in the current year;
  The  loss  on  disposal  of  non-current  assets  resulting  from  the  sale  of  the  Townsville  property
was a one off charge in 2015;
  Decrease  in  employment  benefits  from  $231,887  to  $143,606  as  a  result  of  reducing  the  full-
time staff compliment from four to one, reducing the size of the board by one and reduced level 
of remuneration for the chief executive of the Company;
  In  2015  a  provision  was  recognised  for  the  fine  applied  by  the  Court  of  Jurisdiction  in  the 
Northern  Territory  as  a  result  of  a  breach  of  the  Mining  Management  Act  (NT)  totalling 
$300,000.  As  a  result  of  a  successful  appeal  this fine  was  reduced  to  $150,000  resulting  in  a 
credit to the income statement in 2016;
  Decrease in other expenses from $580,098 to $346,237 as a result of a cost containment focus
introduced by the new board;
  In 2015 an impairment charge on abandoning all Queensland and Northern Territory tenements 
was  booked-  $2,735,677  and  exploration  costs  incurred  during  the  period  totalling  $294,282 
were expensed. No charges of this nature were required in 2016.

(c)  Financial Position
Key financial variances relating to the 2016 financial year include the following:
  Net assets decreased by $3,582,085; and
  Cash balance at year end totalled $4,558,258
Net  assets decreased by  52% during the financial year. This was principally as a result  a Return of 
Capital totalling $4,027,155 in August 2016, being a return of 5 cents per ordinary share. In addition 
the decrease in net assets was impacted by the operating loss of $165,942 for the period.
Cash  balances  reduced by  $4,866,242  during  the financial  year  as  a result  of  the  Return  of  Capital 
and funding overhead and exploration expenditure outflows. Aside from short-term cash requirements 
held in an operating account, all funds at 30 June 2016 have been invested on a short term basis in 
deposits with financial institutions holding sound credit ratings.
The Group acquired the Torrington Tungsten and Topaz Project during the year for a mixture of cash 
and  issue  of  ordinary  shares.  The  value  of  the  acquisition  consideration  totalled  $746,012. 
Subsequent  to  acquisition,  the  Group  expended  $493,869  on  progressing  evaluation  of  the  project 
feasibility.
(d)  Business strategies and prospects for future financial years
Business strategies and prospects for future years have been included in the review of operations in 
(a) above
(e)  Administration and organisational
TopTung is an equal opportunity workplace. During the permitting and approval phase the Company 
did not directly employ personnel in order to maintain flexibility and minimise overheads. There are no 
females on our board of directors or any Indigenous Australians on the board or on staff.
Dividends
No  dividends  have  been  paid  or  declared  by  the  company  since  the  end  of  the  previous  financial 
period and no dividend will be paid for the current financial year.
Options
At  the  date  of  this  report  there  were  no  listed  or  unlisted  options  over  ordinary  shares  of  the 
Company.
During the financial year 16,384,675 listed bonus option holders exercised their right to acquire fully 
paid  ordinary  shares  in  the  Company.  These  options  were  exercisable  for  no  consideration  after 
shareholders approved a capital return of 5 cents per share in August 2015. At the date of expiry of 
the listed bonus options 2,590,187 remained unexercised and consequently lapsed.
No  option  holder  has  any  right  under  the  options  to  participate  in  any  other  share  issue  of  the 
company or any other entity.
Environmental Regulation
The  company’s  operations  are  subject  to  significant  environmental  regulation  principally  under  the 
provisions of the Mining Act 1992 and requirements of the Exploration Licences.
The company believes it has met its obligations in all areas to date.

TopTung Limited 
Directors’ Report 2016
Significant changes in the state of affairs
Other than as disclosed in this report, in the opinion of the directors there were no significant changes 
in the state of affairs of the company during the financial year under review.
Events subsequent to balance date
Subsequent  to  year  end  the  Company  incorporated  a  further  subsidiary,  TopFibre  Pty  Ltd.  This 
Company is currently dormant but will be used in future activities associated with topaz research and 
development.
In  August  2016,  the  Remuneration  Committee  conducted  a  review  of  the  employment  and 
remuneration arrangements for the Executive Chairman, Dr Leon Pretorius. Effective 1 July 2016, Dr 
Pretorius’ remuneration will be increased to $240,000 per annum (inclusive of superannuation). The 
new employment contact can be terminated by either party with 12 months’ notice.
There are no other events that have occurred subsequent to year end that are material or unusual in 
nature that are likely to affect significantly the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, 
or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent financial years.

Remuneration Report (Audited)
This remuneration report, set out under the following main headings, has been audited:
(a)  Remuneration policy
(b)  Service contracts
(c)  Remuneration details
(d)  Share based payments
(e)  Other transactions with KMP and their related parties
(a)  Remuneration Policy
A separate Remuneration Committee has not been established for the current financial year with all 
decisions regarding remuneration being made the full Board. The full Board is charged with the duties 
of considering and approving recommendations from management concerning non-executive director 
remuneration.
(i)
The Board and the Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration policy in such 
a way that it:
  motivates  directors  and  management  to  pursue  the  long-term  growth  and  success  of
the Company within an appropriate control framework; and
  demonstrates  a  clear
relationship  between  key  executive  performance  and
remuneration.
(ii)
In performing its role,  the Board and the Remuneration Committee is required to ensure 
that:

the  remuneration  offered  is  in  accordance  with  prevailing  market  conditions,  and  that 
exceptional circumstances are taken into consideration;
  contract provisions reflect market practice; and

if targets and incentives are set they are based on realistic performance criteria.
(iii)  The Board and the Remuneration Committee will also:
  overview the application of sound remuneration and employment practices across the
Company; and
  ensure  the  Company  complies  with  legislative  requirements  related  to  employment
practices.
All remuneration paid to directors and executives is valued at cost to the company and expensed or 
capitalised  (where  exploration  related).  Shares  issued  to  directors  or  executives  are  valued  at  the 
difference between the market price of the shares and the amount paid by the recipient. Options are 
valued using the Black-Scholes model.
Fees  paid  to  non-executive  directors  are  considered  by  the  Board  based  on  market  rates  for  time, 
commitment and responsibility. These are reviewed regularly by the Board and independent external 
advice  is  sought  when  required.  The  maximum  aggregate  amount  of  fees  that  can  be  paid  to  non-
executive directors is subject to shareholder approval and is currently set at $200,000 per annum.
On  termination,  directors  are  entitled  to  receive  their  statutory  entitlements  for  any  superannuation 
benefits together with any unpaid fees. No other termination benefits are payable.

Remuneration Report (cont)
To  further  align  directors’  interests  with  those  of  shareholders  and  in  order  to  provide  a  reward  for 
performance  and  to  enable  directors  and  key  employees  to  participate  in  future  Company  success, 
the  Company  utilises  a  Long  Term  Incentive  Plan  and  may  issue  options  to  directors  subject  to 
shareholder approval. No director options were issued during the past two financial years.
Other than the alignment between company performance and remuneration provided by the issue of 
options to directors as part of their remuneration, there were no other performance conditions set as 
part of director remuneration.
The Company has not used remuneration consultants during the year.
Relationship between the Remuneration Policy and the Company's performance
The  Company  is  focused  on  driving  sustained  growth  in  shareholder  wealth,  principally  through 
mineral  exploration,  evaluation  and  commercialisation  of  discoveries  each  designed  to  increase  the 
share price.
The mineral discovery focus of the Company is based on exploration and evaluation activities with the 
objective of proving up a resource that can be commercialised through development, joint venture or 
sale. Consequently there are sustained periods where a net operating loss is incurred. In the current 
year  the  Company’s  strategy  was  significantly  advanced  through  the  acquisition  of  the  prospective 
Torrington Tungsten and Topaz Project.

TopTung Limited 
Declaration by Directors
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016
Corporate Information
The financial statements of TopTung Limited  for the year ended 30 June 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of 
the  directors  on  6  September  2016  and  covers  the  consolidated  entity  consisting  of  TopTung  Limited  and  its  subsidiary  (the  Group)  as 
required by the Corporations Act 2001.
The financial report is presented in the Australian currency.
TopTung Limited is a company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled in Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange 
Limited.
On 14 August 2015, the shareholders in general meeting voted in favour of changing the name of the company from Krucible Metals Limited 
to TopTung Limited. This change of name has been registered by ASIC on 16 August 2015.
The address of the registered office and principal place of business is set out in the Corporate Directory section at the front of this report.
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Basis of Preparation
The  financial  statements  are  a  general  purpose  financial  report  which  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian  Accounting 
Standards,  including  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations,  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards 
Board and the Corporations Act 2001.
The  consolidated  entity  is  a  for  profit  entity  with  the  financial  statements  being  prepared  on  an  accruals  basis  based  on  historical  costs. 
Compliance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  ensures  that  the  financial  statements,  comprising  the  financial  statements  and  notes 
thereto, comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Parent entity information
In accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the consolidated entity only. Supplementary 
information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 27.
The  consolidated  entity  has  adopted  all  of  the  new,  revised  or  amending  Accounting  Standards  and  Interpretations  issued  by  the 
Australian  Accounting  Standards  Board  ('AASB')  that  are  mandatory  for  the  current  reporting  period.  The  adoption  of  these  Accounting 
Standards and Interpretations did not have any significant impact on the financial performance or position of the consolidated entity.
New Accounting Standards for Application in Future Periods
Accounting  Standards  issued  by  the  AASB  that  are  not  yet  mandatorily  applicable  to  the  Group,  together  with  an  assessment  of  the 
potential impact of such pronouncements on the Group when adopted in future periods, are discussed below:
AASB  9:  Financial  Instruments  and  associated  Amending  Standards  (applicable  to  annual  reporting  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1 
January 2018).
The  Standard  will  be  applicable  retrospectively  (subject  to  the  provisions  on  hedge  accounting  outlined  below)  and  includes  revised 
requirements  for  the  classification  and  measurement  of  financial  instruments,  revised  recognition  and  derecognition  requirements  for 
financial instruments and simplified requirements for hedge accounting.
The  key  changes  that  may  affect  the  Group  on  initial  application  include  certain  simplifications  to  the  classification  of  financial  assets, 
simplifications  to  the  accounting  of  embedded  derivatives,  upfront  accounting  for  expected  credit  loss,  and  the  irrevocable  election  to 
recognise  gains  and  losses  on  investments  in equity  instruments  that  are  not  held for  trading  in other  comprehensive  income.   AASB  9 
also introduces a new model for hedge accounting that will allow greater flexibility in the ability to hedge risk, particularly with respect to 
hedges of non-financial items.  Should the entity elect to change its hedge policies in line with the new hedge accounting requirements of 
the Standard, the application of such accounting would be largely prospective.
The core principle of the Standard is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services. To achieve this 
objective, AASB 15 provides the following five-step process:
identify the contract(s) with a customer;
identify the performance obligations in the contract(s);
determine the transaction price;
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and
recognise revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied.

TopTung Limited 
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
1.  Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (Cont)
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of AASB 15 will have an impact on the Group’s financial statements, based on the current 
operations which are exploration and evaluation focused.
AASB 16: Leases (applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).
When  effective,  this  Standard  will  replace  the  current  accounting  requirements  applicable  to  leases  in  AASB  117:  Leases  and  related 
Interpretations. AASB 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model that eliminates the requirement for leases to be classified as operating 
or finance leases.
The main changes introduced by the new Standard include:
-
-
-
-
-




recognition of a right-to-use asset and liability for all leases (excluding short-term leases with less than 12 
months of tenure and leases relating to low-value assets);
depreciation of right-to-use assets in line with AASB 116: Property, Plant and Equipment in profit or loss and 
unwinding of the liability in principal and interest components;
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the initial measurement of the lease 
liability using the index or rate at the commencement date;
by applying a practical expedient, a lessee is permitted to elect not to separate non-lease components and 
instead account for all components as a lease; and

additional disclosure requirements.
The transitional provisions of AASB 16 allow a lessee to either retrospectively apply the Standard to comparatives in line with AASB 108 or 
recognise the cumulative effect of retrospective application as an adjustment to opening equity on the date of initial application.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16 will impact the Group's financial statements, based on current operations and 
activities.
AASB 2014-3: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (applicable to 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016) and AASB 2014-10: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale 
or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018, as deferred by AASB 2015-10: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Effective Date of Amendments to AASB 
10 and AASB 128).are not expected to have any impact on the Group financial statements based on current operations.
(b) Income Tax
The  income  tax  expense/credit  for  the  period  is  the  tax  payable/recoverable  on  the  current  period's  taxable  income/loss  based  on  the 
national income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and  liabilities attributable to temporary differences 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.
Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognised  for  all  temporary  differences,  between  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  for 
financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases, at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities 
settled,  based  on  those  tax  rates  which  are  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  for  each  jurisdiction.  Exceptions  are  made  for  certain 
temporary differences arising on  initial recognition of an asset or a liability if they arose in a transaction, other than a business combination, 
that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit.
Deferred  tax  assets  are  only  recognised  for  deductible  temporary  differences  and  unused  tax  losses  if  it  is  probable  that  future  taxable 
amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Current and deferred tax balances relating to amounts recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity are also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
TopTung  Limited  (the  “head  entity”)  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  have  formed  an  income  tax  consolidated  group  under  the  tax 
consolidation  regime.  The  head  entity  and  the  subsidiary  in  the  tax  consolidated  group  continue  to  account  for  their  own  current  and 
deferred  tax  amounts.  The  tax  consolidated  group  has  applied  the  ‘separate  taxpayer  within  the  group’  approach  in  determining  the 
appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group.
In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred 
tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from the subsidiary.
The group does not have a tax funding or sharing agreement in place in relation to tax liabilities that might arise.

1.  Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (Cont)
(c) Impairment
At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is any indication that individual assets are impaired. Where impairment indicators 
exist, recoverable amount is determined and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss where the asset's carrying value exceeds its 
recoverable  amount.  Recoverable  amount  is  the  higher  of  an  asset's  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  value  in  use.  For  the  purpose  of 
assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre-tax  discount  rate  that  reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate recoverable amount for an individual asset, recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs.
(d) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and at bank, deposits held at call with 
financial institutions, and short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and bank overdrafts.
(e) Financial Instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
Recognition: 
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, when the related contractual rights or obligations exist.  
Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are measured as set out below. 
(i)  Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They 
are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance date, which are classified as non-
current assets. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment loss.
(ii) Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Group has 
the positive intention and ability to hold-to-maturity and are measured at amortised cost subsequent to initial recognition using the effective 
interest  method.  If  the  Group  were  to  sell  other  than  an  insignificant  amount  of  held-to-maturity  investments,  the  whole  category  is  then 
reclassified as available-for-sale.
(iii) Financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, comprising original debt less principle payments and amortisation.
Impairment: 
An assessment is made at each balance date to determine whether there is objective evidence that a specific financial asset or a group of 
financial assets may be impaired. A financial asset is considered impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had 
a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. 
If  such  evidence  exists,  the  estimated  recoverable  amount  of  that  asset  is  determined  by  publicly  available  information  such  as  quoted 
market prices or by calculating the net present value of future anticipated cash flows. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset is 
calculated  as  the  difference  between  its  carrying  amount  and  its  recoverable  amount.  All  impairment  losses  are  recognised  in  profit  and 
loss. There were no impairments at year end and as such no provision for impairment has been raised.
(f) Exploration and Evaluation Assets
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest. To the extent these costs are 
carried forward, they are only carried forward if they are expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area or where 
activities  in  the  area  have  not  yet  reached  a  stage  that  permits  reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  of  economically  recoverable 
reserves.
Certain accumulated costs are expensed three years after being incurred even when they are expected to be recouped through successful 
development of the area of interest or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the 
existence of economically recoverable reserves.
Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit in the year in which the decision to abandon is made.
When production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are amortised over the life of the area according to the 
rate of depletion of the economically recoverable reserve.
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to 
that area of interest.

1.  Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (Cont)
(g) Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation and where applicable impairment losses.
Depreciation of assets is calculated on a straight line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful 
lives.
The depreciation rates used for each class of depreciable asset are:
Buildings
2.5%
Equipment and furniture
8%~50%
Motor vehicles
19%~30%
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance date.
An assets' carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in profit or loss.
(h) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the year end and which are unpaid and 
unsecured and on credit terms ranging from 7 to 60 days.
(i) Employee Benefits
(a)   Wages and Salaries and Annual Leave
Liabilities  for  wages  and  salaries,  including  non-monetary  benefits,  and  annual  leave  expected  to  be  settled  within 12  months  of  balance 
date are recognised in respect of employees' services rendered up to balance date and measured at amounts expected to be paid when the 
liabilities are settled. Liabilities for wages and salaries and annual leave are included as part of other payables.
(b)
Long Service Leave
Liabilities  for  long  service  leave  are  recognised  as  part  of  the  provision  for  employee  benefits  and  measured  as  the  present  value  of 
expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees to the balance date. Consideration is given to expected 
future  salaries  and  wages  levels,  experience  of  employee  departures  and  periods  of  service.  Expected  future  payments  are  discounted 
using national government bond rates at balance date with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated 
future cash outflows.
(c)  Defined contribution superannuation expense
Contributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
(j) Share-based payments
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Employee Share Option Plan.
The  fair  value  of  options  granted  under  the  Employee  Share  Option  Plan  is  recognised  as  an  employee  benefit  expense  with  a 
corresponding increase in equity.
The  fair  value  is  measured  at  grant  date  and  recognized  over  the  period  during  which  employees  become  unconditionally  entitled  to  the 
options.
The fair value at grant date for options is independently determined using an option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, 
the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected 
dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.
(k) Contributed Equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown as a deduction from the equity proceeds, net of any income tax 
benefit.

TopTung Limited 
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
1.  Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (Cont)
(l) Earnings per share
(i)   Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit and loss attributable to equity holders of the company, excluding any 
costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary  shares outstanding during the 
year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.
(ii)
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after 
income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average 
number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(m) Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  are  recognised  net  of  GST  except  where  GST  incurred  on  a  purchase  of  goods  and  services  is  not 
recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the 
expense item.
Receivables  and  payables  are  stated  with  the  amount  of  GST  included.  The  net  amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the 
taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows arising from investing and 
financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are classified as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.
(n) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of TopTung Limited and its subsidiaries at 30 June each year ("the 
Group").  Subsidiaries  are  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  the  power  to  govern  the  financial  and  operating  policies  generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible 
are  considered  when  assessing  control.  Consolidated  financial  statements  include  all  subsidiaries  from  the  date  that  control  commences 
until the date that control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent using 
consistent accounting policies.
All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions,  including  unrealised  profits  arising  from  intragroup  transactions  have  been  eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred.
Subsidiaries are accounted for in the parent entity financial statements at cost.
(o) Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental expenditure
Costs  of  site  restoration  are  provided  over  the  life  of  the  facility  from  when  exploration  commences  and  are  included  in the  costs  of  that 
stage.  Site  restoration  costs  include  the  dismantling  and  removal  of  mining  plant,  equipment  and  building  structure,  waste  removal,  and 
rehabilitation  of the  site in accordance  with  clauses  of mining  permits. Such  costs  have  been  determined  using  estimates  of future costs, 
current legal requirements and technology on an undiscounted basis.
Estimates  of  future  costs  are  reassessed  at  least  annually.  Changes  in  estimates  relating  to  areas  of  interest  in  the  exploration  and 
evaluation phase are dealt with retrospectively, with any amounts that would have been written off or provided against under the accounting 
policy for exploration and evaluation immediately written off.
Restoration from exploration drilling is carried out at the time of drilling and accordingly no provision is required.
(p) Revenue Recognition
Revenue  is  recognised  when  it  is  probable  that  the  economic  benefit  will  flow  to  the  consolidated  entity  and  the  revenue  can  be  reliably 
measured, Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable
(q) Leases
The  determination  of  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease  is  based  on  the  substance  of  the  arrangement  and  requires  an 
assessment  of  whether  the  fulfilment  of  the  arrangement  is  dependent  on  the  use  of  a  specific  asses  or  assets  and  the  arrangement 
conveys the right to use the asset.
A distinction is made between finance leases, which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the  risks and benefits 
incidental to ownership of the leased assets, and operating leases, under which the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and 
benefits.
Finance leases are capitalised. A lease asset and liability are established at the fair value of the leased assets, or if lower, the present value 
of minimum lease payments. Lease payments are allocated between the principal component of the lease liability and the finance costs, so 
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
26
TopTung Limited 
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
1.  Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (Cont)
Leased assets acquired under finance lease are depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the 
lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the consolidated entity will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the profit and loss on a straight line basis over the 
term of the lease.
(r) Fair Values
Fair values may be used for financial asset and liability measurement and well as for sundry disclosures. 
 
Fair  value  is  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market 
participants at the measurement date. It is based on the presumption that the transaction takes place either in the principal market for the 
asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market. The principal or most advantageous market must 
be accessible to, or by, the group. 
 
Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their best economic interest. 
 
The  fair  value  measurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes  into  account  the  market  participant's  ability  to  generate  economic  benefits  by 
using the asset at its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset at its highest and best use. 
 
In  measuring  fair  value,  the  group  uses  valuation  techniques  that  maximise  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimise  the  use  of 
unobservable inputs.
(s) Comparatives
Where required by the Australian Accounting Standards comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for 
the current financial year.
2.  Critical Accounting Estimates And Other Accounting Judgements 
 
The  directors  evaluate  estimates  and  judgements  incorporated  into  the  financial  statements  based  on  historical  knowledge  and  best 
available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future  events and are based on current trends and economic 
data, obtained both externally and within the Group. 
 
The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are discussed below.
Exploration and evaluation costs 
Exploration and evaluation costs have been capitalised on the basis that the consolidated entity will commence commercial production in 
the future, from which time the costs will be amortised in proportion to the depletion of the mineral resources. Key judgements are applied in 
considering  costs  to  be  capitalised  which  includes  determining  expenditures  directly  related  to  these  activities  and  allocating  overheads 
between those that are expensed and capitalised. In addition, costs are only capitalised that are expected to be recovered either through 
successful  development  or  sale  of  the  relevant  mining  interest.  Factors  that  could  impact  the  future  commercial  production  at  the  mine 
include  the  level  of  reserves  and  resources,  future  technology  changes,  which  could impact  the  cost  of mining,  future  legal  changes  and 
changes in commodity prices. To the extent that capitalised costs are determined not to be recoverable in the future, they will be written off 
in the period in which this determination is made. 
 
3.  Segment Information 
 
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the  board of directors (chief 
operating  decision makers)  in assessing  performance  and  determining  the  allocation  of  resources.  The  Group  is  managed  primarily  on  a 
geographic basis that is the location of the respective areas of interest (tenements) in Australia. Operating segments are determined on the 
basis of financial information reported to the Board which is at the Group level. The Group does not have any products/services it derives 
revenue from. 
 
The Group does not have any products/services from which it derives revenue. 
 
Management currently identifies the Group as having only one operating segment, being exploration. All significant operating  decisions are 
based upon analysis of the Group as one segment. The financial results from the segment are equivalent to the financial statements of the 
Group as a whole.

During  the  year  the  Group  acquired  EL  8258  and  EL  8355  (Torrington  Tungsten  and  Topaz  Project)  from  Resolve  Geo  Pty  Ltd  for  the 
following consideration: 
a)
12,000,000  shares  (Tranche  1)  in  the  Company  subject  to  1  and  2  year  escrow  restrictions  for  the  first  and  second  50  % 
respectively 
$135,000 cash payment to reimburse past exploration expenditure 
6,000,000  shares  (Tranche  2)  to  be  issued  on  preparation  of  a  Preliminary  Feasibility  Study  for  the  tenements  or  30  January 
2016, whichever occurs first; and 
A  further  6,000,000  shares  (Tranche  3)  to  be  issued  on  obtaining  Board  approval  for  a  Final  Investment  Decision  (FID)  and 
applying for one or more Mining Leases in relation to the FID, whichever occurs later
b) 
c)
d)
The fair value of the Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 contingent share issue was determined at the acquisition date and recorded as part of the 
acquisition costs with an equivalent amount recognised in the Contingent Consideration Reserve. The Tranche 2 shares were issued to 
Resolve Geo Pty Ltd (and nominees) on 30 January 2016 and the attributable fair value was transferred to Issued Share Capital. 
 
Recovery of the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful development and commercial

On 24 June 2015 the Company received a Summons from the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy (Department) under the 
Mining Management Act (NT). The summons related to the Tobermorey Project (EL 28710) on the basis of: 
 
“Being  an  operator  for  a  mining site  carried  out  mining  activities  on  that site without  authorisation, contrary  to  section  35(4)  of  the Mining 
Management Act (NT)” 
 
The mining activities referred to in this Summons related to a drilling program conducted under the approval and supervision of the previous 
Board, management and consultants of the Company. In August 2015, the Court of Summary Jurisdiction found the Company guilty of the 
breach  and  levied  a  fine  of  $300,000.  Accordingly  a  provision  for  this  amount  was  raised  when  finalising  the  30  June  2016  financial 
statements. This fine was subsequently reduced to $150,000 on appeal and the excess provision reversed to the Income Statement.

The  Board  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  determination  of  the  Group’s  risk  management  objectives  and  policies.  The  Group'  risk 
management  policies  and  objectives  are  designed  to  minimise  the  potential  impacts  of  the  risks  on  the  results  of  the  Group  where  such 
impacts  may  be  material.  The  Board  receives  monthly  financial  reports  from  the  Company  Secretary  through  which  it  reviews  the 
effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.  The overall objective of the Board 
is  to  set  polices  that  seek  to  reduce  risk  as  far  as  possible  without  unduly  affecting  the  Group’s  competitiveness  and  flexibility.    Further 
details regarding these policies are set out below.
(b)  Credit Risk
The maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value of any collateral or other security, at balance date to recognised financial assets 
is the carrying amount, net of any provisions, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements.
Credit  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  other  party  to  a  financial  instrument  will  fail  to  discharge  their  obligation  resulting  in  the  Group  incurring  a 
financial loss. This usually occurs when debtors or counterparties to contracts fail to settle their obligations owing to the Group.
The Group manages its credit risk associated with funds on deposit and cash at bank by only dealing with a spread of reputable financial 
institutions.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity  risk  arises  from  the  Group's  management  of  working  capital.  It  is  the  risk  that  the  Group  will  encounter  difficulty  in  meeting  its 
financial obligations as they fall due. As the Group’s main component of working capital comprises cash, the policy is to ensure that it will 
always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due by continuous monitoring of actual and projected cash 
flows.
(d) Market risk
Market  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  change  in  market  prices,  such  as  foreign  exchange  rates,  interest  rates  and  equity  prices  will  affect  the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to market risks other than interest rate risk.
(e) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises principally from cash and cash equivalents.
Interest rate risk is managed by continuous monitoring of interest rate exposure  and using a mixture of terms for fixed rate cash deposits 
with reputable financial institutions. At 30 June 2016 approximately 96% (2015- 98%) of cash deposits were at fixed terms of between 30-
150 days. It is the policy of the Group to keep as much cash as possible on fixed interest rates.
The sensitivity to movements in the interest rates would result in an increase or decrease interest revenue of $45,582 as a result of a 1% 
increase or decrease in interest rates. This exposure is managed in the short-term through the fixing of term deposits.

In  managing  its  capital,  the  Group's  primary  objective  is  to  ensure  it  has  sufficient  funds  to  meet  its  working  capital  requirements  and  its 
strategic investment needs.
The Group has debt financing at balance date of nil (2015: $nil)
The Group is not exposed to externally imposed capital requirements.

(a)  Key management personnel- service agreements 
 
Remuneration  of  the  Executive  Chairman  is  by  way  of  consulting  fees  paid  to  Opaline  Gold  Pty  Ltd  (a  company  associated  with  Dr  L  E 
Pretorius) for the services provided to  the company at a rate of $12,000 (excluding GST) per month commencing on 11 November 2014. 
Furthermore the contract states that although the Executive Chairman has a residence in Perth, he may from time-to-time choose to reside 
in Southern Africa and if this is the case up to three return business class airfares will be reimbursed to him by the Company for himself and 
similarly for no more than one family member, i.e. a total of 6 return airfares during any one 12-month period. This may be varied by the 
Board if additional overseas travel for the Company’s business is required and may be included in the planned trips to Southern Africa.
These  airfares  have  no  monetary  value  if  not  utilised.  Fees  paid  to  Opaline  Gold  Pty  during  the  financial  year  totalled  $144,000  (2015: 
$92,000) and are included in the Remuneration Report within the Directors’ Report.
Remuneration  of  the  Company  Secretary  is  by  way  of  fees  paid  for  secretarial,  accounting  and  administration  services  provided  to  the

Subsequent Events
Subsequent to year end the Company incorporated a further subsidiary,  TopFibre Pty Ltd. This Company is currently dormant but will be

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the members of TopTung Limited
Report on the Financial Report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of TopTung Limited, which comprises the  
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the 
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the  entity 
comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the 
financial year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true 
and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for 
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. In Note 1(a), the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 
Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with International Financial 
Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In 
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s 
preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well 
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.
