[2]     
I am satisfied you have freely and voluntarily pleaded guilty. You are convicted as charged.

On 22 March 2008 at 7.15pm you were arrested by a police officer at the Levuka Town and taken to the police station.

You admitted you had the marijuana in your possession for sale.

Drug peddling is a serious offence. Generally, an immediate custodial sentence is warranted.

In mitigation you said you are 42 years old and single. You have an elderly mother who is depended on you. Three weeks ago you secured an employment with Airport Buses. You earn $70.00 per week. You have no history of drug use or drug peddling. The amount involved is relatively small.

Taking these matters into account, I sentence you to 6 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years. In the next 2 years if you commit any other offence, you may have to serve this sentence of 6 months imprisonment in addition to any other sentence imposed on you for the other offence.
