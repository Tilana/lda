PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 1. Financial Statements.
The condensed financial statements included herein are presented, without audit, pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
such rules and regulations, although the trustee believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the
information presented not misleading. These condensed financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Trust’s latest Annual
Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the trustee, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the Hugoton
Royalty Trust at June 30, 2016 and the distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the three- and
six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 have been included. Distributable income for such
interim periods is not necessarily indicative of the distributable income for the full year. The condensed
financial statements as of June 30, 2016, and for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 have been subjected to a review by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Trust’s
independent registered public accounting firm, whose report is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Unitholders of Hugoton Royalty Trust and
Southwest Bank, Trustee:
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus of
Hugoton Royalty Trust (the “Trust”) as of June 30, 2016, and the related condensed statements of
distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the three-month and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Trustee.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an
opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.
As described in Note 1, these financial statements were prepared on the modified cash basis of
accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the
accompanying condensed interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with the basis of
accounting described in Note 1.
We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus as of December 31, 2015, and
the related statements of distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the year then ended (not
presented herein), and in our report dated March 11, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed statement of
assets, liabilities and trust corpus as of December 31, 2015 is fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus from which it has been derived.

HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST
Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited)
1.Basis of Accounting
The financial statements of Hugoton Royalty Trust are prepared on the following basis and are not
intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”):
– Net profits income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by XTO Energy Inc., the
owner of the underlying properties, to Southwest Bank, as trustee for the Trust. XTO Energy is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. Net profits income consists of net proceeds
received by XTO Energy from the underlying properties in the prior month, multiplied by a net profits
percentage of 80%.
Costs deducted in the calculation of net proceeds for the 80% net profits interests generally include
applicable taxes, transportation, marketing and legal costs, production expense, development costs,
operating charges and other costs.
– Net profits income is computed separately for each of the three conveyances under which the net
profits interests were conveyed to the Trust. If monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance,
such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that
conveyance and cannot reduce net proceeds from the other conveyances.
– Interest income and distribution payable to unitholders include interest earned on the previous
month’s investment.
– Trust expenses are recorded based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established by the trustee
for liabilities and contingencies.
– Distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the trustee.
– The Trust may dispose of all or part of the net profits interests if approved by a vote of holders of
80% or more of the outstanding trust units, or upon trust termination. Otherwise, the Trust is required
to sell up to 1% of the value of the net profits interests in any calendar year, pursuant to notice from
XTO Energy of its desire to sell the related underlying properties. Any sale must be for cash with
80% of the proceeds distributed to the unitholders on the next declared distribution.
The Trust’s financial statements differ from those prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP because
revenues are recognized when received rather than accrued in the month of production, expenses are
recognized when paid rather than when incurred and certain cash reserves may be established by the
trustee for contingencies which would not be recorded under U.S. GAAP. This comprehensive basis of
accounting other than U.S. GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial
Statements of Royalty Trusts.
Table of Contents
9
Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, directing such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period
other than when such revenues were received or expenses were paid. Because the Trust’s financial
statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, as described above, most accounting
pronouncements are not applicable to the Trust’s financial statements.
Impairment of Net Profits Interest
The trustee reviews the Trust’s net profits interests (“NPI”) in oil and gas properties for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the NPI may not be recoverable. In
general, the trustee does not view temporarily low prices as a trigger event for conducting an impairment
test. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility and though
prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by
market supply and demand. If a trigger event occurred, the trustee would use the estimated undiscounted
future net cash flows from the NPI to evaluate the recoverability of the Trust assets. If the undiscounted
future net cash flows from the NPI are less than the NPI carrying value, the Trust would recognize an
impairment loss for the difference between the NPI carrying value and the estimated fair value of the NPI.
The determination as to whether the NPI is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by the
trustee and is based on the best information available to the trustee at the time of the evaluation.
In light of lower long term prices used to develop projections of future cash flows, continued excess costs
on two conveyances and zero distributions to unitholders for the six months ended June 30, 2016, the
trustee concluded that an impairment trigger event had occurred in the second quarter of 2016. An
assessment of the forecasted net cash flows was performed for the NPI. The result of the assessment
indicated that the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from the NPI were below the carrying
value of the NPI. During the second quarter of 2016, the NPI was written down to its fair value of $
28.8 million, resulting in a $ 57.3 million impairment charged directly to Trust corpus, which does not affect
distributable income. The fair value of the NPI was developed using estimates for future oil and gas
production attributable to the Trust, future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices published by third-
party industry experts (adjusted for basis differentials), estimated taxes, development and operating
expenses, and a risk-adjusted discount rate.
Net profits interests in oil and gas properties
The initial carrying value of the net profits interests of $247,066,951 represents XTO Energy’s historical
net book value for the interests on December 1, 1998, the date of the transfer to the Trust. For the quarter
ended June 30, 2016, the carrying value of the NPI was written down to its fair value, resulting in an
impairment of $57,306,527 charged directly to Trust corpus. Amortization of the net profits interests is
calculated on a unit-of-production basis and charged directly to Trust corpus. Accumulated amortization
was $160,959,424 as of June 30, 2016 and $160,166,720 as of December 31, 2015.

The monthly development cost deduction was $200,000 from the January 2015 distribution through the
August 2015 distribution. Due to the anticipated level of actual costs and the 2015 development budget,
the development cost deduction was increased to $300,000 beginning with the September 2015
distribution and was maintained at that level through January 2016. Due to the level of actual
development costs, the monthly development cost deduction was decreased from $300,000 to $187,500
beginning in February 2016 and was maintained at that level through the March 2016 distribution. Due to
the revised 2016 budget, the monthly development cost deduction was decreased to $100,000 beginning
with the April 2016 distribution and due to the level of actual development costs the monthly development
cost deduction was further decreased to $50,000 beginning with the June 2016 distribution. The monthly
deduction is based on the current level of development expenditures, budgeted future development costs
and the cumulative actual costs under (over) previous deductions. Changes in oil or natural gas prices
could impact future development plans on the underlying properties. XTO Energy has advised the trustee
that this monthly deduction will continue to be evaluated and revised as necessary.
3.Income Taxes
For federal income tax purposes, the Trust constitutes a fixed investment trust that is taxed as a grantor
trust. A grantor trust is not subject to tax at the trust level. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has
been made in the financial statements. The unitholders are considered to own the Trust’s income and
principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to have been received
or accrued by each unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust and not when
distributed by the Trust. If the Trust borrows against the net profits interest of the Trust, as contemplated in
“Administration Expense Reserve,” unrelated business taxable income could result to tax-exempt
unitholders. Impairment for book purposes will not result in a loss for tax purposes for the unitholders until
the loss is recognized.
All revenues from the Trust are from sources within Kansas, Oklahoma or Wyoming. Because it distributes
all of its net income to unitholders, the Trust has not been taxed at the trust level in Kansas or Oklahoma.
While the Trust has not owed tax, the trustee is required to file a return with Kansas and Oklahoma
reflecting the income and deductions of the Trust attributable to properties located in each state, along
with a schedule that includes information regarding distributions to unitholders.
11
Table of Contents
Wyoming does not have a state income tax.
Each unitholder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding income tax requirements, if any,
applicable to such person’s ownership of Trust units.
Unitholders should consult the Trust’s latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of
federal and state tax matters.
4.Contingencies
In September 2008, a royalty class action lawsuit was filed against XTO Energy styled Wallace B.
Roderick Revocable Living Trust, et al. v. XTO Energy Inc. in the District Court of Kearny County, Kansas.
The case was removed to federal court in Wichita, Kansas. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy has
improperly taken post production costs from royalties paid to the plaintiffs from wells located in Kansas,
Oklahoma, and Colorado; later reduced to Kansas. The case was certified as a class action in March
2012. XTO Energy filed an appeal of the class certification to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 11,
2012, which was granted on June 26, 2012. The court reversed the certification of the class and
remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings. The case was previously stayed pending
a final decision from the Kansas Supreme Court on the Fawcett v. OPIK appeal. Following the decision in
Fawcett, the Judge in Roderick ordered new briefing on the pending motions. In its pleadings, the plaintiff
has alleged damages in excess of $40 million. On June 22, 2016, plaintiffs’ Second Motion for Class
Certification was denied.
In December 2010, a royalty class action lawsuit was filed against XTO Energy styled Chieftain Royalty
Company v. XTO Energy Inc. in Coal County District Court, Oklahoma. XTO Energy removed the case to
federal court in the Eastern District of Oklahoma. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy wrongfully
deducted fees from royalty payments on Oklahoma wells, failed to make diligent efforts to secure the best
terms available for the sale of gas and its constituents, and demand an accounting to determine whether
they have been fully and fairly paid gas royalty interests. The case was certified as a class action in April
2012. XTO Energy filed an appeal of the class certification to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 26,
2012, which was granted on June 26, 2012. The court reversed the certification of the class and
remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings. A non-binding mediation is scheduled
for September 1, 2016.
XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that XTO Energy has strong defenses to these
lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend its position. However, XTO Energy has informed the trustee that
it is cognizant of other, similar litigation. As these cases develop, XTO Energy will assess its legal
position accordingly. If XTO Energy ultimately makes any settlement payments or receives a judgment
against it in Chieftain or Roderick, XTO Energy has advised the trustee that the Trust should bear its 80%
share of such settlement or judgment, including any future royalty adjustments that would reduce net
proceeds. The trustee intends to review any claimed reductions in payment to the Trust based on the facts
and circumstances of such settlement or judgment. In light of a 2014 arbitration decision in which a three
panel tribunal decided that the settlement in Fankhouser v. XTO Energy, Inc, including a new royalty
calculation for future royalty payments, could not be charged to the Trust, to the extent that the claims in
Chieftain or Roderick are similar to those in Fankhouser the trustee would likely object to such claimed
reductions. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that, although the amount of any reduction in net
proceeds is not presently determinable, in its management’s opinion, the amount is not currently expected
to be material to the Trust’s financial position or liquidity though it could be material to the Trust’s annual
distributable income. Additionally, XTO Energy has advised
Table of Contents
12
the trustee that any reductions would result in costs exceeding revenues on the properties underlying the
net profit interests of the cases named above, as applicable, for several monthly distributions, depending
on the size of the judgment or settlement, if any, and the net proceeds being paid at that time, which would
result in the net profits interest being limited until such time that the revenues exceed the costs for those
net profit interests. If there is a settlement or judgment and should XTO Energy and the trustee disagree
concerning the amount of the settlement or judgment to be charged, if any, against the Trust’s net profits
interests, the matter will be resolved by binding arbitration through the American Arbitration Association
under the terms of the Indenture creating the Trust.
Certain of the underlying properties are involved in various other lawsuits and governmental proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not believe
that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material effect on the financial position or liquidity of
the Trust, but may have an effect on annual distributable income.
Other
Several states have enacted legislation requiring state income tax withholding from nonresident recipients
of oil and gas proceeds. After consultation with its tax counsel, the trustee believes that it is not required to
withhold on payments made to the unitholders. However, regulations are subject to change by the various
states, which could change this conclusion. Should amounts be withheld on payments made to the Trust
or the unitholders, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the
filing of a claim for refund by the Trust or unitholders for such amount.

If monthly costs exceed revenues for any of the three conveyances (one for each of the states of Kansas,
Oklahoma and Wyoming), such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net
proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net proceeds from other conveyances.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that a one-time reimbursement for overhead corrections, led to the partial
recovery of excess costs of $71,807 ($57,446 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net
profits interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower gas prices
caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $255,605 ($204,484 net to the Trust) on properties
underlying the Kansas net profits interest for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that a one-time reimbursement for overhead corrections led to full
recovery of excess costs, plus accrued interest of $1,059 ($847 net to the Trust), on properties underlying
the Oklahoma net profits interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. XTO Energy advised the trustee
that lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $97,457 ($77,966 net to the Trust) on
properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interest for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.

XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower gas prices, partially offset by a one-time reimbursement for
overhead corrections caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $570,141 ($456,113 net to the Trust)
on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. XTO
Energy advised the trustee that lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $472,481
($377,985 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interest for the quarter ended
March 31, 2016.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased costs, decreased gas production and lower gas prices
caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $367,814 ($294,251 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended
June 30, 2015 and $338,668 ($270,934 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 on
properties underlying the Kansas net profits interest.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower gas prices and increased costs caused costs to exceed
revenues by a total of $125,832 ($100,666 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and
$87,082 ($69,666 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 on properties underlying the
Wyoming net profits interest.
Cumulative excess costs for the Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming conveyances remaining as of June 30,
2016 totaled $2,846,607 ($2,277,286 net to the Trust).
6.Administration Expense Reserve
Due to the current level of commodity prices, the Trust is receiving reduced cash distributions and excess
costs have accumulated within two of the three conveyances of the Trust. As a result, administrative
expenses have exceeded cash disbursements received during the first half of 2016 in all months except
May. The May 2016 distribution included a one-time reimbursement related to operated overhead, which
allowed the trustee to cover administrative expenses and partially replenish the expense reserve. With the
increase in natural gas and oil prices, there was sufficient net profits income for the July distribution to
replenish the expense reserve to $1,000,000 after paying administrative expenses and providing a
distribution to unitholders. The trustee believes that the current reserve will be sufficient to pay the Trust’s
obligations for the next year.
The trustee is exploring its options with regards to the payment of the Trust’s obligations if and when the
administrative expense reserve is depleted. This may include but is not limited to borrowing against the
net profits interest of the Trust. Such borrowing may result in unrelated business taxable income to
unitholders who are exempt organizations.
7.Operated Overhead
XTO Energy advised the trustee that the May 2016 distribution included a one-time reimbursement of
$788,000 related to operated overhead corrections for the period of January 2014 through February 2016.
The reimbursement affected the net profits income under the Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming
conveyances by approximately $186,000, $320,000 and $282,000 respectively.
Table of Contents
8.Other
14
XTO Energy advised the trustee that the February 2015 distribution included a one-time prior period
adjustment for the recoupment of natural gas liquids revenue from the Trust in the amount of $353,069
($282,455 net to the Trust) which was deducted from net proceeds for the first quarter of 2015.
9.Subsequent Events
XTO Energy has advised the trustee that net profits income for August 2016 will include an additional
reimbursement of approximately $450,000 related to operated overhead corrections for the period of
January 2014 through May 2016. The reimbursement will affect the net profits income under the
Oklahoma conveyance.
XTO Energy has advised the trustee that net profits income for August 2016 will include approximately
$500,000 in additional gathering fees for the period of December 2015 through May 2016 related to a gas
purchase contract change subsequent to June 30, 2016 that includes production from properties
underlying the Oklahoma conveyance.
Item 2. Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trustee’s discussion and analysis
contained in the Trust’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the condensed financial statements
and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-
K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are
available on the Trust’s web site at www.hgt-hugoton.com.
Distributable Income
Quarter
For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, net profits income was $199,545, as compared to $1,463,774 for
second quarter 2015. This 86% decrease in net profits income is primarily the result of lower oil and gas
prices ($3.2 million), partially offset by decreased production expense ($1.4 million), lower development
costs ($0.3 million), and decreased taxes, transportation, and other costs ($0.3 million). See “Net Profits
Income” on following page.
After adding interest income of $173, deducting administration expense of $193,490, and increasing the
cash reserve $6,228 for the payment of Trust expenses, distributable income for the quarter ended
June 30, 2016 was $0, or $0.000000 per unit of beneficial interest. Administration expense for the quarter
increased $15,385 as compared to the prior year quarter. Changes in interest income are attributable to
fluctuations in net profits income and interest rates. For second quarter 2015, distributable income was
$1,185,720 or $0.029643 per unit.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net profits income was $263,107 compared with $5,600,616 for
the same 2015 period. This 95% decrease in net profits income is primarily the result of lower oil and gas
prices ($8.8 million), partially offset by decreased production expense ($2.1 million), lower taxes,
transportation, and other costs ($1.0 million), decreased development costs ($0.2 million), and net excess
costs in 2016 ($0.2 million). See “Net Profits Income” below.
After adding interest income of $255, deducting administration expense of $537,337, and reducing the
cash reserve $273,975 for the payment of Trust expenses, distributable income for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 was $0, or $0.000000 per unit of beneficial interest. Administration expense for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 increased $88,321 as compared to the same 2015 period. Changes in
interest income are attributable to fluctuations in net profits income and interest rates. For the six months
ended June 30, 2015, distributable income was $4,951,720, or $0.123793 per unit.
Net Profits Income
Net profits income is recorded when received by the Trust, which is the month following receipt by XTO
Energy, and generally two months after oil and gas production. Net profits income is generally affected by
three major factors:
– oil and gas sales volumes,
– oil and gas sales prices, and
– costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income.

(a) Because of the two-month interval between time of production and receipt of net profits income by
the Trust, (1) oil and gas sales for the quarter ended June 30 generally represent production for the
period February through April and (2) oil and gas sales for the six months ended June 30 generally
represent production for the period November through April.
(b) Oil and gas sales volumes are allocated to the net profits interests based upon a formula that
considers oil and gas prices and the total amount of production expense and development costs. As
product prices change, the Trust’s share of the production volumes is impacted as the quantity of
production to cover expenses in reaching the net profits break-even level changes inversely with
price. As such, the underlying property production volume changes may not correlate with the
Trust’s net profit share of those volumes in any given period. Therefore, comparative discussion of
oil and gas sales volumes is based on the underlying properties.
(c) See Note 2 to Condensed Financial Statements.

The following are explanations of significant variances on the underlying properties from second quarter
2015 to second quarter 2016 and from the first six months of 2015 to the comparable period in 2016:
Sales Volumes
Gas
Gas sales volumes were relatively flat from second quarter 2015 to second quarter 2016 as natural
production decline was offset by completion of repairs at a third party gas processing system in the
Hugoton area following a force majeure incident and the timing of cash receipts.
Gas sales volumes increased 1% for the six-month period as compared with the same 2015 period
primarily due to timing of cash receipts and the completion of repairs at a third party gas processing
system in the Hugoton area following a force majeure incident, partially offset by natural production
decline.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that repairs and maintenance in the first half of 2015 at a third party gas
processing system in the Hugoton area following a force majeure incident resulted in decreased
underlying gas volumes of approximately 5,000 Mcf per day. After being advised by the third party
processor that the repairs were completed, XTO Energy then received notice that the force majeure event
was being extended to the processing portion of the third party plant due to an equipment malfunction.
The processor was able to bypass the plant and take gas; however, the plant was not able to process gas
for NGLs or helium for a period of time. XTO Energy received notice that the plant returned to full capacity
at the end of October 2015, including the processing of gas for NGLs and helium.
Oil
Oil sales volumes decreased 3% for second quarter and 3% for the six-month period as compared with
the same 2015 periods primarily due to natural production decline.
The estimated rate of natural production decline on the underlying oil and gas properties is approximately
6% to 8% a year.
Sales Prices
Gas
The second quarter 2016 average gas price was $1.61 per Mcf, a 36% decrease from the second quarter
2015 average gas price of $2.50 per Mcf. For the six-month period, the average gas price decreased 41%
to $1.76 per Mcf in 2016 from $2.99 per Mcf in 2015. Natural gas prices are affected by the level of North
American production, weather, crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, the U.S. economy, storage levels
and import levels of liquefied natural gas. Natural gas prices are expected to remain volatile. The second
quarter 2016 gas price is primarily related to production from February through April 2016, when the
average NYMEX price was $1.93 per MMBtu. The average NYMEX price for May and June 2016 was
$1.98 per MMBtu. On July 18, 2016, the average NYMEX futures price for the following twelve months
was $3.03 per MMBtu.
Table of Contents
Oil
18
The second quarter 2016 average oil price was $32.28 per Bbl, a 31% decrease from the second quarter
2015 average oil price of $46.84 per Bbl. The year-to-date average oil price decreased 38% to $32.75 per
Bbl in 2016 from $52.46 per Bbl in 2015. Oil prices are expected to remain volatile. The second quarter
2016 oil price is primarily related to production from February through April 2016, when the average
NYMEX price was $36.57 per Bbl. The average NYMEX price for May and June 2016 was $47.81 per
Bbl. On July 18, 2016, the average NYMEX futures price for the following twelve months was $48.19 per
Bbl.
Costs
Taxes, Transportation and Other
Taxes, transportation and other costs decreased 23% for the second quarter and 35% for the six-month
period primarily because of decreased oil and gas production taxes and other deductions related to lower
oil and gas revenues and decreased property taxes related to lower valuations.
Production Expense
Production expense decreased 14% for the second quarter and 15% for the six-month period primarily
because of decreased repairs and maintenance, field, compressor rental, fuel and labor costs.
Development Costs
Development costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income are based primarily on the current
level of development expenditures and the development budget. These development costs decreased
58% for the second quarter and 23% for the six-month period.
At December 31, 2015, cumulative budgeted costs deducted exceeded cumulative actual costs by
approximately $0.2 million. In calculating net profits income for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, XTO
Energy deducted budgeted development costs of $0.3 million for the quarter and $0.9 million for the six-
month period. After considering actual development costs of $0.2 million for the quarter and $0.7 million
for the six-month period, cumulative budgeted costs deducted exceeded actual costs deducted by
approximately $0.4 million at June 30, 2016.
XTO Energy has advised the trustee that revised 2016 budgeted development costs for the underlying
properties are between $2 million and $4 million. The 2016 budget year generally coincides with the Trust
distribution months from April 2016 through March 2017. The monthly development cost deduction will be
reevaluated by XTO Energy and revised as necessary, based on the 2016 budget and the timing and
amount of actual expenditures. See Note 2 to Condensed Financial Statements.
Overhead
Overhead decreased 35% for the quarter and 16% for the six-month period primarily because of a one-
time reimbursement of approximately $788,000 related to operated overhead corrections for the period of
January 2014 through February 2016, and the annual rate adjustment based on an industry index. See
Note 7 to Condensed Financial Statements.
Table of Contents
Excess Costs
19
If monthly costs exceed revenues for any of the three conveyances (one for each of the states of Kansas,
Oklahoma and Wyoming), such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net
proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net proceeds from other conveyances.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that a one-time reimbursement for overhead corrections, led to the partial
recovery of excess costs of $71,807 ($57,446 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net
profits interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower gas prices
caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $255,605 ($204,484 net to the Trust) on properties
underlying the Kansas net profits interest for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that a one-time reimbursement for overhead corrections led to full
recovery of excess costs, plus accrued interest of $1,059 ($847 net to the Trust), on properties underlying
the Oklahoma net profits interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. XTO Energy advised the trustee
that lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $97,457 ($77,966 net to the Trust) on
properties underlying the Oklahoma net profits interest for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower gas prices, partially offset by a one-time reimbursement for
overhead corrections caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $570,141 ($456,113 net to the Trust)
on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interest for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. XTO
Energy advised the trustee that lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $472,481
($377,985 net to the Trust) on properties underlying the Wyoming net profits interest for the quarter ended
March 31, 2016.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased costs, decreased gas production and lower gas prices
caused costs to exceed revenues by a total of $367,814 ($294,251 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended
June 30, 2015 and $338,668 ($270,934 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 on
properties underlying the Kansas net profits interest.
XTO Energy advised the trustee that lower gas prices and increased costs caused costs to exceed
revenues by a total of $125,832 ($100,666 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and
$87,082 ($69,666 net to the Trust) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 on properties underlying the
Wyoming net profits interest.
Cumulative excess costs for the Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming conveyances remaining as of June 30,
2016 totaled $2,846,607 ($2,277,286 net to the Trust).
Impairment of Net Profits Interest
In light of lower long term prices used to develop projections of future cash flows, continued excess costs
on two conveyances and zero distributions to unitholders for the six months ended June 30, 2016, the
trustee concluded that an impairment trigger event had occurred in the second quarter of 2016. An
assessment of the forecasted net cash flows was performed for the NPI. The result of the assessment
indicated that the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from the NPI were below the carrying
value of the NPI. During the second quarter of 2016, the NPI was written down to its fair value of
$28.8 million, resulting in a $57.3 million impairment charged directly to Trust corpus, which does not
affect distributable income. The fair value of the NPI was developed using estimates for future oil and gas
production attributable to the Trust, future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices published by third-
party industry experts (adjusted for basis differentials), estimated taxes, development and operating
expenses, and a risk-adjusted discount rate.

Table of Contents
Administration Expense Reserve
Due to the current level of commodity prices, the Trust is receiving reduced cash distributions and excess
costs have accumulated within two of the three conveyances of the Trust. As a result, administrative
expenses have exceeded cash disbursements received during the first half of 2016 in all months except
May. The May 2016 distribution included a one-time reimbursement related to operated overhead, which
allowed the trustee to cover administrative expenses and partially replenish the expense reserve. With the
increase in natural gas and oil prices, there was sufficient net profits income for the July distribution to
replenish the expense reserve to $1,000,000 after paying administrative expenses and providing a
distribution to unitholders. The trustee believes that the current reserve will be sufficient to pay the Trust’s
obligations for the next year.
The trustee is exploring its options with regards to the payment of the Trust’s obligations if and when the
administrative expense reserve is depleted. This may include but is not limited to borrowing against the
net profits interest of the Trust. Such borrowing may result in unrelated business taxable income to
unitholders who are exempt organizations.
Other
XTO Energy advised the trustee that the February 2015 distribution included a one-time prior period
adjustment for the recoupment of natural gas liquids revenue from the Trust in the amount of $353,069
($282,455 net to the Trust) which was deducted from net proceeds for the first quarter of 2015.
Contingencies
XTO Energy is a party to certain litigation affecting the underlying properties. See Note 4 to Condensed
Financial Statements.
Several states have enacted legislation requiring state income tax withholding from nonresident recipients
of oil and gas proceeds. After consultation with its tax counsel, the trustee believes that it is not required to
withhold on payments made to the unitholders. However, regulations are subject to change by the various
states, which could change this conclusion. Should amounts be withheld on payments made to the Trust
or the unitholders, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the
filing of a claim for refund by the Trust or unitholders for such amount.
Forward-Looking Statements

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
There have been no material changes in the Trust’s market risks from the information disclosed in Part II,
Item 7A of the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15.
Based upon that evaluation, the trustee concluded that the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be
disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the trustee to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In its evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures, the trustee has relied, to the extent considered reasonable, on information provided by XTO
Energy. There has not been any change in the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting during the
period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Trust’s internal control over financial reporting.
