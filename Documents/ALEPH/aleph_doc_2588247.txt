font-family:Times New Roman">We are including the following discussion to inform
our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and
uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the 
&#147;safe harbor&#148; protection for forward-looking statements afforded by 
applicable federal securities laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">All statements other than statements of historical 
facts included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus regarding our 
financial
position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future 
operations, industry conditions, and indebtedness covenant compliance are 
forward-looking statements. When used in this prospectus, forward-looking 
statements are generally
accompanied by terms or phrases such as &#147;estimate,&#148; 
&#147;project,&#148; &#147;predict,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148;

&#147;goal,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;may&#148; or other
words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or 
outcomes. Items contemplating or making assumptions about actual or potential 
future
sales, market size, collaborations, and trends or operating results also 
constitute such forward-looking statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; 
margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New 
Roman">Forward-looking
statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many
of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, include the 
following:
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices; the pace of drilling and 
completions activity on our properties; our ability to acquire additional 
development opportunities; changes in our reserves estimates or the value 
thereof; general economic or
industry conditions; nationally or the regions in which our company conducts 
business; changes in the interest rate environment; legislation or regulatory 
requirements; conditions of the securities markets; our ability to raise or 
access capital;
changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; financial or political
instability; acts of war or terrorism; and other economic, competitive,
governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our operations, 
products and prices.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-
size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have based any forward-looking 
statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. 
While our management
considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are 
inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory 
and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to
predict and many
of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, results actually achieved may 
differ materially from expected results in these statements. Forward-looking 
statements speak only as of the date they are made. You should consider 
carefully the statements
under the heading &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in this prospectus and in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and the other 
documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus, which describe factors
that could
cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking 
statements. We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to 
update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances 
occurring after the
date of such statements other than as may be required by applicable law or 
regulation. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">We are an independent energy company engaged in the
acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas 
properties,
primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks formations within the Williston Basin in
North Dakota and Montana. We believe the location, size and concentration of our
acreage position in one of North America&#146;s leading unconventional oil-
resource
plays provide us with drilling and development opportunities that result in
significant long-term value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our primary focus 
is oil
exploration and production through non-operated working interests in wells 
drilled and completed in spacing units that include our acreage. As a non-
operator, we are able to diversify our investment exposure by participating in a
large number of
gross wells, as well as entering into more project areas by partnering with 
numerous experienced operating partners. In addition, because we can elect to 
participate on a well-by-well basis, we believe we have increased flexibility in
the timing and
amount of our capital expenditures because we are not burdened with various 
contractual development agreements or a large operating support staff. Further, 
we are able to avoid exploratory costs incurred by many oil and gas producers.
