<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 4/8<b> </b>(&#8220;Follow up to decision S-4/101 
of 13 December 2006 adopted by the Human Rights Council at its fourth special session entitled 
&#8220;Situation of human rights in Darfur&#8221;)<b> </b>the group of seven mandate holders (&#8220;experts group&#8221;) 
carried out their task of ensuring the effective follow-up and fostering the implementation of 
resolutions and recommendations on Darfur, as adopted by the Human Rights Council, the 
former Commission on Human Rights and other United Nations human rights institutions, as 
well as the task of promoting the implementation of relevant recommendations of the other 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, taking into account the needs of the Sudan, 
safeguarding the consistency of these recommendations and contributing to the monitoring of the 
human rights situation on the ground. 
</p>
<p> The experts group held two meetings in Geneva. During the first meeting the experts group 
discussed a methodology for implementation of resolution 4/8, reviewed all pre-existing human 
rights recommendations and identified priority areas. In addition, the experts group selected and 
synthesized a number of recommendations which could improve the human rights situation in 
Darfur. The Group also outlined steps to be undertaken in order to implement the 
recommendations in the short and medium terms, intended as 3 and 12 months, respectively. 
During the second meeting, the experts group reviewed the response of the Government of the 
Sudan, held consultations with an inter-ministerial delegation from Khartoum and decided about 
its conclusions and recommendations.  
</p>
<p> In its conclusions, the experts group reiterates its concern regarding the human rights 
situation in Darfur, expressed by the Human Rights Council in resolution 4/8. The Group urges 
the Government of the Sudan to implement without delay the recommendations it committed 
itself to put into practice and to continue its dialogue with the experts group on the 
implementation of other recommendations made by the Group. 
</p>
<p> The experts group also recommends that a review, to ascertain the level of implementation 
of human rights recommendations, take place three months after the publication of this report 
and that the results of such review be reported to the seventh session of the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p> The experts group further invites relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, including 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to provide the support and technical 
assistance to the extent necessary for the implementation of these recommendations, and called 
upon donors to provide funds for this support and technical assistance. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>1. Arising out of its deep concern over the ongoing violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law in Darfur, the Human Rights Council adopted by consensus at 
its fourth session, on 30 March 2007, resolution 4/8 on the &#8220;Follow-up to decision S-4/101 
of 13 December 2006 adopted by the Human Rights Council at its fourth special session entitled 
&#8216;Situation of human rights in Darfur&#8217;&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2. Through its resolution 4/8, the Human Rights Council decided to convene a group of 
seven mandate-holders &#8220;to work with the Government of the Sudan, the appropriate human 
rights mechanisms of the African Union and to closely consult with the Chairman of the 
Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation (DDDC) to ensure the effective follow-up and to 
foster the implementation of resolutions and recommendations on Darfur, as adopted by the 
Human Rights Council, the former Commission on Human Rights and other United Nations 
human rights institutions as well as to promote the implementation of relevant recommendations 
of other United Nations human rights mechanisms, taking into account the needs of the Sudan in 
this regard, to safeguard the consistency of these recommendations and to contribute to 
monitoring the human rights situation on the ground&#8221; (para. 7). 
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council requested the group of seven mandate-holders (the &#8220;experts 
group&#8221;) to report to its fifth session. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  MEMBERSHIP 
</b></p>
<p>4. The experts group is presided over by Ms. Sima Samar, Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Sudan and is composed of Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for children and armed conflict, Mr. Philip Alston, 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Ms. Hina Jilani, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, Mr. Walter 
K&#228;lin, Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, Mr. Manfred Nowak, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and Ms. Yakin Ert&#252;rk, Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences. The experts group was supported by a 
secretariat appointed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  METHODOLOGY 
</b></p>
<p>5. The experts group convened two meetings in Geneva, from 24 to 27 April and 
from 23 o 25 May 2007. During the first meeting, the experts group&#8217;s terms of reference were 
adopted and Mr. Walter K&#228;lin was appointed as rapporteur. Discussions focused on the 
interpretation of resolution 4/8, approaches for its implementation and related tasks; a common 
understanding regarding the mandate and a methodology for its implementation were identified 
and agreed upon.  
</p>
<p>6. During the second meeting, the experts group reviewed inputs submitted by the 
Government of the Sudan, held consultations in Geneva with an inter-ministerial delegation from 
Khartoum and decided about its conclusions and recommendations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. The experts group agreed on the following parameters in order to achieve its objectives: 
 (a) Establishing cooperation and working in a transparent manner with the Government 
of the Sudan and other relevant partners within the international community; 
</p>
<p> (b) Identifying the obstacles to implementation of previous recommendations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Prioritizing recommendations and defining reachable steps that are tangible for the 
victims in the short and medium terms; 
</p>
<p> (d) Working at the technical level while identifying steps/benchmarks for 
implementation at a practical level. 
</p>
<p>8. As resolution 4/8 clearly indicates the need to work with existing recommendations, the 
experts group therefore reviewed resolutions and recommendations on Darfur, as adopted by the 
Human Rights Council, the former Commission on Human Rights, and other United Nations 
human rights organs and mechanisms. It concluded that the resolution does not request any 
fact-finding activities by the experts group, but its recommendations should contribute to 
monitoring the human rights situation on the ground by all relevant actors, including the 
United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), as requested by the Human Rights Council in 
paragraph 8 of resolution 4/8. 
</p>
<p>9. While cognizant of the fact that implementation of aspects of some or all of the existing 
recommendations may have taken place, the experts group noted the deep concern expressed in 
resolution 4/8, regarding &#8220;the seriousness of ongoing violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law in Darfur, including armed attacks on the civilian population and humanitarian 
workers, widespread destruction of villages, and continued and widespread violence, in 
particular gender-based violence against women and girls, as well as the lack of accountability of 
perpetrators of such crimes&#8221; as well as the Council&#8217;s consensus on the urgent and continuing 
need to focus on fostering implementation of existing recommendations in order to enhance the 
human rights situation in Darfur. Therefore, the experts group intended its task as a 
forward-looking exercise rather than an assessment of past situations and activities undertaken 
by the Government of the Sudan in implementing existing recommendations. 
</p>
<p>10. The experts group was unanimous in its understanding that, while recommendations which 
necessitate a longer timeline for effective implementation were, at this stage, not included in its 
work, those, as well as the existing body of other recommendations with a human rights content 
on Darfur, made by various United Nations mechanisms and beyond the immediate scope of the 
experts group&#8217;s mandate as per resolution 4/8, maintain their full validity. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  EXAMINATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>11. Based on the documentation examined according to resolution 4/8, the experts group 
identified priority areas which were clustered in a matrix under four main categories: 
</p>
<p> (a) Human rights protection; including protection of civilians and internally displaced 
persons; protection of women against violence; children and armed conflict; protection against 
summary executions, arbitrary detention, disappearances and torture; protection of witnesses and 
victims; and protection of human rights defenders; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (b) Humanitarian access; including protection of humanitarian workers from harassment 
and attacks; facilitating access to civilians, including those displaced; 
</p>
<p> (c) Accountability and justice; 
 (d) Monitoring of implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>12. The experts group selected and synthesized a number of recommendations for each priority 
area which, if implemented, could improve the human rights situation on the ground. At the 
same time, the experts group identified steps to be undertaken in order to implement the 
recommendations that can be considered as indicators of their accomplishment. Furthermore, and 
in order to facilitate implementation, a number of recommendations general in scope were 
reformulated into separate practical steps. 
</p>
<p>13. The experts group also assessed the length of time needed to implement each of the 
recommendations and classified them according to whether they can be implemented in the 
&#8220;short&#8221; and &#8220;medium&#8221; terms, intended as periods of 3 and 12 months, respectively. While it 
acknowledges that a three-month period is relatively short, it is of the opinion that its 
recommendations in this category either are immediately implementable (e.g. public statements) 
or concern first steps which, while being part of a longer process, can be taken in the short term. 
</p>
<p>14. The matrix with recommendations (annex I to this report) was submitted to the 
Government of the Sudan on 2 May. A list of the relevant sources for these recommendations 
(see appendix to annex I) was sent to the Government of the Sudan on 14 May. The experts 
group invited the Government of the Sudan to comment on the feasibility of the 
recommendations and requested a <i>prima facie</i> assessment of the contribution that the 
international community may provide, in terms of technical assistance, to facilitate the removal 
of obstacles hampering implementation of each of the recommendations. On 18 May, the 
Government of the Sudan replied in writing, including an appreciation of its requirements to 
implement the recommendations (annex II).  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONSULTATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SUDAN 
</b></p>
<p>15. The experts group sought to work in a transparent and collaborative manner with the 
Government of the Sudan by keeping it informed at all times. The experts group noted the 
Government&#8217;s acknowledgment of serious human rights problems in Darfur and the urgent need 
to address them and its expressed willingness to cooperate towards achieving the objectives of 
resolution 4/8. 
</p>
<p>16. The experts group&#8217;s secretariat held an introductory meeting with the Permanent Mission 
of the Sudan in Geneva, on 18 April, and the experts group&#8217;s Chairperson met with 
representatives of the Permanent Mission, on 23 April, in order to introduce the work of the 
experts group. 
</p>
<p>17. While the Experts noted that the Permanent Representative of the Government of the 
Sudan to the United Nations in Geneva was in contact with the Secretariat and the chairperson 
during the week of 23 April, he was unable to meet with the Group until the afternoon of 
26 April, when preliminary consultations were held via conference call with the State Minister </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>for Foreign Affairs - in charge of human rights - in Khartoum. The State Minister undertook to 
create a Committee within the Government of the Sudan, to study the recommendations 
compiled by the experts group and to facilitate contacts in Geneva, on 24 May, between an 
inter-ministerial delegation from Khartoum and the experts group. 
</p>
<p>18. On 24 May, the experts group met with the inter-ministerial delegation and representatives 
from the Permanent Mission of the Sudan to the United Nations in Geneva.<b>1</b> The purpose of the 
meeting was to discuss the matrix of recommendations prepared by the experts group and the 
response of the Government towards developing a strategy for their effective implementation.  
</p>
<p>19. The consultations between the experts group and the Government of the Sudan were open 
and frank and a degree of progress was achieved. Opinions converged on a number of issues, 
while there was less convergence - or even clear differences - on others which will necessitate 
ongoing dialogue. 
</p>
<p>20. The Government of the Sudan agreed with a substantial number of recommendations 
although it was sometimes unclear what specific steps it will undertake to implement them. The 
delegation requested a change to the time frame for implementation and suggested that the 
short-term should be a period of six rather than three months. Furthermore, the Government of 
the Sudan considered that recommendations should not be based on factual assessments which 
the Government disagrees with, or which are outdated. 
</p>
<p>21. The experts group, considering that resolution 4/8 mandates the experts group to work with 
existing recommendations and does not require fact-finding, invited the Government of the 
Sudan to state clearly which recommendations it disagrees with or considers out of date. 
Furthermore, the experts group noted the Sudan&#8217;s request to extend the time frame for short-term 
recommendations to six months, but reiterated that it deems the three-month period sufficient, as 
most of those recommendations do not require lengthy administrative processes or additional 
resources to put them into practice, while others can be implemented immediately.  
</p>
<p>22. During the consultation with the Government of the Sudan, the experts group, while noting 
positive commitments and developments on aspects related to the protection of civilians, on 
measures to combat violence against women and to protect children, on revision of certain laws, 
on the need to increase the number of prosecutors in Darfur, to extend their presence on the 
ground and on possible mechanisms to monitor jointly the implementation of the 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The inter-ministerial delegation was led by Mr. Abdeldaiem Zumrawi, Deputy Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice, and included Dr. Hassabo Mohamed Abdelrahman, Commissioner for Humanitarian 
Assistance, Brigadier General Hassan Hamid Mohamed, Ministry of Defense, 
Dr. Atiyat Mustafa, member of Sudanese Human Rights Consultative Council and Director for 
combating violence against children and women, Ministry of Justice, Dr. Abdelmonim Osman 
M. Taha, Rapporteur of Sudanese Consultative Council on Human Rights. The delegation also 
included Ambassador Omar Dahab F. Mohamed, Deputy Permanent Representative, 
Mrs. Rahma Salih Elobeid, Minister Plenipotentiary, Salah Al Mubarak, Counsellor, 
Eqbal Mouhamad (2nd Secretary), Mouhamad Hassan (2nd Secretary), from the Permanent 
Mission of the Sudan to the United Nations in Geneva. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recommendations, underlined that these commitments must be specified as concrete time-bound 
actions. The experts group also welcomed the commitment of the Government to respond to all 
pending communications submitted by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>23. The experts group noted the Joint Communiqu&#233; on humanitarian access, of March 2007, 
but reiterated that the mere existence of an agreement or law is insufficient to ensure the rights of 
its beneficiaries, which can only be measured through improvements on the ground. At the same 
time, the experts group noted that the Government of the Sudan, while accepting the importance 
of implementing the Joint Communiqu&#233; and protecting humanitarian workers, disagreed with the 
experts group&#8217;s analysis of the seriousness of the situation on the ground. The experts group also 
noted the Government&#8217;s disagreement with the recommendation on the protection of 
humanitarian workers and humanitarian access as well as the recommendation to grant human 
rights monitors the ability to carry out unannounced visits to places of detention while giving 
assurances that visits to places of detention would be allowed whenever the necessary 
notification is provided to the relevant authorities. 
</p>
<p>24. The Sudanese delegation disagreed with the premise that the Government of the Sudan is 
under a legal obligation to cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) because its 
national courts have reportedly investigated all allegations of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. The Government further stated that whenever such allegations were found to be 
substantiated, the suspects have been sent to court and victims have been compensated. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government of the Sudan also clarified its position with regards accession to 
international conventions such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the Optional Protocol to CAT, 
which were also included as recommendations in the matrix. While in principle the Government 
of the Sudan is reportedly not against ratification of these Conventions, and is indeed considering 
accession with certain reservations, the Government is unable to commit to ratify them within 
the recommended time frame because of the purported need to raise awareness in society and 
because the Government cannot anticipate the outcome of legislative procedures necessary to 
ratify them. 
</p>
<p>26. In conclusion, the experts group noted with satisfaction the expressed willingness of the 
Government to take steps to partially or fully implement or to continue implementing the 
following recommendations included in the annexed matrix: 1.1.1; 1.1.4; 1.1.5; 1.2.1; 1.2.2; 
1.2.3; 1.2.4; 1.3.1; 1.3.2; 1.3.3; 1.4.1; 1.4.3; 1.4.4; 1.5.1; 1.6.1; 1.6.2; 2.2.3; 3.1; 3.2; 3.4; 3.5; 4.5; 
4.6; 4.7.  
</p>
<p>27. The experts group is of the opinion that there is scope for a rapprochement of positions on 
other recommendations and therefore recommends continuing dialogue with the Government of 
the Sudan on these issues. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
</b></p>
<p>28. In order to facilitate a common understanding of the spirit of resolution 4/8, and also to 
ensure transparency, on several occasions the experts group briefed relevant partners of the 
international community in Geneva on progress made towards implementation of resolution 4/8. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>29. On 23 April, Ms. Sima Samar had introductory meetings with representatives of the 
Permanent Mission of the Sudan in Geneva, the President of the Human Rights Council, the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and senior officials of the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>30. Between 24 and 27 April, the experts group held a series of consultations with 
representatives of the diplomatic community, including the ambassadors of Algeria, Egypt, 
Germany, Ghana and Romania, as well as the Permanent Observer of the African Union and the 
ambassadors of Morocco and Mauritius, in their capacity as &#8220;troika&#8221; of the African Regional 
Group. The Ambassadors of China and South Africa were not immediately available to meet 
with the experts group. Representatives of the diplomatic community expressed support and gave 
valuable suggestions for the work of the experts group.  
</p>
<p>31. The experts group met, on different occasions, with the President of the Human Rights 
Council, to discuss methods of work and exchange views on the novel approach instituted by the 
Council and briefed the Bureau of the Human Rights Council twice on progress achieved. 
</p>
<p>32. The experts group received information from the United Nations Mission in the Sudan 
(UNMIS), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the 
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and conducted 
consultations, in person and via audio-conference, with international NGOs, Geneva-based 
Sudanese NGOs in addition to individual experts - including from Sudan - on Darfur. The 
interlocutors provided valuable information on the situation in Darfur, on priority areas of 
concern as well as on obstacles hampering implementation of existing recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONSULTATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN UNION 
</b></p>
<p>33. Resolution 4/8 specifically calls on the experts group to work with the African Union and 
its human rights mechanisms. Taking into account the important role of the African Union in the 
Abuja peace process and the need for all parties, including the non-signatories, to the conflict to 
adhere to and implement the Darfur Peace Agreement, the experts group considers these contacts 
to be of particular importance. On three occasions, the experts group held consultations with and 
briefed the African Union&#8217;s Permanent Observer in Geneva, together with the &#8220;troika&#8221; of the 
African Regional Group and in presence of the Permanent Mission of the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>34. The experts group also initiated contacts with the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR) secretariat and its mechanisms; the Special Rapporteur on refugees 
and displaced persons in Africa communicated with the experts group via audio-conference on 
27 April. While initial plans to organize a meeting between the Chairperson of the experts group 
and the ACHPR in Banjul could not been realized, a follow-up meeting between the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons and 
the ACHPR&#8217;s Special Rapporteur on Refugees, Internally Displaced and Migrants in Africa took 
place in Addis Ababa, on 11 May. On 16 May, the experts group submitted a statement to the 
opening meeting of the forty-first session of the ACHPR emphasizing the need to deepen 
cooperation on Darfur between the mechanisms of the ACHPR and the special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. On 23 May, an audio conference was organized between the experts group and the 
ACHPR Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Women in Africa, a Member of the Working Group 
on Robben Island Guidelines, the Special Rapporteur on Conditions of Detention and Prisons in 
Africa, the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, the Special Rapporteur on 
Refugees, Internally Displaced Persons and Migrants in Africa, the Special Rapporteur on 
Freedom of Expression, as well as the Secretary of ACHPR. The objective of the consultation 
was to exchange views on means and methods of implementation of resolution 4/8. The 
mandate-holders of ACHPR expressed support for the work of the experts group and committed 
to continue cooperating with the mechanism established in resolution 4/8. 
</p>
<p>36. The Chairman of the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation (DDDC) was also 
approached on several occasions. The experts group regrets that formal consultations could not 
yet take place as the required authorization from the African Union for such contacts between the 
Chairman of the DDDC and the experts group has not yet been granted. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>37. The experts group shares the concern of the Council, expressed in its resolution 4/8, 
regarding the seriousness of ongoing violations of human rights and international humanitarian 
law in Darfur as well as the lack of accountability of perpetrators of such crimes. 
</p>
<p>38. The experts group believes that the approach chosen by the Human Rights Council through 
resolution 4/8 provides an opportunity for the Government of the Sudan to demonstrate its 
commitment to the protection of human rights in accordance with its obligations under 
international law. 
</p>
<p>39. The experts group welcomes the expressed commitment of the Government of the Sudan 
to work with the Council and the United Nations in order to implement pre-existing human rights 
recommendations and recalls that the current exercise can only be a starting point towards a 
betterment of the human rights situation in Darfur. While the commitments of the Government 
and the measures taken are crucial, it is the human rights situation on the ground which will 
provide the measurement of any improvement.  
</p>
<p>40. In this regard, the experts group underlines the importance of the work done by UNMIS 
human rights monitors and other actors in the field and reiterates that human rights monitors 
must have full and unimpeded access to all relevant areas, including all places where persons are 
deprived of their liberty as well as to investigation records, and be allowed to interview victims 
and detainees in private. 
</p>
<p>41. The experts group welcomes the opportunity to cooperate with the human rights 
mechanisms of the African Union, including the African Commission of Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights and the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation and reiterates the importance of those 
mechanisms to be fully engaged in the process outlined in resolution 4/8. 
</p>
<p>42. The experts group recalls that all parties involved in the conflict must stand up to their 
commitments and implement all pre-existing human rights recommendations issued by the 
United Nations and on all relevant actors involved to address, within the framework of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Abuja Peace Agreement and other appropriate forums, in a comprehensive 
manner all the obstacles hampering the improvement of the human rights situation in Darfur. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>The experts group recommends that the Human Rights Council:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Urge the Government of the Sudan to implement, without delay, the 
recommendations of the experts group it committed itself to put into practice (para. 26 
above); 
 (b) Request the experts group to continue its dialogue with the Government of the

<p><b>Para. Action Time frame Needs of the Sudan 
</b>1.1.1 The Government of the Sudan is committed to taking any 
</p>
<p>action likely to guarantee citizens greater protection and to 
ensure recognition of, and respect for, human rights. Any 
attack upon civilians is an attack upon human life and 
human dignity. These rights are safeguarded and protected 
under articles 28 and 29 of the Interim Constitution of the 
Sudan of 2005 and the Sudanese Criminal Code of 1991. 
Such attacks may also amount to war crimes, crimes against 
humanity or the crime of genocide under the Armed Forces 
Act of 2007, which was submitted to the legislature this 
week to replace the Armed Forces Act of 1986. Protection 
of civilian populations is part of the international 
humanitarian law curriculum used for training the armed 
forces at all levels. In order to strengthen this protection, 
several presidential decrees have been issued, namely:  
</p>
<p>Short-term The Government of the Sudan should like support 
in the following areas: 
</p>
<p>1. Assistance in providing external training 
for 30 persons on international humanitarian law 
and the protection of civilians. 
</p>
<p>2. The organization of a course for 100 officers on 
the same topics to be held in the Sudan in 
conjunction with the Sudanese National 
Committee for International Humanitarian Law.  </p>

<p><b>Para. Action Time frame Needs of the Sudan 
</b>1.1.2 The legal framework used by the African Union, the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan and the United Nations to 
monitor the execution of militia disarmament plans is: 
</p>
<p>(a) The N&#8217;Djamena Agreement of April 2004; 
(b) The decision adopted by the Assembly of the 
African Union at its summit held in Addis Ababa on 
8 July 2004; 
</p>
<p>(c) The Abuja Protocol of 9 November 2004 on the 
enhancement of the security situation in Darfur; 
</p>
<p>(d) The Darfur Peace Agreement of 5 May 2006. 
</p>
<p>Pursuant to these instruments, a joint committee was 
established, comprising representatives of the 
African Union, the Government and the movements which 
had signed the Peace Agreement was established and the 
Government submitted its militia disarmament plan to the 
African Union on 7 June 2006, according to with the 
deadline specified in the Protocol on Security 
Arrangements. The delegation of the Sudan will present this 
plan when it meets the Experts Group and will submit 
another report on what has been and what will be 
implemented.

<p>Mid-term - High-quality means of transport 
</p>
<p>- Communications equipment 
</p>
<p>- Capacity-building for persons implementing 
disarmament activities 
</p>
<p>- Funding 
</p>
<p>The obstacles to implementation of the plan by the 
African Union are lack of funding, lack of donor 
commitment, the continuing refusal by some 
movements to accede to the Peace Agreement and 
the steady flow of arms into the region from certain 
neighbouring States. Hence, the Government of the 
Sudan calls on the international community to 
implement this plan. </p>

number of checkpoints jointly manned by government and 
African Union forces in the town of Kas and it disarmed 
citizens, taking away various pieces of weaponry and 
ammunition. This operation is described in a report by 
Mr. Alfa Omar Kunari, Chairman of the African Union 
Mission, which was submitted to the Peace and Security 
Council of the African Union at its meeting held on

<p>1.1.4 Under Sudanese law the age of recruitment is 18 years. 
Consistent with this approach, the Sudan has signed and 
ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, which prohibits the involvement of 
children in armed conflict and sets the age of recruitment at 
18 years. This condition is also spelt out in article 14 of the 
Armed Forces Act. It is an offence to recruit a person below 
this age and severe penalties are prescribed therefor in 
article 182 (2) of the same Act. The Government will 
ensure compliance with these provisions.

with the African Union and create a mechanism for 
cooperation and coordination between the police and the 
African Union in the areas of peacekeeping, the adoption of

security plan has been devised for IDP camps, whereby 
internal security will be provided by the Sudanese police, 
while the African Union Mission will provide security and 
protection around camp perimeters. This is in keeping with 
the memorandum of understanding signed between the 
Sudanese Ministry of the Interior and the African Union

the 1991 Criminal Code. There is no connection between 
the article that deals with rape and the one that deals with 
extramarital intercourse and sodomy. A rape charge 
contains an element of doubt which precludes the penalty 
prescribed for the imposition of extramarital intercourse.

i.e. between rights and the interests of society.

designates a judge, to be appointed by the Constitutional 
Court, to whom a prisoner can turn in order to challenge a 
detention order. The judge may take whatever decision he 
deems fit after reviewing the grounds for the detention. The 
law also stipulates the time limits for arrest and detention, 
granting every security services director the power to hold a 
person for up to three days for questioning and the 
investigation of an allegation. Where three days is not 
sufficient for questioning, the law allows security directors, 
subject to the requirements of national authority, to extend 
the period of detention for up to 30 more days, if the person 
has been accused of a crime against the State and there is 
evidence or testimony against him. In such a case,

for up to a further two months, if a security director 
presents it with a case which, for security reasons, warrants 
a longer detention period than that prescribed.

person, they do so in accordance with strict legal rules. 
Detention is normally used solely in relation to activities 
that fundamentally threaten the security and safety of the

in 2004 on fast-track procedures for getting humanitarian 
assistance to those in need (copy attached). 
</p>
<p>A high-level joint committee was set up to monitor 
compliance with the agreement on a monthly basis (the 
delegation will submit a copy of the joint communiqu&#233;). 
</p>
<p>2.1.2 The work of humanitarian organizations in the Sudan is 
subject to State laws and regulations, as in any other 
country. Although many organizations operating in the 
Sudan breach these laws, the Humanitarian Aid 
Commission does not revoke their registration or expel 
them. There are many documented cases of this kind and 
the delegation will provide detailed information about 
them.

</p>
<p>The armed forces comply with international military 
norms on colour markings on vehicles, aircraft and military 
equipment. White aircraft are used for transport and 
medical evacuations and it is inconceivable that they 
should bear the symbols of any United Nations or 
non-governmental organization, because this would be a 
war crime under article 159 of the Armed Forces Act 
of 2007.

</p>
<p>other than the People&#8217;s Defence force and the national 
police. 
</p>
<p>2. The Government of the Sudan abides by domestic and 
international laws and does not engage in arbitrary acts 
against humanitarian workers. Most violations are 
committed by rebel movements which have not signed the 
Abuja Agreement. 
As for the movements that have signed the Abuja 
Agreement, there is a joint security arrangements 
commission which implements and applies the relevant 
terms of the Agreement. These movements have signed a 
joint statement undertaking to respect and not to interfere 
with humanitarian work. 
</p>
<p>The commission is tasked with disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration. There are no militias 
under armed forces&#8217; control.

</p>
<p>2.2.1 In keeping with paragraph 7 of the joint communiqu&#233; of 
2007 between the Government of the Sudan and the 
United Nations, a high-level joint committee was formed by 
the two sides to monitor implementation of the agreement 
set out in that document. The committee is chaired by the 
Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, the Deputy Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General and the resident 
representative for humanitarian affairs. The members are 
senior representatives from relevant agencies of both sides. 
The Government of the Sudan, with the cooperation of the 
United Nations, will monitor the work of this committee 
and give it a stronger role.

Over 2,500 foreigners working in Darfur benefit from these 
facilities.

<p>According to the World Food Programme report issued in 
February 2007, the rate of coverage for affected persons in 
Darfur is 98 per cent.

</b>The 2 per cent shortfall is concentrated in North Darfur and 
is due to attacks by movements that have not signed the 
Darfur Peace Agreement. This is confirmed in a joint report 
by the World Food Programme, the World Health 
Organization, UNICEF, the Ministry of Health and the 
Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, published in 2007. The 
Government of the Sudan shall endeavour to make up for 
this shortfall. 
</p>
<p>2.2.3 The present Act was approved after wide-ranging 
consultations which took account of the comments of the 
relevant organizations and entities. Under the Act, a total of 
2,063 domestic organizations and over 250 international 
organizations were registered after receiving official 
approval. The objection at issue relates to article 7, 
paragraph 2, of the Act, concerning disclosure of sources of

</b>The Duraybat area is outside of governmental control and is 
controlled by Abd al-Wahid Mohammed Nur. According to 
our information, the conflict is between movements that are 
not parties to the Abuja Agreement. 
The incidents in the Baram area were caused by a 
movement that is not a party to the Abuja Agreement and 
which is led by Sadiq. The Government took some counter-
measures. 
</p>
<p>Personnel of the United Nations, NGOs and the 
African Union Mission were arrested for breaching 
articles 77, 78 and 154 of the Sudanese Criminal Code 
of 1991. They were immediately released on bail and were 
tried under articles 77 and 78 of the Code, concerning 
alcohol consumption and breaching the peace. They were 
not tried under article 154 of the Code, because none of the 
accused entered an immunity plea. 
</p>
<p>3.2 The Armed Forces Act does not provide immunity for any 
members of the armed forces. Circular 3/95 provides no 
immunity for these groups, but rather regulates proceedings 
against members of the armed forces and the popular 
defence force. 
</p>

Police Act is procedural immunity and is subject to the

with official duties, the incident can be referred to the 
courts and the perpetrator may be put on trial. 
</p>
<p>Several members of the regular forces have been tried after 
their immunity was waived. 
</p>
<p>Decisions on immunity are subject to judicial scrutiny, by 
the Constitutional Court. Requests for an immunity waiver 
are made by the public prosecution service or the 
Prosecutor-General.  
</p>
<p>3.3 The legal position of the Government of the Sudan is as 
follows: 
</p>
<p>1. The Security Council does not have the power of referral 
under the Charter of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>2. Security Council resolution 1593 (2005) affirms that 
States non-parties to the Rome Statute are not obliged to 
cooperate with the Court. 
</p>
<p>3. The Sudan is not a party to the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p>4. The Government of the Sudan, because it believes in the 
principle of accountability for criminal acts and wishes to 
see justice being served, set up a national committee to 
investigate the incidents that allegedly occurred. The 
committee, in its final report, recommended among other 
things that a judicial investigation panel be established.

</b>The investigation panel was duly established and it found 
evidence to justify the laying of charges against a number 
of individuals implicated in several incidents. Arrest 
warrants were issued and served and the investigation panel 
decided to refer the case to the courts after completing the 
investigation. The defendants appealed against the 
indictment and the matter is now in the hands of the 
authorities responsible for hearing the appeal.

<p>5. The judicial authorities in the Sudan will follow up on 
the process in order to make sure that the suspects are 
brought to justice. 
</p>
<p>3.4 The National Security Act is one of the laws that will be 
amended consistent with the Interim Constitution of 2005. 
This action is pending.

<p>The process of amending applicable legislation to bring it 
into line with the Interim Constitution has begun and a 
committee has been set up by the Ministry of Justice to 
oversee this process.

<p>3.5 The judiciary and the Ministry of Justice are endeavouring 
to supply sufficient numbers of judges and prosecutors for 
Darfur. There are 22 public prosecutors for the three states 
of Darfur, 7 of them in North Darfur, 10 in West Darfur 
and 5 in South Darfur. The Government intends to ensure 
that they perform their duties effectively.

between the United Nations, the international community, 
as represented by UNMIS, donor States and the 
Government of the Sudan, as represented by the Advisory 
Council for Human Rights. The Council&#8217;s membership 
includes all relevant governmental bodies and a number of 
NGOs. At a regular meeting of the mechanism, a 
subcommittee was set up for the joint implementation 
mechanism. This committee looks into all human rights 
issues, including concerns about violations. The 
Government of the Sudan intends to strengthen this 
mechanism. 
</p>
<p>Ongoing Boost the role of human rights observers in 
working effectively with the Government of the 
Sudan to exchange and discuss reports impartially 
and transparently. 
</p>
<p>4.2 There is no law restricting the right of human rights 
monitors to interview victims. Monitors are not allowed to 
see investigation records lest this would affect the course of 
an investigation or of justice. Trial proceedings are 
conducted in open court and anyone can attend, unless a 
court decides, for stated reasons, that they should be held in 
camera.

<p>4.3 All previous requests for interviews with detainees held in 
connection with the situation in Darfur were freely granted 
on the basis of objective criteria, such as prior notification 
from the United Nations Office in order to schedule a time 
for the interview and identify the visitor or visitors. The 
Government of the Sudan will continue this policy.
