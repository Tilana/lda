</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on

</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 69/268 of 5 March 2015 on education 
</p>
<p>for democracy, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> <i>also </i>the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education 
</p>
<p>and Training and the World Programme for Human Rights Education, 
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming</i> the World Education Forum 2015, organized by the United Nations 
</p>

</p>
<p>and long-lasting harm to individuals and societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the negative impact of conflict and crisis on the full realization of the 
</p>
<p>right to education, and that more than one third of the world&#8217;s 121 million school children

</p>
<p>quality education,

</p>
<p>including the enactment of appropriate legislation, adjudication by national courts and the
