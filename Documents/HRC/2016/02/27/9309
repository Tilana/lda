<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of Estonia and in pursuance of his mandate, the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance visited Estonia from 25 to 28 September 2007. The Special Rapporteur held 
meetings with authorities from the executive, legislative and judicial branches, as well as with 
representatives of civil society, minority communities and victims of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes that the Estonian authorities, in particular the Prime 
Minister, has shown political will to tackle the problems related to racism and racial 
discrimination in the country, highlighting however that it needs to be constantly reinforced and 
transformed into concrete actions. He also underlines the fact that Estonia has put in place some 
institutions that have been very sensitive to the issues relevant to his mandate. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur also found a number of areas of concern, primarily concerning 
three distinct communities in Estonia: the Russian-speaking minority, the Roma community and 
non-European migrants. The main concerns of the Russian-speaking community are directly 
related to statelessness, which predominantly affects this group, and the country&#8217;s language 
policy, which is seen as an attempt to suppress the usage of Russian. Despite its small size, the 
Roma community in Estonia, as elsewhere in Europe, suffers mostly from structural 
discrimination, precarious education and marginalization. Lastly, non-European minorities have 
experienced a surge in racist violence, particularly by extremist groups and intolerance by some 
individuals concerning their ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. Although each of these 
communities faces different types of problems, a truly long-term solution can only be achieved 
by focusing on the promotion of multiculturalism and respect of diversity. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur notes that Estonia, as the other Baltic countries, is at a turning 
point in its history. The legacy of Soviet domination and occupation left scars that have yet to be 
healed, profoundly affecting the dynamics of inter-community relations. The main challenge that 
Estonia currently faces is to build a democratic, egalitarian and interactive multicultural society 
which takes into account the need to reassert the continuity of its national identity, severely 
shaken and eroded by the occupation, while recognizing and respecting the rights of the 
minorities that arrived during and after the occupation. In order to overcome the identity tensions 
raised by this process, Estonia will have to show political vision, legal vigilance and cultural 
creativity to develop a long-lasting sense of belonging and living together that will allow its 
different communities to bond. In this process, two main principles should be followed: respect 
for historical truth; and non-discrimination of minorities. To implement this strategy fully, 
national and regional factors will be of key relevance as far as the Russian-speaking 
communities are concerned. The full respect of their rights, in terms of citizenship, language, 
culture and the eradication of any form of discrimination, is closely linked to their involvement 
and participation in the process of construction of a new multicultural nation that is fully 
respected by all countries in the region.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur puts forward a number of recommendations, including the 
following: 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
  page 3 
 
&#131; State authorities should constantly reaffirm their political will and commitment to fight 
</p>
<p>all forms of racism and discrimination 
</p>
<p>&#131; The Government should adopt holistic national legislation covering all forms of 
discrimination in a comprehensive legal act 
</p>
<p>&#131; The Government should develop best practices and general guidelines for the prosecution 
of cases of incitement to racial hatred and racially motivated crimes 
</p>
<p>&#131; The Government should further strengthen the capacity of the Chancellor of Justice, 
including in terms of financial and human resources, to act thoroughly on allegations of 
racist crimes and incitement to racial, ethnic or religious hatred 
</p>
<p>&#131; Estonia should sign the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and 
the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness 
</p>
<p>&#131; The language policy in Estonia should be subject to an open and inclusive debate, in 
close consultation with ethnic minorities, aimed at finding strategies that better reflect the 
multilingual character of Estonian society 
</p>
<p>&#131; The Government should establish a broad process of consultation with a view to reducing 
the gap in historical perceptions between the Estonian and Russian-speaking 
communities 
</p>
<p>&#131; In parallel with a political and legal strategy, the Government, in cooperation with civil 
society, should adopt an ethical and cultural strategy that addresses the deepest roots of 
racism, xenophobia and intolerance and is built on the promotion of reciprocal 
knowledge of cultures and values, interaction among the different communities and the 
link between the fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination and the long-term 
construction of a democratic, egalitarian and interactive multicultural society

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur visited Estonia (Tallinn, Tartu 
and J&#245;hvi) from 25 to 28 September 2007. He met with the Prime Minister, the Ministers for 
Interior, Justice, Population Affairs and Social Affairs, officials at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Director-General of the Citizenship and Migration Board, the Director of the 
Language Inspectorate and the Head of the Prison of Tartu. He also met with the President of the 
Supreme Court and the Chairman of the Parliament Cultural Affairs Committee. After the formal 
conclusion of the mission, the Special Rapporteur also met with the Minister for Education and 
Research on 19 October 2007 in Paris. 
</p>
<p>2. Apart from the agenda with the government and state institutions, the Special Rapporteur 
also had extensive meetings with representatives of civil society organizations that are active in 
the realm of racism and xenophobia, minority communities as well as victims of racism and 
racial discrimination. He also participated in a roundtable held in J&#245;hvi with national minorities 
living in the north-eastern region of Estonia.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government of Estonia for 
its cooperation and openness throughout the visit and in the preparatory stages.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Historical and political context 
</b></p>
<p>4. The historical origins of Estonia date back to many centuries, with specific references to 
the name of Estonia occurring in the ninth century. Estonia was one of the last regions in Europe 
to be Christianized during the Northern Crusades in the late twelfth century. Throughout the 
Middle Ages, Estonia fell under Livonian, Lithuanian-Polish and Swedish control, until Russia 
defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War in 1721. During the early period of Russian control, 
a number of reforms were introduced, including abolishing serfdom, granting peasants the right 
to own property and freedom of movement. In this context, a particularly important period of 
Estonian history started, traditionally called the &#8220;national awakening&#8221;, where Estonian language, 
culture and traditions were revived.  However, after Alexander III became the Russian ruler, a 
deliberate attempt of Russification of Estonia started, which included the introduction of Russian 
as the official language in 1887.  
</p>
<p>5. With the outbreak of the Russian revolution of 1905, demands for national autonomy and 
civil and political rights started to grow. However, independence was only achieved after the 
Bolshevik Revolution and declared in 1918, after a brief period of German occupation during the 
First World War. Despite an unsuccessful attempt of invasion by the Soviet Army, the Republic 
of Estonia was created, adopting a Constitution in 1920, gaining international recognition and 
joining the League of Nations. 
</p>
<p>6. During the interwar years, rapid economic, social and cultural changes took place, 
including in the organization of state structures. In particular, Estonian language schools were 
widely disseminated. In 1925, a law on the cultural autonomy of minority groups was passed, 
turning Estonia in one of the first countries to adopt such type of legislation.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>                                                
</p>
<p>7. Estonia&#8217;s history, as that of the other Baltic States, was severely affected by the outbreak 
of the Second World War. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 assigned Estonia to the Soviet 
sphere of influence, prompting the beginning of the first Soviet occupation in 1940. A Soviet-
friendly government was set up and mass deportations started to take place, affecting a large part 
of the population. During the first year of occupation, around 60,000 people are believed to have 
been deported &#8211; 10,000 of whom during a single night in June 1941. Soviet control was briefly 
substituted by a Nazi occupation after the end of the non-aggression pact between Germany and 
the Soviet Union and the advance of German troops. Many Estonians were forcefully 
conscripted by the Nazi in the war against the Red Army, whereas many others were guided by 
the failed expectation that a Nazi victory would lead to independence. In particular, as the 
German-Soviet front reached the region of Narva, massive mobilization carried out by the Nazi 
and their Estonian collaborators led to the formation of the twentieth Waffen Grenadier Division 
of the SS in 1944, formed by Estonians.  
</p>
<p>8. After the German defeat in 1944, the second Soviet occupation started and Estonia became 
a Soviet republic. The first decade of the occupation, under Stalin, was particularly repressive, as 
Moscow attempted to implement a policy of Russification of the Baltic states, directly affecting 
education and cultural activities, including language. Between 1945 and 1953, it is believed that 
around 80,000 Estonians were deported, mainly to Siberia and Central Asia. The war casualties, 
massive deportations and migrations from other parts of the Soviet Union drastically changed the 
ethnic makeup of the population. While before the war 90 per cent of the residents were ethnic 
Estonians, this proportion fell to 60 per cent by 1990. Most of the political leadership, 
particularly in the first decades, was made of non-Estonians.  
</p>
<p>9. The independence of Estonia was restored formally on 20 August 1991, after a process of 
rapid political changes within the Soviet Union as a whole. Estonia quickly embarked on a 
policy of rapprochement with the West, engaging in profound economic reforms to integrate into 
the global markets. In 2004, Estonia acceded to the EU and NATO. The adaptation of legislation 
to the <i>acquis communautaire </i>led to important changes in policies that directly affect the fight 
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Demographic, ethnic and religious composition 
</b></p>
<p>10. Estonia has a population of 1,342,409, out of whom 68 per cent are ethnic Estonian. The 
largest minority is composed of ethnic Russians, which form 25 per cent of the population. Other 
sizeable minorities are Ukrainians (2 per cent), Byelorussians (1.2 per cent) and Finns (0.8 per 
cent). Tatars, Latvians, Poles, Jews, Lithuanians and Germans jointly represent some 1 per cent 
of the population.  
</p>
<p>11. Evangelical Lutheranism is the dominant religion, with some 13.6 per cent of the 
population, closely followed by Orthodox, with 12.8 per cent. Some 34.1 per cent of the 
population are unaffiliated. Thirty-two per cent of the population have unspecified or other 
religions. Around six per cent of the population has no religious affiliations.<b>1</b>

<b>1</b> Census 2000. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
  page 7 
</p><p> 
12. An important demographic distinction is between citizens, foreigners and persons of 
undefined nationality (stateless). Presently, there are 112,049 stateless persons in Estonia, which 
amounts to 8 per cent of the population. Tallinn, with 51,253 stateless persons, and East-
Virumaa are especially affected. The majority of stateless persons (around 52 per cent) were 
born in Estonia. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Political structure 
</b></p>
<p>13. Estonia is a parliamentary democracy whose government is headed by the Prime Minister. 
The Head of State is the President. The unicameral Parliament (<i>Riigikogu</i>) is composed of 101 
members and is elected through a system of proportional representation. A multiparty system is 
in place, and government has traditionally been coalitional. Only citizens have the right to vote 
in national elections. Non-citizens, however, have the right to vote in municipal elections. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>14. Estonia is party to the core international human rights instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its first Optional Protocol, the Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). At the European level, Estonia has ratified the 
Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. 
</p>
<p>15. Estonia is not a party to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and 
to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>16. Estonia has yet to become a party to other legal instruments that are relevant for questions 
of racism and discrimination, including Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human 
Rights on general non-discrimination (signed, but not ratified), the European Convention on 
Nationality (not signed), the Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Local Public Life 
at Local Level (not signed) and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (not 
signed). 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur carried out extensive meetings with authorities at the executive, 
legislative and judiciary branches to collect their views and opinions concerning racism and 
xenophobia in Estonia, the adequacy of the existing legal framework and the programmes and 
policies adopted by the authorities to fight these problems. Additionally, an agenda with civil 
society organizations, communities and minority groups, victims of discrimination and 
journalists was organized.  
</p>
<p>18. In order to comprehensively and objectively assess the situation, the Special Rapporteur 
structured his meetings with all his interlocutors around three questions: (i) Is there racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in Estonia? (ii) If this is the case, what are 
their main manifestations and expressions and the communities affected? (iii) What are or should 
be the governmental policies and programmes to fight these phenomena at the political, legal and 
cultural levels? </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
page 8 
</p><p> 
19. Section II of this report analyzes the political and legal strategy adopted by state 
institutions, with a particular focus on the perceptions of state officials concerning the problems 
related to racism and discrimination in the country. Subsequently, on Section III, the views of 
civil society organizations, representatives of minorities and victims of discrimination are 
introduced. This is followed by an analysis of the situation by the Special Rapporteur on Section 
IV and his recommendations to the Estonian government on Section V.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRATEGY OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Legal and institutional framework to combat racism and racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Constitutional and legislative provisions  
</b></p>
<p>20. The Constitution of Estonia establishes the general right to non-discrimination under its 
Article 12, which provides that &#8220;No one shall be discriminated against on the basis of nationality, 
race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, political or other opinion, property or social status, 
or on other grounds&#8221;. This principle is further specified in the Penal Code (&#167; 152), which 
establishes a possibility of punishment by fine, detention or one year of imprisonment to any 
&#8220;unlawful restriction of the rights of a person or granting of unlawful preferences to a person on 
the basis of his or her nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, 
political opinion, financial or social status&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>21. Article 12 of the Constitution provides that &#8220;the incitement of national, racial, religious or 
political hatred, violence or discrimination shall, by law, be prohibited and punishable&#8221;. The 
Penal Code (&#167; 151) increases the scope of the prohibition by referring additionally to colour, sex, 
language, origin, sexual orientation, financial or social status. Different levels of punishment are 
established, ranging from a fine to 3 years of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>22. According to the Penal Code, a first time violation of the provisions of non-discrimination 
and non-incitement to hatred are considered as a misdemeanour, punishable by fines or 
detention. Only when the violation causes &#8220;substantial damage&#8221; to another person&#8217;s rights or 
represents a repetition of the same type of violation by the perpetrator is it punishable by 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>23. Ethnic minorities are also entitled to specific rights defined in the Constitution. Article 49, 
in particular, ascertains that &#8220;everyone shall have the right to preserve his or her ethnic identity&#8221;. 
Article 50 establishes that &#8220;ethnic minorities shall have the right, in the interests of their national 
culture, to establish institutions of self-government in accordance with conditions and procedures 
determined by the Law on Cultural Autonomy for Ethnic Minorities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>24. The Constitution defines Estonian as the official language of the state and local 
government (Article 52). However, it also allows for local government authorities in regions 
inhabited by a majority of non-Estonian speakers to use the language of the majority &#8220;for internal 
communication to the extent and in accordance with procedures determined by law&#8221;. In regions 
where at least half of the residents belong to an ethnic minority, the Constitution provides for the 
&#8220;right to receive answers from state and local government authorities and their officials in the 
language of that ethnic minority&#8221; (Article 52).  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
<b>2.  Citizenship legislation</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Estonia&#8217;s citizenship policy after the restoration of independence was based on the doctrine 
of legal continuity of the state. According to this principle, the end of the Soviet occupation did 
not create a new state, but rather restored a previously existing state whose independence was 
interrupted by forcible annexation into the USSR. The first steps after the end of occupation 
were to restore the political and legal framework that existed in 1940, including the Constitution. 
Therefore, only those persons that enjoyed citizenship prior to 1940 and their direct descendents 
were recognized as citizens after the restoration of independence. Those citizens of the former 
Soviet Union who immigrated to Estonia during the Occupation became stateless persons. For 
this group, the only option available to become Estonian citizens was to apply for citizenship 
through naturalization. 
</p>
<p>26. Although the fundamental <i>jus sanguinis</i> principle of citizenship is defined by the 
Constitution, the specific regulations for the acquisition of Estonian citizenship are established 
by the Law on Citizenship. Article 6 of the Law, in particular, defines a set of criteria that need 
to be met by aliens who wish to receive the Estonian citizenship through naturalization. These 
include: (i) a minimum age of 15; (ii) permanent residence in Estonia for five years; (iii) 
knowledge of the Estonian language; (iv) knowledge of the Estonian Constitution and the Law 
on Citizenship; (v) a permanent lawful income sufficient to support the alien and his or her 
family; (vi) loyalty to the state of Estonia; (vii) an oath of citizenship. 
</p>
<p>27. Specific requirements are also established for the language examination in the Law on 
Citizenship. The general demand is that the applicant demonstrates knowledge of the language 
&#8220;required for day to day life&#8221;. Such knowledge is deemed to include listening comprehension, 
conversation, reading comprehension and writing. All persons who have completed basic, 
secondary or higher education in Estonian language are exempted from the exam. An 
amendment to the Law on Citizenship in 2004 defined that the Government would reimburse the 
costs of language courses incurred by applicants to Estonian citizenship who successfully passed 
the language exam. According to the new Programme for Integration of Society, language 
courses of less secured persons will be financed by the State. 
</p>
<p>28. State authorities highlighted that the language requirements for the naturalization 
procedure have been drastically facilitated in the past years. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s state 
interlocutors emphasized that presently the language exam only requires a very basic knowledge 
of Estonian and is no longer the reason why non-citizens do not apply for citizenship. Rather, 
many authorities believe that the range of rights to which non-citizens are entitled, which is seen 
as closely resembling those of citizens, in effect disincentives many people to apply for 
citizenship, as this would bring about few material changes. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Language legislation 
</b></p>
<p>29. Apart from the language requirements for the acquisition of Estonian citizenship, the 
broader application of regulations concerning the Estonian language in public and private life are 
contained in the Language Act. It establishes Estonian as the official language and &#8220;any language 
other than Estonian&#8221; as a foreign language (&#167;2), including the languages of national minorities. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
page 10 
</p><p> 
30. The Language Act defines particular requirements for proficiency and use of Estonian 
language. Although these requirements were reduced after amendments to the Act, they still 
include a number of areas, including: (i) public servants and employees of state agencies 
(national or local) &#8220;must be able to understand and shall use Estonian at the level which is 
necessary to perform their service&#8221; (&#167; 5.2); (ii) employees of companies, non-profit associations 
and sole proprietors in industries that offer goods or services and forward information also must 
have the adequate level of Estonian to perform their duties &#8220;if it is justified in the public 
interest&#8221;. Three levels of proficiency are defined by the Act: basic, intermediate and advanced, 
which are tested through language proficiency examinations organized by the State. Language 
requirements for naturalization only demand a basic level of proficiency. The skill requirement 
must be substantiated and proportionate to the aim pursued by the person.  
</p>
<p>31. In local governments where the majority of permanent residents belong to a national 
minority, the language of the national minority may be used alongside Estonian as the internal 
working language, subject to a request by the municipal council and approval of the Government 
of the Republic (&#167; 11). Communications with state agencies and other local governments, 
however, are required to take place in Estonian (&#167; 12). This same principle is valid for cultural 
autonomy bodies of national minorities.  
</p>
<p>32. Supervision of the Language Act is carried out by the Language Inspectorate, a 
governmental body created in 1991. The Act further establishes that violations to its provisions 
are subject to administrative liability. In his meeting with the Director of the Language 
Inspectorate, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Inspectorate focuses its supervision 
activities primarily in the public sector, but also monitors private companies that have direct 
contact with customers. He further added that the main objective of the Inspectorate is not to 
prohibit the usage of foreign languages, but rather to guarantee the usage of Estonian. In 
particular, the main motivation behind the creation of the Language Inspectorate was to restore 
the position of Estonian language in society, reversing the Soviet policy that was centred on the 
need to promote the Russian language among Estonians. 
</p>
<p>33. The Director of the Language Inspectorate also explained that the Inspectorate regularly 
visits public and private institutions in order to assess whether the language level of employees is 
compatible with the requirements of their position. Whenever a person who works in a position 
that demands a certain level of proficiency in Estonian fails to meet that requirement, the State 
covers the costs of the language courses that are required to the person to be reassessed. 
Language oversight in regular establishments is in the vast majority of cases pre-scheduled with 
one moth in advance (one year for schools). Only in limited cases can the oversight take place 
without previous warning.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Law on cultural autonomy of national minorities 
</b></p>
<p>34. The particular cultural autonomy rights of national minorities are established by the Law 
on Cultural Autonomy of National Minorities. In the Law, national minorities are defined as the 
citizens of Estonia who &#8220;reside on the territory of Estonia&#8221;, &#8220;maintain longstanding, firm and 
lasting ties with Estonia&#8221;, &#8220;are distinct from Estonians on the basis of their ethnic, cultural, 
religious, or linguistic characteristics&#8221; and &#8220;are motivated by a concern to preserve together their 
cultural traditions, their religion or their language which constitute the basis of their common 
identity&#8221;.  The Law further establishes that &#8220;national minority cultural autonomy may be </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
established by persons belonging to German, Russian, Swedish and Jewish minorities and 
persons belonging to national minorities with a membership of more than 3000&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>35. These national minorities as defined by the Law are entitled to specific rights, including 
the right to form cultural and educational institutions, religious congregations and ethnic 
organizations, to use their mother tongue &#8220;within the limits established by the Language Act&#8221;, 
and to publish, circulate and exchange information in the mother tongue. Other specific rights 
are contained in paragraph 4 of the Language Act. 
</p>
<p>36. Due to the definition of ethnic minorities as being composed by citizens, stateless persons 
living in Estonia are unable to benefit from the rights established by the Law. This definition was 
further stated in Estonia&#8217;s declaration when it ratified the Council of Europe&#8217;s Framework 
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, when it declared that its understanding of 
the term national minorities is that contained in the Law on Cultural Autonomy of National 
Minorities. Under the Law, non-citizens &#8220;may not vote or be elected or appointed to the 
leadership of the institutions of cultural self-government&#8221;, but may take part in their activities 
(Article 6). 
</p>
<p><b>5.  The Chancellor of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>37. The position of Chancellor of Justice was created by the Constitution as an independent 
official, appointed by Parliament, in charge of overseeing that all the proposed legal acts, both in 
national and local governments, are in accordance with the Constitution and overall legislation. 
Apart from investigating issues of constitutionality, the Chancellor of Justice is empowered to 
receive petitions containing allegations of violations of rights established in the Constitution or 
other legislation. 
</p>
<p>38. With the passing of the Chancellor of Justice Act in 1999, the Office gained new 
responsibilities, in particular the function of ombudsman, and has since then more centrally 
focused on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. Furthermore, in 2004, new 
amendments to the Act empowered the Chancellor of Justice to deal with cases of 
discrimination, both in the public and in the private sectors. Since 2001, the Chancellor of Justice 
engaged in a strategy to open regional offices, particularly in the north-eastern regions, which 
have a higher proportion of stateless persons and minorities. 
</p>
<p>39. The Chancellor of Justice underlined that he has a key role to change attitudes within 
society, fighting the underlying reasoning that motivates racism rather than solely its 
consequences. To achieve this goal, the Chancellor expressed his engagement in activities such 
as awareness-raising, research, training and monitoring. In particular, his Office has organized 
training courses for civil servants working in other departments in order to explain the nature of 
human rights and obligations thereof. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Policies and programmes to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to Estonian authorities, apart from the existing legal framework and its 
monitoring by the Chancellor of Justice, a number of initiatives are being developed to promote </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>                                                
</p>
<p>tolerance, respect for diversity and, ultimately, integration of racial, ethnic and religious 
minorities in Estonia.  
</p>
<p>41. One of the frameworks for consultation with national minorities created by Estonia is the 
President of the Republic&#8217;s Roundtable on National Minorities, which is mandated to propose 
specific recommendations in several areas, including &#8220;the resolution of the socio-economic, 
cultural and legal problems of aliens and stateless persons permanently residing in Estonia as 
well as of ethnic minorities&#8221;; &#8220;support for persons seeking Estonian citizenship&#8221;; language-
related issues; and preservation of cultural and ethnic identity of minorities.  
</p>
<p>42. Representatives of the Ministry of Social Affairs highlighted that non-discrimination is an 
important topic on the Ministry&#8217;s agenda. In effect, the Ministry coordinated the European Year 
of Equal Opportunities for All 2007 in Estonia, prompting the organization of several awareness-
raising actions among the population in general and minorities in particular, focusing not only on 
the respect for diversity but also educating the population concerning the existing legislation on 
non-discrimination. The collection of data concerning the main forms of discrimination was 
highlighted by Ministry officials as a central priority and the subject of various ongoing research 
projects during the year. 
</p>
<p>43. The Office of the Minister of Population Affairs is more directly engaged in efforts to 
promote minority cultures, particularly by financing associations of national minorities, which 
are entitled to receive public funds to develop cultural activities. The Office of the Minister was 
also involved in the preparation of the Strategy for Integration of Society (2008-13), in 
cooperation with the Integration Foundation, a body set-up in 1998 to prepare, coordinate and 
execute projects that aim to foster the integration of Estonian society. During the drafting 
process, around 200 amendments to the strategy were received from members of civil society, 
including minority organizations, and a broad process of consultation was established. According 
to officials, this Strategy was designed to further strengthen the Government&#8217;s support of ethnic 
minorities. It will address the problem of social and political exclusion of large ethnic groups, 
which is viewed as an important challenge for integration, as well as the need to focus on 
regional differences in integration and to deepen cooperation with local governments. The 
Strategy has as its main objective the promotion of cultural diversity, specifically through the 
preservation of the linguistic and cultural distinctiveness of minorities, whilst creating a common 
sense of unity around core Estonian values, in particular Estonian language and Constitution, and 
promote participation in social, economic and cultural life.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>44. An important realm for the respect of diversity and multiculturalism are state agencies that 
deal directly with non-citizens as well as refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the Citizenship and Migration Board has developed in-house 
trainings to prepare its staff to respect diversity. Compulsory training programmes on human 
rights and multiculturalism are also in place for all employees of reception centers for asylum-
seekers and refugees as well as deportation facilities.

</p>
<p><b>C.  Perceptions and reactions of State officials and Government agencies  
</b></p>
<p>45. The majority of state authorities recognized the existence of racism and discrimination in 
Estonia, whilst highlighting the actions and programmes taken by the government to fight these 
problems. The Prime Minister, in particular, stated that although some people in Estonia, as in 
other countries, are intolerant and even violent towards foreigners, the Government has a very 
strong stance against this behaviour. This stance is reflected in the Constitution and other 
legislation, which unambiguously prohibit any form of racism and discrimination. The 
Government&#8217;s position is to recognize the problems of the past as a means to avoid them in the 
future. In this regard, the Prime Minister made a specific reference to the issue of anti-Semitism 
and the collaboration of Estonians with the perpetrators of the Holocaust, emphasizing that the 
Government had already formally apologized for this period of history and is taking all measures 
to protect the Jewish community.  
</p>
<p>46. The Prime Minister also recognized the complex situation of the Russian minority, 
especially in view of the recent historical background. He highlighted important differences 
within the Russian community, which reached Estonia in different historical periods over the 
past two centuries, from the arrival of the old believers to the more recent wave of migration 
during Soviet times. The Prime Minister pointed out that the Russian community has refrained 
from engaging in nationalist parties, which has allowed for the strengthening of non-ethnic, 
mainstream parties. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur asked government interlocutors about the high number of stateless 
persons. Most authorities saw the large number of persons of undefined nationality not as 
evidence of discrimination, but rather as an outcome of large-scale historical processes that 
placed communities in conflictive situations. Some state authorities, particularly the Chancellor 
of Justice, recognized that the elevated number of non-citizens represents a concrete problem, 
whilst underlining the positive steps taken by the Government in order to facilitate the granting 
of citizenship. According to many authorities, the simplification of citizenship application, 
including of language requirements, directly contributed to the reduction of the number of 
persons of undefined nationality from around 500,000 in the early 1990s to 112,000 at present.  
</p>
<p>48. One of the barriers to reducing the number of stateless persons, according to some State 
officials, is a lack of incentives for non-citizens to apply for citizenship. In particular, it was 
pointed out by many authorities, including the Ministers of Interior and Justice, that over the past 
years, the Government has made a strong effort to facilitate citizenship procedures, which in 
their views transformed Estonia&#8217;s legislation into one of the most liberal in the world. In the 
view of many authorities, many non-citizens choose not to apply for citizenship because of the 
limited additional benefits of becoming a citizen. 
</p>
<p>49. The Prime Minister also focused on the need to bridge the gap in the interpretation of 
history between the Estonian and Russian communities, particularly regarding symbolic events 
such as the Second World War, collaboration with the Nazis and the meaning of the Soviet 
occupation. This gap in historical perceptions was demonstrated in April 2007, during the crisis 
around the relocation of a monument in homage to the Soviet soldiers that died during the 
Second World War. A problem mentioned by some authorities is that history has been 
instrumentalized in some occasions in order to question the right of Estonia to exist as a </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
page 14 
 
legitimate state. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of developing a common 
understanding of history among the different communities living in Estonia. 
</p>
<p>50. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur received the information that an Institute of Memory 
was established on 1 February 2008 by the President, which will look into the human rights 
violations committed in the country in the period 1944-1991. According to the government, the 
aim of the Institute is to better understand the past, in a manner that is not politicized, in order to 
cope with the present.  
</p>
<p>51. Apart from the issues related to citizenship and integration of the Russian-speaking 
minority, the Special Rapporteur also focused on the problem of mounting racist violence, 
particularly by extremist groups, some of which were believed to be active in Tartu. In this 
regard, the Ministry of Interior emphasized that the existing legislation already contains all the 
necessary provisions for law enforcement officials to prosecute cases of racist crimes, making 
particular reference to the provisions in the Penal Code concerning genocide, incitement to 
hatred, discrimination and freedom of religion. The Minister of Justice also emphasized the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to tackle this problem, underlining that many foreign groups have 
attempted to organize extremist activities in Estonia, but have been under constant surveillance 
by security forces. In response to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s inquiry on whether there is a need for 
new provisions qualifying racism as an aggravating factor for racially motivated crimes, the 
Minister expressed the view that this particular issue is already covered in the Constitution and 
the Penal Code.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  VIEWS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND COMMUNITIES CONCERNED 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Concerns in response to State policies and measures 
</b></p>
<p>52. Representatives of civil society, minorities and victims of discrimination, conveyed their 
strong perception that there are several expressions of racism and discrimination within the 
Estonian society. Despite the different concerns expressed by each particular community, a 
common threat that was distilled by the Special Rapporteur regards the policies designed to 
strengthen and reaffirm a core Estonian identity, which are viewed as an attempt to suppress the 
diversity and distinctiveness of their own particular identities. These identity tensions are directly 
reflected in issues as distinct as language, citizenship and intolerance, which were highlighted by 
representatives of all minorities.  
</p>
<p>53. Civil society considers that there is a weak institutional framework as well as a lack of 
political will to revisit issues of language and citizenship, which in they view are the major 
obstacles for the full protection against racism and discrimination. One of the main mechanisms 
of consultations with minorities, the President of the Republic&#8217;s Roundtable with Ethnic 
Minorities, was seen as ineffective by most of the interlocutors in civil society. In particular, the 
recommendations that were debated and formulated in the meetings of the Roundtable were seen 
as merely formal commitments, with no concrete effect on policy. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur has identified three main groups that are vulnerable to racism, 
discrimination and xenophobia in Estonia, who nevertheless face distinct problems. The Russian-
speaking minority, particularly ethnic Russians, is mostly affected by the problem of 
statelessness as well as language restrictions. The Roma community and non-European </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
  page 15 
 
minorities have been a vulnerable target for racist attacks and suffer from negative stereotyping. 
The Roma, in particular, have historically faced cultural stigma and structural discrimination that 
directly hinders their ability to fully enjoy their rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Views of the Russian-speaking community 
</b></p>
<p>55. Estonia has a large Russian-speaking community, which is composed mostly of ethnic 
Russians but also includes smaller groups of ethnic Byelorussians and other minorities. Ethnic 
Russians arrived in Estonia during different waves of migration that extended from the sixteenth 
century, with the arrival of the old believers, to the aftermath of the 1917 Revolution. The largest 
part of the Russian community migrated forcefully or voluntarily during the Soviet occupation. 
However, in view of the different waves of Russian migration, it is inaccurate to speak of a 
unified ethnic Russian minority, since members of this group have different degrees of 
integration into the Estonian society (e.g. in terms of language) as well as different legal status. 
To refer to those former USSR citizens that immigrated to Estonia during the Soviet occupation, 
the Special Rapporteur uses the term Russian-speaking community. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur held extensive meetings with representatives of the Russian-
speaking community in order to collect their views and concerns. Members of the community 
expressed the view that the most important form of discrimination in Estonia is not ethnic, but 
rather language-based. In particular, it affects directly the Russian-speaking persons who either 
migrated or were born in Estonia during the period of the Soviet occupation. 
</p>
<p>57. Although the language requirements for citizenship applications were pointed out as 
problematic by some members of the community, the majority of interlocutors argued that the 
problem with language discrimination is more general, concerning the overall language policy in 
Estonia. The Russian-speaking community perceives the existing language policy as an attempt 
to suppress Russian as a legitimate minority language in the country, not only in public affairs, 
but also in the private domain. The role of the Language Inspectorate and its mandate to conduct 
language oversight in public and private institutions was strongly criticized and referred to by 
some interlocutors as a &#8220;language police&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>58. Representatives of the Russian-speaking community argued that the lack of recognition by 
Estonian authorities of the legitimate existence of Russian is seen more concretely in the 
educational system. They argued that the number of Russian-speaking schools is much lower in 
proportion to the number of Russian-speaking students than the number of Estonian-speaking 
schools. Educational reform, which will introduce a mandatory minimum of 60 per cent of 
courses that need to be taught in Estonian-language, was also viewed with concern. In many 
cases, according to community representatives, this will imply that Russian-speaking teachers 
will have to teach in Estonian in classes composed exclusively of Russian-speaking students. 
The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors underscored their preoccupation regarding the decrease in 
the quality of education for pupils, since many students of the Russian-speaking community with 
poor language skills in Estonian will have to follow a large part of the school curriculum in 
Estonian language. Furthermore, the concern regarding education reform extended to the 
situation of Russian-speaking school teachers, many of whom fear for their jobs. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors also emphasized that statelessness remains a central 
problem that mostly affects the Russian-speaking community. They highlighted that although the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
page 16 
 
overall citizenship application procedures have been facilitated, they still pose problems to a 
number of vulnerable groups. The cost of language courses in Estonian was seen as a major 
obstacle for the economically marginalized segments of the population. The reimbursement of 
the expenses with language courses was not seen as helpful, since it only applies after the exam 
and covers exclusively candidates that are successful in the language examinations. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that many candidates need to take the exam more than once, which 
entails an even higher cost. The situation of Russian-speaking elders was also considered as 
vulnerable, since the majority of people within this group have difficulties in terms of language 
instruction. 
</p>
<p>60. The Russian-speaking community also expressed concerns about their overall situation of 
social marginalization. The process of deindustrialization affected particularly the Russian 
community in North-Eastern Estonia. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the 
unemployment rate among Russian-speaking persons is almost twice as high as among 
Estonians. Furthermore, Russian-speakers earn lower average salaries and are allegedly 
overrepresented within the prison population.  
</p>
<p>61. The overall perception among members of the Russian-speaking community was that the 
key obstacle for the understanding among the Estonian and Russian-speaking communities was 
the view that the loyalty of the Russian-speakers to the Estonian state is questionable. The 
community highlighted that most of the Russian-speakers settled in Estonia many decades ago, 
and over half of the community was born in Estonia. They underlined the importance that the 
role of large segments of the Russian-speaking community in the process that led to Estonia&#8217;s 
restoration of independence should be recognized. Human rights NGOs pointed out that although 
there are obvious cultural links between the Russian-speaking community and the Russian 
Federation, existing sociological surveys show that these links are cultural and not political. 
However, their perception is that the members of the Russian-speaking community are treated as 
foreigners rather than people with long roots in Estonia. One of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
interlocutors argued that &#8220;we suddenly became migrants without ever leaving our homes&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Views of the Roma community 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of the small Roma community 
in Estonia, composed of 588 members according to official statistics. One of their main concerns 
refers to the non-recognition of the long history of the Roma in Estonia, and particularly of the 
tragic events surrounding the community during the Holocaust. One of the interlocutors pointed 
out that the construction of a monument to honour the Roma killed during the Second World 
War did not receive any financial support from the State. 
</p>
<p>63. The Roma community, despite its small size, referred to important problems they face, 
particularly concerning socio-economic marginalization. Education was pointed out as one of the 
key obstacles for the integration of Roma in the Estonian society. Roma children suffer from 
much higher dropout and drastically lower educational achievement rates, which directly affect 
their ability to enter the labour market. 
</p>
<p>64. Roma representatives also pointed out to more profound problems related to the cultural 
stigmatization and lack of tolerance towards the Roma community, which is often seen through 
stereotyped lenses and concepts. This lack of acceptance of Roma traditions and history by the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
society at large was pointed out as a key obstacle that prevents the Roma from fully integrating 
into society.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Views of non-European communities 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of the small but active African and 
Arab communities. Their concerns are different from the traditional questions of citizenship and 
language expressed by other minorities. In particular, non-European communities emphasized 
their view that nationalism, and not necessarily racism, is an important problem that leads 
directly to discrimination. 
</p>
<p>66. Nationalism is directly connected to one of the main concerns expressed by the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors: racially motivated crimes, particularly by members of extremist 
organizations, including neo-Nazi groups. Human rights NGOs and community representatives 
pointed out that neo-Nazi groups are currently active in Estonia, particularly in Tartu, and have 
perpetrated acts of violence against non-European minorities. It was underlined that due to the 
limitations in the legislation against racially motivated crimes and incitement to racial hatred, 
these groups are still free to operate. The resurgence of racist violence is a particularly 
distressing trend for members of non-European communities, as several of them moved to 
Estonia from Russia in order to escape extremist organizations and what they saw as a wave of 
racist attacks.  
</p>
<p>67. Relations with law-enforcement officials were also emphasized as an important form of 
discrimination against non-European minorities, particularly in what concerns border guards.  
Some cases of harassment by police officers were reported to the Special Rapporteur, and some 
interlocutors highlighted the existence of informal racial profiling. This has been a sensitive 
problem for the Arab community, which is affected, particularly since 9/11, with negative 
stereotypes associating them with terrorists, increasing harassment by the police in general as 
well as by border guards.   
</p>
<p>68. Non-European communities emphasized the need to further develop multicultural training 
programmes for state officials in general, particular those working directly with minorities, 
refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants, thus preparing them to respect diversity. This was seen 
as important in view of the gradual arrival of non-European migrants following Estonia&#8217;s 
accession to the European Union. On the legal level, more comprehensive legislation was called 
for, especially in the realm of racially motivated crimes, as well as clear guidelines for the 
prosecution of cases of incitement to racial and religious hatred.  
</p>
<p><b>E.  Roundtable with national minorities of the Ida Virumaa region  
</b></p>
<p>69. On 27 September, the Special Rapporteur was invited to attend the monthly meeting of 
national minorities of the Ida Virumaa region in the north-eastern of Estonia. The meeting took 
place in J&#245;hvi and gathered representatives of the Russian, Byelorussian, Jewish, Tartar, Finnish, 
Polish, Ukrainian minorities. A representative of the Estonian community, which is a minority in 
Ida Virumaa, was also present. The region has a radically different demographic makeup than 
the rest of the country: 71 per cent Russian, 20 per cent Estonian, 2.8 per cent Byelorussian, 2.8 
per cent Ukrainian and 1.4 per cent for other ethnic minorities. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
page 18 
</p><p> 
70. The main activities developed by the National Associations in the Ida Virumaa region 
include cultural festivals, Sunday schools to teach minority languages, history and traditions and 
the creation and maintenance of integration centres where all minorities can interact.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur noted with great satisfaction that the main objective of the 
roundtable with national minorities, as mentioned by the communities themselves, is the constant 
promotion of national cultures alongside the development of close links and increased 
interactions among the different communities. In particular, many representatives that attended 
the meeting referred explicitly to the respect for diversity as the unifying element that connects 
all minorities. The fact that such an initiative is taking place in a region where a very high 
proportion of non-Estonians inhabit illustrates how multiculturalism is the central response to the 
promotion of tolerance and respect among the different communities.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>72. After closely analyzing the statements of government officials and those of civil society 
organizations, representatives of minorities and victims of racism and discrimination, the Special 
Rapporteur reached the following conclusions. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur noted the existence of political will by State authorities to fight the 
expressions of racism and discrimination in Estonia. In particular, he considers his meeting with 
the Prime Minister as a sign of the Government&#8217;s strong commitment at its highest level to fight 
racism and discrimination. A number of relevant institutions showed a remarkable sensitivity to 
this cause, including the Chancellor of Justice, the Ministries of Social Affairs and Population 
Affairs. The Citizenship and Migration Board, within the limits of its mandate and the 
legislation, is also developing relevant actions to promote respect for diversity and 
multiculturalism.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur noted that Estonians have a core national identity that was crafted 
and refined throughout the years, as the people resisted to different foreign attempts to suppress 
their distinctiveness. However, Estonia, particularly through historical interactions with its 
neighbours, also developed a tradition of tolerance, multiculturalism and openness that still 
permeates Estonian society. Despite the existence of scars from the more recent historical 
experience of the Second World War, this tradition of tolerance and multiculturalism needs to be 
strengthened in the deployment of efforts to eradicate racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur is particularly impressed by the experience of the Roundtable with 
National Minorities of the Ida Virumaa region. The members of the Roundtable demonstrate a 
profound understanding of intercommunity relations, making a deliberate &#8211; and appropriate &#8211; 
choice for a process of multicultural integration. In particular, the activities developed by those 
communities show how it is not only possible, but necessary, to combine the recognition and 
acceptance of specific identities for each community whilst promoting interactions between the 
different communities. The fact that this experience takes place in a region largely inhabited by 
the Russian-speaking community shows the potential of inter-community relations as a means to 
foster tolerance and understanding. 
</p>
<p>76. In what concerns the particular problems faced by ethnic minorities, the Special 
Rapporteur noted important differences of opinion and assessment between the government and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
the communities themselves. Although the Estonian society is not viewed as discriminatory by 
the minorities, they argued that they regularly encounter discriminatory practices that directly 
affect their capacity to enjoy their human rights. In this regard, the incident with the Russian 
bronze soldier, particularly the dichotomous reactions it triggered in the Estonian and Russian-
speaking communities, show that there are deep discrepancies in perceptions and memories 
between the two communities, as well as particular grievances that should be addressed in order 
to improve inter-community relations. 
</p>
<p>77. One of the main concerns expressed by the Russian-speaking minority concerns 
statelessness and the perceived discriminatory nature of citizenship regulations. As many 
authorities emphasized, the citizenship regulations are not formally discriminatory, as they do 
not differentiate applicants on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race or other grounds. However, 
if one considers the particular historical context in which these regulations exist, especially 
concerning the demographics of the stateless population, one realizes that the Russian-speaking 
minority is largely the most affected group. It is in this broader sense, political rather than legal, 
that the Special Rapporteur considers extremely credible the views of the representatives of the 
Russian-speaking minorities who expressed that the citizenship policy is discriminatory. The 
large number of stateless persons currently living in Estonia &#8211; around 8 per cent of the resident 
population &#8211; is evidence that a problem exists. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur is aware that the problem of statelessness in Estonia involves 
sensitive issues related to the recent historical experience of the country, in particular the need to 
reaffirm the principle of legal continuity of the state and the reinforcing of the Estonian national 
identity.He welcomes the Government&#8217;s decision to extend to persons of undefined nationality 
the right to vote in local elections. However, he highlights the need to revisit this policy as a 
means to bridge the significant gap that separates the Estonian and Russian-speaking 
communities. In particular, he notes the existence of vulnerable groups of non-citizens &#8211; elders 
and socially-marginalized populations &#8211; who could enjoy easier access to citizenship, including 
free-of-charge language courses to prepare for the language exam. 
</p>
<p>79. The broader language policy put in place in Estonia is viewed as even more problematic by 
ethnic minorities. The main problem that needs to be addressed concerns the perception by 
minorities that there is an attempt to suppress the linguistic diversity of Estonia with policies that 
reinforce the role of Estonian in wide-ranging domains of public and private life. The role of the 
Language Inspectorate and its mandate to oversee whether people have a minimum knowledge 
of Estonian contribute to this impression. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the legitimate right 
of Estonia to protect and promote its official language. However, in order to comply with 
international instruments, and in order to build tolerance and understanding, minority languages 
should also be protected.   
</p>
<p>80. Referring to the crisis in April 2007 concerning the relocation of the statue of the Soviet 
soldier, many authorities referred to the difficult role of history and symbols in inter-community 
relations. The large gap in the understanding of history between the Estonian and Russian 
communities was clearly seen in this case: whereas the Russian community saw the monument 
as a symbol of respect to those that died fighting Nazi Germany, the Estonian community viewed 
the monument as a symbol of the start of the Soviet occupation. These conflicting views of key 
historical events are a major obstacle for the promotion of mutual understanding. The allegation

relocate the bronze statue and its hastily execution are indicative of the lack of a clear and long-
term vision of bridging the gap in memory and symbols between the communities, in particular 
with the Russian-speaking community. 
</p>
<p>81. Despite its small size, the Roma community in Estonia, as in most European countries, 
suffers from stigmatization and structural discrimination that manifests specifically in the realms 
of education, employment and cultural stereotypes. Although some efforts have been made by 
the Government, they have not been able to redress the vulnerable conditions faced by Roma 
residents. Apart from the provision of basic economic, social and cultural rights, authorities 
should focus on projects that target not only the community itself, but society as a whole. One of 
the main reasons for the marginalization of Roma citizens is intolerance and lack of acceptance 
by society at large, which can only be redressed through a national strategy that promotes 
cultural diversity and acceptance of multiculturalism and recognizes the historical role of the 
Roma community in Estonia as well as its tragic fate during the Second World War.  
</p>
<p>82. Estonia is currently witnessing an embryonic process that has been taking place in many 
other parts of Europe: the resurgence of racist crimes by extremist organizations, particularly 
neo-Nazi groups. If not curbed promptly by effective Government action, this problem will tend 
to become more widespread, particularly in view of the gradual arrival in Estonia of new waves 
of non-European migration. Effective action needs to focus both on stopping any form of 
incitement to racial, ethnic, national or religious hatred whilst criminally prosecuting any case of 
racist aggression. 
</p>
<p>83. These new migratory trends also raise more profound challenges for the country to 
overcome concerning the integration of racially, ethnically and religiously different minorities.  
Apart from the basic respect of the fundamental rights, broad efforts should be made to 
effectively integrate peoples bearing different traditions, ensuring respect for their culture, 
religion and customs.  
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur notes that Estonia, as the other Baltic countries, is currently at a 
turning point in history. The legacy of Soviet domination and occupation has left scars that have 
yet to be healed, profoundly affecting the dynamics of inter-community relations. The main 
challenge Estonia currently faces is to build a democratic, egalitarian and interactive 
multicultural society which takes into account both the need to reassert the continuity of its 
national identity, severely shaken and eroded by the occupation, whilst recognizing and 
respecting the rights of the minorities that arrived during and after the occupation. In order to 
overcome the identity tensions fostered by this process, Estonia will have to show political 
vision, legal vigilance and cultural creativity to develop a long-lasting sense of belonging and 
living together that bonds its different communities. In this process, two main principles should 
be followed: respect for the historical truth and non-discrimination of minorities. To fully 
implement this strategy, national and regional factors will be of key relevance as far as the 
Russian-speaking communities are concerned. The full respect of their rights &#8211; in terms of 
citizenship, language, culture and the eradication of any form of discrimination &#8211; is closely 
linked to their involvement and participation in the process of a new multicultural nation that is 
fully respected by all countries in the region.  </p>

<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>State authorities in the executive, legislative and judiciary powers should constantly 
reaffirm their political will and commitment to fight all forms of racism and 
discrimination. In particular, they need to be proactive and vigilant concerning the new 
challenges that arise from growing migration, multiculturalism and the dynamics of 
identity transformation. It is especially important to firmly condemn any racist or 
xenophobic action or discourse, including by political parties and the media. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Through its close interaction with its neighbours throughout the centuries, Estonia 
has developed a societal basis of tolerance and multiculturalism that still exists in the heart 
of its society. State authorities and civil society should build on these plural traditions to 
strengthen all actions against racism and discrimination and to promote a democratic 
multiculturalism that will be central to include new minorities into the Estonian society.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>In what concerns the legal framework to fight racism and discrimination, despite the 
existence of separate provisions in different legislation, including the general principle of 
non-discrimination enshrined in the Constitution, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government adopt national holistic legislation covering all forms of discrimination 
in a comprehensive legal act. It is particularly important that this legislation be precise in 
terms of the punishment and prosecution of racially motivated crimes and incitement to 
racial hatred. This would complement the relevant legislative basis that already exists in 
Estonia and, most importantly, ensure that no protection gaps remain. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government develop best practices and 
general guidelines for the prosecution of cases of incitement to racial hatred and racially 
motivated crimes, developing clear criteria for the threshold of evidence that is required to 
be presented and for the investigative conduct of law enforcement officials. Whilst 
developing these guidelines, the Government should bear in mind the need for the 
prohibition of incitement to racial, religious or ethnic hatred established by Articles 151 
and 152 of the Estonian Penal Code, Article 20 of ICCPR and Article 4 of ICERD. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Government should further strengthen the capacity of the Chancellor of Justice, 
including in terms of financial and human resources, to act on allegations of racist crimes 
and incitement to racial, ethnic or religious hatred. To complement the role of the 
Chancellor of Justice, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government put in 
place an independent institution entrusted with a mandate to fight discrimination. Rather 
than duplicating the role of the Chancellor of Justice, this institution would be responsible 
for linking the fight against discrimination with the active promotion of multiculturalism 
as the long-term solution to all forms of discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>In what concerns the issue of statelessness, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
Estonia accede to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons as well as 
the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Such a decision would strengthen 
the protection of minorities in Estonia and highlight the Government&#8217;s commitment to 
finding an equitable solution to the problem. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
page 22 
 
91. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government revisit the existing 
requirements for naturalization with a view to facilitate the granting of citizenship to 
persons of undefined nationality. In particular, the Government should facilitate the 
citizenship procedures for vulnerable groups, including elders and economically 
marginalized segments. This should involve the offer of free-of-charge language courses for 
all non-citizens that wish to apply for citizenship, as partially foreseen in the Programme 
for Integraton of Society (2008-13) The Government should also consider appropriate 
measures to tackle the low level of registration as citizens of children born in Estonia after 
20 August 1991 to non-citizen parents. These measures could include granting automatic 
citizenship at birth, without a requirement of registration by the parents, to those children 
born to non-citizen parents who do not acquire any other nationality. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>As a matter of priority, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the language policy 
in Estonia be subject to an open, democratic  and inclusive debate, in close consultation 
with ethnic minorities and human rights organizations, aiming at elaborating consensual  
strategies that better reflect the multilingual character of its society. This process should 
aim at promoting the living together of all the communities in Estonia on the basis of two 
principles: first, the legitimate right of the Estonian government to disseminate Estonian 
language among all residents and avoiding the process of asymmetric bilingualism that 
characterized the Soviet occupation; second, the respect for the existence of minority 
languages spoken by sizeable communities, in particular Russian, in full compliance with 
the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities, in particular, Article 2.1: &#8220;persons belonging to national [&#8230;] 
minorities have the right to [&#8230;] use their own language, in private and in public, freely and 
without interfere78)nce or any form of discrimination&#8221;; Article 4.2: &#8220;States shall take 
measures to create favourable conditions to enable persons belonging to minorities to [&#8230;] 
develop their culture, language, religion, traditions and customs&#8221; and Article 4.3: &#8220;States 
should take appropriate measures so that, wherever possible, persons belonging to 
minorities may have adequate opportunities to learn their mother tongue or to have 
instruction in their mother tongue&#8221;. Specific measures could be taken to allow linguistic 
minorities to reach the adequate language proficiency level demanded by the nature of 
their occupation, including the provision of free-of-charge Estonian language courses. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Government should establish a broad process of consultation with a view at 
diminishing the gap in historical perceptions between the Estonian and Russian-speaking 
communities. In particular, a collective writing by local and international scholars of a 
common history of the region that is accepted and recognized by all communities would 
represent a significant step to foster understanding and tolerance and would facilitate the 
teaching of history at schools, which is viewed as one of the main obstacles to the living 
together of the different communities. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Particular attention should be granted to the vulnerable situation of the Roma 
community. The Government should reinforce its programmes, drawing attention to 
general recommendation 27 of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination on discrimination against Roma. In particular, specific measures should be 
taken to improve the educational attainment of Roma children and to reduce dropout 
rates. The Programme should also promote a sensitization effort among the Estonian 
society at large to Roma history, traditions and living cultures, including their fate during </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.2 
  page 23 
 
<b>the Holocaust, in order to eliminate the negative stigma and stereotypes that Roma are 
recurrently associated with.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Government should develop mandatory training schemes for all law-enforcement 
officials, including border guards, focusing on human rights education in general and 
racism and discrimination in particular, following the successful in-house programme 
developed by the Citizenship and Migration Board. A multicultural composition and 
training of these officials will improve their relations with minority communities and 
respect thereof. Additionally, adequate mechanisms should be put in place to identify and 
punish unprofessional performance of law-enforcement officials when dealing with 
minorities, in particular in cases of harassment and racial, ethnic or religious profiling. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Government should strengthen its cooperation with all societal actors, in 
particularly civil society organizations that have been playing an important monitoring 
role for human rights violations. Civil society should be encouraged to further its work in 
providing legal counsel to victims as well as access to international instruments, both at the 
international and regional levels. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>In parallel with a political and legal strategy, the Government, in cooperation with 
the civil society, should adopt an ethical and cultural strategy that addresses the deepest 
roots of racism, xenophobia and intolerance and is built around the promotion of 
reciprocal knowledge of cultures and values, the interaction among the different 
communities and the link between the fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination 
and the long-term construction of a democratic, egalitarian and interactive multicultural 
society.
