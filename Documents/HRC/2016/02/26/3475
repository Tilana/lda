<p><b>The right to food 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council on the right to food, in particular Assembly resolution 65/220 of 21 December 
2010 and Council resolutions 13/4 of 24 March 2010 and 16/27 of 25 March 2011, as well 
as all resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights on the issue, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the seventh special session of the Human Rights Council, at which 
the Council analysed the negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the 
realization of the right to food for all, and Council resolutions S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 9/6 of 
18 September 2008 and 12/10 of 1 October 2009, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition 
and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in which the right of everyone to adequate food, including the fundamental 
right of every person to be free from hunger, is recognized, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted on 13 June 
2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 
2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible 
Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-importing 
Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994, 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its nineteenth session (A/HRC/19/2), chap. I. 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of 
National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations in November 2004,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained 
in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential foundation that 
will enable States to give adequate priority to food and nutrition security and poverty 
eradication,  
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration 
of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument 
of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 
international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from 
unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations and that endanger food and nutrition security,  
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and 
capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of 
Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize 
collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security in a world of increasingly 
interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared 
responsibilities are essential,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food and 
nutrition insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress 
made in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless 
urgent, determined and concerted action is taken,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the complex character of the global food crisis as a combination of 
several major factors, including speculation on food commodities and macroeconomic 
factors, also affected negatively by environmental degradation, desertification and global 
climate change, natural disasters and the lack of development and transfer of relevant 
technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries and least developed 
countries, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in 
particular in the said countries,  
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have 
serious consequences for the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, 
which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and 
alarmed at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, 
especially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading 
system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, 
thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance and positive role of smallholder farmers, including 
women, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries,  </p>


<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of 
life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in 
particular in developing countries,  
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of reversing the substantial decline in assistance devoted to 
agriculture since 1980, both in real terms and as a share of total official development 
assistance, while noting the recent partial inversion of this trend,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to 
agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails an increase in 
productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional 
farmers, in particular women farmers, and the most vulnerable groups, as well as national 
and international policies that are conducive to the realization of this right,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the need to increase sustainable investment in agriculture from all 
relevant sources for the realization of the right to food,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity 
and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and 
international levels for its elimination;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious 
food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be 
free from hunger so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and 
mental capacities;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Expresses</i> <i>grave concern</i> at the evolution of the world food crisis, which has 
been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis and<b> </b>seriously 
undermines the realization of the right to food for all, especially for one sixth of the world 
population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, who suffer from hunger, 
malnutrition and food insecurity;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Considers</i> <i>it intolerable</i> that, according to an estimation by the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the 
</p>
<p>age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are 
undernourished is nine hundred and twenty five million worldwide, and that there is an 
additional one billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of 
the global food crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could 
produce enough food to feed twelve billion people;  
</p>
<p>5. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its concern</i> that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food and nutrition insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality 
and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from 
malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice 
as many women as men suffer from malnutrition;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of smallholder farmers in developing countries, 
including women and local and indigenous communities, in ensuring food and nutrition 
security, reducing poverty and preserving ecosystems, and the need to assist their 
development;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> all States to take action to address gender inequality and 
discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of 
women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to 
food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and </p>


<p>water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and 
technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Stresses</i> the need to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to land 
rights for smallholders, traditional farmers and their organizations, including, in particular, 
rural women and vulnerable groups;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to ensure the 
mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations 
bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food and nutrition insecurity to 
integrate into and effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights 
perspective in their relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food;  
</p>
<p>10. <i>Reaffirms</i> the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious 
food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities;  
</p>
<p>11. <i>Encourages</i> States to mainstream a human rights perspective in building and 
reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to food for all, and to take 
steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as 
possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing 
appropriate institutional mechanisms, in order to: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, emerging threats to the right to 
adequate food, with a view to facing them;  
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Strengthen the overall national human rights protection system with a view to 
contributing to the realization of the right to food;  
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Improve coordination between the different relevant ministries and between 
national and subnational levels of government; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the 
setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that 
require progressive implementation;  
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Ensure adequate participation, particularly of the most food-insecure 
segments of the population;  
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Pay specific attention to the need to improve the situation of the most 
vulnerable segments of society;  
</p>
<p>12. <i>Underlines</i> the significance of national government policies and strategies on 
food production and poverty alleviation;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Stresses</i> that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the 
right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated 
response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional 
efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production, particularly 
through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop 
rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food and nutrition security, with a special 
focus on the gender-sensitive dimension; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, 
paragraph 2, thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Calls upon</i> States, individually and through international cooperation and 
assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the 
measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human </p>


<p>rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative 
impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free 
from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure;  
</p>
<p>16. <i>Stresses</i> that improving access to productive resources and investment in 
rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 
developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-
scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to 
droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological 
approaches, and encourages States and donors, both public and private, to examine and 
consider ways to integrate, where applicable and according to national contexts, the 
recommendations contained in the latest report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food1 in policies and programmes;  
</p>
<p>17. <i>Recognizes</i> that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural 
areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, 
and that these people are especially vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity, given the 
increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, 
seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that 
sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools to achieve food 
and nutrition security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, 
fishing communities and local enterprises is a key element to food security and the 
provision of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 
national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land 
degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to 
the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in countries experiencing serious drought 
and/or desertification, particularly in Africa;  
</p>
<p>19. <i>Recalls</i> the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and 
challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take 
special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and 
malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them;  
</p>
<p>20. <i>Requests</i> all States and private actors, and international organizations within 
their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective 
realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields;  
</p>
<p>21. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a 
human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food and nutrition security;  
</p>
<p>22. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, 
towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop 
national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of 
hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food;  
</p>
<p>23. <i>Stresses</i> the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt 
</p>

<p>relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable 
food security policies;  
</p>
<p>24. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> the early conclusion and a successful, development-oriented 
outcome of the Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a 
contribution to creating international conditions permitting the full realization of the right to 
food;  
</p>
<p>25. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in 
order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the 
realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views 
of all stakeholders;  
</p>
<p>26. <i>Stresses</i> that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p>27. <i>Recalls</i> the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Recognizes</i> that the commitments made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
halve the number of people who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while 
recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States and 
international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations 
agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding for realizing the 
aim of halving by 2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from 
hunger, as stated in Millennium Development Goal 1, as well as the right to food, as set out 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration;  
</p>
<p>29. <i>Reaffirms</i> that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all 
people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their 
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive 
effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases;  
</p>
<p>30. <i>Urges</i> States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>31. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of international cooperation and development 
assistance, as an effective contribution to both the expansion and improvement of 
agriculture and its environmental sustainability, and the provision of humanitarian food 
assistance in activities relating to emergency situations for the realization of the right to 
food and the achievement of sustainable food and nutrition security, while recognizing that 
each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national 
programmes and strategies in this regard;  
</p>
<p>32. <i>Reaffirms</i> the commitment made in the ministerial declaration of the 2009 
high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council to eliminating hunger and to 
securing food for all, today and tomorrow, and reiterates that relevant United Nations 
organizations should be assured the resources needed to expand and enhance their food 
assistance, and support safety net programmes designed to address hunger and malnutrition, 
when appropriate, through the use of local and regional purchase; 
</p>
<p>33. <i>Invites</i> all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive 
impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the </p>


<p>implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the 
fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on 
the realization of the right to food;  
</p>
<p>34. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant 
stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises 
currently occurring across Africa, in particular in the Horn of Africa and in the Sahel, and 
expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to 
cut operations across different regions, including southern Africa;  
</p>
<p>35. <i>Encourages</i> developing countries to establish regional arrangements, where 
they do not exist, with the support of the international community and development 
partners to ensure adequate food production and thereby contribute to ensuring food and 
nutrition security, in particular in developing countries that have scarce fertile land;  
</p>
<p>36. <i>Welcomes</i> the adoption by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations of a regional approach towards ensuring food and nutrition security, and 
expresses its appreciation for the current collaboration with all Rome-based institutions 
working comprehensively towards the realization of the right to food;  
</p>
<p>37. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Working 
Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the private sector to the 
realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring sustainable water 
resources for human consumption and agriculture;  
</p>
<p>38. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue his collaboration with 
relevant international organizations and United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, in 
particular the Rome-based ones, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food 
Programme, in order to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further 
within these organizations, in accordance with their respective mandates, including for the 
advancement of smallholders and agricultural workers in both developing and least 
developed countries;  
</p>
<p>39. <i>Expresses</i> <i>concern</i> at the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to 
adequate food of insufficient purchasing power and the increased price volatility of 
agricultural commodities on international markets, particularly on people in developing 
countries and on net food-importing countries;  
</p>
<p>40. <i>Stresses</i> the need to address the root causes of excessive food price volatility, 
including its structural causes, at all levels, and the need to manage the risks linked to high 
and excessively volatile prices in agriculture commodities and their consequences for 
global food and nutrition security;  
</p>
<p>41. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur, within his existing mandate, to explore, 
in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders, ways and means of raising 
the capacity of countries, particularly developing countries, including least developed and 
net food-importing developing countries, to ensure the realization and protection of the 
right to adequate food for their populations, and to report on his findings to the Human 
Rights Council;  
</p>
<p>42. <i>Takes note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur1 and the 
recommendations contained therein;  
</p>
<p>43. <i>Calls upon</i> all States and, if appropriate, relevant international organizations:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To combat the different forms of malnutrition as a means to realize the right 
to adequate food, including, if appropriate, by adopting a national strategy in this regard;  </p>


<p>(<i>b</i>) To take measures and support programmes which are aimed at combating the 
irreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, in particular by targeting 
the first thousand days of a child&#8217;s life;  
</p>
<p><i>(c) </i>To support the national plans and programmes of countries to improve 
nutrition in poor households, in particular plans and programmes that are aimed at 
combating undernutrition in mothers and children, and those targeting the irreversible 
effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, from gestation to the age of two years; </p>
<p>44. <i>Supports</i> the fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, as extended 
for a period of three years by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 13/4, and takes 
note with appreciation of the work conducted by the Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of 
his mandate;  
</p>
<p>45. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, as part of his mandate, to continue to 
monitor the evolution of the world food crisis and, in the context of his mandate and regular 
reports, to keep the Human Rights Council informed of the impact of the crisis on the 
enjoyment of the right to food and to alert it to possible further actions in this regard;  
</p>
<p>46. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to continue to provide all the human and financial resources necessary 
for the continuation of the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur;  
</p>
<p>47. <i>Welcomes</i> the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general comment 
No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the 
right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and 
is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill 
of Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of 
appropriate economic, environmental and social policies at both the national and 
international levels, oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human 
rights for all;  
</p>
<p>48. <i>Notes </i>general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant), in which the 
Committee noted, inter alia, the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for 
human consumption and agriculture in the realization of the right to adequate food;  
</p>
<p>49. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive 
Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, 
adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 
November 2004, represent a practical tool in the promotion of the realization of the right to 
food for all, contribute to the achievement of food security and thus provide an additional 
instrument in the attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including those 
contained in the Millennium Declaration;  
</p>
<p>50. <i>Acknowledges</i> the work being carried out by the Human Rights Council 
Advisory Committee on the right to food and, in that regard, takes note of its submission to 
the Council of the study on severe malnutrition and childhood diseases with children 
affected by noma as an example,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/19/73. </footnote> including the human rights principles and guidelines to 
improve the protection of children at risk or affected by malnutrition, specifically at risk of 
or affected by noma, annexed thereto, and encourages States to implement those principles;  
</p>

<p>51. <i>Takes note</i> of the final study of the Advisory Committee on the advancement 
of the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas;<footnote name="3">A/HRC/19/75. 
 4 A/HRC/AC/8/5. </footnote>  
</p>
<p>52. <i>Also takes note</i> of the preliminary study on the promotion of human rights of 
the urban poor: strategies and best practices,4 prepared by the Advisory Committee, and 
requests that the final study on this topic be presented to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-second session; 
</p>
<p>53. <i>Further takes note</i> of the concept note for the preliminary study on rural 
women and the right to food, prepared by the Advisory Committee, and requests the 
Committee to continue to undertake a comprehensive study in that regard;  
</p>
<p>54. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to collect the views and 
comments of all Member States, all relevant United Nations special agencies and 
programmes and all other relevant stakeholders on the preliminary studies mentioned in 
paragraphs 52 and 53 above, so that the Advisory Committee may take them into account 
for the conclusion of its final studies;  
</p>
<p>55. <i>Welcomes</i> the continued cooperation of the High Commissioner, the 
Advisory Committee and the Special Rapporteur, and encourages them to continue their 
cooperation;  
</p>
<p>56. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special 
Rapporteur in his task by supplying all necessary information requested by him and to give 
serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the Special Rapporteur to 
visit their countries to enable him to fulfil his mandate more effectively;  
</p>
<p>57. <i>Recalls</i> the requests made by the General Assembly, in its resolution 66/158, 
that the Special Rapporteur submit to the Assembly an interim report at its sixty-seventh 
session on the implementation of that resolution and to continue his work, including by 
examining the emerging issues with regard to the realization of the right to food within his 
existing mandate;  
</p>
<p>58. <i>Invites</i> Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes, treaty bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental 
organizations, as well as the private sector, to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur
