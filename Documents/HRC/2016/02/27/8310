<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth session from 3 
to 14 October 2011. The review of Antigua and Barbuda was held at the 3rd meeting on 4 
October 2011. The delegation of Antigua and Barbuda was headed by Justin Simon, 
Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs. At its 7th meeting held on 6 October 2011, 
the Working Group adopted the report on Antigua and Barbuda. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Antigua and Barbuda: Ecuador, India and 
Mauritania. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Antigua and Barbuda: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/ATG/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ATG/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ATG/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, 
Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to 
Antigua and Barbuda through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of 
the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Antigua and Barbuda welcomed the opportunity to participate in the universal 
periodic review and to engage in a dialogue with members of the international community 
on the subject of its human rights record and accomplishments. Antigua and Barbuda was 
taking the necessary steps within available means and resources towards fulfilling its 
commitments to enhance and reinforce the promotion and protection of the human rights of 
its citizens and residents. It remained committed to the review process and confident that, 
with the support and encouragement of the international community, it would be able to 
further honour its international obligations and continue to contribute to the strengthening 
of human rights as a global aim. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation indicated that the interactive dialogue had twofold importance, as it 
provided an opportunity to identify the critical areas for improvement while simultaneously 
allowing the Human Rights Council to learn about and understand its approach, as a 
developing State, to human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. Antigua and Barbuda was a twin island state, with a population of about 80,000. The 
human rights provisions enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were 
entrenched in the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda which became effective on 1 
November 1981 on its attainment of independence from Great Britain. The Constitution as 
the Supreme Law was the foundation for the rule of law and safeguards the protection and </p>


<p>promotion of human rights in Antigua and Barbuda. Among the fundamental freedoms of 
the individual protected by the Constitution were freedom of movement, conscience, 
expression, assembly and association irrespective of race, place of origin, political opinions, 
colour, creed or sex. Subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and the public 
interest, the Constitution safeguarded the right to life and personal liberty and secured 
protection from slavery and forced labour, inhuman treatment and deprivation of property. 
Any person who alleged a breach of any of these rights might apply for redress in the High 
Court, which had original jurisdiction in all constitutional human rights matters with a right 
of appeal firstly to its regional Court of Appeal of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean 
States and finally to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Great Britain. The 
delegation added that the Court of Appeal of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States 
sat in each of the territories of the member States of the organization and visited Antigua 
and Barbuda three times a year. 
</p>
<p>8. Antigua and Barbuda had received a number of questions from various States and 
would take some of these advanced questions into consideration in its statement.  
</p>
<p>9. Antigua and Barbuda was a party to various core international human rights treaties 
and was giving consideration to other conventions to which it was not yet a party; however, 
it was faced with many development challenges like many of its sister Caribbean islands, 
with respect to resources, both human and financial, which also adversely affected its 
timely presentation of reports to treaties to which it was a party. It reiterated, however, that 
it was committed to meeting all its treaty commitments and would seek to do so on the 
basis of practical priorities and common sense. 
</p>
<p>10. Although there was no full participation of State functionaries during the preparation 
of the report, it provided a comprehensive view of the human rights situation. The Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Legal Affairs did organize and coordinate 
consultations with groups and organizations within civil society in preparing the national 
report. The former President of the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, Clare 
Roberts, and other human rights activists such as a former State Ombudsman, had 
established a human rights group in Antigua and Barbuda to monitor reports of abuses and 
complaints from members of the public, highlighting societal expectations with a view to 
making recommendations to Government, where deemed necessary. Antigua and Barbuda 
welcomed such an initiative and would provide the group with all necessary support. 
</p>
<p>11. With regards to discrimination against women, Antigua and Barbuda had ratified the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1989, and 
acceded to its Optional Protocol in June 2006. It presented its combined initial and second 
reports in 1997 and was working to complete its combined third and fourth reports. 
</p>
<p>12. The Directorate of Gender Affairs continued to work in partnership with other 
governmental social agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide the necessary 
support to build and strengthen the capacity of these various groups as they confronted the 
issue of violence against women, while sharing knowledge and information with the 
general public. Public awareness and education formed part of the programme of action by 
the Directorate and in commemorating annual events such as 16 Days of Activism from 25 
November to 10 December. These opportunities were used to increase public awareness of 
the real facts and figures of the incidents of domestic violence within Antigua and Barbuda 
and to campaign for legislative reform, particularly in judicial procedure. 
</p>
<p>13. The Directorate had been seeking closer collaboration with the Royal Police Force 
of Antigua and Barbuda under the project &#8220;Strengthening State Accountability&#8221;, which 
continued to be supported by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women (UN-Women). The capacities of key stakeholders such as the 
police, the healthcare providers, and specially trained counsellors had been effectively </p>


<p>strengthened and continuous training and education was being provided to other key 
groups, equipping them with the necessary tools to effectively work towards the elimination 
of gender-based violence, violence against children, and the reduction of HIV contraction 
and transmission among those who had been affected by unwanted sexual encounters. The 
Childcare and Protection Act and the Maintenance of and Access to Children Act both 
addressed the issues of child abuse and neglect and made provision for the removal and 
placement of child victims and the prosecution of parents and caregivers who failed in their 
duties. 
</p>
<p>14. Through new initiatives, victims of rape and other sexual offences would benefit 
from a one-stop approach to treatment and response in a designated support location. Key 
stakeholders in the health, legal, judicial and social services sectors would work together to 
address the incidence of sexual offences and would incorporate all aspects of prevention, 
response, treatment and social support. The establishment of a Sexual Assault Referral 
Centre with trained nurses as forensic examiners, and the 24 Hour Crisis Hotline in 
collaboration with 911 Emergency Services would provide necessary and effective 
assistance to victims of rape, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect. Additionally, the 
training of male gender advocates continued to be part of the Directorate&#8217;s activities and 
</p>
<p>would continue through partnerships formed with a number of concerned men who had 
committed themselves to being proactive in the fight to end gender-based violence in all 
forms. 
</p>
<p>15. As to clarification on the lack of information on prostitution and trafficking of 
women, Antigua and Barbuda had enacted legislation in 2010 for the Prevention of 
Trafficking in Persons which provided, among other things, for compensation and medical 
expenses to be paid to sexually exploited victims. A national coalition for the prevention of 
trafficking in persons had been established in 2008. Training and education had been 
provided with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration to key 
stakeholders such as immigration officers, customs officers, coastguards and the police. 
</p>
<p>16. As part of the Initiative and Programme for the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons 
within Antigua, the International Organization for Migration in collaboration with the 
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, had also piloted the manual <i>Caring for 
Trafficked Persons</i>, which had been incorporated into the programme as a development 
tool. 
</p>
<p>17. Antigua and Barbuda had continuously voted against United Nations resolutions 
calling for a moratorium on the death penalty, as such resolutions were inconsistent with 
existing national legislation. Since 1873, capital punishment had been the automatic penalty 
for anyone guilty of murder &#8211; that was until April 2001, when the Eastern Caribbean Court 
of Appeal held in a landmark decision that the mandatory death sentence contravened the 
constitutional provision which prohibited cruel and inhuman punishment. The judicial 
directive which was being followed was that, after a conviction of murder by a jury, the 
judge must hold a further inquiry and hearing to determine the appropriate sentence to be 
imposed. There were seven inmates at Her Majesty&#8217;s Prison who had been sentenced to 
hanging between 1996 and 2000, and who would be serving life sentences. The last three 
executions occurred in 1988, 1989, and 1991. 
</p>
<p>18. Antigua and Barbuda was conscious of overcrowding in its only prison facility. 
Crown lands had been earmarked for the construction of a proper and multifaceted 
correction facility, but funds had not been forthcoming for that project. The delegation 
stated that Antigua and Barbuda must be forgiven for viewing its education, health, social 
protection, judicial and infrastructure needs as priorities for its scarce budgetary allocations, 
particularly in the economic downturn. </p>


<p>19. On the issue of corporal punishment, the Education Act 2008 provided for it to be 
administered only by the School Principal or the Deputy or their delegate in the 
enforcement of discipline at schools, provided that it was not degrading or injurious, and 
conformed to guidelines issued by the Director of Education, with particulars thereof to be 
recorded in writing. The Minister might by order abolish the use thereof altogether, but 
such an order was to be laid before Parliament for adoption or revocation &#8211; that provision 
clearly indicated expressed societal concerns over the total abolition of corporal punishment 
in schools. However, the Corporal Punishment Act which allowed for whipping and 
flogging of males in prison should be repealed; in any event, no such punishment had been 
ordered by the courts in a long time.  
</p>
<p>20. Antigua and Barbuda believed that national development in all its aspects was, in a 
real sense, a fundamental human right. It recognized the relationship between development 
rights and human rights and accepted that the advancement of these rights was inextricably 
linked to human development. It also believed that the establishment and advancement of 
all universal human rights could only be seen through this developmental prism. Significant 
investments and marked improvements had been achieved in the areas of education, 
housing, health, economic development, social protection, poverty reduction, and assistance 
to the elderly and disadvantaged in its society &#8211; all of which came at great financial cost to 
the Government and the constant re-mobilization of its limited human resources.  
</p>
<p>21. The delegation stated that, undoubtedly, one of the major challenges which Antigua 
and Barbuda, as a small developing State, faced was that of institutional capacity. It had 
established the International Treaties Unit within the Ministry of Legal Affairs to work 
closely with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to compile and keep a data bank of its 
international treaty obligations. This Unit would be tasked with the responsibility of 
overseeing compliance with the various human rights obligations of the State and 
disseminating relevant information to the public to sensitize and shape public opinion. The 
databank would also inform Government of the various international human rights 
instruments which should be adopted and enforced as part of its domestic law, given the 
dualist legal system under which it operated. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>22. During the interactive dialogue, 29 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations welcomed the participation of Antigua and Barbuda in the universal periodic 
review and thanked the Government for its national report. Delegations also welcomed the 
frank presentation delivered by Antigua and Barbuda. They acknowledged its commitment 
to human rights despite the many challenges faced by small island States. 
Recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in chapter II of the present 
report. 
</p>
<p>23. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted the commitment of Antigua and 
Barbuda to education as a significant tool for social transformation. Despite economic 
constraints, the island was taking steps to reach universal education by 2013. Moreover, 
free education was guaranteed at the primary and secondary levels and education was 
compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16. It also commended the school feeding 
programme which operated in 19 primary schools located in the most disadvantaged areas 
and the grants provided for uniforms and the free access to books. The Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>24. Cuba recalled that Antigua and Barbuda was part of the Bolivarian Alliance for the 
Peoples of Our America. Cuba had contributed to its development of health, education, and 
infrastructure. Antigua and Barbuda had suffered from an unjust international economic 
order, world crises and other challenges faced by humanity. However, the island had taken </p>


<p>action to combat poverty and achieved universal education. The Government had also 
advanced in health care, in particular in the prevention of HIV/AIDS. Cuba made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>25. Algeria mentioned the high level of poverty in Antigua and Barbuda and the 
importance of poverty reduction programmes for the implementation of economic and 
social rights. It praised the adoption of the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention) Act 2010. 
Algeria stated that it followed with interest the efforts undertaken to combat corruption and 
all forms of inequalities. It shared its satisfaction with the non-implementation of death 
penalty since 1989 and hoped that Antigua and Barbuda would support the General 
Assembly resolutions on the moratorium on the application of death penalty. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. France<b> </b>welcomed the fact that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was 
reflected in the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda, but noted the State was not a party to 
the whole set of international human rights instruments. It praised a de facto moratorium on 
the death penalty since 1991. France referred to the Criminal Code and the sentencing of 
those convicted of homosexual relationships to imprisonment of up to 15 years. It also 
raised its concern with regard to the lack of investigation and prosecution in cases of human 
trafficking. France made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>27. China appreciated the accession by the Government to the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. It welcomed the measures taken to guarantee the rights of vulnerable groups 
such as the elderly, children and persons with disabilities. It praised the efforts of Antigua 
and Barbuda to promote gender equality. It mentioned its progress in health care, education 
and poverty reduction, including the establishment of a social security system. It hoped that 
it would ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other 
international instruments.  
</p>
<p>28. Trinidad and<b> </b>Tobago mentioned the public programmes to enhance support for 
increased access by the differently abled persons to amenities and services, thereby 
empowering them. It welcomed the provision of financial assistance to vulnerable groups, 
including the disadvantaged and senior citizens. It referred to the problems posed by 
HIV/AIDS and praised the strategic decision taken by the Government to provide, free of 
charge, antiretroviral drugs and establish a human rights desk to deal with complaints of 
stigma and discrimination experienced by those infected with HIV. It highlighted also the 
passage of the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention) Act 2010. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Nicaragua stressed the efforts of the Government to meet the Millennium 
Development Goals, despite economic constraints faced by small economies which had 
been worsened by the international financial crisis. In that context, international solidarity 
constituted a tool that should be pursued in the multilateral forums. With the universal 
periodic review, Antigua and Barbuda had an opportunity to assess those areas in the field 
of human rights that could be reinforced and to find spaces for technical cooperation. 
Nicaragua made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>30. Canada<b> </b>addressed the human rights challenges that remained in certain areas such as 
protection of juveniles in the legal system, sanctions on private behaviour between 
consenting adults and ensuring the rights of minorities, the lack of detention facilities for 
those under 18 years and overcrowding. It welcomed the de facto moratorium on the death 
penalty since 1989 but noted that the penalty itself remained. Canada referred also to the 
persistence of discrimination and legal sanctions based on sexual orientation and gender 
identity. It inquired about the State&#8217;s commitment to establish a human rights body. Canada 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. </p>


<p>31. Hungary hoped that the universal periodic review of Antigua and Barbuda would 
strengthen the promotion of human rights in the ground. It welcomed the priority given to 
the implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It 
expressed concern on the legality of corporal punishment for children, the low age of 
criminal responsibility and the fact that no separate detention facilities for persons under 18 
existed. It praised the establishment of a human rights desk to combat discrimination 
against HIV-infected persons but regretted that homosexual acts between consenting adults 
continued to be illegal. Hungary made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. Slovakia commended the adoption of the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention) Act 
and the country&#8217;s efforts to address that negative phenomenon. It referred to the absence of 
an adequate complaint mechanism for child victims of abuse and the very low minimum 
age of criminal responsibility set at 8 years as indicated by the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF). It raised concern at the poor 
conditions in prisons and detention centres due to overcrowding and lack of necessary 
infrastructure. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. The delegation thanked the recommendations made by various speakers and stated 
that it would certainly be looking into their adoption. It also indicated its appreciation to the 
assistance given by Cuba and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in respect of poverty 
alleviation as well as university education.   
</p>
<p>34. With regard to the concerns expressed for the mandatory death sentence and 
corporal punishment, the delegation reiterated that corporal punishment in schools was 
rather limited. As for mandatory death sentence, Antigua and Barbuda did not have a 
political mandate for its abolition; however, it was concerned and would certainly educate 
the public towards the realization of its abolition. It was acting in concert with various 
territories of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, as it had a common judiciary 
with them and its positions and situations in terms of judicial directions were similar to 
theirs. The fact that it had exercised a moratorium on the execution clearly indicated the 
direction to which Antigua and Barbuda was leaning, particularly as it had considered 
making life sentences in respect of those persons who were convicted and sentenced to 
death.  
</p>
<p>35. The delegation also noted the concerns expressed about criminalization under the 
Sexual Offences Act, which it recognized that the international community was actually 
moving away from. It stated that there was no discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
Nor were there any particular acts of discrimination against these persons. Antigua and 
Barbuda had to be aware and concerned of the society&#8217;s leanings and where it stood. 
However, it did not have a political mandate to decriminalize those acts. Criminalization 
was on the books as far as the law was concerned, however, it was only in the very rare 
instances that the law had actually been enforced. Antigua and Barbuda was, nevertheless, 
guided by the public opinion and was not in a position to clearly decriminalize these acts.  
</p>
<p>36. Concerning juveniles, Antigua and Barbuda was introducing a family court which 
would specialize in criminal behaviour and punishment of juveniles and also address all 
other family matters so that more speedy, more interactive and mediatory resolutions of 
family matters and offences against children would be expected.  
</p>
<p>37. The delegation also pointed out that, although Antigua and Barbuda had passed the 
Anti-Trafficking Act, it did not have problems of trafficking in persons. It passed that 
legislation in the light of its obligations towards the international community. After the 
Data Unit had been established within the Ministry of Legal Affairs, it would be more 
responsive to the adoption of various conventions and would ensure that they were part of 
its domestic legislation and that they could clearly be enforced in its local courts.  </p>


<p>38. Australia acknowledged the participation of Antigua and Barbuda, a small island 
State, in the universal periodic review process, which required considerable efforts, given 
limited resources. Australia welcomed the establishment of the National Committee on 
Social Indicators. It was concerned by reports of the use of excessive force by the police 
and welcomed action taken to introduce training for the police on international conventions. 
It noted reports on the declining situation of prison conditions and was concerned that the 
island retained the death penalty. Australia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>39. Germany<b> </b>inquired about the steps undertaken to reduce overcrowding in the prisons 
and guarantee an overall more humane prison regime. It referred to the vote against the 
General Assembly resolution on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty. Germany 
raised concern with the very low minimum age of criminal responsibility mentioning the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and UNICEF. Finally, it requested information on the 
evaluation made by Antigua and Barbuda and the measures taken to countervail children&#8217;s 
sexual exploitation. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Slovenia praised the Government for the improvement of the human rights situation 
and asked three questions. It inquired about the guarantee to enshrine the rights mentioned 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other major instruments since the island 
had a dualist legal system. It also requested information about the strategy undertaken by 
the Government to cope with child labour and violence against children. It asked about the 
intentions of the Government to overcome under-resourced education. Slovenia made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. Brazil was pleased to learn that substantive progress had been made to the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It welcomed initiatives undertaken to 
guarantee the permanence of children in school but noted that additional efforts were 
required to integrate children with disabilities into the regular education system. It 
commended Antigua and Barbuda for the establishment of an AIDS secretariat and for 
providing free antiretroviral drugs. It noted the lack of measures to increase women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>participation in political and public life, despite legal steps to prohibit gender 
discrimination. Brazil made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>42. The United States of America<b> </b>commended the passage of the Trafficking in Persons 
(Prevention) Act of 2010. It remained concerned, however, about the continued 
criminalization of homosexual conduct and the pervasive societal discrimination against 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. It stressed that the criminalization 
of homosexual conduct exacerbated homophobic attitudes and prevented LGBT persons 
from fully participating in society. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Spain recognized the efforts of Antigua and Barbuda in harmonizing its domestic 
legislation with its international commitments, as was the case of the ad hoc procedure for 
asylum requests. Spain made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>44. Indonesia commended the efforts of the Government to fulfil many aspects of the 
human rights of its citizens, including the rights of persons with disabilities and freedom of 
assembly and association, as well as through poverty alleviation. It also noted the positive 
efforts of the Government to ensure compliance of national legislation with that of the 
international human rights instruments it had ratified. Indonesia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>45. Maldives<b> </b>praised the commitment of Antigua and Barbuda to the protection and 
promotion of human rights. It inquired whether the Government would consider 
establishing a UPR standing committee chaired by the Prime Minister&#8217;s office that would 
facilitate better coordination and cooperation between the State functionaries in the follow 
up to the universal periodic review. It also inquired about the adverse effects posed by 
climate change on the enjoyment of human rights. In addition, Maldives mentioned </p>


<p>combating domestic violence and asked about the temporary special measures to encourage 
greater appreciation of women in political life. Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Uruguay commended the efforts of the Government in the fields of education, 
health, security, development and cultural recreation. It was concerned by the use of 
corporal punishment in the legal system as a penalty for certain crimes, in the home and in 
schools. It was also concerned by the absence of mechanisms and policies to prevent child 
abuse and neglect. It noted that several treaty bodies had advised the Government to request 
technical assistance to the United Nations in order to implement their recommendations. 
Uruguay made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>47. The delegation once again thanked States for their complementary remarks and 
recommendations that they had made. Concerning specialized schools for persons with 
disabilities, Antigua and Barbuda did have such schools established, fully funded by the 
Government, ensuring that various persons who taught there were fully trained. As regards 
the greater participation of women in political life, the speaker of the House of 
Representatives and President of the Senate were women, and there were two women 
ministers. Additionally, there was a very proactive women&#8217;s group called the Professional 
Organization of the Advancement of Women (POWA). The issue of women being part and 
parcel of the political process was a live debate. The political climate sometimes seemed to 
adversely affect the continued participation of women in the political process. The issue 
was, however, handled very openly, and Antigua and Barbuda would encourage and seek to 
ensure that more women were part and parcel of the process.  
</p>
<p>48. There was a certain amount of public acceptance of homosexual conduct, although 
generally in a silent way. Antigua and Barbuda, however, did not have a political mandate 
with respect to changing the law, notwithstanding the fact that enforcement of those laws 
was not actually sought. The Government would continue its efforts on education and 
information to ensure that the public opinion would in time adopt the international 
standards. 
</p>
<p>49. Excessive use of force and threats of violence by the police force was a very rare 
occurrence. Within the police force and also within civil society, bodies that monitored the 
complaints of that nature were established.  
</p>
<p>50. The delegation thanked Maldives for its willingness to share its experience in 
conducting consultative processes in the run-up to the universal periodic review. Antigua 
and Barbuda expected to have more active consultation, after its review, both with the 
public and stakeholders and various members of the Government under the directive of the 
Ministry of Legal Affairs, particularly a specially appointed unit. The delegation noted the 
suggestion that such a body or a committee should be headed or chaired by the Prime 
Minister&#8217;s Office to give it the necessary impetus and importance. 
</p>
<p>51. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland acknowledged the 
challenges faced in implementing the human rights obligations of Antigua and Barbuda. It 
welcomed the steps taken to address the issue of sexual violence such as training for police 
officers and nurse forensic examiners and encouraged the Government to seek ways to 
increase the number of cases that were successfully prosecuted. It raised concerns with the 
overcrowding in the prisons and encouraged Antigua and Barbuda to consider replacing the 
current prison facility with a new prison that would meet the United Nations standards. It 
promoted the culture of tolerance and inquired about the actions taken to put an end to 
discrimination against LGBT persons. The United Kingdom made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>52. Morocco welcomed the progress made in achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals and particularly on the implementation of the National Social Transformation Plan. It 
praised the establishment of the Office of the Mediator in 1995, the laws on the fight </p>


<p>against corruption and the freedom of the press, programmes for the protection of the child, 
assistance to the elderly and the fight against poverty. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Chile recognized that the country faced complex issues such as vulnerability to 
natural disasters and poverty. Thus, it valued the Government&#8217;s efforts to promote 
</p>
<p>democracy with social justice, good governance, social protection and education. It 
commended the law to prevent human trafficking. Chile noted the admission of the 
authorities of Antigua and Barbuda with regard to the impossibility of complying with the 
national report&#8217;s guidelines due to the lack of cooperation of public officers and was 
</p>
<p>confident that a solution was on the way. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>54. Latvia<b> </b>stressed that accommodation of special procedures mandate holders did not 
place significant burden on a country, even small ones, as exemplified by the number of 
small States that had issued a standing invitation. It highlighted that special procedures 
mandate holders were sensitive to the resource constraints of smaller States in the 
preparation of their visits. Latvia made a recommendation.

<p>55. Israel acknowledged that Antigua and Barbuda faced challenges, including debt 
burden and vulnerability to natural disasters. It applauded the efforts to implement the 
practice of good governance by enacting legislation to address public corruption. It also 
commended the integration of HIV/AIDS care in the public health infrastructure and 
initiatives to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and chronic diseases on a regional level. Israel 
encouraged Antigua and Barbuda to continue such efforts in the future. Israel made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>56. Mexico commended the country&#8217;s legislation in the areas of human trafficking and 
migrants smuggling. It also valued the programmes aimed at the social rehabilitation of 
prisoners and the prevention of juvenile delinquency. Mexico noted the persistence of some 
challenges. Mexico made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>57. Ecuador highlighted the efforts of Antigua and Barbuda in the fields of food 
security, sanitation, access to water, fight against poverty and education. It also commended 
the progress in the attention given to persons with disabilities and the development of 
awareness campaigns to end stigmatization and discrimination against this vulnerable 
group. Ecuador noted the commitment of the Government to comply with its international 
obligations through the harmonization of its domestic legislation. Ecuador made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>58. Barbados<b> </b>commended the sustained engagement of Antigua and Barbuda in the 
universal periodic review process. It viewed positively the creation of a National Poverty 
Reduction Strategy and the Social Transformation Plan. Barbados praised the steps taken to 
improve labour standards and promote gender equality, the rights of child, the elderly, 
persons with disabilities and those living and working with HIV/AIDS. It noted the 
legislative efforts made by the Government to combat public corruption and enhance access 
to information. It referred to the capacity constraints faced by the Government for the 
signature, ratification and reporting to the treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p>59. Nigeria<b> </b>noted the passage of the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention) Act and the 
legislation for the prevention of the smuggling of migrants. It praised the special attention 
paid by the Government to the welfare of persons with disabilities through the 
establishment of special schools and the provision of financial assistance for their special 
devices. It commended the achievement of free education at the primary and secondary 
level. Nigeria requested clarifications on the incorporation of the international human rights 
instruments into domestic laws.

<p>60. Argentina noted the efforts of Antigua and Barbuda to enhance the political 
participation of women and incorporate HIV/AIDS treatment in the National Strategic Plan </p>


<p>in order to improve the quality of life of the persons affected by this disease. Argentina 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>61. The delegation thanked the States for their encouragement and recommendations 
they had made and assured that its children were its future leaders and that it was 
committed to ensuring that they would receive best education and health opportunities, 
which included equal opportunities and good quality of life for children with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>62. The Government was committed to protecting all members of the society from 
discrimination, harassment and violence, regardless of their sexual orientation. The 
Government&#8217;s commitment to protecting all members of the society remained as strong as 
</p>
<p>ever.  
</p>
<p>63. With respect to death penalty, the delegation stated that the Court of Appeal 
indicated the rules and regulations in that regard and read an extract from the judgment of 
the then Chief Justice Sir Dennis Byron: &#8220;Rational and humane sentencing in accordance 
</p>
<p>with a requirement of due process requires individualized sentencing in imposing the death 
penalty. The sentencing discretion should be guided by legislative or judicially prescribed 
principles and standards and subject to an effective judicial review in order to ensure that 
the death penalty was imposed only in the most exceptional and appropriate circumstances. 
A procedure which provided no opportunity for personal mitigation of sentence before the 
imposition of a mandatory sentence was not reasonable or just or fair, and was therefore 
inconsistent with Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s constitutional provision.&#8221; In the light of that 
judgment, imposition of the death penalty would be guided by strict judicial directives and 
principles.  
</p>
<p>64. As to the criminal procedures, the delegation stated that it was endeavouring to 
ensure that persons in prison, awaiting trial, would not spend too long a time in there before 
the trials. Criminal trials had been earlier occurring three times a year. However, Antigua 
and Barbuda was introducing criminal trials throughout the whole year with one or two 
judges dedicated towards dealing with criminal trials. It had introduced legislation that 
abolished and replaced preliminary investigations in respect of indictable offences with 
paper committals to ensure speedy trials.  
</p>
<p>65. The delegation thanked Morocco for its assistance to educational opportunities and 
Barbados for the statement calling on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to work with Antigua and Barbuda, taking into consideration its capacity constraints. 
Antigua and Barbuda would welcome that opportunity and would certainly approach the 
High Commissioner in that regard.  
</p>
<p>66. The delegation thanked various delegations for constructive comments and 
expressions of support. It had taken careful note of all concerns and comments expressed. It 
reiterated that it had approached the review and recommendations in a very serious and 
realistic manner and considered that a number of short-, medium- and long-term objectives 
would have to be undertaken. Antigua and Barbuda would take necessary steps within its 
available resources towards fulfilling its international commitments, which would further 
enhance and reinforce the promotion and protection of human rights of its citizens and 
residents.  </p>
