<p><b>  23/6. 
Independence and impartiality of the judiciary, jurors and assessors, 
and the independence of lawyers 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and articles 2, 4, 9, 14 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
and bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the Basic 
Principles on the Role of Lawyers, the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, the 
Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct and the United Nations Principles and Guidelines 
on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also </i>all previous resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council, 
as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, on the 
independence and impartiality of the judiciary and on the integrity of the judicial system, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal 
profession, an objective and impartial prosecution able to perform its functions accordingly 
and the integrity of the judicial system are prerequisites for the protection of human rights 
and the application of the rule of law, and for ensuring fair trials and that there is no 
discrimination in the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that prosecutors should, in accordance with the law, perform their 
functions fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and 
uphold human rights, thus contributing to due process and the smooth functioning of the 
criminal justice system, 
</p>
<p>  
  &#8727; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report 
</p>
<p>of the Council on its twenty-third session (A/HRC/23/2), chap. I. 
 
</p>
<p>GE.13-14894 </p>


<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> the increasingly frequent attacks on the independence of 
judges, lawyers, prosecutors and court officials, in particular threats, intimidation and 
interference in the discharge of their professional functions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that every State should provide an effective framework of remedies to 
redress human rights grievances or violations and that the administration of justice, 
including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and, especially, an independent 
judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in 
international human rights instruments, is essential to the full and non-discriminatory 
realization of human rights and indispensable to the processes of democracy and 
sustainable development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> that it is essential to ensure that judges, prosecutors, lawyers and 
court officials possess the professional qualifications required for the performance of their 
functions through improved methods of recruitment and legal and professional training, and 
through the provision of all necessary means for the proper performance of their role in 
ensuring the rule of law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that judges, prosecutors and lawyers play a critical role in upholding 
human rights, including the absolute and non-derogable right of freedom from torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of bar associations, professional associations of judges 
and prosecutors, and non-governmental organizations in the defence of the principle of the 
independence of judges and lawyers, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the role that independent and effective national human rights institutions in 
accordance with the Paris Principles can and should play in strengthening the rule of law 
and in supporting the independence and integrity of the judicial system, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that legal aid is an essential element of a fair, humane and efficient 
system of administration of justice that is based on the rule of law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 17/2 of 6 July 2011 on the mandate of

</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to guarantee the independence of judges and lawyers

interference, harassment, threats or intimidation of any kind; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages</i> States to promote diversity in the composition of the members of

criteria, and guarantee the appointment of individuals of integrity and ability with 
appropriate training and qualifications in law; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> that the term of office of judges, their independence, security, 
adequate remuneration, conditions of service, pensions and the age of retirement should be 
adequately secured by law, and that the security of tenure of judges is an essential 
guarantee of the independence of the judiciary and that grounds for removal must be 
explicit with well-defined circumstances provided by law, involving reasons of incapacity 
</p>

observations and decisions of human rights mechanisms, such as treaty bodies and regional 
human rights courts; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Underscores</i> the importance for States to develop and implement an effective 
and sustainable legal aid system that is consistent with their international human rights 
obligations and takes into account relevant commitments and good practices, and to ensure

eligibility criteria and in accordance with international human rights law;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in

assistance and capacity-building, and the dissemination of best practices, including through

Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, when requested by the State concerned, 
with a view to establishing and strengthening the rule of law, paying particular attention to 
the administration of justice and the role of an independent and competent judiciary and 
legal profession; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Encourages</i> Governments that face difficulties in guaranteeing the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the objectivity and impartiality of prosecutors and 
their ability to perform their functions accordingly, or that are determined to take measures 
to implement these principles further to consult and to consider the services of the Special 
Rapporteur, for instance by inviting her to their country; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Encourages</i> Governments to give due consideration to recommendations 
made by United Nations human rights mechanisms addressing the independence and 
effectiveness of the judiciary and their effective implementation, and also invites the
