<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In this note the Special Rapporteur provides observations to assist with the 
development of laws and administrative measures to secure the rights of indigenous and 
tribal peoples in Suriname, in particular their rights over lands and natural resources. He 
offers these observations in accordance with his mandate from the United Nations Human 
Rights Council to &#8220;examine ways and means of overcoming existing obstacles to the full 
and effective protection of the rights of indigenous peoples [&#8230;] and to identify, exchange 
and promote best practices&#8221;, as well has his mandate to &#8220;develop a regular cooperative 
dialogue with all relevant actors [&#8230;] including on possibilities for technical cooperation at 
the request of Governments&#8221;.1 The Special Rapporteur hopes that the observations below 
are useful to Suriname as it advances measures to implement its international legal 
obligations concerning indigenous and tribal peoples, especially in light of binding 
decisions rendered by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>2. This note is provided in the context of a request by the Government of Suriname and 
its Ministry of Regional Development for technical and advisory assistance as it develops 
the legislative and administrative measures necessary to secure the territorial and other 
rights of the indigenous and tribal peoples of Suriname.2 The Special Rapporteur responded 
positively to this request and proposed that, as a preliminary step, he carry out a visit to the 
country to meet with relevant stakeholders regarding his possible assistance. The 
Government agreed to the visit, which was carried out from 13-16 March 2011. 
</p><p>3. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur met in Paramaribo with representatives of 
the Government, including the Vice President; the Ministers of Regional Development, 
Justice and Police, Foreign Affairs, Natural Resources, Physical Planning, and Labour, 
Technology and Environment, as well as participated in a joint meeting of the Council of 
Ministers. The Special Rapporteur also held meetings with the association of indigenous 
village leaders from each of the 35 indigenous villages in Suriname (Vereniging van 
Inheemse Dorpshoofden or &#8220;VIDS&#8221;), the Association of Saramaka authorities (Vereniging 
van Saramakaanse Gezagdragers or &#8220;VGS&#8221;), and other Maroon groups, including the 12 
Okanisi clan, the Matawai clan, the Paramakan community, and the Bureau Moiwana. 
Finally, the Special Rapporteur met with the United Nations country team and Resident 
Coordinator, and has been in contact with representatives of the Inter-American 
Development Bank since the visit regarding coordination on work related to indigenous and 
tribal lands in Suriname. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for all those that assisted in 
planning and coordinating logistics for the visit, in particular the Ministry of Regional 
Development and the United Nations country team in Suriname. 
4. The observations below include recommendations that build on the discussions 
during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Suriname. After a brief assessment of Suriname&#8217;s 
international legal obligations in relation to the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples, this 
note outlines a process for moving forward toward developing legislation and related 
administrative measures to secure these rights. The note also includes suggestions about the 
basic contents of the legislation, while emphasizing that this legislation should be the

<p>outcome of a participatory process, assisted by relevant international institutions, in which 
indigenous and tribal peoples are themselves involved.   
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>5. The Special Rapporteur anticipates that this note may be followed by further 
consultations with the Government and with indigenous and tribal peoples in Suriname, and 
he stands ready to provide additional comments and recommendations as progress is made 
toward adopting legislation to secure these peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Suriname&#8217;s international legal obligations concerning 
indigenous and tribal peoples 
</b></p>
<p>6. It should be noted by way of background that the indigenous peoples of Suriname 
include the following groups: Kali&#241;a (or Karinya or Carib); Lokono (or Arawak); 
Trio/Tareno and associated peoples; and Wayana.  In addition to these indigenous groups 
whose ancestors&#8217; presence predated European settlement in the continent, culturally distinct 
tribal peoples known generally as Maroons inhabit Suriname&#8217;s interior region. The 
Maroons, who are the descendants of African slaves who began arriving the area in the late 
1700s, include the following groups: Saamaka (or Saramaka); N&#8217;djuka (or Aucaner); 
Matawai; Kwinti; Paramaka; and Aluku (or Boni).  
</p><p>7. It is apparent that the Maroon tribal groups in Suriname have characteristics and 
human rights concerns similar to those of indigenous peoples, especially in regard to 
cultural and linguistic distinction and the existence of traditional authority and land tenure 
patterns. Given these similarities, the tribal and indigenous peoples of Suriname fall within 
a common set of international standards, as reflected in International Labour Organization 
(ILO) Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries.3 
Even though Suriname is not a party to ILO Convention No. 169, the Convention is 
indicative of the common responses and standards that have developed within the 
international arena to the common human rights concerns of indigenous and tribal peoples.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The American Convention on Human Rights and the Judgments of the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has specifically affirmed that, like 
indigenous peoples, the Maroon tribal peoples of Suriname have individual and collective 
rights, including collective rights over lands and natural resources, which are protected by 
the American Convention on Human Rights, a multilateral treaty to which Suriname is a 
party. The Inter-American Court has issued two judgments related to tribal peoples in 
Suriname, <i>Moiwana village v. Suriname</i>4 of 2005, and <i>Saramaka v. Suriname5</i> of 2007. In 
</p>
<p>  
 3 See Article 1 of Convention No. 169, which articulates the Convention&#8217;s scope of coverage:  &#8220;This Convention 
 applies  to:(a) tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them 
from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs 
or traditions or by special laws or regulations; (b) peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on 
 account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the 
 country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, 
 irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social,  economic, cultural and political institutions. 2. 
Self-identification as indigenous or tribal shall be regarded as a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to 
which the provisions of this Convention apply&#8221;. 
 4 Moiwana Village v. Suriname, Judgment of 15 June 2005, Inter-Am Ct. H.R., (Ser. C) No. 124 (2005).<b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.7 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>the case of <i>Moiwana village v. Suriname</i>, the Inter-American Court found Suriname 
responsible for the failure to investigate and punish those who had carried out the 1986 
massacre in which at least 39 Moiwana villagers were killed.6 The Court also found that 
Suriname had violated article 21 of the American Convention on Human Rights, which 
protects the right to property, and ordered that Suriname &#8220;adopt such legislative, 
administrative and other measures as are necessary to ensure the property rights of the 
members of the Moiwana community in relation to the traditional territories from which 
they were expelled, and provide for their use and enjoyment of those territories&#8221;.7 The 
Court ordered that these measures include the &#8220;creation of an effective mechanism for the 
delimitation, demarcation and titling of said traditional territories&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p>9. In the case of <i>Saramaka v. Suriname</i>, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
recognized the rights of the Maroon Saramaka communities to lands and resources on the 
basis of their traditional tenure, and affirmed that these rights are property protected by 
article 21 of the American Convention on Human Rights. Building upon its earlier 
jurisprudence9, the Court expounded on the elements and implications of the right to 
property in the context of indigenous and tribal peoples, and it ordered Suriname, among 
other measures, to &#8220;delimit, demarcate, and grant collective title over the territory of the 
members of the Saramaka people, in accordance with their customary laws, and through 
previous, effective and fully informed consultations with the Saramaka people, without 
prejudice to other tribal and indigenous communities&#8221;;10 and to &#8220;adopt, in its domestic 
legislation, and through prior, effective and fully informed consultations with the Saramaka 
people, legislative, administrative, and other measures as may be required to recognize, 
protect, guarantee and give legal effect to the right of the members of the Saramaka people 
to hold collective title of the territory they have traditionally used and occupied&#8221;.11  
10. The Court further ordered Suriname to &#8220;adopt legislative, administrative and other 
measures necessary to recognize and ensure the right of the Saramaka people to be 
effectively consulted, in accordance with their traditions and customs, or when necessary, 
the right to give or withhold their free, informed and prior consent, with regards to 
development or investment projects that may affect their territory&#8221;.12 Additionally, the 
Court ordered that the State &#8220;grant the members of the Saramaka people legal recognition 
of the collective juridical capacity, pertaining to the community to which they belong, with 
the purpose of ensuring the full exercise and enjoyment of their right to communal 
property, as well as collective access to justice, in accordance with their communal system, 
customary laws, and traditions&#8221;.13 
11. While there have been some advancements made in the implementation of the orders 
of the Inter-American Court, including the payment of the costs that the Court ordered be 
paid to the Saramaka communities, Suriname has not yet complied with the most

<p>substantive elements of the Court&#8217;s judgment, including those parts requiring the 
demarcation and titling of the Saramaka communities&#8217; lands and the development of a law 
or procedure to carry out that process. In its judgment the Court required that State must 
begin the process of delimitation, demarcation and titling of traditional Saramaka territory 
within three months from the notification of the judgment, and must complete this process 
within three years from such date, which lapsed in December 2010. It is imperative that 
Suriname take steps to fully implement the judgment of the Court, in order to avoid a 
prolonged condition of international illegality.   
</p>
<p>12. While the <i>Moiwana </i>and <i>Saramaka</i> judgments specifically concerned the tribal 
communities involved in those cases, it is beyond question that the principles affirming 
indigenous land and resource rights articulated by the Court on the basis of the American 
Convention of Human Rights apply generally to the indigenous and tribal peoples of 
Suriname. Hence, these judgments of the Inter-American Court imply international legal 
responsibility on the part of Suriname in regard to all the indigenous and tribal peoples of 
the country under the American Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Other International Instruments 
</b></p>
<p>13. Suriname&#8217;s obligation to secure the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples also 
arises under other international treaties to which it is a party, including the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),14 and the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Convention Against Discrimination).15 
In observations on Suriname, the Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance 
with the ICCPR, expressed concern over &#8220;the lack of legal recognition and guarantees for 
the protection of indigenous and tribal rights to land and other resources&#8221;, and stated that &#8220;it 
regrets that logging and mining concessions in many instances were granted without 
consulting or even informing indigenous and tribal groups, in particular the Maroon and 
Amerindian communities&#8221;.16 It recommended that Suriname guarantee the members of 
indigenous communities the full enjoyment of all the rights recognized by article 27 (rights 
of minorities) of the Covenant, and adopt specific legislation for this purpose.17 It also 
recommended that &#8220;[a] mechanism to allow for indigenous and tribal peoples to be 
consulted and to participate in decisions that affect them should be established&#8221;.18 
</p>
<p>  
 14 In regard to Article 27 (rights of minorities) of the ICCPR, the Human Rights Committee has stated &#8220;that culture 
manifests itself in many forms, including a particular way of life associated with the use of land resources, especially 
in the case of  indigenous peoples. [&#8230;] The enjoyment of those rights may require positive legal measures of 
protection and measures to  ensure the effective participation of members of minority communities in decisions 
which affect them&#8221;,  CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.5, para. 7 (1994). Also relevant is Article 1 of the Covenant, which 
states &#8220;All peoples have the right  of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their 
political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development&#8221;.  
 15 Interpreting the obligations of states under the Convention, the Committee on the Elimination of 
 Discrimination has called upon states to &#8220;recognize and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to 
own, develop, control and use their communal lands, territories and resources and, where they have 
been deprived of their lands and territories traditionally owned or otherwise inhabited or used without 
their free and informed consent, to take steps to return those lands and territories. Only when this is 
for factual reasons not     possible, the right to restitution should be substituted by the right to just, fair 
and prompt compensation. Such compensation should as far as possible take the form of lands and 
territories&#8221; A/52/18, annex V, para. 5.

</p>
<p>14. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in review of 
Suriname&#8217;s compliance with the Convention Against Discrimination, has urged the 
Government to &#8220;[e]nsure legal acknowledgement of the rights of indigenous and tribal 
peoples to possess, develop, control and use their communal lands and to participate in the 
exploitation, management and conservation of the associated natural resources; [and] strive 
to reach agreements with the peoples concerned, as far as possible, before awarding any 
concessions&#8221;.19 In this connection, in its most recent report on Suriname, the Committee 
welcomed information provided by the Government in 2008 that it had requested technical 
assistance of the Special Rapporteur towards this end, noting that it &#8220;encourages continuing 
dialogue and collaboration with the Special Rapporteur [&#8230;] regarding technical support for 
a draft framework law on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights&#8221;.20 
</p><p>15. Adding to the forgoing is the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, which summarizes and elaborates upon standards that have been 
recognized elsewhere in international instruments and decisions. The Declaration, which 
was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007 with the affirmative vote of 
Suriname, represents a broad international consensus about the content of the rights of 
indigenous peoples and, by implication, of tribal peoples as well.  
</p>
<p>16. The Declaration provides extensive recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; individual 
and collective rights under the overarching thrust of the human rights to equality and self-
determination. It affirms a number of rights in areas of special significance to indigenous 
peoples, such as rights to self-government and participation, including consultation and 
consent; cultural and spiritual heritage; lands, territories and natural resources; and 
development and social services. Specifically in relation to the rights of indigenous and 
tribal peoples to lands and resources, the Declaration affirms that &#8220;Indigenous peoples have 
the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they 
possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or use, as well as 
those which they have otherwise acquired&#8221;.21 The Declaration requires States to &#8220;give legal 
recognition and protection to these lands, territories and resources. Such recognition shall 
be conducted with due respect to the customs, traditions and land tenure systems of the 
indigenous peoples concerned&#8221;.22 
</p>
<p><b> III. Recommendations regarding the development of domestic 
legislation to protect the rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>17. It is evident from the foregoing that Suriname must adopt measures to secure the 
rights of indigenous and tribal peoples, and that these measures should comply with 
international standards and the legally binding judgments of the Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights. The Special Rapporteur is pleased that the Government has expressed its 
commitment to developing new legislation in this area of concern and to implementing the 
Court&#8217;s judgments, and that it has taken some initial steps toward that end.  
</p><p>18. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the proposal of indigenous representatives, 
which he understands has been accepted by the Government, to have a framework law that 
broadly addresses indigenous and tribal peoples and their rights, which would include or be 
accompanied by specific legislative provisions or regulations regarding land and resources.

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>In this section of the note the Special Rapporteur first offers observations and 
recommendations regarding the process toward adopting such legislation, and then he 
makes suggestions about the contents of the legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  The process forward 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The need for consultations with indigenous and tribal peoples </b> 19. Any legislation or administrative regulation to secure the rights of indigenous and 
tribal peoples in the country should be the outcome of a process involving adequate 
consultations with these peoples. As stated by the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, &#8220;States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples 
concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior 
and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative 
measures that may affect them&#8221;.23 In its judgment in the <i>Saramaka </i>case, the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights emphasized the need for consultation with indigenous 
and tribal peoples on development projects within or affecting their traditional lands. It is 
clear that consultations with these peoples, through procedures meeting certain minimum 
criteria, are also required in the drafting and adoption of legislation or administrative 
regulations that concern them.  
20. While there is not one specific formula for carrying out consultations with 
indigenous peoples that applies to all countries and in all circumstances, the basic elements 
that consultation procedures should include have been described with some level of 
specificity by various international bodies, including the International Labour Organisation; 
regional human rights institutions, especially the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights; and United Nations treaty 
monitoring bodies. The Special Rapporteur provided an overview of these principles in his 
2009 annual report24 and in his report on the process of consultation in connection with 
constitutional reforms in Chile.25 These required elements of consultations include that they 
must: be distinct from consultations that may involve the general public or ordinary 
political processes; take place at the earliest possible stage; be a genuine dialogue and more 
than just the provision of information; be in good faith with the objective of obtaining 
agreement or consent; be carried out with due regard for indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional 
decision-making institutions in the appropriate languages; provide the time necessary for 
the indigenous peoples to make decisions, taking into account their customary ways of 
decision-making; and provide information sufficient to allow indigenous peoples to make 
decisions that are informed. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Formation of a joint commission or other platform for consultations on new 
legislation 
</b>21. Keeping these basic elements in mind, some formally structured platform and 
corresponding procedure should be established to advance the consultations with 
indigenous and tribal peoples on the development of legislation and any related measures to 
secure their rights. A proposal that arose in the context of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
discussions during his visit to Suriname was the formation of a joint commission, made up 
of both Government representatives and representatives of indigenous and tribal peoples,

<p>with adequate financial and technical support, to collaboratively develop a text that is 
agreeable to the Government and indigenous and tribal representatives alike. 
</p><p>22. Indigenous and tribal peoples should be permitted to name their own representatives 
to such a joint commission. In this connection, indigenous and tribal peoples should, in 
order to avoid confusion or slow down the process, propose individuals to represent them in 
the joint commission in accordance with their traditional decision-making procedures. This 
has already been contemplated by indigenous and Maroon communities in a resolution 
adopted unanimously at the 2006 Diitabiki meeting of indigenous and tribal chiefs in 
Suriname.26 At that meeting it was agreed that indigenous and tribal groups would form a 
delegation of indigenous and Maroon peoples tasked with &#8220;conduct[ing] talks and 
negotiations on behalf of the interior [peoples], with institutions eligible for that and the 
further elaboration of measures concerning Land Rights of Indigenous and tribal peoples in 
Suriname&#8221;.27 Further, the Government should allow the indigenous representatives to be 
counseled independently by their own legal experts or technical advisers. 
</p>
<p>23. Other countries in the region have used specially constituted commissions to assist 
in the development of laws to secure indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, particularly land and 
resource rights. For example, in order to assist with the development of a demarcation and 
titling law for the indigenous peoples of the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua, a &#8220;Coordinating 
Commission on Territorial Demarcation (CCDT)&#8221; was formed. The Coordinating 
Commission was made up of indigenous leaders, as well as representatives from indigenous 
universities and non-governmental organizations. Over a period of several months the 
commission met with the &#8220;Committee on Ethnic and Indigenous Affairs&#8221; of the National 
Assembly (the country&#8217;s legislative body) to discuss a draft demarcation law, which was 
eventually presented to the National Assembly and adopted. Also attending the meetings of 
the commission were a representative of the Proyecto de Ordenamiento de la Propiedad 
(PRODEP), the World Bank&#8217;s Land Administration Project in Nicaragua, and the Adviser 
for the Atlantic Coast to then President Enrique Bola&#241;os. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Mandate of the joint commission 
</b>24. As its first task, a joint commission of the kind suggested should establish an 
agreed-upon timetable, as well as clear and measurable benchmarks by which progress for 
development of the relevant legislation and any related regulatory measures may be 
assessed. These benchmarks should relate to the development of the specific documents to 
be drafted, including the draft text of the proposed framework law and drafts of any 
supplemental legislation or regulation regarding, in particular, a procedure for demarcating 
and titling of indigenous and tribal lands, and a procedure to follow for consultations with 
indigenous and tribal peoples on resource extraction and other activities affecting their 
lands and resources (see paras. 29-38, infra, on the framework law and supplemental 
legislation). The joint commission also should be tasked with reviewing relevant 
constitutional provisions and existing laws, policies and natural resource concessions, and 
should propose any amendments necessary to harmonize these with the new legislation 
being developed to secure indigenous and tribal peoples&#8217; right (see paras. 39-40, infra). 
25. Once draft legislation and possibly also administrative regulations have been 
developed by the joint commission, the commission or the Government, through the 
relevant ministry such as the Ministry of Regional Development, should carry out a 
consultation process with the broader indigenous and tribal communities. This consultation

<p>process should itself be in line with relevant international standards.28 At the conclusion of 
the community-level consultations, the commission would finalize any revisions to the draft 
texts that followed from those consultations. The final phase of the process would be 
submission of the draft text or texts to the Government and parliamentary authorities for 
their consideration and final action. Provision should be made for indigenous peoples to be 
consulted in this final stage through special legislative arrangements. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Technical and financial assistance by international experts and institutions </b> 26. In order to generate confidence in the process of developing laws to secure 
indigenous and tribal peoples&#8217; rights to lands and resources and related rights, and to ensure 
that this process is carried out in accordance with relevant international standards, it is 
advisable to involve international experts and international institutions in the process, as the 
Government has already done by requesting the technical assistance of the Special 
Rapporteur. Furthermore, once a joint commission or other platform for consultations is 
formed, the Special Rapporteur is willing to provide more specific comments or input on 
the draft laws or administrative procedures to be developed. 
</p>
<p>27. Apart from whatever further involvement he may have, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government seek the assistance of the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights to help facilitate and orient initial negotiations. The Inter-American 
Commission has played an important role in taking the <i>Moiwana</i> and <i>Saramaka</i> cases to the 
Inter-American Court, and has on ongoing role in to play in the full implementation of the 
Court&#8217;s judgments in those cases. Additionally, the Commission has a mandate under the 
American Convention on Human Rights &#8220;to respond, through the General Secretariat of the 
Organization of American States, to inquiries made by the member states on matters related 
to human rights and, within the limits of its possibilities, to provide those states with the 
advisory services they request&#8221;.29  Technical advisory assistance could also be sought from 
other international institutions, such as the United Nations Development Programme, 
International Labor Organization, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development 
Bank (IDB). Such support has been invaluable in the experience of other countries, 
especially during the phases of implementation of the process of demarcating and titling 
indigenous lands. For example, in Nicaragua, the Proyecto de Ordenamiento de la 
Propiedad (PRODEP), the World Bank&#8217;s Land Administration Project in Nicaragua, has 
provided important financial and technical assistance for the demarcation of Miskito and 
Mayagna lands on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. That effort has, so far, resulted in the 
demarcation and titling of nine indigenous territories, spanning more than 10,000 km2.30 
28. Furthermore, in order to ensure adequate financing and technical assistance for the 
process of developing legislation, the Government should seek funding from external 
sources such as the World Bank or the IDB. In this connection, the Government should 
include in its proposed country strategy with the IDB&#8212;which the Special Rapporteur 
understands is currently being developed&#8212;support for the process of developing a law or

<p>laws to secure indigenous and tribal peoples&#8217; rights, including land and resource rights. 
Other countries have similarly relied on the assistance of multi-lateral lending agencies for 
developing and implementing laws and policies to secure indigenous and tribal land rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  The legislation to be developed and its basic content 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The 2005 draft proposal: a starting point for the discussions 
</b>29. The Special Rapporteur is aware that efforts to draft a framework law on the rights 
of indigenous and tribal peoples have already been underway, and takes note particularly of 
the efforts of indigenous and tribal organizations in this regard. The Special Rapporteur 
finds especially interesting the &#8220;Proposal for legal provisions recognizing indigenous and 
tribal peoples&#8217; rights in the laws of Suriname&#8221; 31, which was developed in 2005 by 
indigenous and tribal leaders and their advisers. This proposal was supported in the 2006 
Diitabiki resolution, the resolution adopted unanimously during the 2006 meeting of all 
indigenous and tribal chiefs. This 2005 proposal, which is appended to this report, would be 
a useful starting point for the discussions within a joint commission or other appropriate 
platform for consultations on legislation to secure the rights of indigenous and tribal 
peoples, given both the substantive content of the draft and its origins in indigenous 
peoples&#8217; own deliberative and internal consultation processes.  
30. The 2005 proposal includes draft amendments to the Constitution of Suriname and a 
draft &#8220;Organic Law on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples&#8221;. Building upon the 
draft constitutional amendments, the draft organic law contains general provisions related 
to the rights of indigenous and Maroon peoples in its Chapter I, including provisions 
recognizing the rights of indigenous and Maroon peoples to non-discrimination and equal 
protection (art. 1); juridical personality and access to remedies (art. 2); indigenous and 
tribal identity and participation in national affairs (art. 3); self-determination and security 
over means of subsistence (art. 4); indigenous and tribal development (art. 5); and linguistic 
and cultural rights (art. 6). The draft law&#8217;s Chapter II provides protections for the right of 
indigenous and Maroon peoples in Suriname to regulation and control over internal affairs 
(art. 7), and Chapter III concerns indigenous and tribal peoples&#8217; &#8220;Rights to Traditional 
Lands, Territories, and Resources&#8221;. The final substantive chapter relates to indigenous and 
tribal peoples&#8217; rights to health and education.  
</p>
<p>31. A second draft text for a framework law was developed by the indigenous 
organization VIDS more recently, and during his visit the Special Rapporteur was informed 
that this draft has been presented to the Ministry of Regional Development for its 
consideration. In large part this draft mirrors the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, this second draft framework 
law is an important initiative towards the advancement of the rights of indigenous and 
Maroon people in Suriname. It would certainly be a significant accomplishment if 
Suriname were to adopt a law that enshrines the principles of the Declaration into the 
country&#8217;s internal law, and this would set a good example for the Latin American and 
Caribbean region. However, standing alone this draft may be too general to provide the 
guidance on indigenous and tribal land rights needed in the country.  
</p>
<p>32. In the view of the Special Rapporteur it is preferable that Suriname proceed as a 
matter of priority to develop a framework law that is more practically oriented and closely 
linked to the reality in the country, such as the 2005 proposed organic law, which is 
</p>
<p>  
31 Attached as Appendix B. <i>Editorial note &#8211; appendices have not been included with the present 
version of this report, although they were transmitted to the Government in April 2011.</i> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>appended hereto. In addition to being more relevant to the specific context in Suriname, the 
2005 draft has an important degree of legitimacy, given that it was adopted by way of 
resolution during a high level meeting of indigenous and tribal representatives. Thus, the 
appended 2005 proposal provides the best place to begin negotiations, in the view of the 
Special Rapporteur. If indigenous and tribal communities or others feel that it is necessary 
or desirable to refer specifically to rights enshrined in the Declaration, the framework law 
could incorporate the provision of the Declaration by reference in a preamble or 
preliminary article. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Other laws or regulations to be developed 
</b>33. As indicated above, the appended 2005 draft organic law provides recognition of 
indigenous and tribal peoples&#8217; rights over a range of matters. Additionally, it includes 
provisions that would mandate subsidiary legislation for implementing indigenous and 
tribal regulation and control over internal affairs (art. 10), demarcation and titling of 
indigenous lands (art. 11(5)), consultations with indigenous and tribal peoples over 
development projects affecting them (art. 13(2)(a)(i)), impact studies for such projects (art. 
13(2)(b)(i)), and special measures to protect cultural heritage and traditional knowledge 
(art. 14(4)). An alternative to subsidiary legislation on these matters would be to amplify 
the framework legislation or organic law to include in that same law the needed 
supplemental protections, either in separate chapters or sub-chapters, or in schedules to the 
law. Consideration should also be given to providing the supplemental protections through 
regulations to be adopted by the relevant ministries or executive authority.   
34. In any case, the Special Rapporteur is agreement that, in whatever form, legislative 
provisions or regulations should be developed that would provide adequately specific and 
concrete protections and procedures to secure the rights recognized in a framework law. As 
with the framework law, such supplemental legislation or regulations should be developed 
by the joint commission or other appropriate platform established for consultations with 
indigenous and tribal peoples.  
35. In light of the <i>Moiwana </i>and <i>Saramaka </i>judgments, the Special Rapporteur is of the 
opinion that priority should be placed on developing specific legal provisions for (1) a 
procedure to identify and title indigenous and tribal lands; and (2) a procedure to follow for 
consulting with and seeking consent of indigenous and tribal peoples for resource 
extraction and other activities affecting their lands and resources. The following comments 
are offered to help orient the discussions in this regard. 
</p>
<p><i>  Land titling procedure 
</i>36. The fundamental goal of a land titling procedure is to provide security for land and 
resource rights in accordance with indigenous and tribal peoples&#8217; own customary laws and 
traditional land and resource tenure. There is some flexibility in how the demarcation and 
titling procedure could be developed; and the specific procedures should be sorted out in 
the relevant negotiations and in consultation with indigenous and tribal peoples. It could be 
expected, nonetheless, that the procedure for land demarcation and titling would contain, at 
a minimum, the following components: (a) identification of the area and rights that 
correspond to the indigenous or tribal community, or group of communities, under 
consideration; (b) resolution of conflicts over competing uses and claims; (c) delimitation 
and demarcation; and (d) issuance of title deed or other appropriate document that clearly 
describes the nature of the right or rights in lands and resources. In order to assist with the 
demarcation and titling process, it may be helpful to form a land commission, either within </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>or independent from an existing appropriate ministry, with a specific mandate to facilitate 
the securing of indigenous and tribal land rand resource rights.32 
</p>
<p><i>  Consultation procedure 
</i>37. In addition to putting in place an adequate land titling procedure, it is necessary to 
have clarity on the steps and specific responsibilities of the Government and third parties 
for consultations with indigenous and tribal peoples in relation to development and other 
activities affecting their lands. It is important to note that neither international law as 
applicable to indigenous and tribal peoples generally, nor the judgments of the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights that apply specifically to groups in Suriname, preclude 
development projects on or affecting indigenous and tribal lands or territories. What is 
required, however, is that such projects fully respect the rights of indigenous and tribal 
peoples within their territories and that, when implemented by Government or third parties, 
the projects follow certain overarching standards of consultation and free, prior and 
informed consent. Again, no one formula exists for adherence to the relevant standards, and 
hence the consultation procedure to be adopted for development projects affecting 
indigenous and tribal lands or territories in Suriname could be developed in various ways. 
As noted earlier, the Special Rapporteur provided an exposition of the international 
standards regarding consultation and consent in his annual report to the United Nations 
Human Rights Council.33 Recall the very succinct summary of the relevant criteria in 
paragraph 20 above. 
38. The Special Rapporteur is willing to give more concrete orientation on specific 
elements to incorporate into the land titling and consultation procedures, once a joint 
commission or other structured mechanism has been put in place to advance with 
discussions with indigenous and tribal peoples on the development of legislation and 
related measures to secure their rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Harmonizing the Constitution and existing laws and policies  
</b>39. Finally, it will be necessary for the Government to review existing laws and the 
Constitution to ensure their consistency with the protections for indigenous and tribal 
peoples to be enacted. This was required by the Inter-American Court in the <i>Saramaka</i> 
decision, which ordered that Suriname to &#8220;remove or amend the legal provisions that 
impede protection of the right to property of the members of the Saramaka people&#8221;.34 
Proposed amendments to the Constitution are included in the appended 2005 proposal. In 
addition to possible amendments to the Constitution, the process of harmonizing existing 
legal provisions with indigenous and tribal rights may include revisions of the Mining 
Decree of 1986 (and the draft revised Mining Act of 2004), the Forest Management Act of 
1992, and legislation concerning national parks and protected areas, among other laws to be 
identified. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the joint commission or other 
appropriate platform established for consultations with indigenous and tribal peoples be 
tasked with identifying the laws and policies that will need to be amended, as well as with 
developing amendments to propose to the relevant government authorities. Indigenous and 
tribal people should be consulted in this process to ensure that appropriate and satisfactory 
arrangements are made.  
</p>
<p>  
32 Such was the approach under Nicaragua&#8217;s Law 445, which established the administrative bodies 
responsible for titling communal lands: the National Commission for Demarcation and Titling 
(&#8216;CONADETI&#8217;) and three &#8216;intersectoral&#8217; commissions of demarcation and titling (&#8217;CIDT&#8217;). 
</p>

34 Saramaka, para. 214(7). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>40. There should also be a review of existing concessions and other third party interests 
in lands to be demarcated and titled in favor of indigenous and tribal peoples, as required by 
the Inter-American Court in the <i>Saramaka</i> case.35 Furthermore, in order to avoid further 
complications of the land tenure situation and minimize the possibility that indigenous and 
tribal land rights may be violated, it is advisable that no new concessions be issued within 
the lands used and occupied by indigenous and tribal peoples until their rights can be 
clarified and protected, and unless pursuant to the affected groups&#8217; free, prior and informed 
consent. This limitation on new concessions is currently required within the Saramaka 
territory under the judgment of the Inter-American Court, which ordered that &#8220;[u]ntil [the] 
delimitation, demarcation, and titling of the Saramaka territory has been carried out, 
Suriname must abstain from acts which might lead the agents of the State itself, or third 
parties acting with its acquiescence or its tolerance, to affect the existence, value, use or 
enjoyment of the territory to which the members of the Saramaka people are entitled, unless 
the State obtains the free, informed and prior consent of the Saramaka people&#8221;.36   
</p>
<p><b>  IV.  Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Suriname and the 
indigenous and tribal peoples of the country for the opportunity to provide comments on the 
steps that, in his view, are essential to moving forward with securing the rights of 
indigenous and tribal peoples to lands and resources, and related rights. As has been 
highlighted throughout this document, at this stage, the Special Rapporteur is convinced 
that it necessary for the Government to establish a clear, workable process to develop the 
laws and administrative measures needed to comply with its legal obligations. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the opportunity to maintain a continued dialogue with the 
Government of Suriname and indigenous and tribal organizations in the country, and to 
provide further technical and advisory assistance as necessary in the implementation of the 
foregoing recommendations.
