figures are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.  For the second quarter of 2016 Alexco recorded net income of $152,000 or $0.00 per
share, including $0.9 million in depreciation and share-based compensation costs offset by an unrealized gain of $1.5 million on warrants held as an

Second Quarter Highlights
Strong cash position with cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 of $18.1 million and net working capital of $26 million compared to $8.1 million and
·
$12.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015.
Under-budget and ahead of schedule with planned 8,000 meter surface exploration diamond drill program at its Bermingham deposit in the Keno Hill
District. The Company has expanded this program by 6,000 meters to approximately 14,000 meters for an estimated additional cost of $0.7 million. As of
·
August 10, 2016, Alexco has completed 25 holes for a total of 7,708 meters. The drilling program is expected to be completed by early October with results
for the complete program expected to be available by the end of October 2016 with interim drill results expected to be available mid-September.
On May 17, 2016, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement of units of the Company ("Units") at a price of $1.20 per Unit pursuant to which
the Company issued 10,839,972 Units for aggregate gross proceeds of $13,007,966. Each unit consisted of one common share and one-half of one non-
·
transferable warrant, each whole such warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional common share of the Company at a price of $1.75 per share
for a period of 24 months following the date of issuance.
During the second quarter 770,800 warrants were exercised for proceeds of $1 million. Subsequent to quarter end, a further 2,433,575 warrants were
·
exercised for additional proceeds of $3.4 million further improving the Company's cash position.
Alexco's President and Chief Executive Officer Clynt Nauman said, "In the second quarter we commenced the surface drill program at our high grade
Bermingham discovery and, due to improved efficiencies and other factors, we increased the drill program from 8,000 meters to approximately 14,000
meters while also adding an additional drill to ensure work is complete by early October, 2016. Elsewhere at Keno Hill we have initiated a mill assessment
and maintenance program and commenced work to prepare for the installation of the Flame & Moth underground portal, expected to be completed by the
end of the third quarter. Clearly, we are encouraged by the continued strength of the silver markets and, pending results of our Bermingham drilling program
we will be well positioned to consider redevelopment options at Keno Hill."

Alexco Environmental Group
AEG recorded revenues of $2.8 million and a gross profit of $0.7 million, compared to revenue of $2.6 million and a gross profit of $0.6 million in the second
quarter of 2016.  The increase in gross profit from the prior period is mainly attributed to improved employee utilization in the fee-for-service business.
At the Gold King Project in southern Colorado, the US Environmental Protection Agency has recently extended the Interim Water Treatment Plant (IWTP)
operations contract with AEG to the end of September 2016, as well as authorized an interim expansion of the plant to approximately double the treatment
capacity of the IWTP. Construction related to this expansion is complete.
Mr. Nauman said, "Our fee for service business in Canada continues a steady trend in profitability. Additionally, project and turnkey work in the US
increased in the second quarter as anticipated, and we expect increasing contribution from US business over the balance of the year."
Keno Hill Exploration
The Company originally planned an exploration program of 8,000 meters and has now expanded the program to approximately 14,000 meters of surface
diamond drilling to follow up on the identification in 2015 and 2014 of high grade silver results at the Bermingham prospect. The expanded exploration
program is budgeted to cost approximately $3.3 million and is primarily funded by way of the $3 million flow through funds that were raised in December
2015. The surface drilling program is expected to be complete in early October 2016. The Company will also expend additional funds to gather important
geotechnical and hydrogeological information, as well as undertake a preliminary metallurgical program to test the Bermingham mineralization.  As at
August 10, 2016, Alexco drilled 25 holes for a total of 7,708 meters at Bermingham. Drill results for the complete program are expected to be available by the
end of October 2016 with interim drill results expected to be available mid-September.
The drill objectives are to infill and expand the previously identified high grade silver zone at Bermingham at sufficient drill density to permit resource
estimation, and to explore up and down plunge for possible extensions to other favourable structural and stratigraphic positions in which additional mineral
deposition may have occurred.

Keno Hill Silver District PEA
The Company plans to provide an updated National Instrument 43-101 compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") for its 100% owned Keno Hill
Silver District in the fourth quarter of 2016 which will incorporate the re-engineering and optimization of the mine plan along with an updated mineral
resource estimate for the Bermingham deposit.
In February 2016 the Company received the amended Quartz Mining Licence for the Flame & Moth deposit, and expects a Water Use Licence amendment
hearing to occur in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Keno Hill Development Update
The Company initiated a mill assessment and maintenance program in the second quarter of 2016. Mechanical assessment and maintenance of equipment
is part of the routine process of maintaining the crushing and milling equipment assets in a condition where resumption of processing operations can be
initiated if warranted.
In July the Company commenced work in preparation for the installation of an underground portal at the Flame & Moth mine along with establishing the
necessary surface infrastructure to drive the first 20 meters of the production ramp. This will allow resumption of development activities to begin at full scale
in the future. This ramp will ultimately be driven approximately 750 meters to the upper production levels of the Flame & Moth silver deposit. Based on prior
work (see the December 10, 2014, Alexco Resource Corp. PEA Technical Report entitled "Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Eastern
Keno Hill Silver Project - Phase 2, Yukon Canada"), the Flame & Moth deposit has approximately 585,000 tonnes of potentially mineable material grading
693 g/t silver, 2.19% Pb, 5.35% Zn and 0.52 g/t gold.
Financial
Alexco's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 totaled $18.1 million compared to $8.1 million at December 31, 2015, while net working capital totaled
$26 million compared to $12.2 million for the same dates.  With its cash resources and net working capital on hand at June 30, 2016, Alexco anticipates it
will have sufficient capital resources to carry out all of its currently-anticipated exploration and development programs, environmental services business and
corporate offices and administration as planned for 2016 and 2017.

Governance Committee. Ms. Sanders is Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary of NovaCopper Inc. and has more than 20 years of experience in

About Alexco
Alexco Resource Corp. owns substantially all of the historical Keno Hill Silver District located in Canada's Yukon Territory, including the Bellekeno silver
mine, the Flame & Moth, Lucky Queen, Bermingham and Onek deposits, and other historic and surface resources within the district. Bellekeno, which
commenced commercial production at the beginning of calendar year 2011, was Canada's only operating primary silver mine from 2011 to 2013. Alexco is
currently undergoing an interim suspension of operations at Keno Hill in order to decrease costs and reposition the district for long-term, sustainable
operations. Between 1921 and 1988, the Keno Hill Silver District was a world-class silver producer, with more than 217 million ounces of silver produced at
average grades of 40.5 ounces per ton silver, 5.6% lead and 3.1% zinc (Yukon Government's Minfile database). These historical production grades would
rank Keno Hill in the top 3% by grade of today's global silver producers. Employing a unique business model, Alexco also provides mine-related
environmental services, remediation technologies and reclamation and mine closure services to both government and industry clients through the Alexco
Environmental Group, its wholly-owned environmental services division.
