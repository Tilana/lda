<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report on human rights and transitional justice is submitted pursuant to 
resolution 12/11 of the Human Rights Council. The report contains an update of the 
activities undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in the context of transitional justice, including by the human rights 
components of peace missions. OHCHR has actively supported transitional justice 
programmes in more than 20 countries worldwide. OHCHR provides conceptual and 
analytical support, advice and assistance in the design and implementation of transitional 
justice processes from a human rights perspective, as well as capacity building and 
partnership with multiple national and international actors. This support is provided 
through dedicated programmes at headquarters as well as country level.   
</p>
<p> The report also includes an analysis of the relationship between disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration (DDR) and transitional justice, prepared in consultation 
with the United Nations Development Programme, the Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations and other stakeholders. In 2009, the Inter-Agency Working Group on DDR  
published the module, &#8220;Transitional Justice and DDR&#8221; as part of the Integrated 
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Standards. The report also draws on 
discussions held during the Expert Workshop on Maximizing Opportunities for 
Coordination between DDR Initiatives and Transitional Justice Processes, organized by 
OHCHR in Geneva in December 2010. DDR and transitional justice processes are 
interrelated and coordination between the two efforts is essential to facilitate their 
coherence and mutual reinforcement.  Establishing reparations for victims in conjunction 
with DDR programmes for ex-combatants may mitigate the perception of inequity in their 
respective treatment and foster reintegration. The enhanced understanding of the 
</p>

<p>connections between DDR and transitional justice should contribute to increased 
coordination between DDR and transitional justice practitioners.

<p><b> I.  Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 12/11, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to submit a report containing an 
update of the activities undertaken by the Office in the context of transitional justice, 
including by the human rights components of peace missions, as well as an analysis of the 
relationship between disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and transitional 
justice, in consultation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other relevant parts of the United Nations 
system, civil society, States and other stakeholders (para. 21).   
</p>
<p>2. The present report, submitted in accordance with the above-mentioned request, 
provides an overview of key transitional justice activities of OHCHR, including the human 
rights components of peace missions since 2009 (see A/HRC/12/18).<b> </b>The report also 
analyses the relationship between disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) 
and transitional justice. On 8 and 9 December 2010, OHCHR organized in Geneva the 
Expert Workshop on Maximizing Opportunities for Coordination between DDR Initiatives 
and Transitional Justice Processes. The discussions of the workshop are reflected in the 
present report, which also takes account of contributions received from the Governments of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, France, Finland, Guatemala, Lebanon, Mauritania, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as 
from UNDP, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime, and the International Center for Transitional Justice.1   
</p>
<p><b> II. Transitional justice activities of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Office of the High Commissioner has been supporting transitional justice 
programmes in more than 20 countries worldwide, including engaging in the design and 
implementation of inclusive national consultations; supporting the establishment of truth-
seeking processes, judicial accountability mechanisms, and reparations programmes; 
enhancing institutional reform; and ensuring that human rights and transitional justice 
considerations are reflected in peace agreements. OHCHR provides dedicated transitional 
justice programmes at the country level; conceptual and policy support at headquarters; and 
partnerships with multiple actors, including national authorities, national human rights 
institutions, civil society and other United Nations departments and agencies.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Enhancing the understanding of transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>4. In decision No. 2006/47 on the rule of law, the Secretary-General designated 
OHCHR as the lead entity within the United Nations system for transitional justice.2 As 
such, OHCHR is responsible for policy development, standard setting, substantive 
guidance, capacity building, and coordination with United Nations and other actors on 
transitional justice issues. In its resolution 12/11 of 2010, the Human Rights Council 
requested OHCHR &#8220;to continue to enhance its leading role within the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The full text of the contributions is available from the secretariat. 
 2 This includes national consultative processes; truth and reconciliation mechanisms; reparations; 
</p>
<p>vetting processes; ad hoc investigations; fact finding; and commissions of inquiry. OHCHR and the 
Office of Legal Affairs jointly lead on the development of international and hybrid tribunals.   </p>


<p>including with regard to conceptual and analytical work regarding transitional justice, and 
to assist States, with their consent, to design, establish and implement transitional justice 
mechanisms from a human rights perspective&#8221; (para. 20). 
</p>
<p>5. In order to build the long-term institutional capacity of United Nations field 
presences, transitional administrations and civil society to respond to transitional justice 
demands, OHCHR has been producing the <i>Rule-of-Law Tools for Post-Conflict States</i>.3  
The tools are grounded in international human rights law and contain lessons learned and 
best practices from United Nations field operations. In 2010, OHCHR published the Tool 
on National consultations on transitional justice, emphasizing that a comprehensive process 
of national consultations is a crucial element for effective and sustainable transitional 
justice strategies. It identifies the main applicable human rights instruments, discusses the 
focus and form of consultations and considers various issues important for their conduct, as 
well as reporting and follow-up. 
</p>
<p>6. OHCHR also led the process of elaboration of the Guidance note of the Secretary-
General: United Nations approach to transitional justice, published in March 2010. The 
guidance note provides a rights-based perspective on transitional justice and offers three 
approaches for further strengthening the transitional justice activities of the United Nations, 
including: (1) striving to take into account the root causes of conflict or repressive rule, and 
address the related violations of all rights, including economic, social and cultural rights; 
(2) taking human rights and transitional justice considerations into account during peace 
processes; and (3) coordinating disarmament, demobilization and reintegration initiatives 
with transitional justice processes in a positively reinforcing manner.   
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR has been exploring and developing additional areas related to transitional 
justice, taking into account the needs of United Nations field presences and emerging 
international legal developments. In follow up to the Secretary-General&#8217;s guidance note, 
and in order to address this emerging issue, OHCHR organized the Expert Workshop on 
Experiences of Transitional Justice Processes in Dealing with Violations of Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights in Geneva in October 2010. The workshop considered various 
experiences and assessed more comprehensively the potential of transitional justice 
mechanisms and processes for dealing with violations of economic, social and cultural 
rights, as well as challenges in this regard. In follow-up, OHCHR is currently developing a 
special issues paper on this topic. 
</p>
<p>8. OHCHR has also been exploring the linkages between DDR processes and 
transitional justice. In 2009, the Inter-Agency Working Group on DDR published the 
module, &#8220;Transitional Justice and DDR&#8221;4 as part of the Integrated Disarmament, 
Demobilization and Reintegration Standards (IDDRS), the United Nations-wide guidance 
on DDR. The module was developed by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and 
OHCHR, in cooperation with the International Center for Transitional Justice. Building on 
the IDDRS module and the Secretary-General&#8217;s guidance note, OHCHR organized in 
December 2010 the Expert Workshop on Maximizing Opportunities for Coordination 
between DDR Initiatives and Transitional Justice Processes. The workshop assessed 
selected experiences of DDR initiatives as they relate to transitional justice processes, and 
further identified lessons learned in this context.5  <b>

<p><b> B. Activities of field presences 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Truth-seeking 
</b></p>
<p>9. Truth-seeking processes help post-conflict States to investigate past human rights 
violations. The right of individuals to know the truth about these violations is supported by 
several treaty bodies, regional courts, and international tribunals.6  Truth-seeking processes 
are undertaken by truth commissions, commissions of inquiry or other fact-finding 
mechanisms.7 Truth commissions are non-judicial investigative bodies which map patterns 
of past violence, and unearth the causes and consequences of these destructive events.  
Commissions of inquiry and other fact-finding mechanisms similarly seek to unravel the 
truth behind allegations of past human rights abuses, but operate under more narrowly 
defined mandates.  Each truth commission is a unique institution, designed within a specific 
societal context, and should be founded on national consultations inclusive of victims and 
civil society organizations. OHCHR assists in the design and establishment of truth 
commissions, including by sharing applicable standards and best practices. OHCHR also 
supports the work of commissions of inquiry and undertakes fact-finding missions. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Africa 
</i></p>
<p>10. In October 2010, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights released 
the report of the Mapping exercise documenting the most serious violations of human rights 
and international humanitarian law committed within the territory of the <b>Democratic 
Republic of the Congo</b> between March 1993 and June 2003. The report also formulates 
options for appropriate transitional justice mechanisms to deal with the legacy of these 
violations in terms of truth, justice, reparation and reform. In follow up, the Government of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in October 2010, announced the creation of 
specialized chambers and prepared a draft law for consideration by Parliament. In March 
2011, OHCHR held meetings with the national authorities and other stakeholders regarding 
the follow-up to the mapping exercise report, and shared recommendations on the draft law. 
</p>
<p>11. The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) of <b>Kenya</b> was 
established by law in November 2008 and inaugurated in July 2009. The TJRC has been 
experiencing operational difficulties since its inception. Despite the difficulties, OHCHR 
Kenya has been providing technical support to the TJRC, including assisting the Ministry 
of Justice in organizing induction training for commissioners, as well as training on 
transitional justice for technical staff, authorities and civil society. OHCHR Kenya also 
provided technical expertise and funding towards the creation of a database for the TJRC.  
</p>
<p>12. In December 2009, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in <b>Liberia 
</b>released its final report, but only a few of its recommendations have been implemented so 
far. The Human Rights and Protection Section (HRPS) of the United Nations Mission in 
Liberia (UNMIL) encouraged civil society organizations to inform the public about the 
content of the report through a program funded by UNDP and advocated for the 
establishment of the Independent National Commission on Human Rights (INCHR).  
INCHR was officially established in October 2010, and tasked, inter alia, with ensuring the 
implementation of the TRC recommendations.   
</p>
<p>13. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in <b>Sierra Leone</b> presented a report 
summarizing its findings and outlining recommendations in October 2004. The Human 
Rights Section (HRS) of successive peacekeeping and peace consolidation missions in 
</p>
<p>  
 6 See E/CN.4/2004/88; E/CN.4/2006/91.   
 7 See E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1, principles 6-13. </p>


<p>Sierra Leone has been assisting the Government with the implementation of the TRC 
recommendations. In November 2010, the HRS of the United Nations Integrated 
Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL), together with the Human Rights 
Commission, organized the second National Consultative Conference on the Status of 
Implementation of the TRC Recommendations in order to facilitate their full 
implementation, including with regard to reparations.   
</p>
<p>14. In July 2008, OHCHR <b>Togo</b> produced a report summarizing the findings of the 
national consultations and outlining recommendations, including for the establishment of a 
truth and reconciliation commission. The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of 
Togo was established by Presidential Decree in 2009. OHCHR Togo has been providing 
logistical, technical and administrative support to the Commission, including organizing 
seminars for the commissioners, as well as training on transitional justice and witness 
protection for technical staff, authorities and civil society.   
</p>
<p>15. The Government of <b>Uganda</b> initiated a study on truth-seeking in 2009, but 
consultations regarding a transitional justice policy were delayed until 2011. Civil society 
groups have taken the initiative with regard to the establishment of a truth commission by 
drafting a bill to this effect, with the assistance of OHCHR Uganda.  The bill has yet to be 
considered by the Government. OHCHR Uganda plans to monitor the implementation of 
the truth-seeking processes to ensure their conformity with international human rights 
standards. OHCHR Uganda also supports a community project on memorialization.   
</p>
<p><i> (b) Asia-Pacific 
</i></p>
<p>16. As part of a national strategy for implementing truth-seeking processes under the 
Action Plan on Peace and Reconciliation in <b>Afghanistan</b>, the Afghanistan Independent 
Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) is expected to release a report in 2011 mapping 
human rights violations committed during the first twenty-three years of the conflict from 
1978-2001. The Human Rights Unit (HRU) of the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
Afghanistan (UNAMA) has provided initial technical assistance to this project and intends 
to provide full support to its follow-up.  
</p>
<p>17. In <b>Nepal</b>, the 2006 Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the Interim Constitution 
contain commitments to establish a truth and reconciliation commission, as well as a 
commission of inquiry on disappearances. In February 2010, the Government submitted to 
Parliament draft bills to establish both commissions; over 80 proposed amendments are 
currently under consideration. OHCHR Nepal has provided comments as well as technical 
assistance during the revision of the draft bills and the formulation of by-laws to facilitate 
their compliance with international human rights standards. Since 2009, OHCHR Nepal has 
also been implementing a large United Nations Peace Fund for Nepal project to provide 
support to the Government and civil society on transitional justice.        
</p>
<p><i> (c) Latin America and the Caribbean  
</i></p>
<p>18. The Government of <b>Colombia</b> approved the Justice and Peace Law in 2005, which 
provides for a special judicial procedure and judicial benefits for demobilized members of 
illegal armed groups. Those procedures partially contributed to the establishment of the 
truth through voluntary depositions, although the information derived from those processes 
appears far from complete and has not resulted in a comprehensive and systematic 
understanding of crimes committed by paramilitaries. Furthermore, the number of 
demobilized members of illegal armed groups processed under the Law is very low, 
compared with the number of persons that could contribute information relevant for the </p>


<p>establishment of the truth.8  OHCHR Colombia has monitored the implementation of the 
Law and made recommendations for modifications regarding, inter alia, the extension of 
the requirements of voluntary depositions to demobilized persons not processed under the 
Law, the possibility of collective voluntary depositions, and the explicit indication that 
depositions should be instrumental to the right to the truth.   
</p>
<p>19. OHCHR <b>Guatemala </b>participates in a working group which aims to promote the 
adoption of a draft law by Congress on the establishment of a national commission to 
search for victims of enforced disappearance during the internal armed conflict.  
Furthermore, OHCHR Guatemala has provided technical assistance to the Presidential 
Commission for the Declassification of Military Archives.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Prosecution initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>20. Prosecution initiatives aim to ensure that those responsible for perpetrating serious 
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that constitute crimes are 
tried and duly punished. States have primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction over 
these crimes.9 Therefore, a sustainable transitional justice strategy seeks to develop national 
prosecutorial capacities. At the same time, States emerging from years of conflict may be 
unable or unwilling to conduct effective investigations and prosecutions. In such situations, 
international and internationalized criminal tribunals may exercise concurrent jurisdiction. 
Regardless of their form, prosecution initiatives must rest on a clear commitment to combat 
impunity, focus attention on the needs of the victims, and comply with international 
standards relating to fair trial. OHCHR provides technical assistance and monitors 
prosecution initiatives to ensure their compliance with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Africa 
</i></p>
<p>21. The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the <b>D</b>emocratic <b>R</b>epublic 
of the <b>C</b>ongo (MONUSCO) has provided information and technical support relating to the 
investigation and prosecution of certain high-profile human rights cases, and has monitored 
the justice proceedings. In 2011, several trials involving allegations of human rights 
violations, including rape, were held by military tribunals and resulted in a series of 
convictions. The Joint Human Rights Office (JHRO) of MONUSCO, in collaboration with 
international and national NGOs and other partners, provided technical and logistic support   
to the authorities. While the convictions constitute a positive step towards combating 
impunity, sexual violence remains a serious concern in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. JHRO-MONUSCO continues to support the authorities in the fight against 
impunity.     
</p>
<p>22. HRS-UNIPSIL has participated in the projects related to the legacy of the Special 
Court for <b>Sierra Leone</b> which are aimed at building the capacity of national stakeholders.  
HRS also implements the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund project which provided seed 
funding to establish a Peace Museum within the complex of the Special Court.     
</p>
<p>23. During 2011, the War Crimes Division of the High Court of <b>Uganda </b>has been 
preparing itself operationally to begin the trial of one member of the Lord Resistance Army 
who had been captured during a Uganda People&#8217;s Defence Force operation. OHCHR has 
provided technical support in developing guidelines on witness protection. 
</p>
<p>  
 8 See A/HRC/16/22, para. 38. 
 9 See E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1, principle 20. </p>


<p><i> (b) Asia-Pacific 
</i></p>
<p>24. Perpetrators of serious crimes under international law may not benefit from 
measures such as amnesty until the State has met its obligations to ensure that those 
responsible are prosecuted, tried and duly punished. In 2009, a broad amnesty law which 
appears to preclude ex officio investigations and prosecutions by the State of perpetrators of 
serious international crimes was published in the Official Gazette of <b>Afghanistan</b>. 
UNAMA, the United Nations Country Team, civil society and international organizations 
objected to the adoption of this legislation which contravenes Afghanistan&#8217;s international 
legal obligations.  
</p>
<p>25. Since June 2007, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of<b> Cambodia</b> (ECCC) 
has been trying &#8220;senior leaders and those most responsible&#8221; for the atrocities committed 
during the period of Khmer Rouge rule from 1975 to 1979. As part of OHCHR 
commitment to help maximize the impact of hybrid tribunals internationally, OHCHR 
Cambodia has been working closely with the ECCC, the Royal Government of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia and civil society to facilitate a legacy program aimed at ensuring 
that the skills, knowledge and practices of the tribunal can positively impact on the practice 
of criminal justice domestically, through concrete initiatives which incorporate the 
jurisprudence of the Court.  
</p>
<p>26. OHCHR <b>Nepal </b>has provided technical support to authorities investigating high-
profile cases related to the conflict period and has monitored judicial developments.  
OHCHR Nepal has also been documenting and publicizing evidence of other violations, 
advocating for their investigation and requesting cooperation from relevant authorities.  
Furthermore, OHCHR Nepal provides technical assistance towards strengthening the legal 
framework for prosecutions of serious human rights violations. It published a legal opinion 
underlying the necessity for the regular criminal justice system to continue investigation 
and prosecution of conflict-related cases regardless of the commitment to establish 
transitional justice mechanisms. The Office has also supported exhumations and conducted 
an assessment with a view to strengthening victim and witness protection.  
</p>
<p>27. As of March 2011, investigations of all cases indentified by the Independent Special 
Commission of Inquiry for <b>Timor</b>-<b>Leste</b> have been opened by the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor. Seven trials have been completed, one indictment is pending trial, four cases 
have been archived and 12 cases are under active investigation. The Human Rights 
Transitional Justice Section (HRTJS) of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-
Leste (UNMIT) has continued to assist the Office of the Prosecutor General in 
implementing the recommendations of the commission.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Latin America and the Caribbean 
</i></p>
<p>28. In March 2011, OHCHR convened a seminar in Argentina on the protection of 
witnesses of serious human rights violations. Representatives of national and provincial 
authorities, witness protection agencies, civil society, as well as judges and prosecutors 
engaged in discussions on current challenges in the area of witness protection and on 
practical measures to improve the protection framework in Argentina.    
</p>
<p>29. Under the Justice and Peace Law of <b>Colombia</b>, 4,484 out of approximately 53,000 
demobilized persons were being processed as of November 2010. However, almost six 
years since the adoption of the Law, there has only been one partial ruling against two ex-
paramilitaries who received the benefit of a reduced conviction. OHCHR has recommended 
that efforts be focused on the most serious violations at the higher level of responsibility. 
Based on the revelations made by the persons processed, the Supreme Court commenced 
criminal investigations against Congressional members for alleged links with illegal 
organizations. As of December 2010, the Supreme Court had decided 28 cases out of 120 </p>


<p>filed. OHCHR has been following the process under the Justice and Peace Law and has 
formulated recommendations for its modifications, with a view to improving possibilities 
for the Law to serve as an instrument of judicial accountability. 
</p>
<p>30. In 2008, OHCHR presented an amicus curiae brief to the Constitutional Court of 
<b>Guatemala</b> in a case of enforced disappearance. Recognition in July 2009 by the 
Constitutional Court of enforced disappearance as a continuing or permanent crime, in 
accordance with international standards, led to a number of convictions by national courts.  
OHCHR Guatemala provides training and technical assistance to the Human Rights Section 
of the Public Prosecutors&#8217; Office, as well as capacity-building for civil society 
organizations that represent the victims of armed conflict and often play a significant role in 
the investigation of past crimes and as civil parties in legal proceedings.    
</p>
<p>31. In February 2011, the High Commissioner for Human Rights offered the authorities 
in <b>Haiti</b> technical assistance towards the prosecution of persons responsible for serious 
human rights violations committed from 1971 to 1986. The Human Rights Section (HRS) 
of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has collaborated with 
the national authorities and civil society in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Reparations programmes 
</b></p>
<p>32. Reparations programmes seek to redress systemic violations of human rights by 
providing a range of material and symbolic benefits to victims. In its resolution 60/147, 
Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of 
Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law, the General Assembly reaffirmed the right of victims to 
reparations. Redress may take a variety of forms, including restitution, compensation, 
rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition. Experience has shown that the 
most successful reparations programmes are designed in consultation with the affected 
communities, particularly victims. OHCHR provides technical assistance in the design and 
implementation of reparations programmes, supports the participation of civil society 
organizations in reparations discussions, and advocates for the full implementation of 
reparations initiatives. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Africa 
</i></p>
<p>33. In <b>Sudan</b>, Darfur Compensation Commissions have been established to address 
compensation claims from victims of the conflict, but a reparations policy has not yet been 
developed. The Human Rights Section (HRS) of the African Union/United Nations Hybrid 
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) has provided training for members of the commissions, 
including on victims&#8217; right to a remedy and comparative experiences regarding reparations.   
</p>
<p>34. In 2010, the High Commissioner convened a High-level Panel to hear directly from 
victims of sexual violence in the <b>Democratic Republic of the Congo</b> regarding their needs 
and perception of remedies and reparations available to them. The report of the Panel was 
presented in the margins of the Human Rights Council session in March 2011. In follow-
up, JHRO-MONUSCO plans to work with national authorities and other relevant 
stakeholders to assist in developing options for reparations for victims of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>35. HRPS-UNMIL has continued to be involved in awareness-raising and sensitization 
discussions regarding reparations in <b>Liberia</b>, with a view to ensuring that various types of 
reparations are taken into account.   
</p>
<p>36. In<b> Sierra Leone</b>, HRS-UNIPSIL, through the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, 
has supported the establishment of reparations programmes which have conducted 
symbolic community reparations events and delivered partial benefits to 20,000 of the 
32,000 registered victims. The National Trust Fund for Victims was established to facilitate </p>


<p>the sustainability of the programme. Lack of adequate funding has been a serious challenge 
in implementing the programme.  
</p>
<p>37. Since 2008, OHCHR has advocated for a separate and comprehensive reparations 
programme in <b>Uganda</b>. In 2008, OHCHR Uganda began implementing the Reparations 
Research and Capacity-Building project in northern Uganda, in collaboration with the 
Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC), conducting training sessions to build 
awareness on reparations. OHCHR Uganda simultaneously conducted research on the 
views of conflict-affected communities towards reparations, and presented its preliminary 
findings to civil society in northern Uganda at a forum on transitional justice in February 
2009. In 2010, OHCHR and UHRC conducted specialized field research on gender and 
reparations; the findings were presented to the Government and donors in a validation 
workshop held in Kampala, as well as to civil society organizations in a separate meeting.   
</p>
<p><i> (b) Asia-Pacific 
</i></p>
<p>38. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of <b>Cambodia</b> has instituted a victims 
participation process whereby victims who become party to the proceedings have the right 
to claim for moral and collective reparation. OHCHR Cambodia has been monitoring the  
victims participation process to ensure that valuable lessons learned, both domestically and 
from an international perspective, are documented and can be appraised. 
</p>
<p>39. The Government of <b>Nepal</b> has begun the implementation of the Interim Relief 
Programme for victims of conflict, while a more comprehensive reparations policy is 
expected to be established in conjunction with the TRC. OHCHR Nepal has worked with 
the International Organization for Migration to analyse the inefficiencies of the interim 
relief projects, and has shared the findings with the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction. 
Amid the delays in setting up transitional justice mechanisms, OHCHR Nepal has been 
supporting the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction in the development of a 
comprehensive reparations policy in line with international human rights standards.   
OHCHR Nepal has initiated extensive consultations with victims as part of the formulation 
of the policy.   
</p>
<p>40. Both truth commissions in <b>Timor-Leste</b> have recommended the establishment of a 
reparations programme. In 2010, Parliament approved in a second reading a draft law 
establishing a framework for a reparations programme, and a law to establish an institution 
to follow up on the recommendations of the two truth and reconciliation commissions, 
including with regard to reparations, disappeared and missing persons, human rights 
training and archives. However, the final enactment of the laws has been pending as of May 
2011. HRTJS-UNMIT continues to support efforts to establish a reparations programme, 
and has provided technical assistance towards the elaboration of the above draft legislation.

<p>41. Under the Justice and Peace Law in <b>Colombia</b>, victims may submit a reparations 
claim against an ex-combatant who has completed the judicial process. However, 
application of the Law is limited and there have only been two rulings on reparations under 
it. OHCHR Colombia is currently providing recommendations for modifications to the 
provisions on judicial reparations in the Law. Victims of human rights abuses committed by 
illegal armed groups could also have sought reparations under an administrative programme 
established in 2008 and closed in April 2010. The programme conferred compensation to 
some victims, but lacked a comprehensive approach and did not apply to victims of crimes 
attributed to State agents; OHCHR Colombia monitored the implementation of the 
programme. Furthermore, it also provided advice regarding the Law on Victims and 
Restitution of Land, adopted by Parliament in May 2011, with a view to facilitating its 
compliance with international standards.  </p>


<p>42. OHCHR <b>Guatemala</b> has advocated for the adoption of adequate legislation to 
strengthen and bring sustainability to State policies on reparations. It further worked to 
sensitize civil society and victims organizations about international standards and 
comparative experiences regarding reparations. In 2011, OHCHR Guatemala plans to 
monitor the implementation of the National Reparations Programme at the local and 
regional levels.       
</p>
<p><b> 4. Institutional reform 
</b></p>
<p>43. Public institutions that have helped to perpetuate conflict must be transformed into 
institutions that sustain peace, protect human rights, and foster a culture of respect for the 
rule of law. By building fair and efficient public institutions, institutional reform enables 
post-conflict Governments to prevent the recurrence of future human rights violations.  
Vetting, by removing from service those public officials and employees, particularly in the 
security and justice sectors, who have been personally responsible for gross violations of 
human rights, is critical to facilitating this transformation. The removal of these persons 
should comply with due process of law and the principle of non-discrimination.  
Institutional reform should further incorporate comprehensive training programmes for 
public officials and employees on applicable human rights and international humanitarian 
law standards.10 OHCHR assists the implementation of institutional reform programmes 
through training, monitoring and resource provision.

<p>44. HRPS-UNMIL has continued to assist in the vetting of new recruits in the <b>Liberia</b> 
National Police (LNP) and the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) by providing background 
information on individual recruits who do not meet jointly agreed criteria for hiring. HRPS- 
UNMIL has also continued to conduct training on human rights and international 
humanitarian law for the LNP and AFL, and has started a similar programme with the 
Special Security Service personnel. HRPS-UNMIL also works to reinforce accountability 
mechanisms within the security sector. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Asia-Pacific

<p>45.  In follow-up to the June 2010 National Consultative Peace Jirga, HRU-UNAMA 
has been advocating for accountability and inclusivity in the process of developing the 
<b>Afghan</b> Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP). As the framework of the APRP was 
imprecise and created uncertainty with regard to certain aspects of the reintegration process, 
HRU-UNAMA has been advocating with the joint secretariat of the High Peace Council to 
ensure that both the &#8220;political amnesty&#8221; provisions and the grievance resolution process are 
clearly understood as not applicable to gross violations of human rights and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law, and that effective vetting of former 
combatants, prior to determining whether they are eligible for reintegration, is conducted.  
</p>
<p>46. OHCHR <b>Nepal </b>has continued its advocacy on the prospective establishment of 
vetting mechanisms in Nepal, including through direct engagement with, and technical 
assistance to, the security forces. In particular, it has taken a position in a number of cases 
relating to promotions and/or appointments to public positions of individuals against whom 
there are credible allegations of human rights violations. OHCHR Nepal has also engaged 
in developing a vetting policy for United Nations peacekeeping operations, given the 
important contribution provided by Nepali security forces in those operations.   
</p>
<p>  
 10 See E/CN.4/2005/Add.1, principle 36. </p>


<p>47. The vetting process for the national police in <b>Timor-Leste</b> was conducted between 
2006 and 2009. Out of a total of approximately 3,118 officers, about 200 were not certified, 
and 7 were dismissed. HRTJS-UNMIT assisted in establishing the vetting process, served 
as an observer on the Evaluation Panel, and supplied the process with information based on 
its monitoring records. HRTJS also participates in the joint assessments by the Government 
and UNMIT to establish whether police units are ready to assume executive policing 
authority. HRTJS has provided training on international humanitarian law and human rights 
for the national police and military officers. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Latin America and the Caribbean 
</i></p>
<p>48. MINUSTAH, the United Nations Police and HRS, have been assisting the 
Government of <b>Haiti</b> in vetting the Haitian National Police (HNP), in accordance with the 
framework set out in the HNP Reform Plan adopted in August 2006. HRS contributed to 
the strengthening of the criteria for certification process and provided information relating 
to investigations of human rights violations allegedly committed by Haitian police officers.  
Between December 2006 and January 2010, the Haitian National Police and the United 
Nations Police opened 7,177 cases for investigation, of which 3,584 completed cases were 
submitted to the authorities for appropriate action. The remaining 3,593 files are being 
investigated.   
</p>
<p><b> 5. National consultations 
</b></p>
<p>49. National consultations are a critical element of the human rights-based approach to 
transitional justice, and founded on the principle that successful transitional justice 
strategies require meaningful public participation. Public participation reveals the needs of 
conflict-affected communities, allowing states to craft an appropriate context-specific 
transitional justice strategy. Moreover, the consultative process endows victims and other 
members of civil society with local ownership of the resulting strategy. Although national 
consultations can shape the design of an overarching transitional justice strategy, they can 
also take place within the context of a specific mechanism. OHCHR supports national 
consultative processes by providing legal and technical advice, promoting victim 
participation, supporting capacity building, and mobilizing resources. Below are some 
examples of steps taken towards consultations, however, not all of the efforts should be 
considered as comprehensive consultations. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Africa 
</i></p>
<p>50. In resolution 1606 (2005), the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to 
organize consultations with the Government of <b>Burundi</b> and Burundian stakeholders 
regarding the establishment of a Truth Commission and a Special Tribunal. Pursuant to the 
operational framework agreement of November 2007, a tripartite steering committee, 
composed of United Nations, Government and civil society representatives was established 
to organize the national consultations. The Human Rights and Justice Division (HRJD) of 
the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi (BINUB) represented the United Nations 
on the tripartite steering committee, and has worked actively to ensure the inclusion of a 
human rights perspective in the national consultations. HRJD-BINUB has simultaneously 
organized sensitization and training programmes for locally elected representatives, civil 
society and vulnerable groups. The national consultations began in July 2009 and was 
completed in April 2010 with the publication of the report, which was forwarded to the 
President of Burundi. HRJD of the United Nations Office in Burundi (BNUB) has begun 
disseminating the report in all provinces. It plans to continue working with the national 
authorities, as appropriate, towards the establishment of the proposed mechanisms in 
conformity with international standards. </p>


<p>51. In <b>Sudan</b>, HRS-UNAMID, in collaboration with the Darfur Joint Mediation Team, 
launched a series of civil society consultations aimed at building their participation in the 
Darfur peace process. At the inaugural civil society conference in Doha in November 2009, 
the HRS supported civil society members in articulating their views and interests into any 
future negotiations. The HRS has since continued to build the capacity of diverse 
communities and civil society groups on transitional justice issues, with a view to 
facilitating their meaningful contribution to the peace process and to the development of 
transitional justice measures for Darfur. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Asia-Pacific 
</i></p>
<p>52. In <b>Afghanistan</b>, HRU-UNAMA has continued to advocate for greater civil society 
representation and involvement in the bodies and mechanisms designed to implement the 
peace and reintegration process. In order to facilitate civil society&#8217;s participation in the 
APRP and assist them in making their views on peace and reconciliation heard, HRU 
supported a civil society-led National Victims Jirga prior to the June 2010 National 
Consultative Peace Jirga. Unfortunately, civil society advocacy was unsuccessful as they 
were virtually unrepresented on the High Peace Council, the 70-member body appointed 
to oversee the implementation of the APRP at both national and local levels, as well as in 
provincial peace committees. HRU-UNAMA continues to work on strengthening the ability 
of civil society to take an active part in the work of the APRP.  
</p>
<p>53. OHCHR <b>Nepal</b> has continued to play a key role in supporting victim participation in 
transitional justice dialogues in Nepal and advocating for increasing access to authorities by 
victims groups. OHCHR Nepal conducted several thematic consultations on the draft TRC 
legislation in 2009; provided training to victims groups on the elements of the TRC and 
commission of inquiry on disappearances bills in April and October 2010; and held three 
consultations on the bills in April and May 2011, designed to draw nationwide participation 
of victims groups. OHCHR, UNICEF, UN Women and civil society organizations have 
worked to facilitate the incorporation of rights and perspectives of women and children into 
transitional justice initiatives. 
</p>
<p>54. In <b>Timor-Leste</b>, HRTJS-UNMIT supported the establishment of a comprehensive 
victims association whose members participated in the public consultations on the draft 
laws on reparations and the follow-up institution for the two truth commissions.    
</p>
<p><i> (c) Europe 
</i></p>
<p>55. The OHCHR office in Kosovo11 has supported the initiative for a &#8220;regional 
commission tasked with establishing the facts about all victims of war crimes and other 
serious human rights violations committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the 
period from 1991-2001&#8221; (RECOM). After extensive consultations in the region, the 
coalition of civil society organizations in the former Yugoslavia adopted a proposed statute 
for the commission in March 2011. OHCHR contributed through participation in expert 
panels, informal discussions, as well as disseminating materials, such as the OHCHR Rule-
of-Law Tools series. It also sensitized international partners about the importance of the 
initiative. 
</p>
<p>  
11 Reference to Kosovo should be understood in full compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and without 
prejudice to the status of Kosovo. </p>


<p><b> III. Relationship between disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration and transitional justice  
</b></p>
<p>56. Transitional justice processes and DDR initiatives both play important roles in post-
conflict transitions and can contribute to preventing the recurrence of violations and 
fostering reconciliation. They are both distinct and limited processes which should be 
encouraged as part of a comprehensive framework of efforts in societies recovering from 
conflict. These efforts have to be context-specific and inclusive of relevant stakeholders, 
including State institutions and civil society. The relationship between DDR programmes 
and transitional justice measures varies depending on the national context, nature of the 
conflict and the manner in which it ended, and role of the international community, among 
other factors. 
</p>
<p>57. In some cases, the initiation of DDR programmes earlier in the post-conflict period 
than the establishment of transitional justice processes can constrain their interconnections.  
In other cases, this type of sequencing could be beneficial for both processes. DDR and 
transitional justice processes also have different core constituencies, with DDR 
programmes primarily directed at ex-combatants, and transitional justice processes focused 
on victims and society more generally. When appropriately connected, however, DDR and 
transitional justice can positively reinforce one another. DDR processes can contribute to 
securing the stability necessary for implementing transitional justice mechanisms, and 
transitional justice processes can strengthen the legitimacy and integrity of DDR initiatives 
and facilitate reintegration.  
</p>
<p>58. In all cases where the two processes coexist, coherent and constructive coordination 
must be created that ensures, at a minimum, that DDR programmes and transitional justice 
mechanisms do not hinder their respective objectives of maintaining stability and 
promoting accountability, truth seeking and reconciliation. Coordination between 
transitional justice and DDR practitioners should also aim to capitalize on opportunities for 
linkages between DDR programmes and transitional justice mechanisms and to 
constructively connect the two processes in ways that contribute to a just and sustainable 
peace. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Peace agreements 
</b></p>
<p>59. Peace agreements provide an important opportunity to establish a framework linking 
DDR and transitional justice. The political and security issues on the agenda of peace 
agreements must be addressed in a manner that complies with international legal 
obligations, including with regard to accountability, truth, reparations and guarantees of 
non-recurrence. By including these obligations, peace agreements, at a minimum, keep the 
door open to the later establishment of transitional justice mechanisms. The inclusion of 
international legal obligations also signals to victims and their advocates that the violations 
suffered by affected populations will not be disregarded, and may decrease initial 
resentment towards ex-combatants. In particular, peace agreements must not provide for 
amnesties for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or gross violations of human 
rights. Certain targeted amnesties for political offences, such as treason or rebellion, 
however, may act as an incentive for demobilization, while allowing for the prosecution of 
those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and gross 
violations of human rights, in compliance with international obligations. Where express 
provision is made for the establishment of both transitional justice processes and DDR 
programmes in a peace agreement, consideration should be given to establishing 
institutional linkages between the two processes so as to provide a framework for effective 
coordination in the post-conflict period. </p>


<p>60. In this context, mediators and others involved in peace negotiations should be aware 
of the impact of DDR and transitional justice processes on one another. Integrating 
transitional justice and DDR into training modules for mediators would ensure an initial 
understanding of transitional justice processes and challenges involved in disarming, 
demobilizing and reintegrating ex-combatants and associated groups. Victims and civil 
society actors should also have a role in peace negotiations which allows them to articulate 
demands for accountability, truth and reparations.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Criminal investigations and prosecutions 
</b></p>
<p>61. Criminal investigations and prosecutions have important potential connections with 
DDR programmes. Information gathered through DDR processes can be useful to criminal 
investigations and prosecutions. Information does not need to be individualized nor require 
the disclosure of identities. For example, general and contextual information related to 
location, composition and structure of certain armed groups, their level of organization and 
hierarchy, type of activities engaged in, or demographics of combatants within particular 
groups or their weaponry can provide important assistance in the context of criminal 
investigations and prosecutions. Information gathered through DDR programmes can also 
be important in corroborating other evidence gathered. Early information sharing about the 
DDR process itself may also be useful in the context of investigations, for example, by 
providing leads as to possible witnesses. In all cases of information sharing, there must be 
transparency about the ways in which information shared will be used. 
</p>
<p>62. Prosecution initiatives can also support DDR processes. By individualizing the guilt 
of specific perpetrators, prosecution initiatives may distinguish perpetrators of violations of 
international humanitarian law or human rights law from other ex-combatants, thereby 
lessening public perception that all ex-combatants are guilty of serious violations. 
Prosecution initiatives can also contribute to DDR by removing spoilers, such as 
uncooperative commanders, from the DDR process. The issuing of an arrest warrant can 
itself isolate and contribute to the marginalization of such spoilers, and thereby removing 
them from the DDR process. Prosecution initiatives may also act as incentives for parties in 
other conflict situations to engage in DDR and to release child soldiers, for instance.   
</p>
<p>63. When the processes overlap, the pursuit of accountability through prosecutions can 
also create tensions with DDR efforts, as DDR requires the cooperation of ex-combatants 
and their leaders, while prosecutions aim to hold those responsible for serious violations of 
international law accountable. Despite these concerns, in a number of contexts, DDR 
programmes have coexisted with prosecutorial efforts, without prosecutions impeding the 
DDR process. Possible tensions can be minimized through effective communication and 
sensitization or outreach, including about the objectives of the prosecution strategy, and 
coordination between DDR practitioners and prosecutors on issues of timing.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Truth-seeking processes 
</b></p>
<p>64. Truth-seeking processes can reinforce DDR programmes, including by assisting in 
the process of reconciliation and contributing to stability. Truth processes may assist in the 
reintegration of ex-combatants by affording them the opportunity to reveal their 
experiences of the conflict and to apologize. Allowing ex-combatants to tell their own 
stories of victimization may break down rigid representations of combatants and victims, 
thereby assisting reconciliation. Testifying may also be of psychological benefit for the 
individual ex-combatant involved, assisting their personal reintegration. Truth processes 
can also play a more direct role in reintegration by, for example, including a process of 
community reconciliation for those involved in &#8220;less serious crimes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>65. Truth-seeking processes and DDR programmes also have significant potential for 
information exchange. Information collected by DDR processes may be very useful to </p>


<p>efforts to establish the truth, for instance in relation to the command structure of armed 
groups, weapons used or where bodies might be found. Conversely, truth-seeking processes 
may establish the institutional dynamics of human rights abuses, which can assist DDR 
processes in screening for eligibility for DDR benefits. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>66. DDR programmes providing benefits to ex-combatants and reparations programmes 
for victims are generally developed in isolation from one another, with far greater financial 
commitment made to DDR. Reinsertion assistance is offered to demobilized combatants in 
order to assist with their immediate civilian resettlement. The result is that ex-combatants 
participating in DDR often receive this assistance in the form of allowances, food, clothes, 
shelter, counselling and skills training as part of the benefits of DDR programmes, while in 
many cases no programmes to redress the violations of the rights of victims are established.  
</p>
<p>67. The failure to coordinate benefits for victims with those provided to combatants is 
inequitable and can give rise to additional grievances which could undermine effective 
community reintegration. The provision of reparations may therefore contribute to 
successful reintegration by reducing the resentment and grievances of the communities 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>68. Where the preconditions for the successful establishment of a reparations 
programme are not present, benefits to victims should be provided instead in the context of 
victims&#8217; assistance payments. DDR programmes are increasingly adopting community-
based reintegration approaches, which include assistance to vulnerable individuals in the 
community beyond ex-combatants. While these efforts cannot substitute for reparations, 
which are distinct in nature and objective, and critical in their recognition of victims&#8217; rights, 
they may nonetheless make an important contribution to avoiding inequity and grievances 
and, thus assist with reintegration.  
</p>
<p>69. In all cases, coordination in commitments to ex-combatants and benefits to victims 
is necessary, in order to ensure that funds are made available for the benefit of victims and 
ex-combatants at the same time. In this context, donors to DDR programmes should 
consider making comparable commitments to victims, and mechanisms such as dual-
window financing should be explored.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Guarantees of non-recurrence 
</b></p>
<p>70. DDR programmes contribute to ending violence and establishing security in the 
short to medium term, and are often one of the first security initiatives in a post-conflict 
society. The success of DDR programmes thus provides a foundation for long-term 
institutional reform. Conversely, DDR programmes alone cannot build peace or guarantee 
long-term security and stability. To be successful in achieving these aims, the programmes 
must take place in the context of larger political and socio-economic transformation and 
institutional reform.  
</p>
<p>71. DDR programmes are also closely connected with security sector reform (SSR), 
which may lead to the integration of ex-combatants in national armed forces or other 
security sector institutions. Therefore, coordination between DDR and SSR programmes on 
vetting strategies and processes is particularly crucial to ensure that ex-combatants who 
have committed gross violations of human rights or serious violations of international 
humanitarian law, or against whom indictments, judicial investigations or credible 
allegations of having committed such violations are pending, are excluded from integration 
into security sector institutions. Failure to do so risks jeopardizing reforms and undermining 
trust in Government institutions. Screening of the human rights records of ex-combatants 
should be conducted as a condition for integration into legitimate security-related </p>


<p>employment. Furthermore, timely institutional and legislative reforms clearly separating 
military and other security sector responsibilities and establishing separate career tracks for 
military and police forces are of key importance. Such reforms can influence the integration 
process, including creating an enabling context for screening the human rights records of 
ex-combatants. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Women associated with armed forces and armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>72. Gender inequality is a pervasive form of social inequality and is often exacerbated 
by conflict situations. Women who have been associated with armed forces and groups, and 
who are returning to civilian life in the post-conflict context may face greater social 
barriers, stigmatization and exclusion than men. Both transitional justice and DDR face a 
common imperative to be responsive to women&#8217;s particular experience of conflict and to 
adopt a gender-sensitive approach. Transitional justice processes and DDR initiatives 
should strive to ensure that women can fully participate in these processes, and that 
women&#8217;s rights and perspectives are adequately addressed.   
</p>
<p>73. Women associated with armed forces and groups have frequently been the victims 
of human rights violations, in particular sexual violence. In order to end impunity for sexual 
violence and facilitate social reconstruction, those responsible for transitional justice 
processes should send a clear message that the perpetrators of these crimes will be brought 
to justice and provide support for the victims of such crimes. Furthermore, transitional 
justice processes should endeavour to prevent revictimization of women who have suffered 
sexual violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Children associated with armed forces and armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>74. Children associated with armed forces and groups represent a special category of 
protected persons under international law. These children should be released and 
reintegrated into families and communities at all times, even before a DDR process is 
formally implemented. Transitional justice processes can play a positive role in 
reintegrating children, and there may be scope for linkages between the release or 
demobilization and reintegration of children and transitional justice.  
</p>
<p>75. Prosecution of commanders who have conscripted, enlisted and used children may 
help the reintegration of children by highlighting that children associated with armed forces 
and groups who may have been responsible for violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law should be considered primarily as victims, not as perpetrators. Likewise 
statements from children during truth-seeking processes can offer an opportunity for their 
participation in post-conflict reconciliation, improve understanding of the impact of war on 
children, facilitate reintegration and prevent future victimization. Children released or 
demobilized from armed forces and groups may also be eligible for reparations as victims, 
as well as financial benefits through a reintegration programme. Provision of reparations or 
benefits should not create additional grievances in affected communities, which may hinder 
reintegration. In all cases, the best interests of the child should guide decisions about their 
participation in transitional justice and DDR processes.  Participation must be voluntary and 
in accordance with child-friendly procedures. Coordination between reintegration and 
transitional justice practitioners in the context of interviewing children released or 
demobilized from armed forces and groups should also be further explored. Interview 
processes can be retraumatizing for children involved, therefore unnecessary duplication in 
efforts should be avoided to the extent possible.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Traditional justice processes 
</b></p>
<p>76. Traditional justice processes can complement both reintegration programmes and 
transitional justice processes by providing a community level means of addressing issues of </p>


<p>accountability of ex-combatants, and facilitating their reintegration through an approach 
that involves victims and communities in defining the responsibility and obligations of 
those who have committed crimes. Traditional justice may be an important process through 
which to link DDR and transitional justice. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that 
traditional justice processes do not violate national and international human rights 
standards, including those related to gender and other forms of discrimination.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The present overview of activities reaffirms the increasing role played by 
OHCHR in providing a broad range of assistance in the field of transitional justice.  
Other parts of the United Nations human rights system are encouraged to continue to 
give due attention to transitional justice in the discharge of their mandates. 
</b></p>
<p>78.  <b>Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) and transitional justice 
processes are interrelated and coordination between the two efforts is essential for 
facilitating their coherence and mutual reinforcement. Establishing reparations for 
victims in conjunction with DDR programmes for ex-combatants may mitigate the 
perception of inequity in their respective treatment, and foster reintegration. 
Enhanced understanding of the connections between DDR and transitional justice 
should contribute to increased coordination between DDR and transitional justice 
practitioners.
