<p><b>  Mission to South Africa: comments by the State on the report 
of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food,  
Olivier De Schutter  
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This Addendum is being forwarded under cover of the official Memorandum 
produced by the Social Sector Cluster of the South African government in whose purview 
the issues associated with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the 
Right to Food reside. The two documents should be read together as encapsulating South 
Africa&#8223;s official position on the content and the general thrust of the Report of the Special 
Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food, hereinafter, referred to, the Report.  
</p>
<p>2. The South African Cabinet decided on 22 October 2002 to extend an open invitation 
to all the Thematic Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council to 
undertake visits to South Africa and make enquiries on the extent of the practical 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, consistent with their mandates. It is 
in this context that the South African government invited the Special Rapporteur of the 
UNHRC on the Right to Food, Mr Olivier De Schutter, to undertake a Mission to South 
Africa on 07 &#8211; 15 July 2012. The government&#8223;s understanding has always been that Mr de 
Schutter&#8223;s visit would focus on the existing legislative, administrative, judicial measures 
and policy frameworks towards the practical realisation of the Right to Food and in this 
regard make observations as well as propose recommendations for consideration and 
consequent implementation by the government of South Africa. To this end, the 
government of South Africa appreciates the opportunity for the exchange of views with the 
Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food including the insights shared on 
how to improve the quality of life of all South Africans, particularly the vulnerable sectors 
and/or segments within society. The government has noted that the Special Rapporteur of 
the UNHRC on the Right to Food, based on his own preference and the tightness of his 
programme, decided to exclude some of the key Departments such as Health and Basic 
Education from his programme. The government further notes that the Report, under its 
segment entitled &#8220;the situation of food insecurity&#8221;, devotes a huge and considerable amount 
</p>
<p>of time and attention to the mandate of these two Departments.  
</p>
<p>3. It should be pointed out that the South African government since the advent of 
democratic rule in 1994, has consistently adopted, adapted and strengthened key policies 
aimed at promoting the Right to Food and has aimed to ensure that all South Africans are 
beneficiaries of food security programmes. In a progressive response to this constitutional 
requirement, government has established an Integrated Food Security Strategy (IFSS) with 
the purpose of streamlining, harmonising and integrating the different food security 
programmes being implemented by different government Departments so as to &quot;attain 
universal physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food by all 
South Africans at all times to meet their dietary and food preferences for an active and 
healthy life&quot;. The main goal of the IFSS is to eradicate hunger, malnutrition and food 
insecurity by 2015. The relevant government Departments have also presented a Draft Food 
Security Policy to Cabinet, which is aimed at developing a framework for South Africa to 
prescribe a threshold for food secure and insecure individuals and also to inform strategies 
and national food security programmes aimed at ensuring food security for all at all times. 
Food security programmes or interventions, amongst others, include the Integrated Food </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>Security and Nutrition Programme, the Household Food Production Programme, the Food 
Insecurity and Vulnerability Information Mapping System, the Comprehensive Agricultural 
Support Programme (CASP), the<b> </b>Agricultural Starter Pack Programme<b> </b>and Food Banks. To 
further enhance efforts of fighting food insecurity, hunger and malnutrition, government 
has established an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Food Security, co-led by the 
Ministers of Social Development and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The IMC is 
tasked to deliver an integrated, inter-sectoral programme, based on the Brazilian model of 
&#8220;Fome Zero&#8221; (Zero Hunger), which is aimed at the fulfillment of the citizen&#8223;s rights to 
food. The fulfilment of this right will generate demand for the supply of nutritious food and 
the state will use state procurement of food as a catalyst to grow and support food 
production and local procurement.  
</p>
<p>4. Notwithstanding the above programmes, South Africa, like all other countries, is 
still confronted with the challenge of food insecurity. This stems primarily from the lack of 
resources, which if available, the Government would undoubtedly use to uplift the 
standards of living and quality of life of the majority of its citizens, including those who, 
for various reasons, find themselves in the jurisdiction of South Africa. It will also be 
recalled that the practical enjoyment of the economic, social and cultural rights is 
predicated on the notion of progressive realisation.  
</p>
<p>5. The fourth democratic administration under the leadership of President JG Zuma 
has, for purposes of effective coordination and management, decided to introduce a system 
of (a) Delivery Agreements, signed between the President and each Cabinet Ministers and 
(b) Implementation Forums composed of relevant Departments for the achievement of the 
12 government Outcomes. In relation to the mandate of Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC 
on the Right to Food, Outcome 7 entitled &#8220;Vibrant, Equitable and Sustainable and food 
security for all&#8221; becomes more instructive. It should be mentioned that five outputs 
underpin Outcome 7 delivery targets. These are sustainable agrarian reform with a thriving 
farming sector, improved access to diverse and affordable food, improved rural services to 
support sustainable livelihoods, improved employment opportunities and economic 
livelihoods, enabling institutional environment for inclusive growth and cross-cutting 
coordination. 
</p>
<p>6. In the above context and often by design or coincidence, the policy and legislative 
mandates of various government departments are cross-cutting and/or mutually reinforcing. 
In recognition of the fact, with a view to maximizing the benefits thereof, as will be 
discernible from the contents of the Annexes to this Report, government coordinates its 
policy and legislative work through a cluster system, which brings together government 
departments with policy and legislative mandates that tend to cut across or mutually 
reinforce each other. Similarly, government coordinates and integrates its planning and 
program execution through a system of Implementation Forums, which brings together 
government departments with mutually reinforcing outputs in respect of a common 
outcome.  
</p>
<p>7. The Implementation Forum for the achievement of this Outcome integrates all the 
role playing Departments, including (a) Rural Development and Land Reform; (b) 
Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; (c) Water Affairs; (d) Environmental 
Affairs; (e) Social Development; (f) Public Works; (g) Trade and Industry; (h) Science and 
Technology; and (g) Economic Development. Regrettably, the thrust of the Report suggests 
that this newly introduced management approach will not produce the desired goal of 
collective governance and working together to ensure that government delivers &#8220;as one&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. In the South African context, the Right to Food is encapsulated in the general rubric 
of the realisation of the economic, social and cultural rights, and especially within the 
context of the realisation of the right to adequate standards of living, including the right to 
life. More significantly, the Right to Development is seen in the context of the South </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>African government as on a par with all other human rights, including the Right to Food. 
The Right to Development also implies a process through which all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms (economic, social and cultural as well civil and political) are 
progressively realised. In this respect; the South African government welcomes the 
observation by the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food in paragraph 
11, which forms the basic underpinnings of the South African Constitution. <b>All references 
</b>in the Report to the concept of &#8220;a rights based approach&#8221; are t<b>herefore understood to 
</b></p>
<p><b>imply the notion of the Right to Development as encapsulated in the 1986 United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations Declaration on the Right to Development and also adopted by consensus at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>9. It is strongly suggested that, for purposes of uniformity and consistency, the 
monetary value of the programmes mentioned in the Report be denominated both in the 
South African Rand (ZAR) and USD due to the currency exchange variations. This 
approach would make it easier for ordinary South Africans to have a comprehensive 
understanding of the main thrust of the Report in the critical areas of budgetary provisions 
and international benchmarks. Similarly, it would be beneficial for the Special Rapporteur 
of the UNHRC on the Right to Food to note that in the South African context, reference is 
made to HIV and AIDS and not HIV/AIDS or AIDS/HIV. Consistency in this regard would 
be much appreciated as in paragraph 7 of the Report. Furthermore, the Report should refer 
to &#8220;Provinces&#8221;, rather than &#8220;States&#8221;, as mentioned in paragraphs 9, 12 and 54. 
</p>
<p>10. The government notes with concern that the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on 
the Right to Food already prejudges the outcomes of the policies currently being 
implemented as destined for failure. This slant and approach seems to permeate the entire 
Report. For the rest of the segments in the Report, the government notes inherent 
contradictions, such as applauding the policies of government and simultaneously finding 
inherent flaws and weaknesses in the implementation of these policies and programmes, 
even prior to their monitoring and evaluation by government. It is also evident from the 
Report, that the perceived failures of government policy may not necessarily be rectified in 
the short to medium term. The quality time spent by political principles in intense dialogue 
with the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food had, as its main thrust, the 
acknowledgment that the South African land acquisition, land restitution and land reform 
programmes were initially manifested in challenges and which are in constant review to 
ensure optimal utilisation of land for purposes of food production.  
</p>
<p>11. For the purposes of contextualising the contents of the Report, the government of the 
Republic of South Africa, has chosen to produce this Addendum, which is to be read in 
tandem with the Report. The approach and methodology adopted are sequential and follow 
chronologically according to the paragraphs in the Report.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Paragraph for paragraph comments on the report 
</b></p>
<p>12.<b> Paragraph 2: </b>It is strongly recommended that uniformity and consistency be 
maintained in references to the various provinces. For example, Gauteng Province, as 
opposed to the Province of Gauteng. It is left to the preference of the Special Rapporteur of 
the UNHRC on the Right to Food, as long as consistency is maintained.  
</p>
<p>13.<b> Paragraph 3</b>: The interpretation that the Report attempts to provide building blocks 
towards a strategy for the full realisation of the Right to Food is not shared by government. 
The view of the government is that the Report should evaluate the existing policies, 
strategies and initiatives and provide observations and recommendations thereon, which 
could be considered by government for implementation or revision and review of existing 
policies.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. The situation of food insecurity 
</b></p>
<p>14.<b> Paragraph 4</b>:  The political slant in this paragraph is incorrect as it purports to 
suggest that the apartheid system was better, more sensitive, attentive and positively 
disposed to national and societal inequalities than the current democratic dispensation. The 
reference in the Report, namely, that &#8220;inequality has increased since apartheid&#8221; is indeed 
</p>
<p>regrettable. South Africa&#8223;s high levels of inequalities are themselves a consequence of 
apartheid. Admittedly, these inequalities persist and confront our society. However, 
immense and intense efforts have been undertaken by the post-apartheid government to 
widen the welfare net and the social security and protection system in order to ensure 
equitable redistribution of benefits and access to equal opportunities and benefit. It should 
be underlined that in South Africa the Gini coefficient does not include those who receive 
social assistance in the form of free basic services such as water, primary healthcare, 
schooling, and housing.1 
</p>
<p>15. Since 1994, government programmes have improved the quality of life and living 
standards for the poorest South Africans. These include expanded access to housing, water, 
sanitation, schooling, primary healthcare and electricity. It is difficult to quantify the 
financial value of these benefits because some are assets received once off (such as a house, 
or a water pipe and taps) and others are services (such as schooling or free water) provided 
on an ongoing basis. Clean running water in or near a household cannot be captured by 
measures of income or GDP, but it has a profound impact on livelihoods, especially for 
women who, traditionally used to bear the brunt of collecting or fetching water from places 
far away from their homestead and are responsible for other essential needs, especially in 
the rural and peri-urban livelihoods.2 
</p>
<p>16. Furthermore, and as noted in the MDG Progress Report on South Africa, the Gini 
estimates have been subjected to many significant changes. The sample frame in 1995 was 
different from that of 2000 and 2006. Hence, while we can conclude that inequality remains 
high, we cannot automatically infer from the data that inequality has worsened.3 
</p>
<p>17.<b> Paragraph 5</b>: The Paragraph omits that in relation to eradicating extreme poverty 
and hunger, South Africa has reduced the numbers of people experiencing the worst levels 
of income poverty significantly. This has contributed effectively towards achieving the 
target provided for in MDG 1, namely, halving the proportion of the population living 
below the poverty line of a $1 per day.4 Although acknowledging this fact in paragraph 40 
of his Report, the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food should have 
reflected this in paragraph 5 of the Report. Most of the achievements in reducing extreme 
levels of income poverty can be ascribed to government&#8223;s comprehensive social assistance 
</p>
<p>programme, which includes extensive income support programmes, access to free 
education and primary health care for the poorest and the provision of free basic services to 
indigent members of society. Further, the Government notes that the sources used for 
arriving at this benchmark for income poverty are those not normally used for government 
planning and budgeting. They are thus, not official custodians of government statistics.  
</p>
<p>18. Furthermore, the reference to 64% of all children living in income poverty depicts a 
situation in South Africa that is not realistic as children don&#8223;t often provide means of

</p>
<p>livelihood except in cases of child- headed households. It should further be mentioned that 
there has been significant progress in fulfilling children&#8223;s right to social security, 
</p>
<p>particularly through the dramatic expansion of child support grants which is administered 
by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). The eligibility age range for the 
Child Support Grant has gradually been extended from 0 to six years in 1999 to 0 to 18 
years from 2012 onwards. The extension of the grant will go a long way in addressing 
childhood malnutrition. Furthermore, government has increased budget allocations to 
programmes such as the Early Childhood Development (ECD) and the School Nutrition 
Programme in a quest to end child poverty in the country. 
</p>
<p>19.<b> Paragraph 6</b>: The income inequality gap remains persistently high, as identified by 
the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food, in paragraph 6. The Report 
rightly quotes the Social Profile of South Africa (2010) and the MDG Country Progress 
Report (2010). The government has found some discrepancies in relation to the references 
to figures from the MDG Country Progress Report. In 2006 the Black African population 
which constituted 79.4 percent of the population earned 17 percent of the 747.6 billion 
ZAR of income while the 9.2 per cent of the white population earned 72.7 percent of this 
income. This is reflected in table 1.2 of the 2010 Country Progress Report, row 105. The 
last sentence in this paragraph should be read as &#8220;female headed households are generally 
much poorer than households that have a father or have both parents&#8221;. Furthermore, child 
headed households should be included in this listing of vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>20. Faced with these realities and the challenges of very high inequality and deep levels 
of poverty, South Africa is working on ways to improve the employment performance of 
the economy and create many more decent work opportunities and better social security 
programmes in line with the development of the New Growth Path Framework, which 
address a major shift in positive direction, in terms of the current policy of government. In 
understanding the multidimensional nature of the triple challenges of unemployment, 
inequality and poverty, government has adopted a multi-faceted response that 
simultaneously deals with deprivation and exclusion.  
</p>
<p>21.<b> Paragraph 7</b>:  In the context of HIV and AIDS, it should be noted that HIV 
prevalence in South Africa appears to be stabilising and evidence from population-based 
HIV prevalence surveys in South Africa indicates that the spread of HIV among persons 
aged 15 &#8211; 24 years overall has declined in the country since 2005. South Africa has the 
largest Anti- Retroviral Therapy programme in the world, and together with the 
strengthening of government prevention programmes, has contributed towards stabilizing 
HIV prevalence.6 The human rights and dignity of HIV-infected persons, including persons 
with AIDS, and workers with HIV-infection who are healthy should be treated the same as 
all other workers. The government prohibits and punishes unfair discrimination on the basis 
of HIV and AIDS status. In terms of nutritional requirements, South Africa acknowledges 
the effect of poor nutritional status on people living with TB and HIV and AIDS and 
provides nutritional support including provision of food supplements and food parcels 
where necessary. In addition the Department of Health works closely with the Department 
of Social Development and ensures that social grants are made available to vulnerable 
groups. 
</p>
<p>22. <b>Paragraph 8: </b>A concerted effort is required to adress challenges of malnutrition and 
stunting amongst children in the form of effective partnerships between all government 
departments, civil society and both domestic and international development partners. To 
this end, government has embarked on multi-faceted programmes to address malnutrition

<p>that is rife amongst children aged 1 - 9 years old. One such programme is the National Food 
Fortification Programme where it is recommended to fortify wheat, maize flour and retail 
sugars, which are three of the five most commonly consumed foodstuffs, as reported by the 
National Food Consumption Survey. Over eight million children also benefit from 
government&#8223;s School Nutrition Programme. This is a programme that directly addresses 
undernutrition especially for children in schools. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>Paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12</b>: The government concurs with the observations of the 
Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food in these paragraphs. In relations to 
paragraph 12 and recommendation 60 (a), the government assures the Special Rapporteur 
of the UNHRC on the Right to Food that it places a premium on economic, social and 
cultural rights and that the ratification of the ICESCR and its Optional Protocol is of high 
importance.  
</p>
<p>24. An important policy which has been omitted from this section of the Report is the 
New Growth Path<b>, </b>whereby agriculture and rural development feature prominently among 
the six priority job drivers for 2011/12.  
</p>
<p>25. <b>Paragraph 15 - 19: </b>The Performance Agreements between the President and the 
Ministers are not legal documents and should not be read as such. They are an effective 
management tool for the President to ensure that Ministers deliver on the key priorities of 
government. Although there is no legal framework for the Performance Agreements 
between the President and members of his Cabinet, the President as the Executive Head of 
State and Government can exercise his prerogative in this regard holding Ministers 
accountable for the delivery of an outcome. This paragraph should also take cognisance of 
the independent role of Chapter 9 Institutions in South Africa. These include (a) the Public 
Protector; (b) the South African Human Rights Commission; (c) the Commission for the 
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities; 
(d) the Commission for Gender Equality; (f) the Auditor-General; and (g) the Electoral 
Commission. These institutions are independent, and subject only to the Constitution and 
the law, and they must be impartial and must exercise their powers and perform their 
functions without fear, favour or prejudice.7 
</p>
<p>26.<b> Paragraph 17</b>:<b> </b>The government is pleased that most of the comments that were 
previously submitted relative to the Outcomes Approach (paragraph 15 and 16), and 
especially Outcome 7, has been taken into account. However, paragraph 17 of the Report 
creates an impression that South Africa has overlooked poor households in the urban and 
peri-urban areas. It is important to indicate that one of the programmes of DAFF is 
Ilima/Letsema with a budget of R1,3 billion over the Medium Term Expenditure 
Framework period 2012/13 - 2014/15. This programme encourages household food 
production and has already for instance, benefited communities in Soweto (Gauteng). In 
addition, all the district municipalities in South Africa have agricultural programmes 
directed at the improvement of food security for all in South Africa and on a non-
discriminatory basis.  
</p>
<p>27. The denial of the fact that the majority of black South Africans have binding ties 
with the rural areas, embracing pro-urban based livelihood strategies to their exclusion (or 
with marginal rural benefits ) might pose challenges not only on the food security front, but

</p>
<p>for social cohesion and quality of life. It is in this context that the government notes that the 
Report has taken into consideration the extent of marginalisation of the rural areas during 
the apartheid era, and its subsequent social ills associated with spatial over-concentration of 
the poorest sectors of the population. These areas demand deliberate and unique 
interventions, which are not commonly applicable in other parts of the developing world.  
</p>
<p>28. <b>Paragraph 18: </b>In South Africa, there is a strong move towards improving 
integration within sectors, across different sectors and between government and non-
government structures. In addition to the establishment of the DPME, noted in the current 
paragraph, the Report should also highlight the role of the National Planning Commission 
(NPC). The introduction of the NPC is a clear demonstration that Government is 
strengthening its mechanics and systems to ensure coherence and cohesion of government 
programmes at different levels. The NPC has also undertaken public engagement with 
social partners around the development of a vision and long term development plan for the 
country called the National Development Plan 2030. This is a draft plan and after thorough 
consultations, the plan will be adopted. The development of strong partnerships within 
government, underlined by a strong sense of one government, and strong partnerships 
between government and non-government stakeholders forms a basis for improving 
integrated planning and cooperative governance.  
</p>
<p>29. <b>Paragraph 19</b>:   Kindly also include to the listing in this paragraph, issues of age 
and disability. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>30. In terms of the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s call for South Africa to adopt a &#8220;rights-based 
approach&#8221;, it should be emphasised that South Africa has consistently supported the notion 
of the Right to Development which has been mainstreamed into all polices and strategies. 
The Right to Development places a human person at the centre and as a beneficiary of 
public policy and development programmes. Furthermore, all government Departments 
have the responsibility to uphold the human rights enshrined in the Constitution of the 
Republic of South Africa in the execution of their mandates and the provision of services.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Food availability: reforming the agricultural sector 
</b></p>
<p>31.<b> Paragraphs 20</b>&#8211;<b>26: </b>The government notes with concern that the Special Rapporteur 
of the UNHRC on the Right to Food already prejudges the outcomes of the policies 
currently being implemented as destined for failure. This slant and approach seems to 
permeate the entire Report. For the rest of the segments in the Report, the government notes 
inherent contradictions, such as applauding the policies of government and simultaneously 
finding inherent flaws and weaknesses even prior to their monitoring and evaluation by 
government. It is also evident from the Report, that the perceived failures of government 
policy may not necessarily be rectified in the short to medium term. The quality time spent 
by political principles in intense dialogue with the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on 
the Right to Food had, as its main thrust, the acknowledgment that the South African land 
acquisition, land restitution and land reform programmes were initially manifested in 
challenges and which are in constant review to ensure optimal utilisation of land for 
purposes of food production.  
</p>
<p>32.<b> Paragraph 22:</b> The recently published Green Paper on Land Reform seeks to undo 
the legacy of apartheid&#8223;s highly unequal land distribution. This remains a fundamental 
priority for the nation and should be noted in the Report. The measures proposed in the 
current Green Paper are informed by an in-depth analysis of the consequences of previous 
policies as well as comparable studies in other countries. It embraces three fundamental 
principles that provide opportunities for all sectors of society to uphold: a)de-racialisation 
of the rural economy for shared and sustainable growth; b) democratic and equitable land </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>allocation and use across gender, race and class; and c) strict production discipline for 
guaranteed national food security8. 
</p>
<p>33. In response to the Report&#8223;s comment in paragraph 22 and recommendation (d) (i) 
related to the failure of government to provide adequate post-settlement support, it is 
important to emphasise that in 2010, the government introduced, as a means of responding 
to challenges of collapsing land reform projects, and defunct irrigation schemes in the 
former homelands, a new programme called Recapitalisation and Development. This 
programme is designed to assist all farmers who accumulated land as a result of the land 
reform processes. This is an effort to provide, for a minimum of five years, post settlement 
support to new farmers and to revive farms that have collapsed and even farms that are 
currently doing well.9 The objectives of the programme are to increase production; to 
guarantee food security; to graduate small scale farmers into commercial farmers; and, to 
create employment opportunities within the agricultural sector. The programme is centered 
on strategic partnerships, mentoring and co-management. The Recapitalisation and 
Development Programme is accessible primarily to farmers and communities that had 
received land from the state, but had not received the necessary support to sustain 
production. To date, the programme is being carried out on more than 170 farms across the 
country. Thanks to the programme, more than 1 300 permanent and more than 2 700 short-
term jobs have been created. The government has also provided jobs for more than 7 900 
rural young people from different wards in various municipalities through its National 
Rural Youth Service Corps (NARYSEC)10.  
</p>
<p>34. In addition, as part of government support to smallholder farmers, a Smallholder 
Development Plan is in the process of being developed to strengthen coordination with 
provinces in regard to the support of 15 000 smallholder farmers. Collaboration with the 
Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Department of Rural 
Development and Land Reform in regard to land ownership and land use remains critical in 
elevating farmers from subsistence to smallholder level and from smallholder to 
commercial level. 
</p>
<p>35.<b> Paragraph 23</b>: There is no doubt that land reform remains a fundamental policy of 
government and one of the central pillars of the Comprehensive Rural Development 
Programme (CRDP). The lessons from the past 16 years of land reform programmes in 
South Africa have prompted government to introduce as an interventionist measure, as a 
strategy referred to as the Recapitalisation and Development Programme, as mentioned 
above, where 25% of every Medium Term Expenditure Framework&#8223;s (MTEF) budgetary 
</p>
<p>allocation to land reform has been set aside for development and capitalisation of land 
reform projects.11  The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform is proactively 
acquiring land under the Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy (PLAS), which is registered 
in the name of the State and subsequently allows access to this land through lease 
arrangements. In this way the Department is able to provide access to more beneficiaries, 
whereas in the past, beneficiaries were expected to provide their own contribution and often

</p>
<p>36.<b> Paragraph 26</b>: In terms of extension and advisory services to farmers (noted in 
paragraph 26 as well  58 of the Report), the Extension and Advisory Services Revitalisation 
Programme was implemented over the past three years. It is worth clarifying that the 
Extension Recovery Plan focuses on five pillars which include Recruitment of personnel, 
Re-skilling &amp; Reorientation of Extension, Improve the image &amp; professionalism, Ensure 
visibility &amp; accountability and lastly the provision of ICT equipment and other resources. 
</p>
<p>37. In terms of the Reskilling &amp; Reorientation, out of 2 210 extension personnel, 1 563 
have enrolled for qualifications upgrading &amp; short courses at various universities in the 
country. Already 81 extension officers have already upgraded their qualification. A total of 
1 000 extension and advisory officers were recruited to improve the extension officer-to-
farmer ratio. The recruitment is aimed at augmenting the existing extension personnel in 
order to adequately respond to the mandate of ensuring food security within the country.  
</p>
<p>38. A comprehensive audit of the 12 colleges of agriculture was completed, in order to 
assess and transform these colleges into national Agricultural Training Institutes (ATIs). 
Infrastructure will be improved and laboratories will be revitalised to meet the standards 
required for these institutes. The institutes will further benefit from international 
partnerships by increasing their capacity and strategically positioning them as centres of 
excellence for the training of smallholder producers.13  The use of the Farmer&#8217;s <i>Green Book 
</i>by all farmers is also currently being enhanced, which is used as a tool to determine the 
extent of the government&#8223;s reach to all farmers, especially to those in need of capacity and 
</p>
<p>post-settlement support.14Skills development is part of the Extension Recovery Plan which 
seeks to rekindle the Agricultural Extension profession. 
</p>
<p>39. In terms of equipping extension officers, all Provincial Departments of Agriculture 
were assisted through the Extension Recovery plan to acquire a Decision Support System 
known as the Extension Suite Online (ESO). ESO is an internet based information system 
designed specifically to assist extension officers to provide advice to farmers regarding 
their rights on farms. In terms of ensuring accountability and visibility 8 out of 9 Provinces, 
through the Extension Recovery Plan have already acquired the geospatial pen commonly 
known as the Smart pen. The pen is meant to improve agricultural project monitoring and 
service delivery to farmers.  
</p>
<p><b> D. A rights-based approach to agricultural support schemes15 
</b></p>
<p>40. This section of the Report fails to mention initiatives currently undertaken in 
incorporating a human rights-based approach to agricultural support schemes. Furthermore, 
the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s recommendation in paragraph 60 (c) indicates that South Africa 
does not have a rights based approach to food. It should be recalled that government 
programmes are inclusive of a human rights based approach, consistent with the core

</p>
<p>41. <b>Paragraph 27</b>&#8211;<b>29: </b>In terms of Chapter 10 of the Constitution of the Republic of 
South Africa, the government is obliged to be development-oriented, to encourage public 
participation in policy-making, and to be accountable and transparent by providing the 
public with timely, accessible and accurate information. Paragraphs 27&#8211; 29 further purports 
to suggest that government programmes do not target the vulnerable groups. The decision 
by the government to establish the Ministry for Women, Children and People with 
Disabilities underscores government&#8223;s commitment to ensure that the voice of vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups remains a priority issue for which maximum protection should be ensured. In terms 
of rural development, the DWCPD held a National Rural Women&#8223;s Summit in May 2011 to 
consolidate the views and aspirations of rural women. Furthermore, the DWCPD is 
working with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform and DAFF in order 
to ensure access to land by women and people with disabilities, as well ensuring that issues 
of these vulnerable groups are mainstreamed into government programmes such as the 
Comprehensive Rural Development Programme. 
</p>
<p>42. <b>Paragraph 28</b>: In terms of land reform policies (also under recommendation 60 
(iii)(v)),  it should be noted and included in the Report that the Department of Rural 
Development and Land Reform is guided by constitutional and policy imperatives to 
redress gender inequalities in land distribution. In addition, the Department is guided by 
South Africa&#8223;s Department for Women, Children and People with Disabilities, the National 
Gender Machinery and by international instruments such as the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Outcome 
of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, namely, the Beijing Declaration and 
Platform for Action. Progress has already been made by the Department in adopting a 
gender-sensitive approach through the development of the Gender Policy Framework 
Guidelines, the hosting of gender awareness workshops and the development of gender 
planning tools.16

<p>social assistance. Essentially, the comprehensive response towards the eradication of 
extreme poverty and hunger combines cash transfers with social wage packages. This 
includes, among others,  free primary healthcare for all, compulsory education for children 
aged between seven and thirteen, decent human settlements for the poor and access to piped 
water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>46.<b> Paragraph 46: </b>South Africa notes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur of 
the UNHRC on the Right to Food that the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) 
should be developed into an &#8220;entitlements-based scheme&#8221; and guarantee &#8220;a minimum 
number of days of employment to all those who have no other source of income&#8221;. It should 
</p>
<p>be noted that the EPWP incentives, which are paid to National, Provincial and Local 
Spheres of government are paid based on the Full Time Equivalents (FTEs). This 
encourages longer duration of projects. All EPWP projects are encouraged to at least 
employ participants for 100 days or more per annum, so as to impact positively on the 
socio-economic conditions of the unemployed and poverty stricken people in South Africa.  
</p>
<p><b>  Promoting household food gardens and urban agriculture 
</b></p>
<p>47. In the above context and through the Community Works Programme (CWP), 
unemployed people are provided work for 100 days per annum and this programme has 
been mainstreamed to comply with EPWP principles. The CWP is an employment safety 
net, giving participants a minimum number of regular days of work, typically two days a 
week or eight days a month, thus providing a predictable income stream. The CWP is an 
ongoing Programme that does not replace government&#8223;s existing social grants programme 
</p>
<p>but complements it. Other programmes of the EPWP that are longer in duration include the 
Home Community Based Care (HCBC) and Early Childhood Development (ECD). 
</p>
<p>48. <b>Paragraph 49: </b>The Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food raises 
concern about specific obstacles facing community-based developments. In response to 
these obstacles, DAFF encourages all municipalities to use all vacant land available in line 
with their Integrated Development Plans. DAFF influences this process through working 
with Provincial Departments of Agriculture and Local Economic Departments of 
municipalities in order to make sure that the available commonage land is reserved for food 
production by the poor and vulnerable groups within the municipalities. This will in turn 
assist the communities involved in farming to acquire expertise and skills for successful 
food production. To enable endearment to the other communities these areas will be 
properly fenced and the community based developments will be properly organised into 
formal structures with proper communication and cooperation mechanisms, much like 
cooperatives. 
</p>
<p><b>  The situation of farm workers, tenant labourers and farm dwellers 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>Paragraph 50: </b>In this paragraph, the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the 
Right to Food is particularly concerned by the situation of farm workers. It is important to 
highlight, and as mentioned by the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food 
that in July 2010, DAFF organised for the first time in the history of South Africa a Summit 
for all vulnerable workers in agriculture, forestry &amp; fisheries. The Summit emerged with 
numerous resolutions clustered under four thematic areas namely (1) the social 
determinants of health (2) working conditions (3) security of tenure, (4) empowerment &amp; 
training. As an outcome of the Summit, a Ministerial Delivery Forum was established, 
comprised of all Employer &amp; Employee Unions, NGO coalitions, National &amp; Provincial 
Departments of Agriculture; Health; Education; Rural Development &amp; Land Reform; 
Labour and Social Development. As a result all provincial Departments were tasked to 
establish vulnerable worker support Directorates. At National level there are working </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>committees mandated to develop and drive the programme in line with the above-
mentioned thematic areas. 
</p>
<p>50. It is further important to note the Labour Inspectorate System will be strengthened to 
monitor and enforce compliance with legislation and ensure decent work principles are 
adhered to, in order to address vulnerability in the labour market. This includes increasing 
penalties for non-compliance with both the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the 
Employment Equity Act. The Department of Labour has further, together with its social 
partners and both organised business and labour, developed an accord that seeks to address 
the plight of farm dwellers generally in what is termed the &#8220;Vision for labour Relations in 
</p>
<p>Agriculture&#8221;. In terms of this vision, inspectors (who in terms of the law) have the right to 
access any farm for bona fide inspections but also have access to organised agriculture 
structures, such as AgriSA, will be able to more effectively address any problems that may 
arise in the performance of their duties. In a situation where there is a need to have broader 
interventions on farms, inspectors will involve other law enforcement agencies as well as 
other agencies of government. 
</p>
<p>51. In relation to farm inspections, it should be mentioned that the Department of 
Labour is actively promoting the visibility of inspectors with particular emphasis on the 
plight of farm workers who form part of the vulnerable working community, especially in 
regard to migratory labour from neighbouring countries of Mozambique, Lesotho, 
Zimbabwe, and Swaziland. In terms of recommendation 60 (g), the responsibility to enforce 
the legislation remains that of government and there is no intention at this stage to provide a 
system of accreditation to other parties other than Department of Labour inspectors to 
conduct inspections. 
</p>
<p>52. Whilst the focus of the Report is on the Right to Food, the section dealing with 
labour does not include the social security arms that fall within the purview of labour 
legislation and specifically the Unemployment Insurance legislation. Paragraph 50 refers 
only to two pieces of labour legislation that applies to farm workers and does not cover all 
the labour laws that apply.  
</p>
<p>53. Furthermore, there is only one determination that applies in the agricultural sector 
(excluding the forestry sector which also set wages and conditions of employment for 
similar workers) and this is set by the Minister of Labour on the advice of the Employment 
Conditions Commission (as opposed to the relevant employment conditions commission as 
stated in paragraph 50). The sectoral determination only sets standards of accommodation 
in the event that the provision of accommodation on farms is regarded as a deduction 
against the wages of farm workers. 
</p>
<p>54. The Report does not make a distinction between internal and cross border migrants 
or between regular or irregular migrants. However it is important to note that irrespective of 
the category of migrants, the rights enshrined in the Constitution and set out in the labour 
legislation applies to them equally. It should however be noted that the migration regime, in 
line with its mandate, deals with the different categories as set out in our migration 
legislation and policies separately. 
</p>
<p>55. In relation to unionization, the lack of collective bargaining and weak trade 
unionism in this sector increases the level of vulnerability and marginalization. The 
government is concerned about the lack of freedom of association in the sector and the lack 
of an effective voice by workers. This has resulted in the Department of Labour 
commissioning a study to identify and isolate the reasons why freedom of association in the 
sector is so poor and how unionization can be improved. It is anticipated that the research </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>findings will point to possible interventions that can assist the parties in the sector to 
enhance freedom of association17. 
</p>
<p>56. <b>Paragraph 51: </b>The notion that is expressed in paragraph 51 that the Extension of 
Security of Tenure Act (ESTA) led to a movement towards contracts of employment is not 
correct. Although it should be acknowledged that there were unintended consequences of 
the  ESTA Act, contracts of employment was already a feature in the sector and did not 
result as a response to ESTA, but further, government provided them with a draft contract 
of employment that reflects the protection provided in the South African legislation. One of 
the unintended consequences of ESTA was that the right to tenure was separated from the 
employment relationship and farmers reduced on farm accommodation provision for 
workers. 
</p>
<p>57. The sectoral determination in the sector clearly states that the rights as set out 
therein does not and should not impact on the rights of farm workers that have accrued 
tenure rights in terms of other legislation or processes. 
</p>
<p>58. It should be mentioned that through research conducted for the Department of 
Labour in 2010, an analysis of the impact of minimum wages on poverty was made. The 
definition of poverty employed was <i>wage poverty</i>, and the results of the study on wage-
related poverty indicated that the decline in poverty levels as a result of the introduction of 
a minimum wage was most apparent for workers covered by the Domestic, Farm and 
Forestry sectoral determinations. Sectoral determination deals with the protection of 
workers in vulnerable sectors/areas of work. The determination sets minimum working 
hours, minimum wages, number of leave days and termination rules. In terms of minimum 
wages and in an endeavour to protect the vulnerable workers in South Africa, the Minister 
of Labour, on 18 January 2012, announced to progressively raise the minimum wage for 
farm workers, effective from 01 March 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Food adequacy: managing nutrition transition 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Paragraph 56: </b>Promotion of healthy living is at the centre of the government's 
provision of quality health care to the people of South Africa. In this regard, the 
Department of Health launched a campaign in 2005 with the slogan, &quot;Vuka South Africa, 
Move for your Health&quot;. It is now part of the government's programme to create a &quot;Long and 
Healthy Life for All South Africans&quot;. The programme consists of five components, namely 
nutrition, promotion of physical activity, tobacco control, promotion of safer sex practices 
and combating substance and alcohol abuse. In terms of nutrition, government promotes the 
intake of traditional and indigenous foods combined with physical activity. The food based 
dietary guidelines forms a basis for promoting healthy eating habits as well as promoting 
the use of a variety of healthy foods that are culturally acceptable. These guidelines are 
promoted in all national healthy lifestyle campaigns 
</p>
<p>60. Furthermore, government is also in the process of adopting a plan for the complete 
replacement of trans-fatty acids with polyunsaturated fats and regulations will enforce the 
restriction of trans-fatty acids in foodstuffs.

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Ratify the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights 
</b></p>
<p>61. The government assures the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to Food 
that it places a premium on economic, social and cultural rights and that the ratification of 
the ICESCR and its Optional Protocol is of high importance. The internal government 
processes are advancing and it is envisaged that with the co-operation of all government 
actors, including oversight parliamentary committees, the South African government should 
be in a position to ratify the ICESCR and its Optional Protocol as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Improve and streamline the collection of data on food security 
</b></p>
<p>62. Government acknowledges that food insecurity information is pivotal to the policy 
goals of eradicating hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity. South Africa has several 
types of information systems that are relevant for understanding food insecurity but micro 
level analysis is crucial to the spatial development process. Information systems widely 
used for policy development and decision making include Early Warning Information 
Systems, Agriculture Information Systems, Health and Nutrition Information Systems, 
Marketing Information Systems and General Vulnerability Information Systems.  
</p>
<p>63. The draft Food Security Policy for South Africa provides for the implementation of 
a Food Insecurity Information System. Once the policy is approved by Cabinet, an 
understanding of the country&#8223;s food insecurity situation will be undertaken immediately, by 
</p>
<p>first ascertaining the national chronic food insecurity and vulnerability baseline and its key 
drivers. The monitoring system would identify predominant risk factors to food insecurity, 
and will be the repository for a national data set on food availability (production, imports), 
access (income, markets), utilization (health, nutrition &amp; sanitation) and the stability of 
supply (climate change). The usefulness of the data in analysing the food insecurity and 
vulnerability situation would be ensured by answering the following questions:  
</p>
<p>(a) Who are the food insecure and where do they live? 
</p>
<p> (b) What is the nature, frequency and depth of their food insecurity and 
vulnerability? 
</p>
<p> (c) What are the characteristics of their livelihood systems and what constraints 
are they experiencing? 
</p>
<p> (d) What is the nature and degree of the risks they are facing? 
</p>
<p> (e) What are the characteristics of their coping strategies in response to these 
risks and are they effective? 
</p>
<p>64. Food security and vulnerability assessments are being structured to harmonise the 
diverse data collection and assessment methodologies currently used in various surveys. 
The structures and methodology used will conform to that of other SADC Member States in 
order to undertake a regional analysis of food security. 
</p>
<p>65. Through the War on Poverty Campaign, government has developed social and 
economic databases of poor households and their members that live in the most deprived 
municipal wards of the country. The information of household needs that is obtained from 
this database is then referred to government departments so that the services can be 
delivered to those poor households. This Campaign also includes coverage of indigenous 
communities, where a trust was established to drive the development agenda of the entire </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>community. Farms bought through this mechanism have entered into a partnership with a 
private entity for enhancing management of the community and raising productivity. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Strengthening existing strategies that relate to food security, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular the Outcomes Approach, by adopting a right-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach 
</b></p>
<p>66. The government has agreed on 12 outcomes as a key focus of work up to 2014. This 
has resulted in the signing of the performance agreements between the President and 
Ministers. The performance agreement outlines high level outputs, metrics and key 
activities for each outcome. The performance agreements were converted into a detailed 
Delivery Agreement that reflects the commitment of key partners which in turn contribute 
to achieving outcome 7. Effective coordination structures were established. This will allow 
the partners of the Delivery Agreements to work together for the next four years in the 
coordination and implementation of the outcomes and carry out monitoring and evaluation 
in terms of the achievement of the outcomes. The Delivery Agreements are an important 
tool for budgeting processes and final budget allocations and these arrangements have 
adequate sanctions and accountability mechanisms built in them.  
</p>
<p>67. It should be rewarded that government programmes are inclusive of a human rights 
based approach in their nature and South Africa has consistently supported the notion of the 
Right to Development which has been mainstreamed into all polices and strategies. Please 
see paragraphs 40&#8211;42 in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Pursuing and accelerating the creation of comprehensive rural 
</b></p>
<p><b>development policies, including agricultural policies, which will 
</b></p>
<p><b>progressively improve the right to food of vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>68. Food security is integral to the Bill of Rights and other sections of the Constitution 
of the Republic of South Africa. The Constitution refers to food in Section 27 1 (b) of the 
Bill of Rights, which states that &#8220;every citizen has a right to access to sufficient food and 
</p>
<p>water&#8221; and that &#8220;the State must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its 
</p>
<p>available resources, to achieve the realisation of this right&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>69. The right to food is a multifaceted and multidimensional issue which will never be 
attained through agricultural production alone. It requires inter-sectoral co-ordination and 
the integration of existing policies and programmes in health, education, and environmental 
protection, as well as in agrarian reform and overall economic development of a country. 
The emphasis of the Food Security Policy for South Africa prioritises household food 
security within a context of national food security. The right to food will be attained 
through the implementation of the following five Food Security Policy strategic objectives:  
</p>
<p>(a) Alignment of agriculture and land reform towards economic development, 
particularly of the poor and marginalized, by implementing a government food purchase 
programme, providing inputs and support services for the establishment of sustainable 
rural, peri-urban and urban agriculture; 
</p>
<p> (b) Improved market participation of the emerging agricultural sector through the 
implementation of the Agri-BEE Charter which requires agri-industry, through preferential 
procurement practices, to prioritise and broaden its supply base for the benefit of the 
emerging agricultural sector, and procuring 10% of their products from the emerging 
agricultural sector. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p> (c) Improved food distribution to ensure access by all through the availability of 
improved safety nets [cash and food transfers], and agro-industrial spatial development 
supported by local production; 
</p>
<p> (d) Improved nutrition education through ensuring that every District acquires 
the services of a nutritionist to assist communities in health meal planning, analysis of the 
nutritional indices and assistance with consumer literacy; 
</p>
<p> (e) Increased investment in research and technology to respond to the production 
challenges currently facing the country, such as climate change and bio-energy. 
</p>
<p>70. The Draft Food Security Policy to Cabinet, is aimed at developing a framework for 
South Africa to prescribe a threshold for food secure and insecure individuals and also to 
inform strategies and national food security programmes aimed at ensuring food security 
for all at all times. Government will also be introducing the Zero Hunger Programme, 
modelled on the very successful Brazilian initiative. The Zero Hunger Programme aims to 
shift procurement of food by schools and other government institutions, in favour of 
smallholder producers, while supporting subsistence production and stimulating local food 
economies in a manner that seeks to enhance local household-level food security. 
</p>
<p>71. In terms of rural development, the Department of Rural Development and Land 
Reform is in constant consultations aimed at promoting the participation of civil society in 
policy dialogue, the planning and implementation of programmes relating land reform and 
rural development. The DRLDR has also established the National Reference Group 
(NAREG) that includes organized agriculture, traditional leadership, land reform 
beneficiaries and land rights organizations. A land rights management facility has also been 
established and a panel of attorneys has been appointed in order provide mediation, 
negotiation and the handling of court cases with regards to evictions on farms. 
</p>
<p>72. The recently published Green Paper on Land Reform, as discussed paragraph 28 of 
this Addendum, seeks to undo the legacy of apartheid&#8223;s highly unequal land distribution. 
</p>
<p>The measures proposed in the current Green Paper are informed by an in-depth analysis of 
the consequences of previous policies as well as comparable studies in other countries 
</p>
<p>73. In terms of post settlement support, as discussed in paragraph 29 of this Addendum, 
it is important to emphasise that in 2010, government introduced, as a means of responding 
to challenges of collapsing land reform projects, and defunct irrigation schemes in the 
former homelands, a new programme called Recapitalisation and Development. 
Government also launched the National Rural Youth Service Corps, where more than 7 000 
young people from rural communities participate in the programme, which includes 
training in disaster management, construction and information management. 
</p>
<p>74. In terms of the empowerment of rural women, and as discussed in paragraph 37 of 
this Addendum, government will continue to ensure that issues of rural women remain on 
government&#8223;s agenda. Government hosted the National Rural Women Summit in 2011, as 
</p>
<p>well as two provincial summits which served as platforms for rural women to influence 
government&#8223;s Women Empowerment Strategy. Through the DWCPD, Issues relating to 
women, children and people will continue mainstreamed into all government programmes 
such as the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme. 
</p>
<p>75. In terms of the EPWP, and as discussed in paragraphs 42&#8211;43, EPWP projects are 
encouraged to at least employ participants for 100 days or more per annum, so as to impact 
positively on the socio-economic conditions of the poor unemployed people. Through the 
Community Works Programme (CWP), unemployed people are provided work for 100 
days per annum and this programme has been mainstreamed to comply with EPWP 
principles. The CWP is an employment safety net, giving participants a minimum number 
of regular days of work, typically two days a week or eight days a month, thus providing a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>predictable income stream. The CWP is an ongoing Programme that does not replace 
government&#8223;s existing social grants programme but complements it. Other programmes of 
</p>
<p>the EPWP that are longer in duration include the Home Community Based Care (HCBC) 
and Early Childhood Development (ECD). 
</p>
<p>76. As elaborated in paragraph 42 of this Addendum, Government will continue to 
ensure that the response to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger is comprehensive, 
combining cash transfers with social wage packages. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Improving programmes to strengthen household food production and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prioritizing support for collective projects 
</b></p>
<p>77. The right to food can only be achieved through multifaceted interventions. Through 
the Zero Hunger and other Social Welfare Programmes, food insecure populations will gain 
access to productive resources and will be linked to protected markets. In situations where 
the food insecure population is unable to gain access to productive resources, food security 
interventions will ensure that this segment gains access to income and job opportunities in 
order to enhance their purchasing power to food. Where the food insecure population does 
not have control over any means of production and are in a destitute situation &#8211; food 
security interventions will ensure that the state provides relief measures that may be short to 
medium term on sustained basis in the form of food and cash transfers. 
</p>
<p>78. Government will strengthen the support given to vulnerable subsistence and 
smallholder producers, through, among others, the following programmes: (a) the 
Comprehensive Agriculture Support Programme (CASP), (b) Ilima/Letsema and (c) Micro 
Agricultural Finance Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA). CASP makes provision for 
agricultural support for targeted beneficiaries of the land and agrarian reform programme. 
Ilima/Letsema is aimed at increasing Household Food Production (HFP) for subsistence 
farmers and MAFISA ensures access to cheap production loans with very little collateral.    
</p>
<p>79. The support is also extended collectively to Community and Institutional Gardens 
which are also found in urban areas. Community Garden participants constitute members of 
the community that have a shared vision . Its basic aim is usually for both sharing for 
household consumption and for sales. The land is usually allocated  by a traditional 
authority or municipality within a commonage  urban area for use communally by the 
communities  resident in that area, again the cost is based on what is provided as per an 
approved  business plan which may in addition to what is provided in a home garden ,some 
are also equipped with boreholes,  pumps and an irrigation system  and a pack house and 
storerooms.)  
</p>
<p>80. The Institutional Garden is usually a partnership initiative between the community 
and an institution like a clinic or a school. The produce might be intended to support 
patients or school feeding schemes and partly for the participating members or even for sale 
to members of the community.  
</p>
<p>81. Government aims to strengthen coordination and support provided by the various 
government ministries, private sector and civil society to subsistence and smallholder 
farmers. As an intervention Cabinet, in 2010, approved the Value Chain Financing Model, 
as a mechanism to ensure sustainable production of subsistence and smallholder farmers. </p>

</p>
<p><b> F. Prioritizing the rebuilding of local food systems and the strengthening 
</b></p>
<p><b>of links between local small-scale producers and urban consumers 
</b></p>
<p>82. Despite adequate food supply and distribution on a national level by the established 
commercial industry, the ultimate determinant of accessibility to urban food markets for 
smallholder farmers remains a challenge. Food security is not guaranteed by food 
availability; and as pointed out by the Special Rapporteur of the UNHRC on the Right to 
Food, this is demonstrated in a country like South Africa that is food sufficient nationally 
but has a high prevalence of malnutrition at household and individual level, which is 
indicative of poor diets in urban areas and lack of market access. The implementation of the 
Zero Hunger Programme will ensure sufficient access to food by all South Africans by 
ensuring that:  
</p>
<p>(a) Through contractual agreements, farmers will be linked to the commercial 
food value chains by ensuring that contracted food service providers to government 
institutions are linked food produced by smallholders. Over time service providers will 
therefore facilitate linkages of smallholder farmers to rural and urban consumers. 
</p>
<p> (b) Secondly the distribution of locally produced and processed food to 
government institutions and to the public at large is key towards the decrease in local food 
prices. For this purpose government food outlets and distribution agencies will be 
established, with an aim to enable smallholder farmers to contribute towards the 
development of rural economies and reduce unemployment. Furthermore, these outlets will 
ensure shorter rural food value chains for the consuming urban centres. In addition, the 
development of alternative local vegetable and processing facilities through the Agri-Park 
concept will not only ensure the off-take of excess household production, but will also 
provide local employment and a local supply of processed, nutritious and preserved 
foodstuffs. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Strengthening the protection of farm workers 
</b></p>
<p>83. In terms of the recommendation to certify union representatives to conduct farm 
inspections, it should be noted that the current labour regime only provides for inspectors 
that have so been appointed by the Minister of Labour, in line with the (BCEA section 63) 
it does not cater for the accreditation of any other agency except designated agents of 
bargaining councils. Inspections can therefore only be conducted in terms of the legislation. 
The inspectorates, on a regular basis conduct awareness campaigns as well as inspections 
(targeted, blitz and general) in the sector. Please also see paragraphs 49 &#8211; 58 of this 
Addendum. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Supporting agroecological processes 
</b></p>
<p>84. African agriculture is vulnerable to climate change and ensuring food security under 
a changing climate is therefore one of the major priorities of the continent. It is in this 
context that an African Ministerial Summit on Climate-Smart Agriculture was held in 
September 2011. This Summit developed a Communiqu&#233; and Action Plan that calls on 
developed countries and other partners, to support the implementation and scaling&#8208;up of 
early action programmes, including best practice and technologies in climate&#8208;smart 
agriculture and food security, through regional, subregional and national programmes and 
institutions as a matter of priority. It also urges African countries to invest in research, 
technology and information dissemination to facilitate the adaptation and application of 
climate&#8208;smart agriculture wherever possible. Furthermore, the Action Plan was launched 
during the COP17 High-Level Side Event on Climate-Smart Agriculture.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>85. Through Climate-smart agriculture, proven practical techniques and approaches will 
help achieve a triple win for food security, adaptation and mitigation. These techniques 
include mulching, intercropping, conservation agriculture, crop rotation, integrated crop-
livestock management, agro-forestry, improved grazing and improved water management. 
</p>
<p>86. Under the UN Convention on Biological Biodiversity, South Africa has also pledged 
to adopt an ecosystems approach to all aspects of human enterprise, and agro-ecology is 
key to this approach.  
</p>
<p>87. DAFF is currently finalizing a policy on organic farming which will help promote 
the agro-ecology in the production system of South Africa. The government is also looking 
at promoting aquaculture development both for the sea and land areas. In this regard it has 
also established an Aquaculture Demonstration Centre. 
</p>
<p>88. South Africa is currently advancing rural development through Conservation 
Agriculture, based on sound agroecology principles. Such principles include conserving 
natural capital, protecting natural capital, re-investing the dividends of &#8222;green practice&#8223;, 
building ecosystem resilience, building natural capital explicitly and diversifying the factors 
of production. 
</p>
<p>89. The government will further work with rural communities to design innovative 
models for the creation of sustainable economic opportunities in agroecology for Small 
Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) and cooperatives, in the context of the 
Comprehensive Rural Development Programme. There is also a strong focus on local 
production to replace imports so that the carbon footprint of the sector is minimised.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Concluding remark 
</b></p>
<p>90. The South Government is, notwithstanding its unique historical challenges, and lack 
of adequate resources, and as guided by its polices and national legislative framework, 
firmly on track towards meeting its obligations of ensuring food security for all in its 
jurisdiction.  
</p>
