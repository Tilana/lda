ARTICLE I
THE TRANSACTIONS
1.1 The Transactions.
(a) The Contribution.
(i) Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, (A) Sabine Investor Holdings shall contribute the Contributed LLC Interests to
Forest in exchange for the Contributed LLC Interests Consideration and (B) AIV Holdings
shall contribute the Contributed Stock Interests to Forest in exchange for the Contributed
Stock Interests Consideration (the shares issued pursuant to clauses (A) and (B),

contribution. The date and time the Contribution becomes effective shall be the “Effective
Time”.

execute and deliver an assignment evidencing the contribution, transfer and delivery from
Sabine Investor Holdings to Forest of the Contributed LLC Interests, in the form attached

the book entry issuance thereof and any other evidence of issuance reasonably
requested by Sabine Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings, or, if requested by Sabine
Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings, certificates of the Forest Senior Preferred Stock or
Forest Common Stock representing the Sabine Contribution Consideration.
(iii) Upon consummation of the Contribution, Forest shall be the sole shareholder of each
of the Contributed Corporations, and Forest and the Contributed Corporations shall be
the sole members of Sabine Holdings.
(iv) If, between the Original Execution Date and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Forest Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange
of shares, or any issuance of shares (other than the Rights) pursuant to the Rights Plan,
or any Rights shall have become exercisable pursuant to the Rights Plan, or any similar
event shall have occurred, then the Sabine Contribution Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change, but in all events
preserving voting rights in the Sabine Contribution Consideration no less favorable to
Sabine Investor Holdings and AIV Holdings, collectively, than if such event had not
occurred.
(b) The Contributed Corporations Mergers.
(i) On the Closing Date, following the Contribution, (A) Forest and the Contributed
Corporations shall execute and deliver, and Forest, as the sole stockholder of each of the
Contributed Corporations, will approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger

Certificates of Contributed Corporations Mergers are filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware and the Department of State of the State of New York or at such
subsequent time as Sabine Investor Holdings and Forest shall agree and as shall be
specified in the Certificates of Contributed Corporations Mergers (the date and time each
of the Contributed Corporations Mergers becomes effective being the “Contributed
Corporations Merger Effective Time”).
4
(iii) At the Contributed Corporations Merger Effective Time, the effect of the Contributed
Corporations Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and
the NYBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Contributed
Corporations Merger Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Contributed Corporations and Forest shall vest in Forest Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Contributed Corporations and
Forest shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of Forest Surviving Corporation. Upon
the consummation of the Contributed Corporations Mergers, Forest shall be the sole
member of the Sabine Holdings.
(c) The Sabine Mergers.
(i) On the Closing Date, following the Contributed Corporations Mergers, Sabine Holdings,
SOGH II and Sabine O&G shall be merged with and into Forest. As a result of the Sabine
Mergers, the separate existence of Sabine Holdings, SOGH II and Sabine O&G shall cease
and Forest shall continue as the surviving corporation after the Sabine Mergers (“Sabine-
Forest Surviving Corporation”).
(ii) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Sabine Mergers
to be consummated by filing certificates of merger relating to the Sabine Mergers (the
“Certificates of Sabine Mergers”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
the Department of State of the State of New York, in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL and NYBCL. The Sabine
Mergers shall become effective as specified in Section 1.1(c)(i), following the time at which
the Certificates of Sabine Mergers are filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or the Department of State of the State of New York or at such subsequent time
as Sabine Holdings, SOGH II, Sabine O&G and Forest shall agree and as shall be specified
in the Certificates of Sabine Mergers (the date and time the Sabine Mergers become
effective being the “Sabine Mergers Effective Time”).
(iii) At the Sabine Mergers Effective Time, the effect of the Sabine Mergers shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and NYBCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Sabine Mergers Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Sabine Holdings, SOGH II and Sabine O&G shall vest
in Sabine-Forest Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Sabine
Holdings, SOGH II and Sabine O&G shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
Sabine-Forest Surviving Corporation.
1.2 Closing. The closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”) shall take place at 9:00 a.m.
Houston time on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions (excluding conditions that, by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions as of the
Closing) set forth in Article VII, at the offices of Vinson & Elkins LLP, 1001 Fannin Street,
Houston, Texas 77002, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Sabine
Investor Holdings and Forest;
5
provided that, if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to such date, then the
Closing shall occur on the later of (i) the Business Day immediately following the final day
of the Marketing Period (or such earlier date within the Marketing Period specified by
Sabine Investor Holdings on at least two Business Days’ notice to Forest) and (ii) the date
the Closing would have been scheduled to occur pursuant to this paragraph if no effect
were given to this proviso, subject, in each of cases (i) and (ii), to the satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII as of the date determined pursuant to this
proviso (excluding conditions that, by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions as of the Closing).
The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the “Closing
Date.”
1.3 Organizational and Governing Documents. Forest shall take all requisite action to
(a) cause the bylaws of Forest (the “Forest Bylaws”) in effect as of and after the Effective
Time (until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law) to be in the form
attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D, except for such changes approved by Forest and
Sabine Investor Holdings (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (b) to cause the certificate of incorporation of Forest in effect as of and after the
Effective Time to be amended to include the amendments set forth in the form of certificate
of amendment attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A-1, with the “Series A Voting Ratio”

attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A-2 and (d) if the Name Change Amendment
Approval is obtained at the Forest Stockholder Meeting, to cause the certificate of

on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total
number of shares of Forest Common Stock subject to such Forest Stock Option, by (ii) the
excess, if any, of the amount of the Forest Stock Measurement Price over the exercise
price per share of Forest Common Stock applicable to such Forest Stock Option (with the
aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent), less such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. Forest shall pay or cause
to be paid to the holders of Forest Stock Options the cash payments described in this
Section 2.1(a) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any
event within ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Forest Stock Option for which the exercise price per share of Forest Common
Stock applicable to such Forest Stock Option equals or exceeds the Forest Stock
Measurement Price shall be cancelled pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) for no consideration.
(b) Forest Performance Unit Awards. Each Forest Performance Unit Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested as of the Effective Time and
be settled following the Effective Time in shares of stock or in cash in accordance with the
terms of the award agreement for such Forest Performance Unit Award (including
concluding the performance period as of the Closing Date for purposes of measuring
achievement of performance conditions).
(c) Forest Phantom Unit Awards. Each Forest Phantom Unit Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, become fully vested as of the Effective Time and be settled
following the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the award agreement for such
Forest Phantom Unit Award.
(d) Forest Restricted Shares. Each Forest Restricted Share that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and the
restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse.
(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Forest Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Forest Stock Plans) shall pass resolutions to effect the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.1.
2.2 Reservation of Shares; Registration. If the 2014 LTIP Proposal Approval is obtained,

Forest Material Adverse Effect. Forest has made available to the Sabine Parties true and

execution and delivery by Forest of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
to which it is a party and the consummation by Forest of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which it is a party have been, or,
in the case of Transaction Agreements to be delivered after the Original Execution Date,
will be, duly and validly authorized by Forest, and, except for the Forest Stockholder

such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors’
rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to legal principles of general applicability
governing the availability of equitable remedies, including principles of commercial
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (collectively, “Creditors’ Rights”).

(a) Forest has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated therein) required to be

the time filed, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Forest SEC Document and (ii) did not at the
time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the Original
Execution Date, then at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.
(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of Forest included in the Forest SEC
Documents (“Forest Financial Statements”) complied at the time it was filed as to form in
all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, has been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods presented thereby and fairly
presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position and operating results,
equity and cash flows of Forest and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of, and for the
periods ended on, the respective dates thereof, subject, however, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments.
12
(c) None of the Forest Entities has any liability, whether accrued, contingent, absolute or
otherwise, that would be required to be included in financial statements of Forest and its
consolidated Subsidiaries under GAAP except for (i) liabilities set forth on the
consolidated balance sheet of Forest dated as of December 31, 2013 or the notes thereto;
(ii) liabilities that have arisen since December 31, 2013, in the ordinary course of business;
and (iii) liabilities which would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would
not reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect.
3.8 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
(a) from and after December 31, 2013 through the Original Execution Date, the Forest
Entities have operated their business in all material respects only in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice and no Forest Entity has taken or agreed to
take any action that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, would constitute a breach of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii), or
(xiii) of Section 5.1(b); and (b) from and after December 31, 2013 through the Effective
Time, there has not been any event, occurrence or development which has had, or would
be reasonably expected to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect.
3.9 Title to Properties and Assets; Oil & Gas Properties.
(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, each
Forest Entity has title to or rights or interests in its real property and personal property
(and each real property and personal property at which material operations of Forest are
conducted) free and clear of all Encumbrances (such property, the “Forest Owned Real
Property”) (subject to Permitted Encumbrances), sufficient to allow it to conduct its
business as currently being conducted.
(b) Oil and Gas Property.
(i) Except for (A) property sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business
since the dates of the reserve reports prepared by DeGolyer & MacNaughton (“DeGolyer”)
relating to the Forest interests referred to therein as of December 31, 2013 (the “Forest
Reserve Reports”), (B) property reflected in the Forest Reserve Reports or in the Forest
SEC Documents as having been sold or otherwise disposed of, as of the Original
Execution Date or (C) matters that would not reasonably be expected individually to have,
and would not reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse
Effect, the Forest Entities have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties
forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Forest Reserve Reports and in each
case as attributable to interests owned by the Forest Entities, free and clear of any
Encumbrances, except for (X) Production Burdens and (Y) Permitted Encumbrances. For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, “good and defensible title” means such title that is
free from reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent person engaged in the business of
purchasing and owning, developing, and operating producing or non-producing oil and
gas properties in the geographical areas in which they are located, with knowledge of all of
the facts and their legal bearing, would be willing to accept the same acting reasonably.
13
(ii) The factual, non-interpretive data supplied by or on behalf of the Forest Entities to
DeGolyer relating to the Forest Entities’ interests referred to in the Forest Reserve Reports
and that was material to such firm’s estimates of proved oil and gas reserves attributable
to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Forest Entities in connection with the preparation of
the Forest Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided (or as modified or amended prior
to the issuance of the Forest Reserve Reports), accurate in all material respects. To
Forest’s Knowledge, any assumptions or estimates provided by the Forest Entities to
DeGolyer in connection with their preparation of the Forest Reserve Reports were made in
good faith and on a reasonable basis based on the facts and circumstances in existence
and that were to Known to Forest at the time such assumptions or estimates were made.
The estimates of proved oil and gas reserves provided by the Forest Entities to DeGolyer
in connection with the preparation of the Forest Reserve Reports complied in all material
respects with Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. Forest’s internal
proved reserve estimates prepared by management for the year ended December 31, 2013
were not, taken as a whole, materially lower than the conclusions in such Forest Reserve
Reports. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development
and production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion
by production, there has been no material change in respect of the matters addressed in
the Forest Reserve Reports that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Forest
Material Adverse Effect.
(iii) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, (A) all
proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties of the
Forest Entities are being received by them in a timely manner; and (B) as of March 31,
2014, no proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from any such Oil and Gas
Properties (to the extent operated by Forest or any of its Subsidiaries) are being held in
suspense (by Forest, any of its Subsidiaries, any third party operator thereof or any other
Person or individual) for any reason other than awaiting preparation and approval of
division order title opinions for recently drilled wells. Section 3.9(b)(iii) of the Forest
Disclosure Letter sets forth all the Oil and Gas Leases included in any Forest Entity’s Oil
and Gas Properties that are scheduled to expire (in whole or in part) at any time in the
twelve (12) month period immediately following the execution of this Agreement.
(iv) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, (i) each
Oil and Gas Lease to which any Forest Entity is a party is valid and in full force and effect,
and (ii) all rentals, shut-ins and similar payments (and all Production Burdens) owed to any
Person or individual under (or otherwise with respect to) any such Oil and Gas Leases
have been properly and timely paid. Except as would not reasonably be expected
individually to have, and would not
14
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, all
royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties and other Production Burdens with
respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by any Forest Entity have been timely
and properly paid. Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and
would not reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse
Effect, no Forest Entity (and, to Forest’s Knowledge, no third party operator) has violated
any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act which, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or
entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in
the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by any Forest Entity and no Forest Entity (or, to
Forest’s Knowledge, any third party operator) has received written notice from any other
party to any such Oil and Gas Lease (A) that any Forest Entity (or such third party
operator, as the case may be) has breached, violated or defaulted under any such Oil and
Gas Lease or (B) threatening to terminate, cancel, rescind or procure judicial reformation
of any such Oil and Gas Lease.
(v) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, all Oil
and Gas Properties operated by any Forest Entity (and, to the Knowledge of Forest, all Oil
and Gas Properties owned or held by any Forest Entity and operated by a third party) have
been operated in accordance with reasonable, prudent oil and gas field practices and in
material compliance with the applicable Oil and Gas Leases, Oil and Gas Contracts and
applicable Laws.
(vi) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, none of
the Oil and Gas Properties of the Forest Entities is subject to any preferential, purchase,
preemptive, consent or similar right which would become operative as a result of the entry
into (or the consummation of) the Transactions.
(vii) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, all of
the wells located on the Oil and Gas Leases or on (or otherwise associated with) any other
Oil and Gas Properties of the Forest Entities have been drilled, completed and operated in
accordance with all applicable Law and the terms and conditions of all applicable Oil and
Gas Leases and Oil and Gas Contracts, and all drilling and completion (and the plugging
and abandonment) of all such wells and all related development, production and other
operations have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Law and the terms and
conditions of all applicable Oil and Gas Leases and Oil and Gas Contracts. No Forest
Entity has elected not to participate in any operation or activity proposed with respect to
any of the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by it (or them, as applicable) that could
result in a penalty or forfeiture as a result of such election not to participate in such
operation or activity that would be material to the Forest Entities, taken as a whole and is
not reflected in the Forest Reserve Reports. The Forest Reserve Reports accurately reflect
in all material respects any payout balances applicable to any well included in the Oil and
Gas Properties held or owned by any Forest Entity.
(viii) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, and to
the Knowledge of Forest, (A) Section 3.9(b)(viii) of the Forest
15
Disclosure Letter lists, as of March 31, 2014, all transportation, plant, production and other
imbalances and overlifts with respect to Hydrocarbon production from the Forest Entities’
Oil and Gas Properties, and (B) no imbalance listed on Section 3.9(b)(viii) of the Forest
Disclosure Letter constitutes all of the Forest Entities’ share of ultimately recoverable
reserves in any balancing area pursuant to any balancing Contract.
(ix) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, with
respect to the Forest Entities’ Oil and Gas Properties, all currently producing wells and all
tangible equipment included therein, used in connection with the operation thereof or
otherwise primarily associated therewith (including all buildings, plants, structures,
platforms, pipelines, machinery, vehicles and other rolling stock) are in a good state of
repair and are adequate and sufficient to maintain normal operations in accordance with
past practices (ordinary wear and tear excepted).
(x) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material Adverse Effect, neither
the entry into (nor the consummation of) the Contribution or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will result in a breach of the terms of, or give rise to any
right of cancellation, termination or forfeiture under, any Oil and Gas Contract included in
any Forest Entity’s Oil and Gas Properties.
3.10 Intellectual Property. Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to
have, and would not reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Forest Material
Adverse Effect, (a) the Forest Entities own or have the right to use pursuant to a license,
sublicense, agreement or otherwise all material items of Intellectual Property required in
the operation of their business as presently conducted; (b) no third party has asserted in
writing delivered to any Forest Entity an unresolved claim that any Forest Entity is
infringing on the Intellectual Property of such third party; and (c) to the Knowledge of

under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law), as a transferee or successor or by Contract. No Forest Entity has been a member of
a combined, consolidated, unitary or similar group for Tax purposes, other than any group

transaction that is disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (other than by reason of the Reincorporation Merger (as
defined in the Shareholder’s Agreement)) none of the Forest Entities has any plan or
intention to cause the issuance of voting interests in Forest to any Person that would

the creation of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances) on any asset of
any Sabine Entity, except, in the cases of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such defaults or rights
of termination, cancellation, amendment, acceleration, violations or Encumbrances, as
would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not reasonably be
expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect. The Sabine Entities
are in material compliance with, and no event has occurred which would constitute (with or
without the giving of notice or the passage of time or both) a material default under or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration under any terms of any
Contracts evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money.

O&G on its web site at www.sabineoil.com (or if revised or amended by a later posting prior
to the Original Execution Date, then at the time of such posting or amendment) contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.
(b) The Sabine Parties have made available to Forest copies of the Sabine Financial
Statements. The Sabine Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods presented thereby and fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position and operating results,
equity and cash flows of Sabine O&G, on a combined consolidated basis, as of, and for

unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments. (i) Sabine Holdings’
only asset is its equity interest in SOGH II, (ii) SOGH II’s only asset is its equity interest in
Sabine O&G, (iii) neither Sabine Holdings nor SOGH II has any liability, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute or otherwise, other than liabilities solely arising from its equity
interest in SOGH II or Sabine O&G, as applicable, and ordinary course entity-level liabilities
solely relating to its maintenance as a limited liability company (such as state franchise or
minimum taxes) and (iv) the Contributed Corporations’ only asset is their equity interest in
Sabine Holdings.
(c) None of the Sabine Entities (other than the Contributed Corporations) has any liability,

liability, whether accrued, contingent, absolute or otherwise, other than liabilities solely
arising from its equity interest in Sabine Holdings and ordinary course entity-level
liabilities solely relating to its maintenance as a corporation (such as state franchise or
minimum taxes).
4.8 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
(a) from and after December 31, 2013, through the Original Execution Date, the Sabine
Entities have operated their business in all material respects only in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice, and no Sabine Entity has taken or agreed to
take any action that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, would constitute a breach of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii) or
(xiii) of Section 5.2(b), and (b) from and after December 31, 2013, through the Effective
Time, there has not been any event, occurrence or development which has had, or would
be reasonably expected to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect.
31
4.9 Title to Properties and Assets; Oil & Gas Properties.
(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, each
Sabine Entity has title to or rights or interests in its real property and personal property
(and each real property and personal property at which material operations of Sabine are
conducted) free and clear of all Encumbrances (such property, the “Sabine Owned Real
Property”) (subject to Permitted Encumbrances), sufficient to allow it to conduct its
business as currently being conducted.
(b) Oil and Gas Property.
(i) Except for (A) property sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business
since the dates of the reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott Co. (“Ryder Scott”) relating
to the Sabine Entity interests referred to therein as of December 31, 2013 (the “Sabine
Reserve Reports”), (B) property reflected in the Sabine Reserve Reports or in the Sabine
Annual Report as having been sold or otherwise disposed of, as of the Original Execution
Date or (C) matters that would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would
not reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, the
Sabine Entities have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the
basis for the reserves reflected in the Sabine Reserve Reports and in each case as
attributable to interests owned by the Sabine Entities, free and clear of any
Encumbrances, except for (A) Production Burdens and (B) Permitted Encumbrances. For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, “good and defensible title” means such title that is
free from reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent person engaged in the business of
purchasing and owning, developing, and operating producing or non-producing oil and
gas properties in the geographical areas in which they are located, with knowledge of all of
the facts and their legal bearing, would be willing to accept the same acting reasonably.
(ii) The factual, non-interpretive data supplied by or on behalf of the Sabine Entities to
Ryder Scott relating to the Sabine Entities’ interests referred to in the Sabine Reserve
Reports and that was material to such firm’s estimates of proved oil and gas reserves
attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Sabine Entities in connection with the
preparation of the Sabine Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided (or as modified or
amended prior to the issuance of the Forest Reserve Reports), accurate in all material
respects. To Sabine Investor Holdings’ Knowledge, any assumptions or estimates
provided by the Sabine Entities to Ryder Scott in connection with their preparation of the
Sabine Reserve Reports were made in good faith and on a reasonable basis based on the
facts and circumstances in existence and that were to Known to the Sabine Entities at the
time such assumptions or estimates were made. The estimates of proved oil and gas
reserves provided by the Sabine Entities to Ryder Scott in connection with the preparation
of the Sabine Reserve Reports complied in all material respects with Rule 4-10 of
Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. Sabine Holdings’ internal proved reserve
estimates prepared by management for the year ended December 31, 2013 were not, taken
as a whole, materially lower than the conclusions in such Sabine Reserve Reports. Except
for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development
32
and production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion
by production, there has been no material change in respect of the matters addressed in
the Sabine Reserve Reports that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sabine
Material Adverse Effect.

reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, (A) all
proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties of the
Sabine Entities are being received by them in a timely manner and (B) as of March 31,
2014, no proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from any such Oil and Gas
Properties (to the extent operated by any Sabine Entity) are being held in suspense (by
any Sabine Entity, any third party operator thereof or any other Person or individual) for
any reason other than awaiting preparation and approval of division order title opinions
for recently drilled wells. Section 4.9(b)(iii) of the Sabine Disclosure Letter sets forth all the
Oil and Gas Leases included in any Sabine Entity’s Oil and Gas Properties that are
scheduled to expire (in whole or in part) at any time in the twelve (12) month period
immediately following the execution of this Agreement.
(iv) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect,
(i) each Oil and Gas Lease to which any Sabine Entity is a party is, valid and in full force
and effect, and (ii) all rentals, shut-ins and similar payments (and all Production Burdens)
owed to any Person or individual under (or otherwise with respect to) any such Oil and
Gas Leases have been properly and timely paid. Except as would not reasonably be
expected individually to have, and would not reasonably be expected in the aggregate to
have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding
royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned
or held by any Sabine Entity have been timely and properly paid. Except as would not
reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not reasonably be expected in the
aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, no Sabine Entity (and, to Sabine
Investor Holdings’ Knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of, or
taken or failed to take any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor
thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by any Sabine Entity and no Sabine Entity (or, to Sabine Investor
Holdings’ Knowledge, any third party operator) has received written notice from any other
party to any such Oil and Gas Lease (A) that any Sabine Entity (or such third party
operator, as the case may be) has breached, violated or defaulted under any such Oil and
Gas Lease or (B) threatening to terminate, cancel, rescind or procure judicial reformation
of any such Oil and Gas Lease.
(v) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, all Oil
and Gas Properties operated by any Sabine Entity (and, to the Knowledge of Sabine
Investor Holdings, all Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by any Sabine Entity and
operated by a third party) have been operated in accordance with reasonable, prudent oil
and gas field practices and in material compliance with the applicable Oil and Gas Leases,
Oil and Gas Contracts and applicable Laws.
33
(vi) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, none
of the Oil and Gas Properties of the Sabine Entities is subject to any preferential, purchase,
preemptive, consent or similar right which would become operative as a result of the entry

reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, all of
the wells located on the Oil and Gas Leases or on (or otherwise associated with) any other
Oil and Gas Properties of the Sabine Entities have been drilled, completed and operated in
accordance with all applicable Law and the terms and conditions of all applicable Oil and
Gas Leases and Oil and Gas Contracts, and all drilling and completion (and the plugging
and abandonment) of all such wells and all related development, production and other
operations have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Law and the terms and
conditions of all applicable Oil and Gas Leases and Oil and Gas Contracts. No Sabine
Entity has elected not to participate in any operation or activity proposed with respect to
any of the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by it (or them, as applicable) that would
result in a penalty or forfeiture as a result of such election not to participate in such
operation or activity that would be material to the Sabine Entities, taken as a whole is not
reflected in the Sabine Reserve Reports. The Sabine Reserve Reports accurately reflect in
all material respects any payout balances applicable to any well included in the Oil and
Gas Properties held or owned by any Sabine Entity.

reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, and to
the Knowledge of Sabine Investor Holdings, (A) Section 4.9(b)(viii) of the Sabine
Disclosure Letter lists, as of March 31, 2014, all transportation, plant, production and other
imbalances and overlifts with respect to Hydrocarbon production from the Sabine Entities’

Disclosure Letter constitutes all of the Sabine Entities’ share of ultimately recoverable
reserves in any balancing area pursuant to any balancing Contract.

otherwise primarily associated therewith (including all buildings, plants, structures,
platforms, pipelines, machinery, vehicles and other rolling stock) are in a good state of
repair and are adequate and sufficient to maintain normal operations in accordance with
past practices (ordinary wear and tear excepted).
(x) Except as would not reasonably be expected individually to have, and would not
reasonably be expected in the aggregate to have, a Sabine Material Adverse Effect, neither
the entry into (nor the consummation of) the Contribution or the other transactions

right of cancellation, termination or forfeiture under, any Oil and Gas Contract included in
any Sabine Entity’s Oil and Gas Properties.

ARTICLE VI
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS
6.1 Preparation of Proxy Statement.
(a) Promptly following the Amended Execution Date, Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV
Holdings, and Forest shall cooperate in preparing, and Forest shall file with the SEC, a
proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the
“Proxy Statement”) in order to seek the Forest Stockholder Approval, the Authorized
Share Amendment Approval, the Name Change Amendment Approval and, subject to the
Forest Board approving the Forest Oil Corporation 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (the
“2014 LTIP”) (which shall be considered in good faith by the Forest Board as promptly as
practicable following the mutual agreement of Forest and Sabine Investor Holdings on the
definitive form thereof), the LTIP Proposal Approvals. The Proxy Statement shall comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Sabine Investor
Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as is practicable after filing, and each of Sabine
Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Forest Common Stock
as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement shall have been cleared by the SEC.
No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement shall be filed without the approval of
Sabine Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such amendment or supplement relates to information
in such document relating to any Sabine Party, AIV Holdings or their Affiliates or their
business, financial condition or results of operations.
(b) Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest each agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, to use reasonable best efforts so that none of the information supplied or to
be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at
the time of the Forest Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which such statement was made,
not misleading.
52
(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any party discovers any information relating to
Sabine Holdings or Forest, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information the parties shall promptly file with the SEC and, to the extent required by
Law, disseminate such information to the stockholders of Forest.
(d) The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any correspondence,
communications or comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by
the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and shall supply each other with (i) copies of all correspondence
and a description of all material oral discussions between it or any of its respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions and (ii) copies of all orders of the
SEC relating to the Proxy Statement.
6.2 Stockholders Meeting; Recommendations. Forest shall take, in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), the NYBCL and the
Forest Organizational Documents, all actions reasonably necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the “Forest Stockholder Meeting”) as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the SEC confirms it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement for the purpose of securing the Forest Stockholder
Approval, the Authorized Share Amendment Approval, the Name Change Amendment
Approval and, subject to the Forest Board approving the 2014 LTIP and resolving to
recommend that the holders of Forest Common Stock vote to approve the LTIP Proposals
(which resolution shall, if the Forest Board approves the 2014 LTIP, be considered in good
faith by the Forest Board as promptly as practicable following such approval), the LTIP
Proposal Approvals. The Proxy Statement shall (i) state that the Forest Board has
(A) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (B) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best
interests of Forest and its stockholders; and (C) include the recommendation of the Forest
Board that the holders of Forest Common Stock approve the issuance of the Sabine
Contribution Consideration, the Authorized Share Amendment and the Name Change
Amendment (such recommendations described in clause (C), the “Forest
Recommendation”) (except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), to the extent that Forest
effects a Forest Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.4); and (ii) subject
to the consent of the Forest Financial Advisor, include the written opinion of the Forest
Financial Advisor, that, as of the Original Execution Date and based upon and subject to
the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in such opinion, the Exchange
Ratio (as defined in the Original Merger Agreement) is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of Forest Common Stock. Unless there has been a Forest Recommendation
Change in accordance with Section 6.4, Forest shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from stockholders of Forest votes in favor of the Forest Stockholder Approval, the
Authorized Share Amendment Approval and the Name Change Approval. The Forest
Board shall not effect a Forest Recommendation Change, except pursuant
53
to and solely as permitted by Section 6.4. Notwithstanding any Forest Recommendation
Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, this
Agreement, the Authorized Share Amendment, the Name Change Amendment and,
subject to the Forest Board approving the 2014 LTIP and resolving to recommend that the
holders of Forest Common Stock vote to approve the LTIP Proposals, the LTIP Proposals
shall be submitted to the stockholders of Forest at the Forest Stockholder Meeting and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Forest of such obligation. In addition
to the foregoing, Forest shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition
Proposal other than the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Forest may adjourn or postpone the meeting of Forest’s stockholders
to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to Forest’s stockholders or, if as of the time for which the
meeting of Forest’s stockholders is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Forest Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such
meeting; provided, however, that no adjournment may be to a date on or after three
(3) Business Days prior to the End Date.
6.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.
(a) Subject to applicable Law, Forest will provide and will cause Forest’s Subsidiaries and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, investment bankers, advisors, and agents and other representatives (collectively,
“Representatives”) to provide Sabine Investor Holdings and its authorized
Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice,
such reasonable access to the offices, employees, customers, suppliers, properties,
books and records of Forest Entities (so long as such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of Forest or the Forest Entities) as Sabine Investor Holdings
may reasonably request. Subject to applicable Law, Sabine Investor Holdings and AIV
Holdings will provide and will cause Sabine Investor Holdings’ and AIV Holdings’
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to provide Forest and its
authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice, such reasonable access to the offices, employees, properties, books and records
of the Sabine Entities (so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of Sabine Investor Holdings or the Sabine Entities) as Forest may reasonably
request. No party shall have access to personnel records of the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or
other information that in such other party’s good faith opinion the disclosure of which
could subject such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability. No party shall
be permitted to conduct any sampling or analysis of any environmental media or building
materials at any facility of the other party or its Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of such other party, which may be granted or withheld in such other party’s sole
discretion.
(b) With respect to any information disclosed pursuant to this Section 6.3, each of Sabine
Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest shall comply with, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations
under the confidentiality agreement, dated January 17, 2014, previously executed by
Sabine O&G and Forest (the “Confidentiality Agreement”). No party shall be required to
provide access to or disclose any information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client
54
privilege of such party or any Subsidiary of such party or contravene any Contract, Law or
order (it being agreed that the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy
or contravention).
6.4 No Solicitation.
(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, Forest shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and
terminate any solicitation, encouragement, knowing facilitation, discussions, negotiations
or other similar activities with any Persons other than Sabine Investor Holdings and its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives that may be ongoing with respect to, or that
may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) immediately
revoke or withdraw access of any Person other than Sabine Investor Holdings and its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives to any data room (virtual or actual) containing
any non-public information with respect to Forest or its Subsidiaries previously furnished
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request or require (to the fullest extent
permitted under any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement with such Person)
such Person to promptly return or destroy, as elected by Forest, all confidential
information concerning Forest and its Subsidiaries.
(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, Forest shall not, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers not to, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate (including by way of furnishing information),
knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making or
submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations
with, disclose any non-public information or non-public data relating to Forest or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of
Forest or any of its Subsidiaries to, or assist, facilitate or cooperate with any effort by any
third party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement,
including any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal (each, a “Alternative Acquisition
Agreement”) (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in circumstances
contemplated in Section 6.4(c)).
(c) The foregoing clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 6.4 notwithstanding, Forest either
directly or through its Representatives may take the actions described in Section 6.4(b)(ii)
with respect to a third party prior to but not after, the receipt of the Forest Stockholder
Approval and the Authorized Share Amendment Approval, if (i) Forest receives after the
Original Execution Date a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal from such third party
that did not result from, or was not otherwise facilitated by, any breach of this Section 6.4
and (ii) before taking any such actions, the Forest Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that (1) Forest shall not deliver any non-public information
or non-public data to such third party or
55
afford such third party any access prior to entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such third party and (2) Forest shall, as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours), provide to Sabine Investor Holdings a copy of
such executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall
prohibit Forest, or the Forest Board, directly or indirectly through any officer, employee or
Representative informing any Person that Forest is party to this Agreement and informing
such Person of the provisions of this Section 6.4. Forest agrees that it shall substantially
concurrently with delivery to any third party provide to Sabine Investor Holdings any
information concerning Forest or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any third party in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal which information was not previously provided
to Sabine Investor Holdings.
(d) Forest shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt), advise Sabine Investor Holdings orally and in writing of any request for
information or any Acquisition Proposal received by Forest, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of its or their Representatives from any Person, or any inquiry with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, and Forest shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt), provide to Sabine Investor Holdings copies of any
written Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the Person making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Forest shall keep Sabine Investor Holdings informed of
any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal on a reasonably current basis (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours).
Forest agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any Person subsequent to the Original Execution Date that prohibits Forest from
providing such information to Sabine Investor Holdings in accordance with this
Section 6.4(d).
(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, neither the Forest Board nor any
committee thereof will (i) qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to
Sabine Investor Holdings (or publicly propose to do so) the Forest Recommendation;
(ii) fail to include the Forest Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (iii) fail to
recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the shares of
Forest Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of any such
offer; or (iv) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal (actions described in subclauses (i) through (iv), being referred to
as a “Forest Recommendation Change”).
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4(e), prior to, but not after, receipt
of the Forest Stockholder Approval and the Authorized Share Amendment Approval, the
Forest Board may make a Forest Recommendation Change and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal that has not
been withdrawn and did not result from a breach of this Section 6.4, if prior to taking such
action, the Forest Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. The Forest Board shall not make a Forest Recommendation Change pursuant
to this Section 6.4(f) and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) unless
prior to taking such action (i) Forest has given Sabine Investor Holdings at least three
(3) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of any
56
such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal)) and has contemporaneously provided to Sabine Investor Holdings a copy of
any proposed transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal,
(ii) Forest has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Sabine Investor Holdings (in each case, if Sabine Investor Holdings seeks to
negotiate with Forest) during such notice period to enable Sabine Investor Holdings to
revise the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (iii) following the end of such notice period, the
Forest Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Sabine Investor Holdings, and shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that notwithstanding
such proposed changes, the third party proposal remains a Superior Proposal, and
(iv) Forest has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.4.
Any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of a Superior Proposal after
delivery of a notice in respect of such Superior Proposal shall require delivery of another
notice and shall commence a new three (3) Business Day notice period in respect of such
Superior Proposal pursuant to this Section 6.4(f) shall commence. No Forest
Recommendation Change shall change the approval of this Agreement for purposes of
Section 902 of the NYBCL, and in no event shall Forest or the Forest Board be permitted
to rescind or amend the resolutions approving this Agreement as in effect on the Original
Execution Date. No Forest Recommendation Change shall have the effect of causing any
state (including New York) corporate Takeover Law or other similar statute to be
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Transactions).
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4(e), prior to, but not after, receipt
of the Forest Stockholder Approval and the Authorized Share Amendment Approval, the
Forest Board may make a Forest Recommendation Change in response to a Forest
Intervening Event if the Forest Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Forest Board to
effect a Forest Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the directors of Forest under applicable Law. The Forest Board shall not make a Forest
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.4(g) unless prior to taking such
action (i) Forest has given Sabine Investor Holdings at least three (3) Business Days’ prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the reasons
therefor), (ii) Forest has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Sabine Investor Holdings (in each case, if Sabine Investor Holdings seeks
to negotiate with Forest) during such notice period to enable Sabine Investor Holdings to
revise the terms of this Agreement such that a failure of the Forest Board to effect a Forest
Recommendation Change in response to such Forest Intervening Event would not be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of Forest under applicable Law and
(iii) following the end of such notice period, the Forest Board shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Sabine Investor
Holdings, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that notwithstanding such proposed changes, the
failure of the Forest Board to effect a Forest Recommendation Change in response to a
Forest Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of
Forest under applicable Law.
(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Forest Board from complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law, including (i) taking and disclosing
57
to Forest stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act, or (ii) making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the Forest
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that
in no event shall any such requirement affect, eliminate or modify the obligations of Forest
under, or the effect of any such actions under, this Section 6.4 with respect to a Forest
Recommendation Change.
(i) Forest acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.4 by any Representative of Forest or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 6.4 by Forest.
(j) Definitions of Acquisition Proposal and Superior Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement:
“Acquisition Proposal” means any offer, proposal, or indication of interest relating to any
transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) from any third party involving: (A) a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation
or similar transaction involving Forest or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, taken
together, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of Forest’s consolidated assets based
on fair market value, (B) any purchase (including any lease, long term supply agreement,
mortgage, pledge or other arrangement having similar economic effect), directly or
indirectly, in any manner of any business or assets (including equity securities or other
interest in one or more Subsidiaries) that constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
consolidated assets of Forest or that generate fifteen percent (15%) or more of Forest’s
consolidated revenues, or (C) the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership
or control of any securities of Forest after which any person or group would own
securities representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total voting power of any class
of Forest’s securities (or that are exchangeable for or convertible into voting securities
having such voting power).
“Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, on its most recently
amended or modified terms, if amended or modified (except that references in the
definition of “Acquisition Proposal” to “15%” shall be replaced by “50%”) made by a third
party, that the Forest Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) (i) would be, if consummated, more favorable to
Forest’s stockholders than the Transactions (taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Sabine Investor Holdings in response to such offer or
otherwise)) and relevant terms, timing, conditions, and legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal, the identity of the third party making such proposal and the
conditions for completion of such proposal and (ii) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
consummated.
58

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Sabine Investor
Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement including using reasonable best efforts to
(i) cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, (ii) obtain all
necessary waivers, consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations (including the

the Transactions or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(v) execute and deliver additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest
agree not to extend any waiting period under HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.
(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV
Holdings and, where applicable, Forest shall (i) make or cause to be made the
registrations, declarations and filings required of such party under the U.S. Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) with respect to

declarations and filings or such transactions, (iv) promptly notify the other party of any
material communication between that party and the FTC, the DOJ, or any other
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the application of an

communication relating to the antitrust merits, any potential remedies, commitments or

Person, relating to any Regulatory Law or any investigation or other Proceeding pursuant
to any Regulatory Law in connection with the Transactions or the other transactions

best efforts to cooperate with the other party in connection with any such registrations,
declarations and filings and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
of any such agency or other Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other

transaction. Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this Section 6.5(b) as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings or Forest, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.5(b), materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of Forest and its Subsidiaries or
Sabine Holdings and its Subsidiaries or as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns.
(c) In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, Sabine Investor Holdings and
AIV Holdings shall, to the extent necessary to obtain expiration of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, agree to or take any action that would result in making proposals, offering
remedies, commitments or undertakings, executing or carrying out agreements (including
consent decrees) or submitting to Laws or orders (i) providing for the license, sale,
divestiture or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of trust or
otherwise) of any capital stock or other Equity Interests of a Subsidiary of Forest or Sabine
Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings, business, assets, categories of assets, or products of
Sabine Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings, Forest or their respective Subsidiaries or the
holding separate of the capital stock or other Equity Interests of a Subsidiary of Forest or
Sabine Investor
60
Holdings or AIV Holdings or (ii) otherwise imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on
Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings, Forest or any of their respective Subsidiaries’
freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses, assets,
categories of assets, or products of Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings, Forest or any
of their respective Subsidiaries (any matter referenced in the foregoing clause (i) or
(ii) being a “Regulatory Divestiture”). Sabine Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings may
condition any Regulatory Divestiture on the consummation of the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will Sabine
Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings be obligated to make or agree to make any Regulatory
Divestiture that would reasonably be expected individually or in the aggregate to be
material to Forest and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Forest agrees that it (A) shall not publicly,
or before any Governmental Entity or third party, offer, suggest, propose or negotiate, and
shall not commit to, or enter into, consent to or acquiesce to any Regulatory Divestiture
without the prior written consent of Sabine Investor Holdings and AIV Holdings and
(B) shall commit to, enter into, consent to or acquiesce to any Regulatory Divestitures as
directed by Sabine Investor Holdings and AIV Holdings, provided that Regulatory
Divestitures are conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement.
6.6 Certain Notices. From and after the Original Execution Date until the earlier to occur of
(a) the Closing Date and (b) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
each of Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest shall promptly notify the other
of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any Event, to the extent known by such party
that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of the other party to effect
the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6
shall not cure the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, the failure to comply with
any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. From and after the Original
Execution Date, Forest shall keep Sabine Investor Holdings reasonably informed
regarding its communications with any Forest shareholder with respect to the applicability
of clause (v) of the definition of “Acquiring Person” set forth in the Rights Plan to any
such shareholder, including by promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt
thereof, providing Sabine Investor Holdings with (i) a copy of any certification received by
Forest in the form set forth in Exhibit D to the Rights Plan, and (ii) copies of any written
communications and summaries of any oral communications with shareholders with
respect to the continuing accuracy of the certifications contained therein
6.7 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the amendment and
restatement of this Agreement shall be a release mutually agreed upon by Sabine Investor
Holdings, AIV Holdings and Forest. Thereafter, Sabine Investor Holdings and AIV
Holdings on the one hand, and Forest, on the other hand, shall consult with and obtain the
approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) before issuing any other press release or other public statements with respect
to the Transactions or this Agreement, to the extent they have not been previously issued
or disclosed and shall not issue any such other press release prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement related to the
trading of the shares of either party on any securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any
such press release or making any such public announcement.
61
6.8 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Forest shall indemnify and hold harmless (and
advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing), in the same manner as provided by
Forest immediately prior to the Original Execution Date, each present and former director,
officer and employee of Forest and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities (collectively,
the “Indemnified Parties”), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such Indemnified
Party is or was a director, officer or employee of Forest or any of its Subsidiaries whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or
omissions by directors or officers of Forest or its Subsidiaries in their capacities as such
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and shall
provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified Parties, in all such cases to the
same extent that such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the Original Execution Date by Forest pursuant to Forest’s certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, or by any one of Forest’s
Subsidiaries pursuant to such Subsidiary’s organizational documents and indemnification
agreements of any Subsidiary of Forest, if any, in existence on the Original Execution
Date.
(b) Forest agrees that, until the six year anniversary date of the Effective Time, Forest’s
Organizational Documents shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification of the current and former directors and officers of Forest than are
currently provided in Forest’s Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such individuals until the expiration of the statutes of limitations
applicable to such matters or unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required
by applicable Law.
(c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Forest shall maintain in effect for the benefit of
the Indemnified Parties an insurance and indemnification policy with an insurer with the
same or better credit rating as the current carrier for Forest that provides coverage for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) covering each
such person covered by the officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policy of Forest on
terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than
those of Forest’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policy in effect on the Original
Execution Date; provided, however, that Forest shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid
by Forest for such coverage; and provided, further, however, that if any annual premium
for such insurance coverage exceeds 300% of such annual premium, Forest shall obtain
as much coverage as reasonably practicable for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Forest’s obligations under this Section 6.8(b) may be satisfied by Forest, or, with the
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) of Sabine Investor Holdings,
Forest, purchasing a “tail” policy from an insurer with substantially the same or better
credit rating as the current carrier for Forest’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance
policy,
62
which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers each
person covered by Forest’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policy in effect on the
Original Execution Date or at the Effective Time for actions and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those of Forest’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policy in effect on the Original
Execution Date. If such “tail” policy has been obtained by Forest prior to the Effective
Time, Forest shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by Forest.
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by
Contract or otherwise. Forest shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity obligations provided in this Section 6.8 unless it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to such indemnity.
(e) If Forest, or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Forest honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8.
6.9 Employee Benefits.
(a) For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date (the “Benefits Continuation
Period”), Forest shall maintain or cause to be maintained annual base salaries and
incentive compensation opportunities for the benefit of each employee who is not a Key
Employee but who is actively employed by the Forest Entities on the Closing Date and
who remain employed by one of the Forest Entities after the Closing Date (each, an
“Employee”) which are, in each case, no less favorable than those provided to the
applicable Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. Forest shall also
maintain or cause to be maintained for each Employee for the duration of the Benefits
Continuation Period other employee benefits (excluding defined benefit, retiree health and
equity-based compensation arrangements) that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than the employee benefits (excluding defined benefit, retiree health and equity-based
compensation arrangements) made available to similarly situated employees of the Sabine
Parties immediately prior to the Closing Date.
(b) During the Benefits Continuation Period, Forest shall maintain or cause to be
maintained annual base salaries for the benefit of each Key Employee who is actively
employed by the Forest Entities on the Closing Date and who remains employed by one of
the Forest Entities after the Closing Date (each, a “Covered Key Employee”) which in each
case is no less favorable than the annual base salary provided to the applicable Covered
Key Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. Forest shall also maintain or
cause to be maintained for each Covered Key Employee for the duration of the Benefits
Continuation Period incentive bonus opportunities and other employee benefits
(excluding defined benefit, retiree health and equity-based compensation arrangements)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
63
incentive bonus opportunities and employee benefits (excluding defined benefit, retiree
health and equity-based compensation arrangements) made available to similarly situated
employees of the Sabine Parties immediately prior to the Closing Date.
(c) Forest shall provide or cause to be provided to each Employee and Covered Key
Employee (together, the “Covered Employees”) who experiences an “Involuntary
Termination” (as defined in the Forest Oil Corporation Severance Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the “Forest Severance Plan”) or the Key Employee
Severance Agreement, as applicable) during the Benefits Continuation Period with the
applicable severance benefits described in the Forest Severance Plan or applicable Key
Employee Severance Agreement.
(d) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in a new
employee benefit plan maintained by Forest or any of its Subsidiaries (a “New Benefit
Plan”), Forest shall cause such New Benefit Plan to recognize the service of such Covered
Employee with the Forest Entities (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting and, except with respect to any defined benefit pension plan or
retiree health plan, benefit accrual under such New Benefit Plan, to the same extent such
service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Forest
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior
to the Effective Time; provided that such recognition of service shall not operate to
duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service.
With respect to any New Benefit Plan that is a health, dental, vision plan or other welfare
plan in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate, for the plan year in which
such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, Forest shall use reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under
such New Benefit Plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent
such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Forest Benefit Plan in which
such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) recognize any health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in
the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and
annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such New Benefit Plan.
(e) The Sabine Parties and AIV Holdings acknowledge and agree that a “change of
control” or “corporate change” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Forest Benefit
Plans will occur at the Effective Time and that Forest will interpret and administer the
Forest Benefit Plans such that the Effective Time shall be treated as a “change of control”
or “corporate change” (or similar phrase) for purposes of such plans.
(f) Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall be construed to limit the right of Forest or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Forest Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Forest Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
plan nor shall anything in this Section 6.9 be construed to require Forest or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Forest Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee.
(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 10.7, the provisions of this Section 6.9 are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee,
director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing
herein shall be construed as an amendment to, or an undertaking to effect an amendment
to, any Forest Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose.
64
6.10 Section 16(b) Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Forest shall take all such steps as
may be required to cause any dispositions of equity securities of Forest (including
derivative securities with respect thereto) or acquisitions of equity securities of Forest

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Forest or who will
become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Forest to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.
6.11 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Laws or any anti-takeover provision or restriction on

Forest Board shall grant such approvals and take all such actions as are necessary or
advisable so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute, regulation or provision in Forest’s organizational documents on
such transactions.
6.12 Transaction Litigation. In the event that any litigation or Proceeding related to this
Agreement, the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(“Transaction Litigation”) is brought, or, to the Knowledge of Sabine Investor Holdings or
Forest, threatened in writing, against a party and/or the members of the party’s board of
directors prior to the Effective Time, such party against which the litigation or Proceeding
has been brought or which has knowledge of such threat shall promptly notify the other
party of such Transaction Litigation and shall keep the other party reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the board of directors
of such party, each of Sabine Investor Holdings and Forest shall give the other party the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation (other
than any litigation or settlement where the interests of Sabine Investor Holdings or its
Affiliates are adverse to those of Forest or its Affiliates), and neither Sabine Investor
Holdings nor Forest shall settle, compromise, come to an arrangement regarding or agree
to settle, compromise or come to an arrangement regarding any such Transaction
Litigation, without the other party’s prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that Sabine Investor
Holdings may settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Forest
if such settlement provides (a) for a complete release of the claims, if any, related to or
against Forest and all directors and officers of Forest and (b) that the sole remedy shall be
monetary damages not to exceed $20,000,000.

the Sabine Mergers to be treated as a transaction that is disregarded for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries’ logos in connection with the

thereto. Any action taken by Forest at the specific request of the Sabine Parties in
accordance with this Section 6.16(a) shall not be deemed to be a breach of or result in any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement.
(b) The Sabine Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause
to be obtained, the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment Letter and shall comply with their obligations, and enforce their rights,
under the Commitment Letter in a timely and diligent manner. In the event that any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, the Sabine
Parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to amend, modify, supplement, alter,
restate, substitute or replace the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, and in any event prior to the End Date, with alternative debt
financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with remaining portion of the Debt
Financing (if any) and with any equity commitment or cash on hand, to consummate the
Refinancing) on terms materially no less favorable to the Sabine Parties and Forest taken
as a whole than those set forth in the Commitment Letter with respect to conditions
precedent or contingencies to funding. The Sabine Parties shall have the right from time to
time to amend, modify, supplement, alter, restate, substitute or replace or waive any of its
rights under the Commitment Letter or any associated definitive documentation with
respect to the Debt Financing or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing from the same or alternative financing sources; provided,
that (i) the amount thereof shall be sufficient, when taken together with remaining portion
of the Debt Financing (if any), any other debt, any equity commitment and cash on hand,
to consummate the Refinancing and (ii) any such amendment, modification, supplement,
alteration, restatement, substitution or replacement or
68
waiver of any rights under the Commitment Letter or any associated definitive
documentation shall not expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the
funding of the Debt Financing as set forth in the applicable Commitment Letter or
associated definitive documentation. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms
“Commitment Letter” and “Financing Commitments” shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment with respect to any alternative
financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Commitment Letter and Financing
Commitment remaining in effect at the time in question).
(c) The Sabine Parties shall provide Forest with prompt oral and written notice of (1) any
material breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letter or definitive
documentation with respect to the Debt Financing (if executed prior to the Closing Date) of
which the Sabine Parties becomes aware, (2) the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Financing Source with respect to any breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or definitive
documentation with respect to the Debt Financing (if executed prior to the Closing Date) of
any provision thereof and (3) any amendment or modification to the Commitment Letter
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Refinancing or otherwise materially adversely affect the ability or
likelihood of the Sabine Parties to timely consummate the Refinancing. The Sabine Parties
shall keep Forest reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of their efforts to consummate the Debt Financing or any alternative
financing.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds
or financing (including the Debt Financing) by the Sabine Parties or any Affiliate be a
condition to any of the Sabine Parties’ obligations hereunder.
(e) Without limiting any obligation to provide Requested Information (including if
previously provided Requested Information has gone stale), if Forest at any time in good
faith reasonably believes that it has delivered the Requested Information in compliance
with Section 6.16(a) to Sabine Holdings, it may deliver to the Sabine Parties a written notice
to such effect, in which case Forest shall be deemed to have delivered the then applicable
Requested Information at the time of delivery of such notice unless the Sabine Parties
shall provide to Forest within five (5) days after the delivery of such notice a written notice
that describes with reasonable specificity the information that constitutes Requested
Information that the Sabine Parties in good faith reasonably believe Forest has not
delivered.
6.17 Certain Tax Matters.
(a) Sabine Investor Holdings shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed, all federal and state income Tax Returns required to be filed by or with
respect to Sabine Holdings and its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period ending

prior elections, accounting methods and positions taken on prior Tax Returns) unless
required by Law.
69
(b) Sabine Investor Holdings shall control any dispute, including any audit or other
examination by any Governmental Authority, and any judicial or administrative

its subsidiaries for a taxable period ending after the Closing Date, without Forest’s prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(c) Forest shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide Sabine Investor Holdings, at

the Sabine Parties in commencing (i) an offer to repurchase or discharge one or more
series of the Notes (as defined below) (each, a “Debt Tender”) and/or (ii) a consent
solicitation to amend or remove one or more covenants in the Indentures (as defined
below) such that, among other things, no aspect of the transactions contemplated hereby

Indenture” and, together with the 2020 Indenture, the “Indentures”), in compliance with the

Debt Offer (collectively, the “Debt Offer Documents”) a reasonable period of time in
advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer, (B) the Sabine Parties will consult with

requested by the Sabine Parties in connection with the Debt Offer including, (i) the prompt
entry into a dealer manager and/or solicitation agreement, with dealer manager(s) and

execution
70
or their affiliates or (B) are selected by the Sabine Parties in consultation with Forest and
(ii) the execution of the Debt Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements
thereto) on a timely basis, provided, however, that nothing herein shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the operations of Forest or
any of its Subsidiaries.
(c) Forest covenants and agrees that, if required by the Sabine Parties, promptly following
the Debt Offer expiration date, each of Forest and its applicable Subsidiaries as is
necessary shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
applicable trustee to) execute a supplemental indenture to each Indenture, which
supplemental indentures shall implement the amendments described in the Debt Offer
Documents so that they become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Debt Offer. Concurrent with

payment and thereafter promptly pay for the Notes that have been properly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer and in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Offer.
(d) The Sabine Parties shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in

other in the preparation of the Debt Offer Documents (including all amendments and
supplements thereto). The Debt Offer Documents (including all amendments or
supplements thereto) and all other communications with the holders of the Notes in
connection with the Debt Offer (including any materials provided, furnished or filed
pursuant clause (e) immediately below) shall be subject to prior review of, and comment
by, the Sabine Parties and Forest and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them.
(e) If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer any information is discovered by
the Sabine Parties or Forest that either the Sabine Parties or Forest reasonably believes
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents so that
the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by the
Forest describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of Forest and its
Subsidiaries to the holders of the Notes (which supplement or amendment and
dissemination may take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.18(e), Forest shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with
the Debt Offer and such compliance will not be deemed a breach of this Section 6.18(e).
(f) The Sabine Parties shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer
manager, information agent, solicitation agent, tabulation agent, depositary or other agent
retained in connection with the Debt Offer upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-

71

for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
incurred by the Forest Entities in connection with the cooperation of the Forest Entities
contemplated by this Section 6.18 and shall indemnify and hold harmless Forest, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the Debt Offer and any information used in connection therewith, except with respect
to any information provided by any of the Forest Entities.
(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the consummation of the Debt Offer be
a condition to any of the Sabine Parties’ obligations hereunder.
6.19 Rights Plan. Substantially concurrently with the execution of this Agreement on the
Amended Execution Date, the Forest Board shall adopt the Rights Plan and declare a
dividend distribution of rights to purchase the Junior Preferred Stock related thereto.
Forest may, in its sole discretion, amend or waive any provision of the Rights Plan, redeem
such Rights (as defined in the Rights Plan) or make any determinations with respect to the
Rights Plan, the Rights and the Forest Junior Preferred Stock; provided that Forest may
not take any such action that would have an adverse effect on the issuance of the Sabine
Contribution Consideration to Sabine Investor Holdings and AIV Holdings.
6.20 Further Assurance. If, after the Effective Time, Sabine Investor Holdings, AIV Holdings
or any of their Affiliates (other than Forest and its Subsidiaries) owns or holds any assets
or rights that as of the Original Execution Date or Closing Date constituted or related to the
Sabine Business, Sabine Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings shall, or shall cause their
applicable Affiliates to, transfer such assets or rights to Sabine-Forest Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries.
6.21 Exchange Listing. Forest shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Forest
Common Stock issuable as Sabine Contribution Consideration and the Forest Common

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including in this Section 8.3, each

available funds to an account designated by Sabine Holdings.
(d) If Forest terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then Forest shall pay

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If a party fails to
promptly pay the amount due by it pursuant to this Section 8.3, interest shall accrue on
such amount from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement until the date of payment at the prime rate of J.P. Morgan Chase, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. If, in order to obtain payment,
the other party commences a suit that results in judgment for such party, the defaulting
party shall pay the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses)
77
incurred in connection with such suit. Each of the parties further acknowledges that the
payment of the amounts by Sabine Investor Holdings and Forest specified in this
Section 8.3 is not a penalty, but in each case is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Sabine Holdings (and Sabine Investor Holdings, in the case
of a payment to Sabine Holdings) or Forest, as the case may be, in the circumstances in
which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Forest be
required to pay the Termination Fee more than once. The parties agree that, in the event
that Sabine Holdings is entitled to receive the Termination Fee in accordance with the
provisions herein and Forest pays the Termination Fee to Sabine Holdings, Forest has no
further liability to Sabine Investor Holdings or Sabine Holdings of any kind in respect of
this Agreement and the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall relieve any party of any liability for
any damages resulting from or arising out of fraud or Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement.

10.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.
10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the Forest Disclosure Letter,
the Sabine Disclosure Letter, and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
10.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties, in whole or in part (whether by
operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and
any attempted or purported assignment without such consent shall be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
10.6 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may to the extent legally allowed,
(a) extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereunder, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance
96
by the other of any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.
10.7 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than (a) the rights of any Indemnified Party solely pursuant to
Section 6.8 (which shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time shall occur), (b) the
rights of holders of Forest Common Stock and holders of equity awards of Forest to
pursue claims for damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for any Sabine

holders of Forest Common Stock and/or equity awards of Forest, in Forest’s sole
discretion, (c) the rights of holders of Forest Common Stock and holders of equity awards
of Forest to receive the consideration specified in Article II (which shall not arise unless

Representatives, to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 10.7, Section 10.9,

not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect
any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to an Article,
Section, Schedule, Exhibit or Annex, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
a Schedule to, an Exhibit to or Annex to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they

event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any arty by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.
97

SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE

State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions
of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a
defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement of this
Agreement or if any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit
or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties irrevocably agree that all claims relating to
such action, proceeding or transactions shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware
State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject
matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.2 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.
(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT IT WILL
NOT, AND WILL NOT PERMIT ITS AFFILIATES TO, BRING OR SUPPORT ANY
PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST THE FINANCING
SOURCES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT
TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE BANK
FINANCING AND/OR THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, IN ANY
FORUM OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR ANY COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN
THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND AGREE THAT THE
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 10.9(C) HEREOF SHALL BE
APPLICABLE TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
98
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.9(c).
10.10 Disclosure Letters. The statements in the Forest Disclosure Letter and the Sabine
Disclosure Letter relate to the provisions in the section of this Agreement to which they
expressly relate; provided, however, that any information set forth in one section of the
Forest Disclosure Letter or the Sabine Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, shall also be
deemed to apply to each other section (other than Sections 3.8(b), 3.15, 4.8(b), and 4.15), to
which its relevance is reasonably apparent. In the Forest Disclosure Letter and the Sabine
Disclosure Letter, (a) all capitalized terms used but not defined therein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in this Agreement; (b) the section numbers correspond to the
section numbers in this Agreement; and (c) inclusion of any item in a disclosure letter
(i) does not represent a determination that such item is material or establish a standard of
materiality, (ii) does not represent a determination that such item did not arise in the
ordinary course of business and (iii) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an
admission to any third party concerning such item.
10.11 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that each would be
irreparably damaged in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that
any non-performance or breach of this Agreement by any party could not be adequately
compensated by money damages alone and that the parties would not have any adequate
remedy at law. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
any other party of any provisions contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party
shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law
or equity, including monetary damages, except as limited by Section 8.3) to seek and
obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such provisions, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. Each party further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10.11, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of
any such bond or similar instrument. The parties further agree that they shall not object to
the granting of any injunctive relief on the basis that an adequate remedy at law may exist.
10.12 Joint Liability; Obligation. Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
made in this Agreement by any Sabine Party or AIV Holdings on the one hand or Forest
on the other hand shall be deemed a representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
made by all of such respective parties jointly and all liability and obligations relating
thereto shall be deemed a joint liability and obligation of all such respective parties.
Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Forest, Sabine Investor Holdings or
AIV Holdings to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Forest, Sabine Investor Holdings or AIV Holdings, as
appropriate, to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.
99
10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall
constitute one and the same document. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in “portable document format” (“.pdf”) form, or
by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper
document bearing the original signature.
10.14 Amendment. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, and except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented
only by a written instrument executed and delivered by all the parties, whether before or
after approval of the Contribution and/or Merger; provided, however, that, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made for which applicable Law or the rules of any
relevant stock exchange requires further approval by stockholders or members without
such further approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment shall be made to
Section 10.7, Section 10.9, this Section 10.14 or Section 10.16 which would be adverse to
the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of such Financing Sources.
10.15 Representation by Counsel. Each of the parties agrees that it has been represented
by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and that it has executed the same upon
the advice of such independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the
drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not
be construed against any party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the parties waive
the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
10.16 Certain Agreements with Respect to Financing Sources. Each of the parties agree
on behalf of themselves and their respective equity holders, controlling persons, Affiliates,
and Representatives (collectively, the “Related Parties”) that (a) the Financing Sources
and their and their respective current former or future equity holders, controlling persons,
Affiliates or Representatives and each of their successors and assigns shall be subject to
no liability or claims by the Related Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with the Bank
Financing or Debt Financing, or the performance of services by such Financing Sources
or their Affiliates or Representatives with respect to the foregoing and (b) no Related
Parties (other than the Sabine Parties and AIV Holdings) shall be subject to any liability or
claims by the Financing Sources arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 10.16 shall limit the rights or obligations that any
Party would have to the Financing or Debt Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter
related fee letters or any definitive documentation in respect of the foregoing.
