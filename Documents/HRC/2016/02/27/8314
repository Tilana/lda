<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The period under review was an extraordinary year for human rights. Global 
financial and economic, climate, energy and food crises, famine in the Horn of Africa, 
armed conflict in Africa and the Middle East, resurgent racism and xenophobia and 
lingering poverty continued to challenge the international human rights movement. In the 
midst of failures of governance around the world in dealing with these challenges, civil 
society became mobilized, first in Tunisia, then across the Arab region, and ultimately in 
cities across the globe. My Office responded to these events with the full range of tools and 
resources available to us, as did the Human Rights Council, the special procedures and the 
treaty bodies that we support. Our mission in advancing freedom from fear and want has 
never been more relevant nor strained. 
</p>
<p>2. In 2011, I established a country office in Tunisia and human rights staff have been 
integrated into the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. As at December 2011, 
OHCHR had 58 field presences: 13 country/stand-alone offices, 15 human rights 
components of peace missions, 12 regional offices and 18 human rights advisers within 
United Nations country teams. These human rights presences are critical for providing 
national counterparts with direct and targeted assistance in addressing human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>3. I conducted missions, in chronological order, to Israel and the occupied Palestinian 
territory, the Russian Federation, Germany, Guinea, Senegal, the United Republic of 
Tanzania, Mauritania, Norway, Australia, Mexico, Tunisia, the Republic of Moldova, 
France, Maldives and Indonesia. The Deputy High Commissioner visited Nepal, the Sudan, 
Haiti, Lithuania, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, the United States of America, Ireland, the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Poland, Qatar and Mali. The 
Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights visited Ethiopia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Afghanistan, 
Iraq, Spain, Turkey and Canada.  
</p>
<p>4. The sharp increase in the tasks requested of my Office, including those arising from 
new, often unfunded mandates, the steadily expanding system of human rights treaty 
bodies, commissions of inquiry and requests from Member States for assistance have tested 
the limits of our resources. I am grateful to my staff for their hard work and professional 
dedication, and appeal to Member States to provide us with adequate resources to enable us 
to undertake effectively our ever-expanding work.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Thematic priorities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening human rights mechanisms and the progressive 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of international human rights law  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Strengthening human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Human Rights Council 
</i></p>
<p>5. The Human Rights Council responded to many human rights crises in 2011. It held 
four special sessions on the human rights situation in Libya and the Syrian Arab Republic. 
With the support of OHCHR, it established commissions of inquiry on C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Libya 
and the Syrian Arab Republic to investigate violations of international law and to 
recommend actions. 
</p>
<p>6. Following the sixteenth special session, I set up a fact-finding mission on the Syrian 
Arab Republic, as requested by the Human Rights Council in its resolution S-16/1. The </p>


<p>mission was regrettably not granted access into the country. In June 2011, the Council 
adopted resolution 17/24, in which it requested OHCHR to monitor and report on the 
human rights situation in Belarus. Regrettably, I received no response to my request to send 
a mission for the purpose of fulfilling this mandate.  
</p>
<p>7. The Office has provided support to an increasing number of panel discussions of the 
Council (six for the eighteenth session) to address specific and emerging human rights 
issues, including the rights of victims of terrorism, the human rights aspects of terrorist 
hostage-taking, children working and/or living on the street, violence against women, 
integration of a gender perspective into the work of the Council, the right to adequate health 
of older persons, the role of international cooperation for the rights of persons with 
disabilities, languages and culture of indigenous peoples, best practices in the fight against 
racism, the human rights of people of African descent, the promotion of a culture of 
tolerance and peace, and the realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>8. Despite calls made during the Council review for a more rationalized programme of 
work and calendar of resolutions, the Council has continued to adopt record numbers of 
resolutions, bringing the total number in 2011 to 108, as against 80 in 2010. This has 
resulted in the increase of new mandates, including reports, panels and other activities. It is 
increasingly difficult for the Office to give them all the attention and dedication that they 
deserve.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Universal periodic review 
</i></p>
<p>9. By the end of October 2011, all Member States had been reviewed, with a 100 per 
cent participation rate in the universal periodic review. The first cycle of the universal 
periodic review, which will be officially concluded in 2012, allowed us to take stock of the 
human rights situation in all Member States and provided a framework for each State to 
commit publicly to implementing universal periodic review recommendations.  
</p>
<p>10. Drawing on the resources of the Voluntary Fund for Participation in the Universal 
Periodic Review Mechanism, OHCHR convened 35 interregional, regional and national 
workshops to advise both States on the preparation of their national reports and 
stakeholders on their input to the review.  
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR has also provided assistance in follow-up to the universal periodic review 
recommendations in some 40 countries by means of, inter alia, the Universal Periodic 
Review Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance. It organized or co-
organized, with Regional Offices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 
the Commonwealth Secretariat and the International Organization of la Francophonie, 
regional, subregional or interregional meetings involving Members States, national human 
rights institutions and civil society actors in order to share information, experiences and 
good practices and to promote continued engagement in the process throughout the second 
cycle. 
</p>
<p>12. The modalities for the second cycle as adopted by the Council seek to strike a 
balance between reviewing the implementation of accepted recommendations and the 
consideration of new developments. Responsibility for implementation rests primarily with 
States, but other stakeholders have a role to play, and wide participation remains critical to 
ensure that the universal periodic review follow-up is integrated into national agendas. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Special procedures 
</i></p>
<p>13. Supporting the work of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council remains 
a priority for my Office. The role of special procedures remains essential in providing the 
Council with timely and reliable information, including at its special sessions.  </p>


<p>14. The Council strongly rejected any act of intimidation or reprisal against those who 
cooperate with the United Nations and its representatives in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>15. The Council established several new mandates: a new working group on 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, a special rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, an independent expert on C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, a special rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees 
of non-recurrence and an independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and 
equitable international order. At its eighteenth special session, the Human Rights Council 
also created a special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab 
Republic once the mandate of the commission of inquiry comes to an end. The mandate of 
the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Burundi came to an end. There 
are now 45 special procedures mandates (35 thematic and 10 geographically related), 
including six five-member working groups. The Council also expanded the scope of the 
mandate on toxic waste, to encompass the human rights obligations related to 
environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. 
</p>
<p>16. From January to November 2011, special procedures mandate holders conducted 75 
country visits and issued 543 communications. More States extended standing invitations to 
special procedures, bringing the number of such invitations to 89 in November. However, 
approval by States of visits and responses to communications remain at around 35 per cent. 
The Council, in the review of its work and functioning, again called on States to cooperate 
effectively with the procedures and reaffirmed the principles of independence, integrity and 
expertise, which enable the mandate holders to fulfil their functions effectively. 
</p>
<p>17. My Office continued to strive for efficient use of resources in supporting these 
mechanisms and encouraged them to continue to improve the coordination and 
harmonization of working methods. Induction sessions for newly appointed mandate 
holders have become routine. A joint communications report is submitted to the Human 
Rights Council at each of its sessions. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Treaty bodies 
</i></p>
<p>18. The Committee on Enforced Disappearances held its first session in November. The 
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities considered its first State party report, 
the initial report of Tunisia. In 2011, treaty bodies adopted some 120 concluding 
observations and 130 decisions on individual cases. As at November, there were 2,041 
ratifications of human rights treaties. OHCHR continued to provide technical assistance 
upon the request of State parties on the reporting process, individual communications and 
follow-up. 
</p>
<p>19. OHCHR continued to facilitate dialogue among stakeholders, aimed at developing 
proposals for strengthening the treaty body system. Consultations took place among all the 
major stakeholders: treaty body experts, States, non-governmental organizations, national 
human rights institutions, academics and United Nations agencies. In November, a meeting 
in Dublin gathered the conveners of all the consultations and the chairpersons of treaty 
bodies. I intend to compile all proposals in a report to be issued in mid-2012. Key proposals 
relate to the further alignment of the working methods of the 10 treaty bodies. Others entail 
new approaches that will require joint endeavours to carry forward, taking into account the 
specificities and independence of the different treaty bodies. The implementation of these 
proposals will be mainly in the hands of treaty bodies and States parties. A cost evaluation 
of key proposals will be provided.  
</p>
<p>20. My Office maintains the Universal Human Rights Index 
(www.universalhumanrightsindex.org), the only electronic tool compiling 
recommendations from the treaty bodies, special procedures and the universal periodic </p>


<p>review. The webpage was recently upgraded and is now available in all official languages 
of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Progressive development of international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>21. OHCHR continued to support the standard-setting activities of the United Nations 
human rights system. 
</p>
<p>22. OHCHR continued to draw attention to human rights violations, including violence 
and discrimination, perpetrated against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation or 
gender identity. In this regard, the Human Rights Council requested the Office to 
commission a study on relevant discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence.  
</p>
<p>23. The General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, permitting the Committee on the Rights of the Child to receive 
individual communications. When article 14 of the International Convention on the 
Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights come into 
force, all treaty bodies will be able to receive individual communications &#8211; a significant 
step forward in improving human rights protection. The Office is supporting developments 
in the General Assembly aimed at strengthening the human rights of older persons.  
</p>
<p>24. The Human Rights Committee adopted its general comment No. 34 on freedoms of 
opinion and expression, providing the most up-to-date understanding of these freedoms in 
the light of the Committee's considerable jurisprudence in this area.  
</p>
<p>25. OHCHR organized an expert meeting on the legal framework required to prohibit, 
prevent and respond to all forms of violence against children, and a consultation with 
stakeholders on children working or living on the street. 
</p>
<p>26. My Office provided support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises 
in the preparation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which were 
endorsed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4. We supported the launch of 
the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises. To support the effective implementation of the Guiding Principles, 
OHCHR produced an interpretive guide on the corporate responsibility to respect human 
rights. Jointly with the Global Compact Office, OHCHR produced a revised online learning 
tool on business and human rights and a guide for business enterprises on the development 
of corporate human rights policies. 
</p>
<p>27. OHCHR continued to support the intergovernmental Open-ended Working Group 
on the Right to Development, including through follow-up to the recommendations made at 
its twelfth session, held in November 2011. 
</p>
<p>28. The Office facilitated the initiative of the Human Rights Council to develop a United 
Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training, and provided support for its 
open-ended working group.  
</p>
<p>29. OHCHR continued to strengthen cooperation with regional human rights 
organizations. We supported the development of human rights mechanisms for the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  
</p>
<p>30. The Office advised the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in the 
elaboration of its Principles and Guidelines on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
which were adopted in October. In November, a regional workshop was organized with the 
Organization of American States, in particular the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, 
with a focus on the prevention of torture and the protection of its victims. </p>


<p>31. In November, in Serbia, OHCHR organized the first in a series of workshops on 
follow-up to the recommendations made by United Nations human rights mechanisms with 
the aim of contributing to the efficient engagement of national stakeholders with these 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Countering discrimination, in particular racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination on the grounds of sex, religion and against others who 
</b></p>
<p><b>are marginalized  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>32. As part of the fight against all forms of discrimination, OHCHR continued to engage 
in activities aimed at the eradication of discriminatory legislation and practices, including 
with regard to indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants, and conducted initiatives to 
counter discrimination on various grounds, notably ethnicity.  
</p>
<p>33. In 2011, OHCHR organized four expert workshops on the prohibition of incitement 
to national, racial or religious hatred, which generated a wealth of information on various 
approaches taken to address this problem through legislation, jurisprudence and different 
types of national policies. 
</p>
<p>34. OHCHR marked the International Year for People of African Descent with the 
theme of &#8220;Recognition, justice and development&#8221;, which was launched by the Secretary-
General on 10 December 2010. Activities included thematic panel discussions in the 
Human Rights Council and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the 
commemoration of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and 
dedicated cultural events and exhibitions. A panel focusing on women of African descent 
was also organized in New York.  
</p>
<p>35. OHCHR also prepared an electronic &#8220;toolkit&#8221; to assist field presences working on 
issues relating to Afro-descendants. A new fellowship programme for Afro-descendants 
was launched for participants from Europe, the Americas and the Middle East, enabling 10 
fellows to deepen their understanding of the United Nations human rights system. On 6 
December 2011, members of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent 
and civil society participated in a ceremony, during which the Secretary-General closed the 
International Year for People of African Descent. 
</p>
<p>36. My Office continues to provide the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination and follow-up mechanisms to the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action with technical and substantive support. These mechanisms address key issues 
including intolerance, the role of education and sport in combating racism and racial 
discrimination, freedom of religion and belief, freedom of expression and opinion, and 
xenophobia. Pursuant to requests from the Human Rights Council and the General 
Assembly, OHCHR also organized high-level panel discussions on good practices against 
racism, the promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace, and the promotion and protection 
of human rights through tolerance and reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>37. For the past two years, my Office has assisted Member States in developing national 
plans of action against racism. In 2011, we provided support to Benin, Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of), Botswana, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, the Niger, Nigeria and 
Uruguay. In addition, my Office organized a seminar in September on racial discrimination 
in Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation, for 10 countries of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS). 
</p>
<p>38. On 22 September 2011, the General Assembly held a high-level meeting to 
commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and </p>


<p>Programme of Action. A declaration, entitled &#8220;United against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221;, was adopted by the Assembly by consensus,1 in which 
States acknowledged that countless human beings continue to be victims of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and called upon all stakeholders to 
intensify their efforts to eliminate these scourges. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Indigenous and minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>39. My Office continued to promote the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and to support the work of the Expert Mechanism and the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. OHCHR conducted its global indigenous 
fellowship programme for 26 fellows, and hosted a regional fellowship in Southern Africa 
and a national fellowship in the Russian Federation. The Office continued to manage the 
United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations.  
</p>
<p>40. The United Nations Indigenous Peoples Partnership was launched on 20 May 2011. 
OHCHR co-chairs the Board on behalf of participating United Nations organizations. In 
October 2011, the Partnership approved six country programmes (Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of), Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo, Nepal and Nicaragua) and a 
regional programme for South-east Asia.  
</p>
<p>41. We also promoted the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities and other human rights standards relevant to 
minority issues, supported the annual session of the Forum on Minority Issues, and 
organized in May the fourth Expert Consultation on Effective Practices in Policing and 
Minority Communities, in Bangkok. A regional conference on minority participation was 
held in Kyrgyzstan in July.  
</p>
<p>42. My Office delivered training on minority rights for United Nations staff members in 
Asia and the Pacific, and its Minority Fellowship Programme brought nine English- and 
Arabic-speaking minority rights advocates to Geneva. OHCHR convened the seventh 
meeting of the Inter-Agency Group on Minorities. In December, OHCHR launched a report 
on access to justice for victims of caste-based discrimination in Nepal and conducted a 
consultation with United Nations country teams from the South Asia region on work- and 
descent-based discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Gender equality an</b>d women&#8217;s human rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>43. On 10 June, I opened the annual full-day discussion of the Human Rights Council 
on women&#8217;s rights and presented a summary report of an expert workshop that focused on 
identifying challenges, good practices and opportunities on the elimination of violence 
against women (A/HRC/17/22) and a report on good practices and remaining gaps in the 
prevention of violence against women (A/HRC/17/23).  
</p>
<p>44. My Office contributed to the strategic planning process of the United Nations Entity 
for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and prepared a joint 
work plan for submission to the Commission on the Status of Women and the Human 
Rights Council at its nineteenth session. In September, I submitted a report to the Council 
on effective practices in adopting a human rights-based approach to eliminate preventable 
maternal mortality and morbidity (A/HRC/18/27).  
</p>
<p>45. In September, OHCHR adopted its Gender Equality Policy and is currently 
developing a gender equality strategic plan. To implement the policy and strategy, 
</p>
<p>  
 1 General Assembly resolution 66/3. </p>


<p>OHCHR, with the support of United Nations training entities, have embarked on a training 
programme for all staff members. OHCHR also actively participated in the consultation 
with United Nations entities on the system-wide plan of action on gender equality and 
women&#8217;s empowerment facilitated by UN-Women. 
</p>
<p>46. Following the report of the high-level panel on remedies and reparations for victims 
of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, my Office and UN-Women 
embarked on a joint provincial-level project to strengthen reparations programmes and 
initiatives for victims of sexual violence, which focuses on accountability and access to 
justice and the social dimension underlying the causes of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>47. OHCHR, in collaboration with the Office of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Sexual Violence and United Nations Action against Sexual Violence, 
provided United Nations peace missions and country teams with operational guidance and 
support for the implementation of Security Council resolutions on women, peace and 
security (1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010)) with a view to 
strengthening responses, ensuring consistent and effective information-gathering and 
investigations, fighting impunity and promoting access to justice for victims. To this end, 
the Office also continued to provide the team of experts on the rule of law with support , 
pursuant to Security Council resolution 1888 (2009). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Discrimination against persons with disabilities, older persons and persons affected by 
</b></p>
<p><b>HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>48. As at the end of November, 106 States were parties to the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities, and 63 States had ratified the Optional Protocol thereto. 
OHCHR increased its support for the Committee , which has begun considering the reports 
of States parties and processing individual communications submitted under the Optional 
Protocol. 
</p>
<p>49. In addition, OHCHR continued to develop and disseminate tools and knowledge 
about the Committee, advocates for disability rights, and supports OHCHR and United 
Nations field presences, which are actively involved in supporting the Committee by 
advocating for ratification, supporting treaty body reporting, collecting and analysing data 
on disability rights, and supporting civil society organizations and law reform efforts.  
</p>
<p>50. OHCHR was one of the main actors developing the multi-donor trust fund on the 
Committee, launched in December. The aim of the fund is to sponsor projects strengthening 
national capacity for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. OHCHR continues to co-chair the Inter-Agency Support Group on the 
Convention and is involved in the Bureau of the Conference of States parties. 
</p>
<p>51. At my initiative, an inter-departmental task force on accessibility was established to 
ensure the participation of persons with disabilities in the work of the United Nations, 
including delegates, staff members and visitors.  
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR supported the open-ended working group created by the General Assembly 
in its resolution 65/182, the purpose of which is to strengthen the protection of the human 
rights of older persons, jointly with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. 
</p>
<p>53. OHCHR was involved in the General Assembly high-level meeting marking 30 
years since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Assembly adopted a new 
declaration on HIV/AIDS aimed at guiding the global response to the epidemic and 
emphasizing the importance of advancing human rights in order to reverse and eliminate it. 
</p>
<p>54.  OHCHR also supported the work of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, 
which examines the links between legal responses, human rights and HIV. The 
Commission&#8217;s recommendations will be finalized in 2012 and should inform future national </p>


<p>responses to the epidemic. Other key activities include the provision of technical assistance 
in the review of HIV legislation, co-sponsoring the West and Central African regional 
meeting of ministers for justice and judges, which led to the adoption of a statement of 
commitment on HIV and the law, and the organization of campaigns to raise awareness and 
address HIV-related stigma and discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Pursuing economic, social and cultural rights and combating 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequalities and poverty, including in the context of the economic, food 
</b></p>
<p><b>and climate crises  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Right to development 
</b></p>
<p>55. &#8220;Development is a human right for all without discrimination&#8221; was the main theme 
of the global commemoration in 2011 of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the 
Declaration on the Right to Development. My Office completed a far-reaching programme 
of activities in 2011 in this context. Landmark statements were adopted by bodies across 
the United Nations system, and new civil society partners mobilized in support for the right 
to development.  
</p>
<p>56. The anniversary events concluded with a call for a resolute transition from theory to 
action, and highlighted the persistent challenges to the meaningful realization of the right to 
development, on which there is a need to find principled common ground. We must also 
work to enlarge the organized constituency in support of the right to development within 
civil society, and to promote mainstreaming and human rights-based policy coherence in 
the global partnership for development.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Human rights and development 
</b></p>
<p>57. My Office has stepped up its engagement with United Nations, national and civil 
society partners in order to strengthen accountability for realizing the Millennium 
Development Goals and ensure that human rights are central to the post-2015 development 
agenda.  
</p>
<p>58. OHCHR continued to support the Resident Coordinator system, including through 
the provision of advice to United Nations country teams, to further mainstream human 
rights and assist follow-up to the recommendations stemming from the universal periodic 
review and other human rights mechanisms. OHCHR also coordinated the work of a human 
rights mainstreaming mechanism. Many agencies are actively collaborating under this 
mechanism to further institutionalize mainstreaming efforts in the United Nations 
operational activities for development, and enhance more systematic engagement with its 
human rights mechanisms. There is a strong commitment among the United Nations 
leadership &#8211; at Headquarters and in countries &#8211; to ensure that a human rights-based 
approach is a key guiding principle of United Nations programming. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Poverty 
</b></p>
<p>59. Combating poverty and protecting and promoting human rights remain important 
priorities for OHCHR. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 15/19, my Office 
carried out extensive consultations on the progress report on draft guiding principles on 
extreme poverty and human rights of the Special Rapporteur on the question of extreme 
poverty and human rights (A/HRC/15/41). An analytical compilation of the submissions 
received will be presented to the Council and should guide the Special Rapporteur in 
concluding her work. My Office has continued to support Member States in developing 
human rights indicators using OHCHR methodology and in integrating human rights into 
national development planning and budget processes in such countries as Ecuador, Kenya, </p>


<p>Liberia and Mexico. Finally, a growing number of Government agencies and national 
human rights institutions, including in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Kenya, Kosovo 
(Serbia) and Nepal, have worked on developing the use of human rights indicators. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>60. OHCHR has pursued the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights and has 
continued to strengthen its capacity to contribute to the protection and monitoring of these 
rights at the national and international levels, including through cooperation with United 
Nations system partners. OHCHR has developed tools and training materials, and trained 
its staff on strategies and skills to monitor implementation of these rights. OHCHR 
provided technical assistance and support to Governments, parliaments, country teams and 
civil society on the rights to adequate housing, adequate food, and health, and on the legal 
and judicial protection of economic, social and cultural rights. OHCHR supported the 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in Argentina, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Cape Verde, Costa Rica and 
El Salvador. Further, in collaboration with civil society partners, OHCHR organized a 
consultation on women and economic, social and cultural rights, focusing on the main 
challenges to the equal enjoyment of these rights by women.  
</p>
<p>61. The Office developed a forced eviction assessment questionnaire and, jointly with 
UN-Habitat, published a report on assessing the impact of evictions. OHCHR also 
produced materials, including a training module on economic, social and cultural rights for 
judiciary schools in Western Africa, a user&#8217;s guide on indicators to monitor economic, 
social and cultural rights in Nepal, publications on the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on indicators on the 
right to health in Mexico.  
</p>
<p>62. OHCHR produced reports on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights 
in all countries, maternal mortality, the use of indicators for economic, social and cultural 
rights, and cultural diversity and human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Human rights and the economic, food and climate crises 
</b></p>
<p>63. With regard to the global food crisis, OHCHR participated in the High-level Task 
Force on the Global Food Security Crisis and contributed to common advocacy in key 
international conferences and policy debates on food and nutrition security. OHCHR 
provided technical assistance for the development of the voluntary guidelines on the 
responsible governance of tenure of land, fisheries and forests in the context of national 
food security in order to ensure consistency of the guidelines with international human 
rights law. 
</p>
<p>64. On the margins of the eighteenth session of the Human Rights Council, OHCHR 
organized a side-event entitled &#8220;The crisis in the Horn of Africa: promoting a human rights-
based approach&#8221;, which event sought to provide a human rights analysis of the crisis and, 
on that basis, to promote an emergency response and medium- and long-term strategies 
anchored in human rights.  
</p>
<p>65. The importance of considering the human rights implications of climate change-
related effects and the need to consider human rights in the formulation of environmental 
policies was emphasized by OHCHR in a number of public statements, including during 
side events to Council sessions.  </p>


<p><b> D. Human rights in the context of migration  
</b></p>
<p>66. My Office has significantly stepped up its efforts in advocating for a human rights 
approach to migration. This builds on recent progress made, including during the chairing 
by OHCHR of the Global Migration Group, from July to December 2010. My Office 
remained an active member of the Group in 2011, and sought to highlight the human rights 
approach to migration in all Group statements and activities. 
</p>
<p>67. In September, the Committee on Migrant Workers held a day of general discussion 
on the human rights of migrant workers in an irregular situation and members of their 
families as the first phase in elaborating a general comment. It focused on an analysis of 
international treaty norms for the protection of the rights of irregular migrants, their 
practical application, international cooperation in protecting those rights and the 
criminalization and detention of irregular migrants. We concluded with the Ministry of 
Labour of Lebanon and the International Labour Organization (ILO) a unified contract for 
all migrant domestic workers employed in Lebanon. The document is in use, but the impact 
on the life of migrant workers is yet to be assessed.  
</p>
<p>68. The issue of criminalization of irregular migration and immigration detention also 
continued to be a focus of our work. A two-day global round table on alternatives to the 
detention of migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers and stateless persons was organized by 
OHCHR in partnership with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) and attended by  representatives of interested stakeholders in May. 
One conclusion was that there is no empirical evidence that immigration detention deters 
irregular migration, and that States should put in place effective alternatives to such 
detention. OHCHR also intervened as amicus curiae in the case of Hirsi and others before 
the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the prohibition of collective expulsion 
also applies where migrants are intercepted on the high seas before they reach territorial 
waters. 
</p>
<p>69. In May, OHCHR organized a panel discussion in New York on the issue of 
migration, racism and discrimination, to examine the persistence of anti-migrant sentiments 
and discriminatory practices.  
</p>
<p>70. In 2011, OHCHR provided training on migration and human rights issues, including 
to partner agencies of the Global Migration Group, such as ILO and the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM). A set of training modules was tested in a pilot workshop 
organized by the Diplomacy Training Programme and Migrant Forum in Asia in 
collaboration with OHCHR, which brought together 25 participants from non-governmental 
organizations and national human rights institutions in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East 
regions.  
</p>
<p>71. I continued to call for increased ratification and the effective implementation of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and for States to ratify all other core international human rights 
instruments in order to protect and promote the human rights of all migrants. In September, 
in response to a request by the Human Rights Council, OHCHR presented a report on the 
situation of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in North Africa 
(A/HRC/18/54), describing the human rights implications and concerns of the cross-border 
movement of migrants and asylum-seekers in this region between January and August 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>72. OHCHR organized a judicial colloquium on the implementation of article 3 (best 
interest of the child) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Europe with regard to 
the situation of migrant children, including unaccompanied and separated children. In 
February, OHCHR participated in the seminar on the human rights of migrant populations, </p>


<p>organized by the Regional Conference on Migration in Tegucigalpa. In June, the Office 
organized a round table on human rights and human smuggling in collaboration with the 
Global Alliance against Traffic in Women. Through the West Africa Regional Group on 
protection in mixed migration, OHCHR, with IOM and UNHCR, facilitated presentations 
and trainings on migration and human rights in this context.  
</p>
<p>73. My Office also continued to work on the human rights issue of trafficking in 
persons. As Chair of the Inter-agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons, 
OHCHR organized a side event during the seventeenth session of the Human Rights 
Council to highlight  the role of the United Nations in protecting victims of trafficking. The 
Commentary on the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking was launched by OHCHR in the Republic of Moldova in November 
and in the United Arab Emirates in December. Capacity-building activities on the rights-
based approach to combatting trafficking were undertaken in Belarus and the United Arab 
Emirates for law enforcement officials from CIS countries and the Middle East and North 
Africa region respectively. OHCHR participated in the first Gulf Forum for Combatting 
Human Trafficking, held in the United Arab Emirates, where the human rights-based 
approach was presented and adopted by the Forum as the methodology to address 
trafficking in persons. A regional consultative meeting on combating human trafficking was 
organized in Qatar in cooperation between OHCHR and the Qatar Foundation for 
Combating Human Trafficking, which aimed to further the implementation of the Arab 
Initiative to build national capacities to combat human trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Combating impunity and strengthening accountability, the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p><b>and democratic society  
</b></p>
<p>74. In addition to the above-mentioned international commissions of inquiry and fact-
finding missions mandated by the Human Rights Council-, OHCHR provided a broad range 
of countries with technical advice on the establishment of national commissions of inquiry. 
As part of its work on the protection of victims and witnesses, OHCHR supported national 
authorities in Kosovo,2 Nepal and Uganda in developing victim and witness protection 
programmes. OHCHR also supported the organization of a judicial colloquium on victim 
and witness protection and the administration of justice in Uganda, and organized a seminar 
on the draft law on witness and victim protection in Argentina. An expert meeting on 
gender aspects of victim and witness protection programmes was held in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>75. OHCHR continued its sustained engagement in transitional justice processes and 
mechanisms at the national level. This included working towards the establishment of 
transitional justice mechanisms in Burundi; conducting an induction workshop for the 
dialogue, truth and reconciliation commission in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire; supporting the Togo truth, 
justice and reconciliation commission; assisting national authorities and civil society on 
transitional justice initiatives in Nepal; supporting efforts to establish a reparations 
programme in Timor-Leste; providing advice on the Law on Victims and Restitution of 
Land in Colombia; and assisting in the vetting of the national police in Haiti. OHCHR also 
participated in workshops on transitional justice in the Middle East and North Africa 
region, and provided advice on related issues in Tunisia and Libya. OHCHR also organized 
an expert workshop entitled &#8220;A human rights-compliant framework for vetting of members 
of the security and justice sectors&#8221;. My Office and the Economic Community of West 
African States also organized a Conference on Impunity, Justice and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Reference to Kosovo should be understood in full compliance with Security Council resolution 1244 
</p>
<p>(1999) and without prejudice to the status of Kosovo. </p>


<p>bringing together Ministers of Justice, Chief Justices and civil society representatives from 
the region. 
</p>
<p>76. OHCHR continued to explore other areas of transitional justice, including by 
developing a special issues paper on transitional justice and economic, social and cultural 
rights; conducting a study on reparations for conflict-related sexual violence; examining the 
linkages between transitional justice and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; 
and holding a seminar on archives as a means to guarantee the right to the truth. In an 
amicus curiae intervention in the case of El-Masri, my Office also urged the European 
Court of Human Rights to recognize the right to truth as being inherent to the European 
Convention on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>77. OHCHR continued to monitor the use of the death penalty, and supported and 
participated in initiatives aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>78. OHCHR and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations jointly completed and 
launched the United Nations Rule of Law Indicators Project. The indicators measure the 
performance, integrity, transparency, accountability and capacity of criminal justice 
institutions and have already been implemented in Haiti and Liberia. 
</p>
<p>79. As lead of theWorking Group on protecting human rights while countering terrorism 
of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, OHCHR organized a regional 
symposium in South-East Asia with a focus on fair trial and due process in the counter-
terrorism context. OHCHR also addressed participants at the special meeting of the 
Counter-Terrorism Committee commemorating the adoption of Security Council resolution 
1373 (2001) and the establishment of the Committee, and contributed to two panel 
discussions held by the Human Rights Council on the human rights dimensions of 
terrorism.  
</p>
<p>80. OHCHR was involved in the development of United Nations-coordinated policy on 
electoral assistance and the elaboration of a strategic approach to issues such as 
unconstitutional changes of Governments. In cooperation with the Department of Political 
Affairs and International IDEA, OHCHR organized a round table on democracy and human 
rights. It also continued to provide support and advice on the integration of international 
norms into electoral laws; national and regional consultations on human rights and 
elections; and constitutional building processes (Libya and Somalia).  
</p>
<p>81. OHCHR implemented human rights education and training programmes, and 
developed related tools and provided Governments, institutions and civil society with 
assistance. My Office also promoted human rights education through information-sharing 
and networking tools such as the OHCHR Resource Collection and Database on Human 
Rights Education and Training. In March, <i>Evaluating Human Rights Training Activities: A 
Handbook for Human Rights Educators</i> was issued. Through the Assisting Communities 
Together project, OHCHR is supporting 28 civil society organizations in 13 countries by 
carrying out human rights education activities in local communities.  
</p>
<p>82. Within the framework of the second phase of the World Programme for Human 
Rights Education (2010-2014), OHCHR is supporting the national implementation of the 
plan of action. Other strategies to increase awareness and encourage implementation of the 
Programme are being implemented jointly with the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization.  
</p>
<p>83. My Office continued its work to support the establishment or reform of professional, 
human rights-compliant and accountable security agencies, armed forces, police and law 
enforcement agencies. In the framework of the inter-agency security sector reform task 
force, OHCHR integrated human rights technical guidance notes on reform and peace 
processes, democratic governance of the security sector, national security policies and </p>


<p>strategies, and on gender-responsive reforms. These tools will ensure that activities in this 
are grounded in international human rights law and they contribute to the Office&#8217;s work on 
</p>
<p>security sector actors. 
</p>
<p>84. My Office continued to devote much effort to developing methodologies to 
document and report on human rights violations, including with regard to sexual violence, 
and strengthening these skills of both OHCHR staff and national human rights actors. The 
OHCHR Manual on Human Rights Monitoring is being revised, and eight new chapters, 
including on analysis, information-gathering and protection of witnesses, victims and 
sources, are being published. Numerous courses on human rights monitoring, fact-finding 
and investigations were conducted for United Nations staff members and external partners, 
including one in the Gambia for staff of the African Commission on Human and Peoples 
Rights.  
</p>
<p>85. The support provided by my Office to international commissions of inquiry and fact-
finding missions included analysing their experience and managing lessons learned 
processes, and updating methodologies and procedures. Rigorous methodologies for such 
mechanisms provide a solid basis of information and analysis to inform action by the 
international community, and support national justice, truth, peace and reconciliation 
processes.  
</p>
<p>86. In November, in the context of a Security Council workshop on accountability, 
OHCHR addressed United Nations practices in the establishment of commissions of inquiry 
and fact-finding mechanisms, underlining challenges, lessons learned as well as 
opportunities for greater action by the Council. OHCHR is currently reviewing its 
experience in this area with a view to contributing to the ongoing review of practices on 
commissions of inquiry.  
</p>
<p>87. OHCHR also supported the establishment and strengthening of national human 
rights institutions in more than 40 countries. In March, in Trinidad and Tobago, OHCHR 
and the Commonwealth Secretariat conducted a workshop aimed at developing institutions 
in Caribbean States. In October, in Tajikistan, OHCHR, together with UNDP and the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe organized a regional workshop for 
human rights institutions with a focus on the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Protecting human rights in situations of violence and insecurity  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights, peace and security 
</b></p>
<p>88. I welcome the determination of the Human Rights Council to take action in the face 
of violent crises, as demonstrated by the special sessions held in 2011, the stronger 
resolutions adopted and the establishment of commissions of inquiry. The Security Council 
also paid greater attention to human rights issues in its thematic and country resolutions. 
These important steps need to be well coordinated, and they provide an opening for 
OHCHR to carry out its work. To ensure greater effectiveness, such steps should include 
considerations for the protection of civilians &#8211; a colossal challenge for the international 
community.  
</p>
<p>89. OHCHR endeavoured to respond more promptly to emerging crises in States, 
notwithstanding the challenges, including security conditions, the will of the relevant 
authorities, whether a human rights presence or Council mandate was present and adequate 
financial resources.  
</p>
<p>90. In February and March, I sent missions to Tunisia and Egypt respectively, to discuss 
human rights challenges with national and international counterparts, as well as possible 
avenues for cooperation during the transition. In June and July, OHCHR conducted a </p>


<p>human rights assessment mission to Yemen, and in November and December, an OHCHR 
team was sent to Yemen. In August, I sent an team to the Sudan and South Sudan to assess 
the facts and circumstances around the events in Abyei in April and to explore possibilities 
for human rights monitoring, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1990 (2011) 
establishing the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei. Regrettably, access to 
Abyei has not yet been possible. 
</p>
<p>91. In this connection, access to situations of protracted conflicts is important and there 
is a need to pay more attention to such situations. The mandate of the High Commissioner 
is to promote and protect the human rights of all, everywhere, including in territories 
controlled by de facto authorities.  
</p>
<p>92. Monitoring and reporting are essential, as factual and objective information is 
critical for dialogue, advocacy, protection and adequate assistance. In Afghanistan, 
OHCHR and the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan publish two reports a 
year on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, documenting figures on civilian 
casualties relating to the conflict and making recommendations to anti-Government and 
pro-Government forces alike. OHCHR believes that this reporting on civilian casualties has 
contributed to strengthening accountability and the respect for international humanitarian 
law. For instance, the proportion of civilian casualties caused by pro-Government forces 
declined owing to the improved safeguards they have adopted as a result of the 
recommendations made in the report and subsequent advocacy.  
</p>
<p>93. In an effort to strengthen human rights further in the United Nations peace and 
security agenda, OHCHR led the development of a policy on Human Rights in United 
Nations peace operations and political missions, which was jointly endorsed in September 
by OHCHR, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Political 
Affairs and the Department of Field Support. This landmark document captures current 
policy, institutional arrangements and good practices in the integration of human rights into 
peace operations in a single, binding document, and provides further operational guidance 
for its implementation. It will contribute to the effective delivery of human rights mandates 
and more coherent approaches to human rights across peace operations.  
</p>
<p>94. OHCHR efforts to enhance the implementation of Security Council mandates for the 
protection of civilians continued throughout 2011. I addressed the Council in May and 
November, emphasizing the importance of including robust language on human rights 
protection and promotion in its mandates and ensuring sustained attention to accountability 
issues. My Office also worked closely with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations on 
a number of initiatives, including a training package for peacekeeping personnel on the 
protection of civilians, a review of how protection of civilians is integrated into planning 
processes, and an assessment of the resources and capabilities needed for the effective 
implementation of mandates for the protection of civilians. 
</p>
<p>95. My Office also took a leading role in the human rights due diligence policy on 
United Nations support for non-United Nations security forces. This policy was endorsed 
by the Secretary-General in July, following an inter-agency effort co-led by OHCHR and 
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. It reiterates the Organization&#8217;s commitment to 
ensure that support provided to non-United Nations security forces is based on respect for 
human rights and international humanitarian law, and provides operational guidance in this 
respect.  
</p>
<p>96. To curb crime and violence, OHCHR advocated for a comprehensive approach that 
looks at the root causes of crime and violence, highlighting that crime prevention, including 
through socio-economic measures to improve livelihood opportunities and attention to 
victims and groups at risk, are as important as control and sanction. A rights-based 
approach to public security also requires that particular attention be paid to victims&#8217; rights </p>


<p>and States&#8217; obligations to guarantee and protect those rights. Several United Nations human 
rights mechanisms have addressed the issue and provided clear guidance on specific areas, 
including preventive actions, juvenile justice, attention to victims (in particular victims of 
gender-based violence), anti-drug policies, firearms and munitions control, use of private 
security companies and the role of the military in law enforcement. 
</p>
<p>97. In Central and South America, OHCHR advised States on proposed legislation on 
crimes and building their capacity to deal with rampant impunity and to abide by their 
international human rights obligations, and advocated for the need to address the root 
causes of violence and crime. Over the past two years, OHCHR partnered the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights and UNICEF in the production of a ground-
breaking report on security, which analyses the issue from a human rights perspective, and 
makes recommendations to States on how to improve institutions, laws, policies, 
programmes and practices in the prevention and control of crime and violence. This 
publication has raised awareness about the need to ensure a different, more comprehensive 
approach to crime and violence, and to present human rights counter-arguments to hard-line 
policies. A second joint report, addressing juvenile justice issues, was published in 
September 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Humanitarian activities 
</b></p>
<p>98. OHCHR affirmed its role as the lead human rights actor in humanitarian action, 
mainstreaming human rights considerations and advocating for human rights in 
humanitarian planning, preparedness, response and recovery. OHCHR increased its 
engagement in humanitarian planning and funding processes by contributing to human 
rights analysis, mainstreaming human rights concerns and considerations, and integrating 
human rights in a number of consolidated and/or flash appeals, including those for the 
Central African Republic, Chad, Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, the occupied Palestinian 
territory and Uganda. 
</p>
<p>99. OHCHR works closely with humanitarian partners on policy, operational guidance 
development and training issues. OHCHR continued its participation in the Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee and sub-working groups or task forces, including on leadership and 
coordination, and contributed to the integration of human rights into guidance materials and 
learning activities for humanitarian coordinators and other partners on emergency 
preparedness and response. OHCHR is a core member of the Global Protection Cluster 
working group and its task forces on, inter alia, natural disasters and learning.  
</p>
<p>100. In 2011, OHCHR led protection clusters in Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, the occupied 
Palestinian territory, Timor-Leste and the Pacific region, and played a key supporting role 
in other countries, such as Iraq. OHCHR embarked upon innovative joint efforts and 
developed tools to integrate human rights in other sectors of humanitarian programming. 
</p>
<p>101. To further enhance the expertise and capacity of OHCHR staff to work in 
humanitarian settings, OHCHR developed a core training course on human rights and 
humanitarian action, which is held on an annual basis. In May, with a view to making 
OHCHR a more effective actor in humanitarian preparedness and response efforts, I 
endorsed an Office-wide strategy and a 4-year plan of action for OHCHR engagement in 
humanitarian activities. Continued cooperation on early warning systems with humanitarian 
partners resulted in human rights being mainstreamed and taken into account in all 
emerging crises in 2011.  </p>


<p><b> III. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>While OHCHR is committed to respond to situations where human rights are 
most at risk, solid political support and adequate resources are a prerequisite for its 
</b></p>
<p><b>meaningfully engagement.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>I welcome the increasing number of cross-regional initiatives undertaken by the 
Human Rights Council, including the establishment of new mandates, which indicate 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Counc</b>il&#8217;s determination to address multiple human rights issues and challenges. 
</p>
<p><b>However, this carries significant resource implications. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>With regard to the efforts to strengthen the treaty body system, I take note with 
great satisfaction of the many varied proposals made through the nine consultations 
</b></p>
<p><b>held since 2009 between different actors, including States parties to international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights treaties, treaty body experts, United Nations entities and specialized 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies, national human rights institutions and civil society, including academia. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Treaty body outputs provide valuable advice for Member States and advocacy tools 
</b></p>
<p><b>for national institutions and non-governmental organizations, contribute to better 
</b></p>
<p><b>integrating human rights considerations into the work of relevant United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies and programmes, and provide the universal periodic review mechanism with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the building blocks necessary to ensure that the peer review is based on objective 
</b></p>
<p><b>technical grounds. Efforts currently under way to strengthen the treaty body system 
</b></p>
<p><b>are crucial, but they will not replace the pressing need for the human and financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources that are essential to a well-functioning and credible treaty body system. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>In 2011, the promise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was 
brought to the forefront by civil society in cities from Tunis to New York. The myriad 
</b></p>
<p><b>global crises confronting Governments and international institutions call for human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights-based governance at the national and international levels. Responding 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively to these calls will be our collective mission for 2012, and beyond. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
