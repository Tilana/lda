<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Independent Expert in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, visited 
Morocco from 5 to 16 September 2011 at the invitation of the Government. The 
Independent Expert travelled to Rabat, F&#232;s, Meknes, Khemisset, Casablanca, Agadir and 
Marrakech, where she met with different stakeholders and visited cultural projects and 
initiatives of various partnerships. The mission was organized in close cooperation with the 
inter-ministerial delegation on human rights and facilitated by the Office of the United 
Nations Resident Coordinator in Rabat.  
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the Independent Expert met senior governmental officials 
working at the central and local levels on issues relating to human rights, culture, education, 
media, justice, gender, minorities, social and economic development, religious matters, 
interior and foreign affairs and national initiatives for human and social development. She 
also interacted with academics, grass-roots leaders from different communities, 
representatives of civil society organizations and of the Amazigh and Jewish communities. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert expresses her appreciation to the Government for providing 
her with this valuable opportunity to examine the realization of cultural rights in Morocco. 
She extends her gratitude to all stakeholders and interlocutors for their time, cooperation, 
information provided and insights into the promotion and protection of cultural rights 
during this mission. 
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, the Independent Expert reviews legislative and policy 
frameworks, as well as initiatives and practices relating to cultural rights, and makes 
recommendations aimed at strengthening the promotion, protection and fulfilment of 
cultural rights by the Government of Morocco.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p>5. Morocco is a multi-ethnic and multicultural society. Moroccans are predominantly 
Sunni Muslims of Arab, Amazigh, or mixed Arab-Amazigh ancestry. In addition, a small 
Jewish community of around 4,000 people, as well as people of African descent, live in 
Morocco.1  
</p>
<p>6. Morocco has two official languages. The Independent Expert appreciates the fact 
that, together with Arabic, the Amazigh language, which has three dialects (Tarifit, 
Tashelhit and Tamazight), has recently been granted the status of official language in the 
Constitution. French is widely taught and serves as the primary language of commerce and 
Government affairs. 
</p>
<p>7. One major challenge identified in effectively promoting cultural diversity and equal 
rights for all is the lack of reliable data on the composition of the country&#8217;s population. 
Regrettably, the 2004 census did not provide detailed information on the ethnic 
composition of the population or on the use of languages by it. In preparation for the next 
census, to be conducted in 2014, it will be crucial to ensure that information is gathered on 
the use of Arabic, Amazigh and other languages, and other indicators of ethnic and cultural 
diversity in the country. The Independent Expert recalls the recommendation made by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in this regard.2

</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Morocco has ratified the main international human rights treaties containing 
important provisions on cultural rights, namely the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Morocco has yet to ratify the optional protocols to the 
international covenants allowing complaints to be lodged by victims of violations and to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>9. Morocco is also a party to major international treaties of the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that are considered essential 
for the enjoyment of cultural rights.3 Morocco has not yet ratified the UNESCO Convention 
on Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. 
</p>
<p>10. According to the amended preamble of the Constitution, Morocco is committed to 
grant international conventions primacy over domestic law and to harmonize its national 
legislation consequently. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. Morocco has undergone a number of constitutional, institutional and legal reforms in 
the past decade, including major amendments to the Constitution in 2011, the adoption of 
the Family Code in 2004 and the establishment of a number of institutions for the 
promotion of cultural rights, such as the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) and 
the National Human Development Initiative (INDH). The education sector has also been 
reformed. 
</p>
<p>12. The Independent Expert welcomes the multistage consultative process undertaken 
for the adoption of the amended Constitution, with the participation of political parties, 
trade unions, youth and civil society organizations. She particularly appreciates the fact that 
amendments to the Constitution have introduced additional references to fundamental rights 
and freedoms, including cultural rights. The amended preamble of the Constitution, in 
particular, stresses that the country&#8217;s unity, &#8220;built on the convergence of its Arabo-Islamic, 
Amazigh and Saharo-Hassani components, is nurtured and enriched by its African, 
Andalusian, Hebraic and Mediterranean constituents&#8221;. Morocco is also notably committed 
to banning and combating all discrimination on the basis of sex, colour, beliefs, culture, 
social or regional origin, language, disability or other personal circumstances.  
</p>
<p>13. The Independent Expert commends the constitutional amendment conferring official 
status to the Amazigh language and its consolidation as a written language, as well as the 
efforts made to promote that language. The Constitution stipulates in its new article 5 that 
Amazigh is an official language of the State. The article also provides that the State will

<p>  
 3 Including the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage 
</p>
<p>(1972), the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003) and the 
Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001). Morocco has also accepted 
the Convention against Discrimination in Education (1960). </p>

</b></p>
<p>take measures to protect the Hassani language, as well as cultural expressions and dialects 
(<i>parlers</i>) thereof practiced in Morocco. It establishes a national council of languages and 
Moroccan culture, mandated to protect and develop the Arabic and Amazigh languages and 
the diverse Moroccan cultural expressions. The Independent Expert welcomes these 
important developments, which are in keeping with her recommendation that States should 
recognize and value the diversity of cultural heritages present in their territories and under 
their jurisdiction.4 Legislation enforcing these provisions has not yet been enacted and it 
remains to be seen how they will be applied in practice. More generally, as stressed below 
in the present report, legislation and policies contrary to this new constitutional provision 
will have to be repealed. 
</p>
<p>14. Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees the freedoms of thought, opinion and 
expression, the freedoms of creation, publication and exhibition in literary and artistic 
matters, and of scientific and technical research. Article 26 of the Constitution stipulates 
that &#8220;public authorities lend, by appropriate measures, their support for the development of 
cultural and artistic creation and of scientific and technical research, as well as for the 
promotion of sports. They favour the development and the organization of these sectors in 
an independent manner and on a democratic and specific professional basis.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>15. Article 12 of the Constitution stipulates that &#8220;civil society associations and non-
governmental organizations are constituted and exercise their activities in all freedom, in 
respect for the Constitution and the law.&#8221; Furthermore, &#8220;they may not be dissolved or 
suspended by the public powers, except by virtue of a decision of justice.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>16. With regard to the right to education, article 31 of the Constitution includes 
provisions on the equal access of all citizens to &#8220;quality education, education concerning 
the Moroccan identity and its permanent national traits, professional training and physical 
and artistic education.&#8221; Furthermore, article 1 of decree No. 04-2000 of 1 June 2000 
envisages that all Moroccan children having reached the age of 6 years have the right to 
education and the duty to benefit from it.  
</p>
<p>17. In 2010, the Government elaborated a national plan of action on democracy and 
human rights for the period 2011-2016. A human rights-based approach is stipulated as a 
basis to address several economic, cultural and environment issues, including the promotion 
of national languages, particularly the Amazigh language and culture. A coordination 
mechanism, composed of representatives of the Government, national institutions, non-
governmental human rights organizations and academics, was established to monitor, 
follow up and evaluate the implementation of the plan.  
</p>
<p>18. The Ministry of Culture has implemented a number of significant initiatives to help 
preserve cultural heritage, improve access to cultural life and extend support for creative 
activities. Morocco does not, however, have a national plan on cultural development with 
dedicated financial resources allocated to the Ministry of Culture for implementation. In 
2005, the Government reported to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
that a comprehensive strategy was being elaborated to establish modern cultural facilities to 
address national needs relating to its heritage, art and literature, the protection of national 
cultural heritage and the expansion of the sphere of cultural production.5 The Independent 
Expert is concerned at the absence of such a strategy and, more generally, of a 
comprehensive national plan on participation in cultural life, including issues relating to 
cultural heritage and linguistic diversity, gender issues and the needs of persons with 
disabilities in the cultural sphere.

</p>
<p><b> C. National institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Ministry of Culture was created in 2006 with a mandate to promote Moroccan 
culture, protect national cultural heritage and collaborate with cultural institutions in 
Morocco and abroad.6 It oversees 376 of the 416 <i>Maisons de la Culture</i> in the country and 
its budget accounts for 0.28 per cent of the national budget.7 
</p>
<p>20. The Independent Expert commends the establishment of IRCAM in 2001 (see 
paragraph 11 above).8 IRCAM has several objectives, including to combine and transcribe 
all the expressions of Amazigh culture and to protect and ensure its broadcasting; to carry 
out and to encourage other academics and experts to undertake research studies on 
Amazigh culture, and to make the results widely accessible; and to promote the artistic 
creation in Amazigh culture and contribute to its revival.9 It organizes educational events 
and training courses, and publishes and translates books.10 While appreciating the efforts 
made by the Institute, including some excellent educational manuals, which range from 
children&#8217;s primers to scientific and philosophical literature, the Independent Expert notes 
that these publications were regrettably not widely available in the public sector institutions 
visited, such as libraries and youth centres. In this regard, the Independent Expert considers 
that concerted efforts should be made to ensure that these publications are widely 
disseminated and available in schools, libraries and cultural centres. 
</p>
<p>21. In 2005, INDH was launched by King Mohammed VI (see paragraph 11 above). The 
aim of INDH is to facilitate access to basic social services, promote activities that generate 
employment and income, and assist people with special needs. Its programme for the period 
2006-2010 included human development projects focusing on poverty reduction and rural 
development by means of capacity-building, technical assistance and support for 
microcredit associations.11 The Independent Expert visited a number of facilities supported 
by INDH and was impressed by the variety of activities, including assistance for women&#8217;s 
shelters, the building of youth centres and projects supporting the crafts industry.  
</p>
<p>22. The Government agencies responsible for the promotion of economic and social 
development of the provinces of the North, South and East,12 and the Agency for Economic 
and Social Development (ADS)13 have a number of projects addressing specific regional 
needs that also take into account cultural rights. The Independent Expert was informed 
about a number of projects implemented by these agencies. The agency for the South, for 
instance, contributed to the establishment of a network of media centres to give people 
access to learning opportunities. It also assists the work of public academia and associations 
working on archaeology and the promotion of cultural festivals. The agency for the East has 
supported festivals of nomadic culture and theatre performances. ADS has helped

<p>communities to develop local plans to integrate cultural rights and include in its work the 
issue of cultural development.  
</p>
<p>23. The inter-ministerial delegation on human rights was set up in April 2011 to 
coordinatethe actions of at least eight governmental bodies working on human rights, as 
well as the initiatives of national and civil society institutions in this field. The delegation 
was created to foster a human rights dimension in public policies and to consolidate the 
State&#8217;s interactivity with international human rights mechanisms. Considering non-
governmental organizations to be main stakeholders on matters relating to human rights, it 
is mandated to reinforce and build the capacity of non-governmental organizations 
addressing human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>24. Article 162 of the Constitution provides for the Ombudsman (Office of the 
Mediator) as an independent and specialized national institution that aims to protect human 
rights. In 2004, the Office launched a communication campaign to raise awareness of its 
work. It provides police officers with training in the field of mediation. The Office has a 
joint initiative with IRCAM to translate into the Amazigh language the information on its 
activities and publications, and to train Office staff members in the use of Amazigh in order 
that they may address the needs of the Amazigh-speaking population. 
</p>
<p>25. The National Council on Human Rights, established in March 2011, is the successor 
to the Advisory Council on Human Rights (Conseil consultatif des droits de l&#8217;homme). Its 
tasks include monitoring the situation of human rights at the national and regional levels, 
preparing reports, visiting places of detention, prisons and child protection centres, and 
examining and studying the harmonization of national laws with the provisions of 
international human rights conventions.14 
</p>
<p><b> D. Participation in international initiatives promoting cultural diversity 
</b></p>
<p>26. Morocco is part of the Millennium Development Goals Achievement Fund, an 
international cooperation mechanism aimed at accelerating progress on the Millennium 
Development Goals.15 The Cultural Heritage and the Creative Industries as a Vehicle for 
Development in Morocco programme has as one of its objectives to strengthen the role of 
cultural heritage and the creative industries within the policies and strategies for human 
development and poverty reduction. The programme (2008-2011) takes into account gender 
and youth aspects in the context of cultural heritage and creative industries.  
</p>
<p>27. Under the auspices of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations initiative, 
Morocco has developed a national plan of action focusing on different areas, including 
education, media, youth, gender, migration, tolerance and the culture of diversity. The 
Ministry of Culture is currently implementing a project (2010-2012) aimed at establishing a 
national database of initiatives undertaken by different stakeholders for the promotion of 
dialogue among civilizations. The project also envisages the development of a national 
programme that highlights shared cultural heritage, including the Moroccan-Jewish 
heritage, the Andalusian heritage and others.16  
</p>
<p>28. In 2006, Morocco hosted the first meeting of the Arab Research-Policy Network 
(ARADESC) organized by UNESCO, in collaboration with the Islamic Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization. ARADESC aims to identify priorities for research on 
economic, social and cultural rights and to further link research to public policies. It

institutions, non-governmental organizations and the academic community, including 
UNESCO chairpersons, universities and research centres in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, 
Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia.17  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Cultural rights and issues 
</b></p>
<p>29. During her mission, the Independent Expert raised issues relating to the realization 
of, in particular, the right to have access to, contribute to and participate in cultural life, 
including the right to manifest and develop one&#8217;s own culture, the right to have access to 
and enjoy cultural heritage, and linguistic rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Use of the Amazigh language in education, the media and public life 
</b></p>
<p>30. According to information received, the Government offers Amazigh language 
classes as part of the curriculum in around 3,500 schools. In 2009-2010, the teaching of 
Amazigh language in primary school covered 17,630 classes and 15 per cent of students. 
The classes vary according to the main dialect spoken in each region; at present, such 
classes are limited to Amazigh-speaking areas.18 The Independent Expert is concerned that 
a number of obstructions restrict the use of Amazigh in education: for example, Ministry of 
Education circular No. 204 of 29 December 2010, on the status of exam evaluation in 
primary schools indicates that the language is included in evaluation exams of primary 
grades students at the municipal level. Exams for the Amazigh language are, however, not 
available at the regional level, even in regions with a sizeable Amazigh population. 
According to information provided by the Government, specializations in Amazigh 
language were set up in universities in Agadir, T&#233;touan, Oujda, Fes and Rabat. Amazigh 
language lessons are not, however, available for higher education classes, and there are no 
Amazigh language textbooks for first and second grade students. In addition, the lack of 
Amazigh language textbooks for third grade students has resulted in the cancellation of 
Amazigh language classes in many schools.19 Furthermore, for second grade students, three 
hours of Amazigh language classes should be allocated, but in practice, these classes are 
replaced by tutoring.20 All school textbooks, except those for the Amazigh language, are 
officially included in the official Ministry of Education list of books. Moreover, the 
Amazigh language is not offered in centres for language teaching.  
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert encourages the Government to continue its efforts to 
introduce the Amazigh language to all levels of education, to widely circulate the primers 
produced by IRCAM and to address the restrictions that inhibit such an introduction. In this 
regard, she wishes to draw the attention of the Government to article 29 of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, on the objectives of education, which includes, among other, the 
development of the child&#8217;s own cultural identity, language and values. She also stresses 
</p>
<p>that, according to article 5 of the UNESCO Declaration on Cultural Diversity, all persons 
are entitled to quality education and training that fully respect their cultural identity. It is 
equally important that all children learn of the country&#8217;s rich cultural diversity, in keeping

<p>with the new constitutional preamble. In this regard, the Independent Expert draws the 
attention of the Government to the fact that, according to several interlocutors, a review of 
history textbooks a priority.  
</p>
<p>32. The Independent Expert commends the efforts made to promote the Amazigh 
language in audio and visual media, such as the establishment of channel 8, which 
broadcasts mainly in Amazigh (70 per cent in Amazigh and 30 per cent in Arabic). The 
Independent Expert was informed that the law stipulates that all other television channels 
broadcasting in Arabic should also allocate 30 per cent of their time to Amazigh language 
programmes. In practice, however, the application of this provision is not enforced. 
Regarding radio broadcasting, several private radio stations in Amazigh language have 
been authorized; However, it is important that Amazigh radio be extended to rural areas, 
where women more frequently listen to the radio. 
</p>
<p>33. A number of impediments to the use of Amazigh in public life remain, including 
poor language proficiency of Government officials when providing Amazigh speakers with 
public services, little opportunity to use Amazigh language in the court system, and the lack 
of bilingual forms. The Independent Expert was informed that the lack of registered 
Amazigh-Arabic interpreters and the practice of not paying for professional Amazigh 
interpreters in court proceedings had led to judges calling for the assistance of unofficial 
and untrained interpreters, which can impede the right to a fair trial. The Independent 
Expert hopes that, following the recognition of Amazigh as an official language and the 
reinforcement of cultural rights in the new Constitution, measures will be taken to address 
these issues. She also draws the attention of the Government to the idea, proposed by some 
interlocutors, of multilingual information / welcoming centres in all administrative 
departments providing public services. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Restrictions on use of languages other than Arabic 
</b></p>
<p>34. The attention of the Independent Expert was drawn to legislation, policies and/or 
and practices forbidding the use of a language other than Arabic in a number of areas21, 
which are not in keeping with cultural rights, as set out in particular in article 15 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Independent Expert, 
taking into consideration the encouraging official recognition in the amended Constitution 
of the country&#8217;s cultural and linguistic diversity, strongly recommends that the Government 
review its legislation, policies and practices accordingly in a timely manner. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Names of children  
</b></p>
<p>35. The Independent Expert notes with concern that parents are still sometimes denied 
the right to freely choose the name of their children and have it registered by the 
Government, in particular in the case of names of Amazigh origin. Article 21 of Civil 
Status Law No. 37-99 of 3 October 2002 stipulates that &#8220;the name chosen when the birth is 
declared must have a Moroccan trait&#8221;. Moreover, the High Commission for Civil Status has 
compiled a list of exemplary authorized Arabic names, thus automatically excluding the 
right of parents to freely choose and register different names for their children.  
</p>
<p>36. Ministry of the Interior circular No. D-3220 of 9 April 2010 provided clarifications 
on article 21 of the Civil Status Law, stipulating that Moroccan names include Amazigh 
names, and Hebrew names for Moroccan Jews. The circular included information regarding 
</p>
<p>  
 21  See for example Circular of the Prime Minister No. 4/2008 on the usage of the Arabic language; 
</p>
<p>Rabat, 22 April 2008. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>the procedural aspects of registration. It also specified that the exemplary list is no longer 
applicable and is therefore to be considered void. 
</p>
<p>37. The Independent Expert regards the above-mentioned circular as a positive step, but 
regrets that it is not enforced. She received a number of testimonies that parents are still 
denied the right to freely choose and register the names of their children. It would appear 
that the list of approved Arabic names is still in circulation and continues to be applied by 
Civil Status officers. Moreover, another list with prohibited names is also used to deny 
parents the freedom to register their preferred names for their offspring. In most cases, 
applicants do not receive any written official refusal to register their child&#8217;s name. In 
addition, the Independent Expert learned that this practice exists not only inside Morocco 
but is also applied abroad in embassies. The Independent Expert is therefore concerned that 
insufficient efforts have been made to ensure that duty bearers at the local level are aware 
of the instructions contained in circular No. D-3220. 
</p>
<p>38. The Independent Expert is of the view that such practices infringe cultural rights, in 
particular the rights of all persons to freely identify with one or several communities and to 
enjoy and manifest their own culture, as well as linguistic rights. She recalls in this regard 
general comment No. 21 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the 
right to take part in cultural life, stressing that &#8220;participation covers in particular the right of 
everyone &#8211; alone, or in association with others or as a community &#8211; to act freely, to choose 
his or her own identity, to identify or not with one or several communities or to change that 
choice, (&#8230;) to engage in one&#8217;s own cultural practices and to express oneself in the 
language of one&#8217;s choice.22 The rights of the child, as set out in articles 7 and 8 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, are also jeopardized by this situation. The 
Independent Expert also draws the attention of the Government to the recommendation 
made by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 2010 on that issue.23  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Names of public places and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>39. During her mission, the Independent Expert was concerned to learn that non-Arabic 
names of public places had been replaced with Arabic names For instance, Ministry of 
Education correspondence No. 01/201024 on new names for regional educational 
institutions specifically instructs the replacement of the Amazigh names of a number of 
schools with Arabic names. Such directives impinge upon the cultural rights of individuals 
and communities, in particular their right to participate in cultural life and to enjoy and 
have access to cultural heritage, as well as their linguistic rights.  
</p>
<p>40. In this regard, the Independent Expert recalls that the right of access to and 
enjoyment of cultural heritage includes the right of individuals and communities to, inter 
alia, know, understand, enter, visit, make use of, maintain, exchange and develop cultural 
heritage, as well as to benefit from the cultural heritage and the creation of others. States 
should therefore ensure access to the cultural heritage of one&#8217;s own communities, as well as 
</p>
<p>that of others.25 Cultural heritage should be understood to also include the history of 
communities, their outstanding figures and their linguistic heritage.

<p><b> 3. Language used in school theatre 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Independent Expert is concerned about a by-law (regulating national festivals of 
school drama theatres in cooperation with other schools) that requires the script of school 
theatre to be in Arabic. In addition, Ministry of Education circular No. 140 of 11 October 
2006, on the eighth annual festival of school drama, stipulates in paragraph 2 that 
performances should be in Arabic. Such provisions, which exclude the use of any other 
language in school drama performances, seem contrary to artistic freedoms, the right to 
have access to and enjoy one&#8217;s own cultural heritage and that of others, as well as linguistic 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to have access to and enjoy cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>42. In Morocco, tangible heritage includes 40 medinas, 150 archaeological sites, 406 
historic sites and a number of natural ones, eight of which are on the UNESCO World 
Heritage List. According to information received, some 20 per cent of the working 
population is employed in the cultural sector.26 The Independent Expert appreciates the 
multifaceted efforts made to document and promote cultural heritage as a living tradition in 
Morocco by establishing museums and initiatives on local heritage in different regions, 
such as the one she visited in Agadir, the festivals that offer people important opportunities 
to participate in and have access to culture, and the support provided to people for 
continuing livelihoods based on cultural production.  
</p>
<p>43. The Independent Expert notes the importance of recognizing medina areas as a part 
of cultural heritage and of sharing good practices between cities. In this regard, she stresses 
the multicultural character of medinas. In referring the Government of Morocco to her 
second annual report on the right to enjoy and have access to cultural heritage 
(A/HRC/17/38), she wishes to highlight the need to ensure that the communities concerned 
and relevant individuals are consulted and invited to participate actively throughout the 
process of identification, selection, classification, interpretation, preservation/safeguard, 
stewardship and development of cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>44. In Marrakech, the Government provides its support to the medina and around 4,000 
craftsmen&#8217;s associations working in approximately 98 <i>founduks</i> (quarters where craftsmen 
work and display their work), which historically were travellers&#8217; inns. This heritage is both 
architectural and historical value; most founduks<i>, </i>however, are owned by private 
individuals and require restoration. The Government has instituted an excellent practice in 
this regard. Funds allocated through INDH projects are used to renovate founduks<i>,</i> thus 
preserving architectural and historic heritage, while simultaneously contributing to 
continued cultural production of craftsmen associations. Another important INDH-
supported initiative visited by the Independent Expert is the Ben Youssef cultural complex, 
involving the transformation of an old house in the medina of F&#232;s into an art centre for 
children. Such initiatives not only contribute to the development of art skills among young 
people, but also assist in the revitalization of cultural life in medinas. 
</p>
<p>45. Every year, approximately 8 million tourists visit Morocco, attracted by, inter alia, 
its cultural heritage which includes a lively crafts tradition.24 Morocco has identified 
innovative ways to protect tangible cultural heritage in a manner that also supports the 
cultural rights of people. For example, this includes the opening of new &#8220;tourist-oriented&#8221; 
local guest houses in traditional Moroccan homes, which not only provide income to the 
owners and neighbourhood but also help to protect the cultural tangible heritage of the

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>medina. The Independent Expert encourages private-public sector partnerships in this area 
to contribute to the sustainable development and maintenance of tangible cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>46. The Independent Expert was impressed by the work of the national mediatheque in 
Rabat and the F&#232;s library to preserve cultural heritage. One main challenge is the 
preservation of ancient texts and manuscripts that have been coated in plastic. This coating 
is highly corrosive and threatens to completely destroy the manuscripts and documents. The 
mediatheque is in the process of removing the coating. However, the far older manuscripts 
in F&#232;s, including the original works of Ibn-Khaldun, are in grave danger of being lost. The 
Independent Expert sees this as an instance where international cooperation and assistance 
would be highly beneficial and should be encouraged. In particular, support would ensure 
that archivists with the necessary skills and technological knowledge are able to assist 
smaller museums.  
</p>
<p>47. Also praiseworthy are the efforts of libraries in Rabat and F&#232;s to encourage the 
participation and engagement with culture of young people by offering them areas for 
exhibitions, theatre and musical performances, as well as cinema screenings. It is important 
that these facilities be accessible to persons with disabilities. One outstanding example is 
the Rabat mediatheque, which is wheelchair-accessible, and has special cabins with Braille 
computers and printers installed for persons with visual impairment, and also caters for 
persons with hearing disabilities.  
</p>
<p>48. The Independent Expert commends the efforts made by a number of associations to 
participate in the identification, documentation and preservation of cultural heritage. Some 
have approached the Government to request that certain tangible objects be included in the 
list of national cultural heritage objects. The Independent Expert encourages authorities to 
consider such requests positively, especially given the new constitutional emphasis on 
preserving the diversity of the country&#8217;s cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>49. The Independent Expert learned of a proposal currently pending with the Ministry of 
Culture and UNESCO to provide legal, financial and institutional support to &#8220;living human 
treasures&#8221;, denoting people with the requisite high degree of knowledge and skills to 
perform or recreate specific elements of intangible cultural heritage. The Independent 
Expert encourages such efforts as a way to safeguard the transmission of knowledge and 
skills relating to intangible cultural heritage to younger generations. In this regard, she 
stresses the need to also ensure appropriate documentation of the knowledge and skills 
employed by living human treasures using all available methods, including new 
information technologies. 
</p>
<p>50. The Independent Expert notes with interest the efforts made to convert the former 
detention centres of Ouarzazate, Zagora, Errachidia and Hay Mohammadi into projects of 
memory preservation museums, pursuant to the recommendations of the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Support for cultural initiatives and respect for the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Independent Expert appreciates the considerable efforts made to organize 
various cultural festivals in most of the locations she visited. Particularly remarkable was 
the World Sacred Music Festival and the Forum of F&#232;s, which brought together various 
musicians and artists aiming to create a space for intercultural dialogue. She underlines the 
importance of ensuring that local communities and artists are the main beneficiaries of 
these events. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.2

</b></p>
<p>52. The Independent Expert visited a number of local community projects, and was in 
particular impressed by the initiative and enthusiasm of the <i>filles cavali&#232;res</i> group in 
Khemisset, an initiative that not only preserves the culture of Moroccan society as a living 
tradition, but also gives new impetus to women&#8217;s participation in cultural life and their 
</p>
<p>contribution to a cultural heritage traditionally embodied by men. The initiative 
underscores, however, the difficulties faced by local community initiatives in their access to 
governmental or INDH and ADS funds owing to the cumbersome project application 
process. The group has difficulties in having access to appropriate facilities for horse riding, 
and has therefore had to turn down the request of many young girls and boys to participate. 
The <i>filles cavali&#232;res</i> face other challenges, because horse riding falls between the 
classifications of sport and culture, thus neither ministry considers it to be within the scope 
of their specific mandate. Lastly, local authorities have to prioritize the allocation of funds 
from the Government. Funds are inevitably used to address the community&#8217;s basic 
necessities, and cannot support such initiatives. The project continues to function thanks to 
private initiatives and the contributions of the local community. The Independent Expert 
strongly encourages the Government to provide such initiatives with financial and logistical 
assistance and to disseminate information about these good practices in other regions. 
</p>
<p>53. The Independent Expert visited a number of INDH-supported projects and centres 
that have been newly established and are well maintained. Although one centre visited in 
Khemisset was built with the assistance of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, subsequently it 
has received very little assistance for its maintenance. In the Independent Expert&#8217;s view, it 
is important that INDH projects channel support to maintain and develop existing 
infrastructure, provide financial assistance to young people, women or persons with 
disabilities and invest more in capacity-building to enable concerned people and institutions 
to prepare adequate project documentation and attract further and sustainable funding.  
</p>
<p>54. One of the most important needs of the country&#8217;s cultural sector is national 
networking and coordination. There is a need for a national database accessible on the 
Internet with updated lists of national cultural bodies and associations, which could also 
serve to share and disseminate information on cultural activities throughout the country. In 
this regard, the Independent Expert was impressed by the work of the Royal Consultative 
Council on Saharan Affairs, which has developed a website 
(www.corcas.com/eng/WesternSaharaPoliticalAffairs.aspx) on Saharawi traditions and 
cultural life, in eight languages. Unfortunately, the website is not available in Amazigh.  
</p>
<p>55. The exemplary coexistence of different cultures, together with mutual respect and 
tolerance, are essential to the country&#8217;s prosperity and should be encouraged, widely 
supported and promoted. In this respect, the unique and outstanding Museum of Moroccan 
Judaism in Casablanca is a good example of respect for cultural pluralism and religious 
tolerance. The Museum, operated by the Fondation du patrimoine culturel Judeo-Marocain, 
is mainly funded by private donations, but receives some Government support, including 
for its well-qualified curator. It is encouraging that a number of non-Jewish students have 
chosen to research the Judeo-Moroccan heritage. Unfortunately, much of the archival 
material, including musical cassettes and literature of the community, are in need of proper 
storage and documentation. Interlocutors from the community and academics stressed the 
need for the Government to assume responsibility for protecting this important part of 
Moroccan cultural heritage, especially given that Jewish neighbourhoods (<i>mellahs</i>) are 
scattered throughout the country, while the vastly diminished Jewish population is 
concentrated in only a few cities. The Independent Expert encourages the Government to 
consider similar projects for the mellahs as those for medinas. </p>

</p>
<p>56. With regard to freedom of association, which is intrinsically linked to cultural 
rights,27 the Independent Expert was informed that some non-governmental organizations 
experience difficulties in becoming registered, for various reasons.  
</p>
<p>57. Freedom of association is governed by Royal Decree (<i>Dahir</i>) No. 1.58.376 of 1958, 
amended in 2002, according to which the regime opted for in Morocco is declaratory. New 
non-governmental organizations wishing to register must submit to the Ministry of Interior 
relevant documentation, which is required to issue a provisional receipt before a final 
receipt is issued within 60 days from the date on which the declaration of establishment was 
submitted. Even without a formal receipt, the association becomes legal and can carry out 
its activities. According to information received by the Independent Expert, however, in 
practice, should the organization not receive a receipt within 60 days, its work is seriously 
disrupted. In addition, there are cases when registration is denied without any reason given 
and despite court judgements confirming that the application for registration is in 
accordance with the law.28  
</p>
<p>58. For instance, the Independent Expert received confirmation during her mission that 
the Amazigh Network for Citizenship, which advocates for the cultural, linguistic, political 
and civil rights of Morocco's Amazigh population, is among the many Amazigh 
organizations that the authorities have refused to register. The National Bureau of the 
Association, based in Rabat, along with its branches in Tanalt, Tiznit, Casablanca and 
Ifrane, have all submitted founding documents to the relevant branch of the local 
administration in conformity with the law. However, the local administrations have 
consistently refused to provide a receipt to the local branches, while the Network's national 
bureau has only been sent such receipts after long delays.29  
</p>
<p>59. The Independent Expert would like to stress that such practices restrict the right to 
freely associate and to solicit, receive and utilize Government funds or any other 
contributions for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights. Individuals and 
communities are thereby prevented from exercising fully their right to participate in cultural 
life and from contributing to the development of cultural expressions in Morocco.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to quality education and training  
</b></p>
<p>60. The Independent Expert noted in her first report that all people are entitled to quality 
education and training that fully respect their cultural identity. She also emphasized that 
education allows access to knowledge, values and cultural heritage.30 Morocco has made 
great efforts to ensure widespread access to education. Despite these developments, 
however, challenges remain, particularly in terms of drop-out rates, enrolment rates of rural 
girls and the quality of education. In particular, there is a significant gender gap in 
education. The female literacy rate in the age group of 10 years and above was less than

<p>half (49.2 per cent) in 2009; only 16.2 per cent of rural girls attended secondary education 
(2009).31 
</p>
<p>61. The Independent Expert is concerned by the high drop-out rates of children, 
particularly girls, from primary schools. She was pleased to learn during the mission that 
the Government was making a number of efforts to combat this phenomenon by, for 
instance, providing cash transfers to rural families as an incentive to send their children to 
schools, and arranging for their transportation to schools. Similarly, in 2009-2010, a 
national programme on non-formal education benefited 38,197 children and helped to 
reintegrate 7,770 children in formal or professional education. The Independent Expert 
considers the work of the Centre r&#233;gional de documentation, d&#8217;animation et de production 
p&#233;dagogique in Marrakesh to be a remarkable Government achievement. By its work, the 
Centre has managed to halve school drop-out rates in a short period of time, supports the 
self-expression of students through various media, engages children in the cultural life of 
their community and increases their participation in cultural life in an imaginative and 
effective manner. For instance, one project implemented in 2009, with the support of an 
international non-governmental organization, focused on reorienting traditional ways of 
teaching to use a human rights-based approach. The Centre also organized a short-film 
competition for children, and additional classes for children are given by teachers on a 
voluntary basis. Importantly, the work simultaneously engages in synergy with families, 
schools and the public sphere. One challenge is that such an initiative relies to a large extent 
on the goodwill and volunteer work of teachers who do not receive paid leave to participate 
in training exercises or to do extra-curricular activities. The Independent Expert encourages 
the Government to allocate the financial and institutional resources necessary to support 
and promote this initiative, and to extend it beyond Marrakesh. A good practice to be 
possibly implemented throughout the country also is the establishment of children&#8217;s 
parliaments in Marrakech, which provides an avenue for children to discuss and participate 
in community development processes and raise awareness on, for instance, human rights 
and cultural heritage issues. For example, in 2010, 23 children parliamentarians had a 
discussion on the right to water and prepared a draft plan of action for their communities, 
which they shared with high-level national authorities. 
</p>
<p>62. The Independent Expert took note of other good practices that should be further 
supported, such as the production, by the Ministry of Social Development, Family and 
Solidarity, of excellent trilingual manuals (in Arabic, Amazigh and French) on the rights of 
the child, the new Family Code and the rights of persons with disabilities. It also includes 
the governmental initiative of teaching human rights to students at all stages of the school 
system and to members of the national legal service and public officials, including law 
enforcement officers.32 In this regard, some interlocutors emphasized that cultural rights 
were not included in such teaching or training. The Independent Expert recommends the 
inclusion of cultural rights in all human rights education programmes. Another positive 
example is initiatives supported by INDH, such as the Ben Youssef cultural complex in the 
F&#232;s medina, and the youth centre of Aourir in the vicinity of Agadir, which offer 
extracurricular art, music and drama education for children and young adults. 
</p>
<p>63. The Independent Expert commends the efforts of civil society to combat illiteracy. 
She was informed of a project of a non-governmental organization that runs a mobile 
library for the poor in the F&#232;s medina, where the drop-out rate is reportedly very high. 
Stopping at various places, the library engages children in storytelling and games, and

<p>imparts sociocultural education. It mobilizes people from the locality to volunteer. Such 
initiatives are an important means of combating illiteracy and should be encouraged.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Participation in cultural life of women and persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>64. Morocco has a number of active civil society organizations working to advance 
women&#8217;s rights. These organizations promote socio-economic, political and civil rights for 
women through various programmes aiming to, for example, provide shelters for women, 
promote literacy and improve family planning. 
</p>
<p>65. The Independent Expert would like to highlight the royal initiative to appoint female 
spiritual guides and preachers as a good practice. In 2005, the Moroccan Ministry of 
Habous and Islamic Affairs initiated the first phase of a programme to train women 
spiritual guides known as <i>mourchidate</i>. Spiritual guides are given the task of providing 
women, children and men with religious instruction and counselling in a variety of venues, 
including local mosques throughout Morocco. This initiative constitutes a first step towards 
ensuring equal opportunities for women to guide and explain religious subjects to others. It 
also creates important sociocultural spaces for women to share their experiences and 
strengthen their participation in the cultural life of local communities. It would therefore be 
useful for women spiritual guides to receive training on women&#8217;s rights and raise awareness 
of women&#8217;s rights in the community.  
</p>
<p>66. Government measures to improve the portrayal of women in media include a 
national charter for this purpose, drawn up in 2005, the establishment of a national 
observatory for the improvement of the image of women in the media (in collaboration with 
civil society) in 2012, and the establishment of a working group on the issue by the 
Superior Council on Audiovisual Communication in 2009. Nonetheless, the Independent 
Expert notes that women need to be encouraged to take a more active role in media 
productions. In Morocco, women currently tend to be users. Media can be an important tool 
for raising awareness about, inter alia, amendments in the Family Code and the new 
Constitution, and should be easily accessible to women in rural areas. Unfortunately, 
according to the interlocutors met, the mainstream media do not reflect the public 
advancements achieved by women. Media seldom use gender-sensitive language, 
frequently portray women&#8217;s roles as linked with the home and raising children, downplay 
their accomplishments in the public sphere and project a passive and negative image of 
women. This discourages any effective participation in social, political and cultural life. 
Although the media have attempted to address issues relating to sexual harassment, 
domestic violence and gender roles, these efforts are inadequate. Furthermore, owing to 
poverty and illiteracy, rural women are generally marginalized in the media.33 
</p>
<p>67. The Ministry of Social Development, Family and Solidarity is responsible for 
protecting the rights of persons with disabilities, who make up approximately 7 per cent of 
the population (5 million). The Government&#8217;s multi-pronged approach is appreciated, and 
includes a 7 per cent quota introduced in public sector employment in 2001; establishing 
special learning centres in addition to integrating children with special needs in regular 
classes; the standardization of sign language; and setting up referral centres in various 
cities. Since 2003, the Secretariat for Social Development, the Family and Solidarity, 
together with the authorities responsible for festivals, have introduced opportunities for 
children with special needs, and some festivals (such as in F&#232;s) now have wheelchair 
access. Other initiatives include providing families with financial and other support. With 
regard to the physical accessibility of persons with disabilities, the law provides regulations

<p>and building codes to this effect, although they do not seem to be effectively implemented. 
With the exception of the Rabat mediatheque, not a single building visited during the visit 
was designed or equipped to be accessible for wheelchairs or for persons with other forms 
of disabilities. It is therefore commendable that women with disabilities have established a 
handicraft centre and a shop in Marrakesh with the support of INDH.  
</p>
<p>68. There is no legislation mandating access to information and communications for 
persons with disabilities. The Independent Expert was informed about efforts to standardize 
sign language on television, and welcomes the recent introduction of a news bulletin with 
sign language on a national television channel. She encourages the Government to pursue 
its efforts, in partnership with civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Cultural rights in Western Sahara 
</b></p>
<p>69. Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1979 (2011)34 and the report of the 
Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western Sahara (S/2011/249),35 the 
Independent Expert visited Dakhla in Western Sahara. She appreciates the Government&#8217;s 
role in facilitating access for the visit. The Independent Expert holds an independent 
position and this visit should not be interpreted as expressing any political view concerning 
the present or future status of the non-self-governed territory of Western Sahara.  
</p>
<p>70. The Independent Expert learned that a number of cultural festivals are organized to 
promote and preserve Saharo-Hassani art and culture. Four public libraries have been 
opened, including a library for children. To preserve tangible cultural heritage, information 
on the area with stones engraved with ancient runes was compiled and work undertaken to 
preserve manuscripts. A cultural club, a mediatheque, a museum, an institute of Hassani 
music and a centre for preserving Hassani culture have been established. Although the 
Hassani culture is primarily oral, the centre has collected 400 manuscripts of Hassani 
poetry. 
</p>
<p>71. The national educational delegation has set up units as part of the Club of Hassani 
Educational Research. The units rely on volunteers who, based on the traditional Hassani 
practice of education, deliver religious education in the desert. With regard to the existing 
education system, a concern was raised that Saharawis do not learn about their own culture 
and history, given that they are taught only the official history of Morocco. The 
Independent Expert recalls that this is not in keeping with article 29 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and article 5 of the UNESCO Declaration on Cultural Diversity.  
</p>
<p>72. The Independent Expert is also concerned about important obstacles to the 
enjoyment of the right to participate in cultural life in Western Sahara. In particular, land 
mines jeopardize Saharawis&#8217; traditional desert-linked nomadic style of living and prevent 
local communities from organizing their leisure activities. In addition, victims of land 
mines find it difficult to obtain police reports for compensation. The Independent Expert 
was furthermore informed that international non-governmental organizations are not

 34 In the resolution, the Security Council welcomed the commitment of Morocco to ensure unqualified 
</p>
<p>and unimpeded access to all special procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
 35 In the report, the Secretary-General referred to a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of 
</p>
<p>Morocco, in which the latter reported on new or strengthened human rights institutions that would be 
&#8220;more open&#8221; to dialogue and interaction with mechanisms of the Human Rights Council. The 
Minister also indicated that Morocco was &#8220;further open to the 33 mechanisms of the United Nations 
body&#8221; and that the new arrangements fully covered the human rights dimensions of the dispute over 
Western Sahara.  </p>

<p>allowed to assist in demining efforts. She encourages the authorities to increase demining 
efforts and to accept the international offer for assistance and cooperation in this respect.  
</p>
<p>73. Saharawi families who have been divided face difficulties in transmitting cultural 
traditions and values to their offspring. The Independent Expert encourages the 
organization of family reunions on a regular and more frequent basis.  
</p>
<p>74. The Independent Expert was informed that, in the period 2009-2010, around 166 
projects supported by INDH focused on capacity-building of local associations, and that 50 
projects were dedicated to cultural development. She also learned that some associations 
experience difficulties in registering even though they submitted all necessary 
documentation.36  
</p>
<p>75. A worrying tendency reported to the Independent Expert was that some Saharawis 
had stopped wearing their distinctive traditional dress or were hesitant to do so, as they felt 
threatened or harassed by others. The Independent Expert recalls that local authorities have 
an obligation to protect the realization of cultural rights against interference by third parties 
and that, as explained by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
obligation to respect and protect the right of everyone to engage in their own cultural 
practices is to be considered a core obligation under article 15 (1) (a) of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.37 She urges the local authorities to 
address this issue and to take measures to promote a culture of tolerance and cultural 
diversity.  
</p>
<p>76. The Independent Expert was concerned to hear reports on violence that erupted 
during the organization of the Sea and Desert festival in February 2011. The attacks 
targeted mainly Saharawi houses, more than 70 of which were burned. Local authorities 
offered some financial compensation and investigations were conducted. The Independent 
Expert would like to be informed of the result of those investigations and the follow-up 
measures taken by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>77. The Independent Expert was also concerned to learn that Saharawis do not always 
enjoy in practice the right to register their preferred name for their children, in particular, 
the Hassani practice of hyphenated names. 
</p>
<p>78. Excellent initiatives supporting persons with disabilities are carried out by the local 
authorities, focusing on raising awareness about and integrating persons with disabilities 
into the school system and in employment. The Independent Expert visited a rehabilitation 
centre for persons with disabilities, and commends its work. The centre has a good 
partnership arrangement with different ministries, including the Ministry of Health, and is 
supported by INDH. Although the centre is equipped with computers, these are not suited 
for use by persons with impaired vision. The Independent Expert notes some difficulties in 
integrating children with disabilities into the educational system owing, for instance, to the 
lack of suitable public transport for physically challenged children and the lack of books in 
Braille for those with impaired vision. Furthermore, no special arrangements are made for 
persons with disabilities to participate in the numerous art festivals and cultural public 
events.  
</p>
<p>79. With regard to the conservation of tangible cultural heritage, the Independent Expert 
was disappointed to learn of the demolition of a Spanish fortress dating back to 1886 and of 
the intention to demolish a church from the same period. Thanks to the efforts of civil 
society, the church was not entirely demolished and is now being renovated. The Spanish

<p>fortress was, however, completely demolished, and an open square has been built in its 
place. Unfortunately, no public consultations were conducted prior to the decision to 
demolish these historic buildings. 
</p>
<p>80. The Independent Expert welcomes the numerous cultural initiatives and festivals 
promoted by local authorities, as well as the funding offered to cultural associations as part 
of the National Initiative for Human Development. She was, however, informed that, for 
the organization of numerous festivals, a disproportionate amount of funds was spent on 
inviting international musicians, particularly from Mauritania. At the same time, local 
musicians and music groups were reportedly screened by a committee which can ask them 
to change, for instance, the lyrics of traditional songs and other proposed performances 
should they find them inappropriate. The Independent Expert was also informed that some 
cultural practitioners were not allowed to participate. Such practices, which limit the free 
expression of cultural diversity that should be otherwise promoted and fulfilled, seem 
contrary to the right to freedom of expression and artistic freedom. 
</p>
<p>81. The Independent Expert recommends that all necessary measures be taken to ensure 
the enjoyment of the right to participate in cultural life of local communities. In particular, 
local artists should be able to participate freely in art festivals without any interference 
relating to the content of their performance, in accordance with the right to freedom of 
expression. Cultural diversity and traditional ways of life should be promoted and 
integrated into the education system, and the Saharawi population should be able to learn 
about their history and culture in schools. Families should be able to choose the names of 
their children, and family reunions should be promoted and allowed to take place on a 
regular basis. International cooperation and assistance to clear land mines in the desert 
should be encouraged.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Independent Expert emphasizes the remarkable efforts made by Morocco 
in recent years to respect and promote human rights. The amendments to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution have strengthened the protection of human rights, including those of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>most vulnerable populations, put greater importance on cultural rights and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity and conferred an official status to the Amazigh language.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Some existing laws, policies and practices are still not in keeping with the 
State</b>&#8217;s international and constitutional commitment to recognize and respect cultural 
</p>
<p><b>rights and cultural diversity. New constitutional provisions, especially those 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning cultural rights and diversity, should be effectively enforced through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption of laws, including all relevant by-laws, as stipulated in the Constitution. Such 
</b></p>
<p><b>new laws and measures require the adoption of relevant policies and strategies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be accompanied by appropriate training and orientation of duty-bearers who 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement them. While understanding that the amended Constitution has only been 
</b></p>
<p><b>recently adopted, the Independent Expert urges the Government to act in a timely 
</b></p>
<p><b>manner on this issue by continuing and further strengthening the consultative process 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopted for the constitutional amendments. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> Ensuring the cultural rights of persons belonging to specific cultural 
communities (Amazigh, Jewish and other groups) requires providing them with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>possibility of bringing their own individual and collective cultural viewpoints to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>shaping of cultural and social developments in the country as a whole, while 
</b></p>
<p><b>preserving in parallel the elements of their culture that they wish to maintain. It also 
</b></p>

</p>
<p><b>language, religion and system of traditions, customs and other artistic and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>manifestations.  
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Independent Expert encourages the Government of Morocco to approach 
cultural diversity as an invaluable resource for the inclusion of all, and to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to mainstream cultural diversity and the cultural heritage of </b>the country&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>diverse populations by, inter alia, promoting these cultures through education, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>media and cultural activities, raising intercultural competencies of all official 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions and encouraging bilingual skills in civil servants.  
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> In the Independent Expert</b>&#8217;<b>s view, a number of specific challenges need to be 
addressed. For this reason, she calls upon the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To strengthen support for the promotion and preservation of Amazigh 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Promptly promulgating laws implementing the constitutional provision 
</b></p>
<p><b>granting an official status to the Amazigh language;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Allocating subsidies to Amazigh artists, theatres and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations, including Amazigh artists in teams that travel abroad 
</b></p>
<p><b>representing the culture of Morocco;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Reforming the education sector in order to ensure the use of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Amazigh language in all education spheres, and including Amazigh language 
</b></p>
<p><b>textbooks in the official list of books prepared by the Ministry of Education to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be distributed free of charge in all schools;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Providing adequate funding and assistance in capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to promote the use of Amazigh language in education and public life; 
</b></p>
<p><b>in particular, further financial assistance should be extended to IRCAM to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that relevant books and publications are widely distributed in rural 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Ensuring that media channels broadcasting in Arabic language also 
</b></p>
<p><b>broadcast at least 30 per cent of their programmes in the Amazigh language, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>stipulated by law; further measures should also be taken to develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes at the national and regional levels to support efforts to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>the knowledge of cultural heritage and diversity in educational and youth 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes, and mobilizing the national media to advocate this approach; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Promoting language skills in Government and administrative officials 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing public services to Amazigh speakers, and in judges and lawyers, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring the training and availability of Amazigh interpreters before courts;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To ensure that civil registrars adhere fully to the provisions of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ministry of Internal Affairs circular of April 9 2010 on the choice of given names. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government should provide access to timely and effective remedies to individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>whose children have been denied registration of names. In this case, civil status 
</b></p>
<p><b>officers should provide written responses to applicants, in a timely manner, 
</b></p>
<p><b>stipulating clearly their reasons for such refusals and the possibilities of appeal. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government should also envisage adopting a new law recognizing the right of every 
</b></p>
<p><b>person to choose freely the name of their children in their own language; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To repeal Ministry of Education circular No. 122 of 7 January 2002 
</b></p>
<p><b>stipulating that non-Arabic names of a number of schools should be replaced with 
</b></p>
<p><b>Arabic names, and repeal any other similar legislation. Morocco should respect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to have access to and enjo</b>y the cultural heritage of one&#8217;s own communit<b>y and </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>that of others, including the history of communities, their outstanding figures and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their linguistic heritage;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To revise history and other subjects in school textbooks to reflect the 
</b></p>
<p>country&#8217;s diversi<b>ty, ensuring the adequate representation of cultural diversity among 
</b></p>
<p><b>authors, as well as in the independent review committee approving textbooks. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>addition, teacher-training programmes should include methodologies that reflect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>richness of Moroccan cultural diversity in the most interactive and innovative fashion.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To review its practices relating to the registration of associations in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to ensure full respect of the right to freedom of association, without any 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) To develop a national plan of action for cultural development that 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively ensures visibility of cultural diversity; in particular, to promote positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>values of cultural diversity through education, media and special programmes for 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with disabilities. To this end, adequate resources should be allocated to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement relevant strategies, policies and programmes at the central, regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>local levels. Notions of human rights, gender equality and social justice should 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to the development of a national plan for cultural development. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The Independent Expert also recommends that, during the 2014 census, 
information be gathered on the composition of the population, the use of Arabic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Amazigh and other languages, and any other indicator of the ethnic and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity of the population. In this regard, the Government may wish to seek the 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance of UNESCO regarding its work on cultural indicators.  
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> The INDH-funded projects visited by the Independent Expert are good 
practices in providing financial assistance to various projects relating to cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, women and persons with disabilities. However, the application procedure for 
</b></p>
<p><b>projects is rather cumbersome, particularly for associations in rural areas. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>introduction of a more effective, simple and user-friendly application process for 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural projects under INDH and other development agencies is crucial to 
</b></p>
<p><b>empowering the cultural civil sector and enabling more active participation at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional and national levels. Furthermore, it is imperative that activities not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>duplicated and that investments be made in maintaining infrastructure and further 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing existing cultural and youth centres; most importantly, more investment 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be made in capacity-building and making these centres more user-friendly for 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with disabilities. The Independent Expert encourages the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>create opportunities and conditions for young people, women and persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities to contribute to the cultural life of society. Concerted measures are needed 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure access to funds for youth-related projects, such as the <i>filles cavali&#232;res</i> in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Khemisset. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> To ensure effective gender equality for women providing religious guidance, 
women should be able to join </b>&#8211;<b> as full members </b>&#8211;<b> religious councils at all levels, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including fatwa institutions, and be allowed to practice religious supervision within 
</b></p>
<p><b>mosques, whether through lessons or preaching.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Morocco is to be commended for its projects and programmes aimed at 
retrieving, revitalizing, documenting and promoting cultural manifestations, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitating access to libraries, theatres, cultural centres and museums. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Independent Expert nonetheless encourages the Government to set up mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>that will allow </b>people&#8217;s effective and meaning<b>ful decision-making and participation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the identification, interpretation, promotion and protection of cultural heritage. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>this regard, she recommends that legal, financial and institutional support be 
</b></p>
<p>provided to the &#8220;<b>living human t</b>reasures&#8221; proposal.<b> Morocco should also advance its </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/26/Add.2

<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>efforts in implementing the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cultural Heritage. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that Morocco ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Independent Expert encourages members of the United Nations country 
team to include the promotion and protection of human rights, especially cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, in the next United Nations Development Assistance Framework. She also 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages the country team to continue to support efforts to promote and protect
