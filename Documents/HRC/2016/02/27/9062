<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report focuses on three thematic issues: the status of the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement (the Guiding Principles) 10 years following their submission to the 
Commission on Human Rights; the protection of persons displaced by natural disaster; and the 
inclusion of the issue of internal displacement and the people it affects in peace processes. 
</p>
<p>2. The second part of this report addresses the Representative&#8217;s country missions and working 
visits, as well as other activities aimed at maintaining a constructive dialogue with Governments 
and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The Representative thanks 
particularly those Governments which accepted and facilitated his visits, as well as international 
organizations, academics, and civil society groups working on the rights of internally displaced 
persons (IDPs), for their helpful cooperation. He equally expresses his appreciation to the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for their support for his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  THEMATIC ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement: 
the recognized international framework for the 
protection of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>3. Ten years ago Francis Deng, the then Representative of the Secretary-General on internally 
displaced persons, presented the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement to the Commission 
on Human Rights.<b>1</b> Addressing all phases of displacement - protection from displacement, 
protection and assistance during displacement, and guarantees for return, settlement, or 
reintegration in safety and dignity - the Guiding Principles set out the basic tenets of a human 
rights-based approach to protecting and assisting IDPs. The Representative, in line with his 
mandate, has continued his &#8220;efforts to further the dissemination, promotion and application of 
the Guiding Principles&#8221;.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>4. While the Guiding Principles themselves do not constitute a binding legal instrument, they 
&#8220;reflect and are consistent with international human rights law and international humanitarian 
law&#8221;.<b>3</b> The annotations to the Guiding Principles, which the Representative recently updated, 
trace the legal foundations of each Guiding Principle in international treaty law and customary 
international law emerging from general practice accepted as law.<b>4 </b>The annotations underscore

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the fact that almost every principle is underpinned by the content of and interrelationships 
between numerous treaty and customary legal provisions. In this regard, most principles do not 
exceed existing binding law; rather, they serve to restate these existing norms more precisely in 
the specific context of internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>5. The Guiding Principles have become widely accepted at the international, regional and 
State levels. At the global level, the Heads of State and Government assembled in New York for 
the 2005 World Summit unanimously recognized the Guiding Principles as an &#8220;important 
international framework for the protection of internally displaced persons&#8221;, a recognition 
subsequently echoed by the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly.<b>5</b> In addition, the 
General Assembly has welcomed &#8220;the fact that an increasing number of States, United Nations 
agencies and regional and non-governmental organizations are applying them as a standard&#8221;, and 
has encouraged &#8220;all relevant actors to make use of the Guiding Principles when dealing with 
situations of internal displacement&#8221;.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>6. During a high-level conference entitled &#8220;Ten Years of Guiding Principles&#8221;, hosted by the 
Government of Norway in Oslo from 16-17 October 2008, participants from Governments, 
international humanitarian agencies, regional organizations and civil society stressed the 
authoritative character and operational utility of the Guiding Principles. In his own address to the 
conference, the Representative emphasized that they have become the normative reference point 
for all actors dealing with internal displacement. However, he also stressed that standing alone, 
they are not sufficient to resolve internal displacement: at the national level, they must be 
translated and incorporated into a strong normative and institutional framework. While many 
Governments have begun to do so, many as well have yet to develop the political will and 
capacity to implement the Guiding Principles in their national laws, policies and programmes.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>7. At the regional level, Africa has shown the most progress in transforming the Guiding 
Principles into binding international instruments. In June 2008, the Protocol on the Protection 
and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons to the Declaration on Peace, Security, Democracy 
and Development in the Great Lakes Region (the Great Lakes Protocol on internal displacement) 
entered into force. The Protocol, which at the end of 2008 had been ratified by 8 out of the 
11 States participating in the Great Lakes process, is the first and only binding multilateral treaty 
on IDPs now in force.<b>8</b> Among other things, States parties to the Protocol undertake to adopt and

<p>implement the Guiding Principles as a regional framework for providing protection and 
assistance to IDPs in the Great Lakes Region.<b>9 </b>States parties also assume the obligation to enact 
national legislation to domesticate the Guiding Principles and to provide a legal framework for 
their implementation. 
</p>
<p>8. More recently, the African Union has finalized the text of a convention for the protection 
and assistance of internally displaced persons in Africa, to be considered and hopefully adopted 
by the heads of State and Government in Kampala, at the African Union Special Summit on 
Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons in Africa in April 2009. This would be a 
tremendous victory for the millions of displaced on the African continent and constitute an 
important example of leadership on human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. Having closely followed and supported the development of the African Union convention, 
the Representative notes with appreciation that - as the representative of the African Union 
Commission at the Oslo conference put it - the Guiding Principles were one of the documents 
that &#8220;greatly inspired the soon-to-be-adopted African Union convention&#8221;.<b>10</b> The Representative 
strongly hopes that this will also be reflected in the final text. 
</p>
<p>10. In the Americas, resolution 2417 adopted by the Organization of American States 
on 3 June 2008 urges member States to consider using the Guiding Principles as a basis for their 
plans, policies, and programmes in support of IDPs and to continue to consider implementing 
them in their domestic law or policies.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>11. Recommendation 2006 (6) of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which 
builds on the work of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council and which arguably remains 
the most authoritative statement on the protection of IDPs in Europe contains a similar 
recommendation.<b>12 </b>The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has 
recognized that the principles provide &#8220;a useful framework&#8221; for its work in dealing with internal 
displacement.<b>13 </b>

</p>
<p>12. At the domestic level, the Representative takes note of increasing efforts to incorporate the 
Guiding Principles into national legal and policy frameworks. Some 15 countries, including most 
recently Iraq, have already adopted polices or legislation specifically addressing internal 
displacement. Other countries, including Sudan, are currently in the process of doing so. At the 
request of both Governments and the United Nations, the Representative provided technical 
support in a number of cases and will continue to do so. 
</p>
<p>13. Today, some Governments explicitly recognize the legal character of the content of the 
Guiding Principles. Iraq&#8217;s National Policy on Displacement, issued in July 2008, makes 
reference to the Guiding Principles and declares that they have become &#8220;part of international 
law&#8221;.<b>14</b> Similarly, the Government of Germany has taken the position that the Guiding Principles 
&#8220;can by now be considered to be international customary law&#8221;.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The Representative remains at the disposal of interested Governments to support the 
development of domestic legislation and policies consistent with the Guiding Principles. Shortly 
after his appointment and in cooperation with the Brookings-Bern Project on Internal 
Displacement, he initiated a process of research and consultation on how best to support 
Governments in their efforts to domesticate the Guiding Principles. Following a consultative 
meeting in Vienna in May 2008 which was hosted by the Government of Austria and attended by 
Government legal experts, humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations, this 
process culminated in the publication of a manual for law and policymakers on protecting 
IDPs.<b>16 </b>The central aim of the manual is to provide advice on shaping laws and policies to 
address protection and assistance needs of IDPs in a manner that ensures full protection of their 
rights in accordance with the Guiding Principles. The manual covers all phases of displacement 
(prevention; protection and assistance; and durable solutions). Importantly, it identifies common 
problems and challenges that States face - based on their shared experiences<b>17 </b>and the

<p>  The Representative particularly recognizes the important contributions by governmental

Council, International Labour Organization, International Organization for Migration,

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Representative&#8217;s observations from four years of missions - particularly because disregard for 
the rights of IDPs is most often neither intentional nor on the face of it discriminatory. Rather, it 
may result from the fact that IDPs have particular needs and vulnerabilities that are insufficiently 
recognized or accommodated in existing law or policy. 
</p>
<p>15. The manual is addressed to national policymakers, competent ministries, legislators and 
civil society groups. Legislators and legal experts from national Governments will be invited to 
participate in regional training seminars that will take place in the course of 2009. 
</p>
<p>16. In collaboration with the International Institute of Humanitarian Law in Sanremo, the 
Brookings-Bern Project, and interested donors, the Representative hopes to continue to offer his 
annual course on the law of internal displacement to train high-level military and civil 
government officials from different parts of the world. This year the course was conducted in 
French. Participants from sub-Saharan Africa, Algeria, Haiti and Lebanon appreciated the 
opportunity to study in one of their working languages. 
</p>
<p>17. In conclusion, the Representative notes substantial progress achieved in the last 10 years in 
strengthening the normative framework necessary to effectively protect the rights of IDPs and to 
provide them with assistance. Nevertheless, he remains concerned that many countries affected 
by internal displacement have not yet adopted laws and policies in line with the Guiding 
Principles; nor have they established institutional arrangements that are sufficient to fulfil their 
primary responsibility under international law to provide protection and humanitarian assistance 
to IDPs within their jurisdiction (Guiding Principle 3). Furthermore, even where they do exist, 
significant gaps often exist between the texts of laws and policies and their implementation in 
practice. The Representative remains committed to supporting all Governments seeking to meet 
these responsibilities. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Protecting the human rights of persons displaced by natural disaster 
</b></p>
<p>18. Faced with the disasters caused by the 2004 tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, 
hurricane Katrina and the knowledge that ever more people will be displaced by disasters caused 
by climate change, the Representative has placed increased emphasis on the human rights 
protection of persons displaced in natural disasters. This has included both a review of existing 
normative frameworks and an examination of how operational response mechanisms address the 
human rights challenges arising in this context. He also carried out a series of working visits to 
countries particularly affected by hydro-meteorological disasters to review disaster management, 
responses and prevention in as far as they relate to the persons displaced by these disasters, and 
he conducted several national and regional training sessions. 
</p>
<p>19. An addendum to this report<b>18 </b>provides a comprehensive summary of the Representative&#8217;s 
activities, findings and conclusions regarding the protection of persons displaced as a result of 
     
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN-Habitat, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Health Organization, as well 
as the authors of the background studies that informed the manual.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>natural disasters, concluding with concrete and detailed recommendations to national 
Governments, the Human Rights Council and international and national organizations in general 
to enhance the protection of the victims of natural hazards and global warming. 
</p>
<p>20. Victims of natural hazard events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes or flooding, 
including displaced persons, are entitled to enjoy the full range of human rights guarantees. The 
question arises as to how a framework to ensure these rights can be established and put into 
practice. Insofar as affected persons are displaced within their own country, the Guiding 
Principles remain fully applicable. Context-specific guidance is now available in the 
Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Operational Guidelines on Human Rights and Natural 
Disasters,<b>19</b> which were proposed by the Representative to support humanitarian organizations in 
implementing a human rights-based approach when responding to natural disasters. The 
Representative also developed a pilot field manual to the Operational Guidelines which was 
released in March 2008 and now is in the process of revision. 
</p>
<p>21. In the context of the current discussions on climate change, the Representative 
acknowledges that disasters such as flooding, hurricanes, desertification or even the &#8220;sinking&#8221; of 
stretches of land, are not new. Yet the most recent findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC)<b>20</b> indicate that their frequency and magnitude are likely to increase as a 
consequence of global warming. These findings are most relevant for the issue of displacement 
and population movements in general and imply that humanitarian and development actors will 
increasingly be expected to respond to situations arising from climate-related hazard events. 
</p>
<p>22. The Representative submitted a working paper to IASC in June 2008 examining the nexus 
between climate change and displacement and highlighting normative gaps in the current legal 
framework for protection of those displaced by the effects of global warming.<b>21 </b>He identified 
five relevant situations triggering displacement: (a) increased hydro-meteorological disasters 
such as hurricanes, flooding or mudslides; (b) gradual environmental degradation and slow onset 
disasters, such as desertification, sinking of coastal zones, or increased salinization of 
groundwater and soil; (c) the &#8220;sinking&#8221; of small island States; (d) forced relocation of people 
from high-risk zones; and (e) violence and armed conflict triggered by the increasing scarcity of 
necessary resources such as water or inhabitable land. 
</p>
<p>23. The Representative concluded that persons displaced by sudden-onset disasters due to 
climate change or by instances of violence or armed conflict over scarce resources should be 
considered as internally displaced persons within the existing international normative 
framework, in particular the Guiding Principles. What this framework lacks, however, is criteria 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to distinguish between forced displacement and voluntary movement in cases of gradual 
degradation of land and living conditions and slow-onset disasters. Clear normative gaps also 
exist regarding persons displaced across international borders. 
</p>
<p>24. In order to better understand the protection challenges arising in the context of natural 
hazard events, as well as to identify possible responses to such challenges, the Representative 
visited several tsunami-affected areas in South-East Asia in early 2005. He also visited the Gulf 
region of the United States of America in early 2008<b>22</b> and conducted working visits to 
Honduras, Madagascar and Mozambique also in 2008. During these visits he convened 
workshops with international, national and governmental humanitarian actors on protection in 
natural disasters. 
</p>
<p>25. While an increasing number of persons are affected by and/or displaced as a consequence 
of a natural disaster, all too often insufficient attention is paid to the multiple human rights 
challenges they may face. The most vulnerable groups of society - including the poor, 
marginalized minorities, female- and child-headed households, chronically ill persons, persons 
with disabilities and older people without family support - suffer the most from the negative 
effects of natural hazards due to their weakened mitigation and adaptation capacities. Moreover, 
in the aftermath of natural disasters pre-existing patterns of discrimination are exacerbated, 
putting already marginalized groups at further risk of human rights abuses, such as a failure to 
protect against life-threatening natural hazards; unequal access to humanitarian assistance; 
discrimination in aid provision; sexual and gender-based violence, particularly in collective 
shelters or camps; infringements of the right to education, e.g. when schools are used as shelters 
for a prolonged period of time; non-replacement of lost documentation; unsafe or involuntary 
return or settlement elsewhere in the country; or difficulties with property restitution. 
</p>
<p>26. Disregard for the victims&#8217; human rights are not necessarily intended but often result from 
inappropriate policies, inadequate capacities, simple neglect or oversight. The Representative 
therefore promotes the integration of a rights-based approach in the design of national disaster 
mitigation and management policies, in humanitarian operations undertaken by national actors 
and international agencies and organizations, and their implementation, in order to prevent such 
violations from the outset. Moreover, the Representative encourages national Governments to 
intensify their prevention efforts by strengthening disaster risk reduction measures and 
addressing existing vulnerabilities so that concerned authorities and the communities exposed to 
the risk of recurrent natural hazard events will be adequately prepared. 
</p>
<p>27. The Representative commends the fact that during the last four years, the United Nations 
has initiated an important effort to strengthen the protection of IDPs, including those displaced 
by natural disasters and environmental degradation, through its humanitarian reform process. 
The Representative acknowledges the commitment of United Nations agencies with protection 
mandates - OHCHR, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and UNHCR - to 
addressing protection challenges arising in situations of natural disasters. However, resources 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  See A/HRC/8/6, paras. 51-53. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(in terms of both funding and human capacity) provided for protection activities have often been 
inadequate, preventing the systematic development of protection programmes that could 
otherwise effectively prevent human rights violations in this context. 
</p>
<p>28. The Representative welcomes and supports the efforts of the International Law 
Commission (ILC), which at its fifty-ninth session in 2007 decided to include the 
&#8220;Protection of persons in the event of disasters&#8221; in its programme of work and appointed 
Eduardo Valencia-Ospina as the Special Rapporteur on the subject. Without prejudice to the 
future outcome of his work, the efforts of the ILC to progressively develop and restate provisions 
of international law<b>23</b> relevant to disaster prevention and relief assistance, as well as to the 
protection of persons in the event of disasters is most timely. The Representative stands ready to 
cooperate with the Rapporteur and the ILC in order to ensure the complementarity of their efforts 
and to build on recent progress in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>29. Through the provision and leadership of a natural disasters focal point for the cluster, the 
Representative will continue participation in the disaster-related activities of the IASC global Protection Cluster Working Group (PCWG), in order to mainstream human rights protection in 
the context of natural disaster and to strengthen existing response mechanisms. He will also 
continue close collaboration with OHCHR in its work on climate change and human rights, as 
well as other initiatives such as the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster 
Reduction. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Human rights and the relationship between internal displacement  
and peace processes, peace agreements and peacebuilding 
</b></p>
<p>30. Resolving internal displacement is inextricably and unavoidably linked with the 
achievement of lasting peace. So long as insecurity remains, lost property is not restored or 
compensated for, or basic conditions for sustainable solutions are not in place, durable solutions 
simply cannot be achieved. Similarly, displacement situations may become protracted despite the 
conclusion of a peace agreement, if it is ill-conceived or poorly implemented. Likewise, 
premature or inadequate return and reintegration programmes may destabilize whatever &#8220;peace&#8221; 
has been achieved, and therefore threaten other peacebuilding efforts. 
</p>
<p>31. Peacebuilding processes are multifaceted. They involve re-establishing law and order; 
reconstruction and economic rehabilitation; reconciliation; and political transition. The way in 
which IDPs are included in and benefit from these processes may ultimately affect the success of 
peacebuilding initiatives. If the situation in their communities of origin is not perceived as safe, 
IDPs will be reluctant to return. If reconstruction and economic rehabilitation are insufficient for 
the displaced to resume an appreciable livelihood and to restart a normal life, return even if 
desired will not be sustainable. The resulting tensions can foster intercommunal violence and 
place a strain on the peace process. If IDPs cannot exercise their political rights and are 
prevented from voting, new political realities could be &#8220;democratically&#8221; legitimized without their

 <p> 
</p>
<p>participation, thus increasing feelings of marginalization. Finally, reconciliation can only truly 
and meaningfully be achieved if restitution of property or compensation for losses is 
comprehensively addressed. 
</p>
<p>32. Throughout his various missions, the Representative has observed that four universal 
elements must be resolved to enable the internally displaced to restart a normal life and to 
contribute to the reconstruction of a country emerging from conflict: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Return must be voluntary and based upon an informed decision, without coercion of any 
kind. Internally displaced persons enjoy the freedom of movement and right to choose 
their place of residence. This means that they are entitled to a meaningful choice of 
whether they want to return, integrate locally where they were displaced to, or resettle in 
another part of the country. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The safety of returnees or relocated persons must be ensured. They must be protected 
from attacks, harassment, intimidation, persecution, or any other form of punitive action 
upon return to their home community or integration in a new community. They must 
also be protected from the danger of landmines and unexploded remnants of war. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Property must be returned to the displaced and their houses reconstructed. At a 
minimum, IDPs should have access to mechanisms for property restitution and 
compensation, as well as to other transitional justice mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An environment must be created that can sustain return or local integration through 
access, without discrimination, to basic public services, to legal and personal 
documentation, and to livelihoods or income-generating opportunities. 
</p>
<p>33. The Representative notes that peace processes are not linear. Activities that address these 
four critical elements should, as much as possible, take place concurrently. Early recovery 
activities should commence as soon as the situation has stabilized. These activities should 
support IDPs in resuming a normal life either at the place of refuge, when they return or when 
they resettle in another part of the country. If they cannot return to a normal life, they are 
unlikely ever to achieve a sustainable and durable solution. Furthermore these activities must be 
tailored to the specific needs of returnees and the communities that receive them. 
</p>
<p>34. The larger policy issue of the relationship between the prevention and resolution of internal 
displacement and the process of creating a lasting peace is actively being discussed in various 
forums. Key insights have been provided through the United Nations Peacebuilding 
Commission,<b>24</b> and further developments will be presented next year in the report of the 
Secretary-General on peacebuilding and early recovery.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. Protection and perspectives aimed at generating durable solutions for IDPs should also 
constitute part of the peace agreement itself. An analysis of existing peace agreements, 
commissioned and endorsed by the Representative, shows that the issue of internal displacement 
is usually not systematically integrated.<b>25</b> It is often weakly addressed. There are several reasons 
for this: IDPs do not have a voice at the negotiating table; they may lack the resources, 
education, or political skill to have political influence, and often belong to either ethnic 
minorities or other marginalized groups; or they are dispersed, posing an obstacle to coherent 
unification of their interests. 
</p>
<p>36. To facilitate the inclusion of IDPs and their interests in peace processes, the Representative 
and the United Nations Mediation Support Unit are developing, in a comprehensive consultation 
process, a manual for mediators. This manual will provide mediators guidance on how to better 
consult with the internally displaced concerning their needs and interests, how to engage with 
them and facilitate their participation at various stages of the peace process, and how to reflect 
the human rights and interests of the internally displaced in the texts of peace agreements. The 
manual is expected to be published in spring 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>II. DIALOGUE WITH GOVERNMENTS, INTERGOVERNMENTAL  
AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>37. Pursuant to his mandate, the Representative maintains a regular dialogue with 
Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in order to promote 
and protect the rights of IDPs. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Official country visits 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Mission to Georgia 
</b></p>
<p>38. At the invitation of the Government and in the aftermath of the South Ossetia conflict, 
the Representative undertook an official mission to Georgia from 1 to 4 October 2008. The 
mission built upon the Representative&#8217;s mission of December 2005<b>26 </b>and follow-up visit of 
December 2006. The Representative&#8217;s report analyses the situation, conclusions, and his 
recommendations, and is available as an addendum to this report.<b>27</b> The Representative 
deeply regrets the current policies of the parties to the conflict on access to the 
Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia and conflict-affected areas, which prevented him from 
conducting the planned visit to the area by mid-December, when this report was finalized.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>39. As a result of the hostilities that escalated on 7-8 August 2008, some 133,000 persons 
became displaced within Georgia. The Representative welcomed the Government&#8217;s prompt 
response to the crisis of displacement and their stated intentions to take measures integrating all 
IDPs who will not be returning to their homes in the foreseeable future, including those who 
have been in protracted displacement since the early 1990s. 
</p>
<p>40. An estimated 24,596 persons returned to the Shida Karli region between 7 
and 10 November 2008,<b>28</b> with an estimated 75,000 having returned to the areas adjacent to the 
administrative border with the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia in August and September 2008. 
Their main needs relate to the challenge of recovery after return, including safety (such as 
humanitarian mine clearance) and the re-establishment of law and order. The reconstruction and 
repairs of destroyed or looted houses, humanitarian assistance, and the re-establishment of basic 
services such as education and health are important concerns, as is the resumption of economic 
activities. The Representative urged the Government to take all required steps to ensure that the 
conditions for sustainable return are created, allowing IDPs to return voluntarily, safely, and with 
dignity. 
</p>
<p>41. Government estimates of November 2008 indicate that 37,605 IDPs will not return in the 
foreseeable future. This figure includes 19,111 IDPs from the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, 
1,821 IDPs from the upper Kodori Valley, as well as those IDPs who will spend the winter 
in displacement, namely 11,500 who cannot return to the area adjacent to the 
Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia for reasons such as security or destruction of property, and 
some 5,173 IDPs from Akhalgori.<b>29 </b>The Government estimated that they would be able to 
accommodate some 21,000 IDPs in settlements by the end of 2008. The Representative 
commended the Government for its decision to provide housing for those IDPs who are unlikely 
to return home in the foreseeable future. However, he is concerned about the almost exclusive 
emphasis on the provision of infrastructure, and recommended that the Government develop a 
comprehensive integration policy with responses to the specific needs of IDPs based on the 
whole range of their civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. Moreover, the full 
participation of all segments of the internally displaced population in the planning and 
management of the resettlement plan should be guaranteed. The Representative emphasizes that 
the decision for resettlement or return must be voluntary, and he reiterates that resettlement 
opportunities shall be offered in a non-discriminatory manner, with priority being given only on 
the basis of specific vulnerability or need. IDPs must be enabled to make a well-informed choice 
about options offered to them. 
</p>
<p>42. The biggest challenge is the integration of the approximately 220,000 IDPs who have been 
living in protracted displacement for more than a decade, as described in the Representative&#8217;s 
previous report. The Representative welcomed the adoption, in late July 2008, of the Action Plan 
to implement Decree No. 47 of the Government of Georgia &#8220;On Approving of the State Strategy

IDPs into mainstream society. While welcoming the policy shift away from considering local 
reintegration and return as mutually exclusive options, the Representative remained concerned 
about the continued lack of integration of the &#8220;old&#8221; IDPs. The rights of this group must be 
ensured, on a non-discriminatory basis, alongside the response in favour of the &#8220;new&#8221; IDPs. He 
recommended that the implementation of the Action Plan for IDPs - with amendments to account 
for the newly displaced population - be given absolute priority by the Government. 
</p>
<p>43. Impeded humanitarian access to conflict-affected areas remains a paramount concern 
because of continued disagreement by the parties to the conflict over access routes. The 
Representative re-emphasized his concerns about the recently enacted Georgian Law on the 
Occupied Territories, which raises questions about its compatibility with Georgia&#8217;s obligations 
under international human rights law and international humanitarian law as restated in Guiding 
Principle 25. He urged the Government of Georgia to take all possible measures, without 
discrimination, to ensure the protection of all human rights for the internally displaced 
population from, or living inside, territories under the control of de facto authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Envisaged visits 
</b></p>
<p>44. Shortly before finalizing this report, the Representative requested the Government of Chad 
to extend an invitation for an official visit in February 2008. The Representative hopes to be able 
to present his preliminary conclusions and recommendations to the Human Rights Council when 
presenting this report. 
</p>
<p>45. Also shortly before finalizing this report, the Representative had requested a visit to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo in his capacity as one of seven independent experts mandated 
by the Human Rights Council in resolutions 7/20 and S-8/1. A separate report by the group of 
experts<b>30</b> has been published for consideration during the tenth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>46. Following requests in 2007, in 2008 the Representative reiterated his request to visit 
the Sudan. He regrets that the Government informed him on 4 November 2008 that his request 
for a visit would only be considered later in 2009. In response, the Representative confirmed his 
interest in visiting the Sudan as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>47. Finally, the Representative had hoped to carry out a mission to Somalia in summer 2008, 
although it became clear that the security situation in Somalia would not allow travel to the 
country for the time being. He remains interested in conducting an official mission to Somalia as 
soon as the security situation permits. The Representative is extremely concerned about the 
estimated 1.3 million displaced persons in Somalia, many of whom are crammed into makeshift 
camps in one of the most insecure parts of the country. Poor rains and economic shocks have 
compounded the primary cause of displacement in 2007 and 2008 - the conflict between 
insurgent forces and the Transitional Federal Government, the latter supported by the Ethiopian 
National Defence Force. Violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by all 
parties to the conflict - from indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas to arbitrary arrest and

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>30
</b>  A/HRC/10/59. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>detention, and a campaign of assassinations of civilian officials - are the main factors that 
induced them to leave their homes. These abuses occur in an environment of total impunity and 
collapse of law and order. While some aid does reach IDPs, Somalia has this year witnessed the 
highest number of killings and kidnappings of aid workers in the world. To address the causes of 
displacement, improve humanitarian access, and provide the space for durable solutions, the 
international community must engage much more seriously in establishing mechanisms that 
could end the violence and hold the parties to this conflict accountable for their actions. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Working visits and follow-up activities 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Representative also conducted working visits to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, 
Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste to follow up on previous official 
visits and/or advise on specific issues. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Representative undertook a working visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina from 16 
to 20 June 2008 at the invitation of the Minister for Human Rights and Refugees, following up 
on his official mission in June 2005. The aim of the visit was to make recommendations in the 
context of the ongoing review of the strategy for implementation of annex VII to the General 
Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Dayton Peace Agreement) 
regarding solutions to the problems faced by refugees and displaced persons, including their 
return. 
</p>
<p>50. The Representative notes with satisfaction the Bosnian Government&#8217;s many recent efforts 
to assist the displaced population, particularly given the decline in the attention of the 
international community. However he was dismayed to see, 13 years after the war, that many 
people remained displaced or in impoverished conditions in &#8220;temporary&#8221; sites established for 
returnees. He is also concerned about the lack of sustainability of many returns. 
</p>
<p>51. The Representative recommends that the Bosnian Government take urgent action to 
resolve the 8,000 pending humanitarian cases. It should locally integrate the most vulnerable, 
who languish in community centres or other forms of temporary accommodation and remain 
unable to return, and help them to re-establish decent living conditions. The success of the return 
process should be measured by the real opportunities available to the returnees, especially those 
belonging to minority groups, to rebuild their lives and reintegrate into society in their places of 
origin in sustainable ways. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>52. At the Government&#8217;s invitation, the Representative visited Colombia from 9 
to 15 November 2008 to assess developments since his official mission in 2006. 
</p>
<p>53. The Representative observed that Colombia continues to experience a severe displacement 
crisis, despite positive action by State authorities. He noted with appreciation the important role 
of the Constitutional Court in promoting and protecting the human rights of IDPs. In particular, 
in a series of decisions over the past four years, the Constitutional Court has launched a process 
that draws together the Government, international actors and civil society to jointly strengthen </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the overall response to the plight of IDPs. While policy development at the national level is very 
encouraging, the Representative notes an implementation gap at the local level. In order to 
ensure an effective IDP policy, the Representative considers that there is a need to strengthen the 
role of municipalities, which was the subject of a day-long workshop during his visit. 
</p><p>54. Notwithstanding these positive developments and the significant increase in budgetary 
allocations for implementation of the national IDP policy, as well as the strengthening of its 
operational capacities, the overall situation of internal displacement remains bleak. New 
displacement occurs at a high rate due to the ongoing conflict between the armed forces and 
irregular armed groups, as well as the emergence of new structures of organized crime and new 
illegal armed groups. 
</p>
<p>55. The Representative stresses the need for comprehensive strategies, focusing on prevention 
and protection as well as on socio-economic stabilization. Regarding prevention, he urges the 
Government to strengthen its unique early warning system by allocating the necessary resources 
for its effective implementation and by then heeding those warnings through systematic 
response. Regarding protection, the Representative expresses his concern that a considerable 
number of displaced persons may not be able to register, although registration is a precondition 
for humanitarian assistance. While fraudulent registration must be prevented, a registration 
system that does not cover all groups of displaced persons would most likely contribute to the 
further marginalization of those excluded. He also expresses his concern about threats and 
violence against IDP leaders and calls on the Government to strengthen its efforts to protect 
them. 
</p>
<p>56. IDPs have rights to property restitution or fair compensation and to reparations for other 
violations suffered. He expresses his concern about the current parliamentary discussions on a 
new law on reparations, stressing that such a law must equally respect the right to reparation of 
all victims of forced displacement, regardless of the cause or agent of displacement. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Honduras 
</b></p>
<p>57. From 6 to 10 May 2008, the Representative visited Honduras as part of a series of working 
visits on displacement of people by natural disaster. He welcomes the ongoing elaboration of a 
law on the national system for natural disaster risk management, which is certain to strengthen 
the normative framework in that area. 
</p>
<p>58. As Honduras is one of the countries most exposed to the risk of natural disasters, the 
Representative recommends the systematic incorporation of disaster risk-reduction measures into 
national development programmes; the provision of financial and technical risk management 
support to municipalities; and the taking of the necessary measures to systematically address the 
need to protect the human rights of persons affected by natural disasters, including displaced 
persons or indigenous communities affected by displacement. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Kenya 
</b></p>
<p>59. Following earlier consultations and support to the United Nations Country Team, including 
the provision of a legal memorandum to senior United Nations officials, the Representative 
conducted a working visit to Kenya from 19 to 25 May 2008 to consider the situation of those </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>displaced during the post-election violence in December 2007 and January 2008. More than 
500,000 persons were displaced at that time, although the Representative also recalled that 
substantial numbers of Kenyans were displaced due to election-related violence in 1992 and 
1997, and to a lesser extent in 2002. Acknowledging the strength of the national and 
international humanitarian response in the immediate emergency phase of the crisis, the 
Representative was, however, concerned by the speed with which return was being promoted by 
the Government, raising questions about the voluntariness of return and triggering substantial 
coordination challenges for humanitarian partners. This resulted in significant numbers of 
returnees not being able to return directly to their land, but rather clustering nearby in improvised 
transit sites, without adequate humanitarian assistance, clean water and sanitation, or access to 
health and education services, and awaiting provision of seeds and basic tools to resume farming 
in their nearby fields. The Representative underscores the need to support in addition solutions 
for those IDPs without land to return to - specifically agricultural workers, tenant farmers, 
squatters, and small business persons. 
</p>
<p>60. Given Kenya&#8217;s history of intercommunal tension and displacement, the Representative 
observes that truly durable solutions will remain elusive without a resolution of the original 
dynamics which led to the displacement. He calls for more robust reconciliation efforts, 
including transitional justice measures, the involvement of community elders, and a clear and 
demonstrated commitment to reconciliation by local as well as national political leaders. During 
a short visit to Nairobi in August 2008, he reiterated these concerns and noted the need for 
renewed efforts to provide transitional shelter and livelihoods, with an appeal to donors to 
support critical early recovery activities. The Representative observes that Kenya should seize 
the opportunity to develop a comprehensive policy on internal displacement and adopt the 
necessary laws consistent with its obligations under the Great Lakes Protocol on internal 
displacement. He stands ready to support Kenya, and other Member States, in the national 
implementation of these obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Madagascar 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Representative visited Madagascar from 2 to 7 July 2008 as a further part of his focus 
on displacement by natural disaster. The Representative welcomes the reform of the natural 
disaster emergency response agencies in Madagascar, which is regularly affected by cyclones, 
floods and droughts. He notes the important role that the United Nations system played in 
enhancing the response capacity and the coordination of humanitarian actors. While recalling 
that national authorities bear the primary responsibility for assisting populations affected by 
natural disasters, including displaced persons, the Representative emphasizes the importance of 
the efforts of the local authorities. Capacity must be built at the regional and local levels. There 
is also a need for measures to protect the most vulnerable people from discrimination and 
exploitation, particularly female heads of households, girls and elderly persons without family 
support. 
</p>
<p>62. In Madagascar, displacements caused by natural disasters often last only a few days or 
weeks. Nevertheless, the ability of returnees to recover presents a real challenge. In order to 
better meet the need during this phase to protect and assist the persons affected, who often live in 
very precarious conditions, the Representative calls on the international community and donors 
to support the Malagasy authorities in their efforts to support rehabilitation and 
income-generating activities. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Mozambique 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Representative&#8217;s visit to Mozambique (26 June to 1 July) also considered responses to 
internal displacement from natural disasters. The Government and other local stakeholders have 
made impressive efforts, with the support of the United Nations system, to protect the human 
rights of persons affected and displaced by regular flooding. The Representative notes in 
particular the institutional arrangements established to respond to these disasters, which have 
helped considerably to reduce the loss of human life from the annual floods. Such arrangements 
could serve as a model for other countries. 
</p>
<p>64. Nevertheless, complex challenges remain in the early recovery phase, in particular 
regarding issues arising from the resettlement of populations to safe areas and the balancing of 
the Government&#8217;s obligation to protect the lives of displaced persons, and the right of such 
persons to move freely and to choose their place of residence. While welcoming the positive 
aspects of the resettlement process, the Representative recommends that the authorities establish 
consultation processes with the populations concerned so that they can fully participate in 
decision-making affecting their lives. It is also important that the affected populations enjoy the 
rights to adequate housing, health and education, particularly in the resettlement areas, and have 
access to means of earning their livelihoods. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>65. As a follow-up to his mission in December 2007, the Representative returned to Sri Lanka 
at the invitation of the Government from 22 to 25 September 2008 to participate in the National 
Consultation on the Status of Internally Displaced Persons within the Framework for Durable 
Solutions. In the report on his mission in 2007, the Representative had highlighted the need not 
only to provide protection and assistance to the recently displaced, but also to tackle the issue of 
finding durable solutions for those who have been living in displacement for up to 20 years.<b>31</b> 
This National Consultation marked an important step in the efforts of the country to identify and 
facilitate the conditions necessary to do precisely that. 
</p>
<p>66. The participants recognized that displacement is not necessarily resolved when an IDP 
returns home or integrates at the site of displacement, nor when the conditions which originally 
caused displacement cease to exist. Among other things, the participants identified restitution of 
property, compensation, and access to livelihoods as fundamental to the achievement of durable 
solutions. They recommended further consultation with IDPs in order to better define existing 
obstacles before the articulation of a comprehensive national action plan. The elaboration and 
widespread communication of uniform standards and procedures for land dispute resolution, 
access to benefits, and compensation for damaged or looted property were also prioritized. At the 
end of the workshop, the Minister for Disaster Management and Human Rights announced his 
intention to develop an action plan on durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>31
</b>  A/HRC/8/6/Add.4. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>67. The Representative had the opportunity to discuss the present situation of persons 
displaced inside the Vanni as a consequence of the ongoing military operations with a number of 
high-level interlocutors, including the Secretary of Defence and the Special Advisor to the 
President. He stressed the need to ensure humanitarian access and the provision of food, 
medicine and emergency shelter materials and expressed his concerns regarding the lack of 
freedom of movement for the displaced and the ensuing negative impact on and dangers for their 
security. 
</p>
<p>68. The Representative welcomed the opportunity to participate in these discussions and to 
continue his frank and constructive dialogue with the Government of Sri Lanka. He reiterates his 
commitment to work with all relevant actors seeking to improve protection and assistance to 
IDPs and to find durable solutions for them. This includes the immediate response to more than 
100,000 new conflict-generated IDPs, and more than 200,000 total in the Vanni. In this regard, 
the Representative remains extremely concerned about the limited accessibility to the Vanni area 
granted to humanitarian actors. He urgently calls upon all parties to the conflict to scrupulously 
respect international humanitarian law in the course of ongoing military operations, including 
provisions on the conduct of hostilities, facilitation and unimpeded passage of humanitarian 
relief for civilians in need, respect for humanitarian personnel, and safe passage for civilians. 
</p>
<p><b>8.  Timor-Leste 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Representative undertook a working visit to Timor-Leste from 6 
to 12 December 2008. The Representative commends the Government for its commitment to 
and achievements in protecting and assisting IDPs - reflected in both the holistic approach to 
displacement embodied in the National Recovery Strategy and its success in voluntarily closing 
the majority of the camps established during the 2006 crisis. The Representative urges the 
Government to maintain displacement as a national priority in 2009, indicating that whether the 
returns are sufficiently supported to be sustainable, and whether solutions are found for those 
who are unable to return, will be important indicators of whether Timor-Leste will end the cycle 
of violence and displacement that have marked its history since 1975. 
</p>
<p>70. The Representative identified three primary challenges. First, to address the underlying 
causes of the violence and displacement, for which additional efforts are needed to support 
continuing dialogue and reconciliation; to redress prevailing impunity; and to resolve and 
prevent further land disputes by adoption of a land and property law. Second, the Representative 
encourages all actors now to expand their focus with activities to strengthen and stabilize 
communities of return. Finally, he notes that the approach to recovery packages - aimed at 
compensating those with damaged property to return to - has not addressed the needs of the most 
vulnerable, including those with no place of return. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Public statements and correspondence with Governments 
</b></p>
<p>71. During the period covered by this report (May to December 2008), the Representative 
conveyed relevant allegations or provided technical advice to various Governments. The 
Representative also issued several public statements and press releases related to his country 
visits. </p>

</b>72. In a letter sent to the Governments of Azerbaijan and of Armenia in December 2008, the 
Representative welcomed the renewed efforts to reach a peace agreement. In this context, he 
reiterated that IDPs are entitled to make a free, informed and individual choice on whether to 
return home in safety and dignity, to integrate locally, or to settle elsewhere within the home 
country. For this right to become reality, mechanisms must be put in place to create conditions to 
allow for a return in dignity and safety. He called on both Governments to reflect these concerns 
in an eventual peace agreement and to involve IDPs in the peace process. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>73. On 28 November, the Representative published a joint statement with the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, expressing concern about serious violations of human rights and grave 
breaches of humanitarian law in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where at least 
250,000 people have been newly displaced. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Nepal 
</b></p>
<p>74. In a letter to Nepal dated 20 October 2008, the Representative noted with satisfaction the 
adoption of the National Policy on Internally Displaced Persons (endorsed in February 2007). 
He urged the Government to proceed with adoption of the procedural directives of the National 
Policy in order to ensure its implementation and avoid negatively impacting recovery efforts. 
</p>
<p>75. The Representative regrets that the procedural directives had not been adopted when this 
report was finalized in mid-December 2008 and fears that further delay could impede the 
dispersal of donor funds for recovery efforts. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>76. In a letter to Sudan dated 4 September 2008, the Representative and the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions jointly addressed reports about an attack on 
25 August 2008 by roughly 2,000 Sudanese armed forces, national security, police, border 
guards, and armed militiamen (so-called Janjaweed) against the IDPs of Kalma Camp in 
South Darfur, resulting in civilian deaths and the destruction of dwellings. 
</p>
<p>77. The Representative regrets that the Government of Sudan had not responded to the 
mandate holders&#8217; request to clarify the accuracy of the allegations presented by the time this 
report was finalized. 
</p>
<p>78. The Representative calls on Sudan to strictly adhere to its obligations under international 
humanitarian law and human rights law, to prosecute perpetrators of grave violations, and to 
provide reparations to all victims. The Representative recalls the recommendations to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan compiled by the Group of Experts mandated by Human Rights 
Council resolution 4/8, which he helped to develop. In this regard, he strongly deplores the fact 
that the Government has yet to implement many of these recommendations.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Georgia 
</b></p>
<p>79. In a public statement issued on 14 August 2008, the Representative expressed his deep 
concern about the growing number of civilians displaced in Georgia due to the conflict in 
South Ossetia, the continuing dangers to which many of them are exposed, and the difficulties in 
providing them with shelter, medical care, and food. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Mainstreaming the human rights of internally 
displaced persons in the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) 
</b>80. During the reporting period, the Representative actively participated in the Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee at both the principals and working group levels. He also participated in the 
work of the global Protection Cluster Working Group and the Cluster Working Group on Early 
Recovery. The Representative regularly debriefed partners on missions and working visits at the 
IASC weekly meeting. 
</p>
<p>81. On the humanitarian implications of climate change, the Representative developed a 
typology of scenarios regarding its impact on migration/displacement of populations and 
analysed the legal gaps for those affected. His analysis built the basis for the discussions of the 
IASC and its contribution to the negotiations of the United Nations Climate Change Conference 
in Poznan in December 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>82. As requested by the Human Rights Council, OHCHR provides support to the 
Representative. In addition to specific OHCHR support to the mandate, the Representative and 
OHCHR co-organized several capacity-building initiatives, including a seminar on protracted 
displacement in Europe jointly organized with the Committee on Migration, Refugees and 
Population of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the Sanremo course on 
the law of internal displacement, mentioned in paragraph 16 above. In addition, the 
Representative participated in a workshop on the role of African national human rights 
institutions in protecting the human rights of internally displaced persons from 25 to 26 October 
in Nairobi, which was co-organized by OHCHR and the Brookings-Bern Project on Internal 
Displacement.

</b>  See the latest report prepared by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
</p>
<p>Sudan, on the status of implementation of the recommendations, A/HRC/9/13/Add.1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>83. The Representative also provided input to the OHCHR study on the relationship between 
climate change and human rights and made a written contribution to the OHCHR-led 
consultation on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights: the rights of 
the poor. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Representative continued to develop his close cooperative relationship with 
the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA) and has one support staff member in OCHA offices in New York. The 
Representative worked with OCHA and other partners on the development of a global 
advocacy campaign on internal displacement which was launched by the Emergency Relief 
Coordinator on 18 December 2008.  
</p>
<p>85. The Representative appreciated the opportunity to provide legal and policy advice at the 
request of OCHA field offices, including thorough guidance notes that he prepared on Kenya in 
early 2008 and on forced evacuation for Mozambique and Southern Africa in January 2008. He 
also provided inputs for OCHA on the inclusion of internal displacement issues in the Goma 
peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Representative maintains his memorandum of understanding with UNHCR, 
strengthening their collaboration and enabling him to place one externally-funded staff member 
within the agency. The Representative and UNHCR have always cooperated on his missions, and 
UNHCR has provided essential support particularly in the field. This relationship has grown 
increasingly productive and reflexive over the years. The Representative has supported the 
mainstreaming of IDP protection by UNHCR through, for example, participating in its Senior 
Management Learning Programme on IDPs. He continues to collaborate with country operations 
as follow-up to his missions, including return working visits to support strategy and planning for 
durable solutions. The Representative has also welcomed the opportunity to actively consult with 
and serve as a resource to UNHCR country operations upon request. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  United Nations Development Programme 
</b></p>
<p>87. Exemplifying the inter-agency cooperation and mainstreaming of internal displacement 
intended by humanitarian reform, a group consisting of the UNDP Bureau of Crisis Prevention 
and Recovery, OCHA, UNHCR, and the Representative organized a workshop on durable 
solutions for IDPs in the context of early recovery from 28 to 30 May 2008 in Geneva. The 
workshop convened United Nations staff from 15 country offices, donor agencies, and the 
World Bank to explore opportunities and challenges. Participants at the workshop committed to 
exploring joint programming for early recovery and pursuing stronger cooperation with donors 
for greater flexibility in funding for early recovery. The Representative notes the importance of 
early recovery: the conditions for IDPs often decline in the transitional phase from standards 
they may have reached during the humanitarian phase. Early recovery - when well-planned, 
well-coordinated, and adequately funded - can reduce dependency and enable durable solutions. 
By stabilizing communities, it builds confidence and contributes to peacebuilding. </p>

<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement, the Representative welcomes the progress made in the past 10 years 
towards greater recognition of the phenomenon of displacement caused by armed conflicts, 
situations of generalized violence, natural or human-made disasters and similar causes, and 
of the primary responsibility of national Governments to respond to such situations. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Representative re-emphasizes that the Guiding Principles reflect international 
law and restate State obligations and responsibilities emerging from international 
humanitarian law and human rights law. He acknowledges the international recognition of 
the Guiding Principles as an important international framework for the protection of 
internally displaced persons and commends the efforts of States to promote the Guiding 
Principles and implement them through incorporation into their domestic laws and 
policies. He highlights the progress made on the African continent in shaping binding 
international treaties on internal displacement particularly the Protocol on the Protection 
and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons to the Declaration on Peace, Security, 
Democracy and Development in the Great Lakes Region (the</b> <b>Great Lakes Protocol on 
internal displacement) and the draft African Union convention for the protection and 
assistance to internally displaced persons in Africa, which is expected to be adopted 
in 2009. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>At the same time, the Representative regrets that over the past 10 years, the number 
of internally displaced persons - today estimated at 1 per cent of the world&#8217;s population - 
has not declined. Rather, it continues to increase, primarily as a result of the growth in 
disaster-induced displacement related to climate change, but also because of protracted 
displacement in the context of unresolved armed conflicts. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>It is estimated that more than 26 million people are currently internally displaced as a 
result of armed conflict or other violence in more than 50 countries, with the Sudan, 
Colombia, and Iraq having the highest numbers. Over the past year, some countries, such 
as Uganda, have made progress in facilitating the return and reintegration of IDPs. At the 
same time, massive new displacement as a result of armed conflict or generalized violence 
has occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Georgia, Kenya, Somalia, 
Sri Lanka, the Sudan, and the Philippines. Meanwhile, millions remain trapped in 
protracted displacement situations in countries and regions including Azerbaijan, 
the Balkans, Colombia, Georgia, Turkey, and Somalia, because the conflicts that gave rise 
to their displacement remain unresolved. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Many countries experience displacement caused by natural disasters. In light of the 
findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is expected that the 
frequency and magnitude of natural disasters will increase, resulting in more displacement. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Representative continues to be concerned about: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ongoing displacements in many countries, often as a result of violence 
committed by State and non-State actors in violation of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) The large number of people who remain in situations of protracted 
displacement; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The frequent difficulties in facilitating durable solutions for internally displaced 
persons, which leave them in situations of deprivation, marginalization and poverty, in 
violation of their civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The failure, in certain countries, of the political will or capacity to respond 
effectively to situations of displacement and to provide displaced persons with the 
necessary protection and assistance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The increasing obstacles humanitarian agencies and organizations face in 
gaining access to IDPs, owing to restrictions imposed by Governments, as well as insecurity 
and even targeted attacks against humanitarian personnel, their supplies and means of 
transport; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The widespread impunity, in certain contexts, for acts of displacement 
amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes, and the continued commission of 
such crimes against displaced persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The difficulties that international and local stakeholders face, in certain 
countries, in effectively coordinating their activities and obtaining the funds necessary to be 
reasonably effective. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Against this backdrop, the Representative recalls that in accordance with their 
obligations under international law, States have the primary duty and responsibility to 
prevent internal displacement, to protect and assist the displaced, and to provide them with 
durable solutions once the causes of displacement have ended. He calls on Member States 
to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Reaffirm their commitment to the Guiding Principles, to create national and 
regional frameworks based on the Guiding Principles, and to develop the capacity and, 
perhaps most importantly, the political will to implement them in practice; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Draft national legislation and policies consistent with the Guiding Principles or 
to revisit existing norms to ensure that the needs of displaced persons receive an 
appropriate response, that institutional responsibilities are specified at all levels, and that 
the necessary capacities and resources to implement these responsibilities are made 
available;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Scrupulously respect their obligations under international human rights law, 
international humanitarian law and international criminal law, to refrain from any acts 
against internally displaced persons amounting to violations of these obligations, and to 
protect the displaced against violations of their rights by third parties; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Investigate, prosecute and punish crimes against humanity and war crimes 
causing internal displacement or committed against those who have been displaced; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Strengthen peace processes, in particular for &#8220;frozen&#8221; conflicts causing 
situations of protracted displacement, allow the displaced a voice in peace processes, and 
comprehensively address their rights, needs and interests in peace agreements; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Mainstream a human rights approach in national strategies for disaster 
preparedness, mitigation and adaptation to negative effects of natural hazards, to better 
protect the rights of affected persons, including those displaced; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Advocate for the protection of persons displaced by the effects of climate change 
to be addressed by current efforts to strengthen the normative framework on climate 
change. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Representative calls on de facto authorities and armed groups to scrupulously 
respect their obligation under international humanitarian and criminal law, to refrain 
from all acts causing displacement or violating the rights of the displaced and to grant safe 
humanitarian access to agencies and organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Representative calls on Governments, humanitarian and development agencies, 
and donors to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that return, or any other solution, is the result of an individual decision 
freely taken, without coercion, on the basis of adequate information; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Take all measures to facilitate the main elements prerequisite for durable 
solutions, in particular: (a) the assurance of physical safety during and after return or 
resettlement; (b) the restitution of property and the (re)construction of adequate housing 
and necessary infrastructure; and (c) the creation of an economic and social environment 
conducive to sustainability, including access, without discrimination, to public services, 
livelihoods and income-generating activities, the restitution or replacement of identity 
documents lost or destroyed during displacement, and the reinstatement of voting rights 
and other political rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Rigorously address these issues when drafting peace agreements and 
reconstruction plans following a conflict or natural disaster, in consultation with displaced 
persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) More resolutely pursue early recovery strategies while carrying out 
humanitarian, peacebuilding and development activities, taking into account the specific 
characteristics of each situation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Develop more appropriate funding mechanisms to bridge the gap between 
emergency phase funding and development phase funding, which now results in the 
systematic underfunding of early recovery activities. Funding mechanisms must be flexible 
enough to respond not only to the needs of IDPs themselves, but also to the needs of all 
displacement-affected communities - host communities as well as communities receiving 
returnees and resettling IDPs.
