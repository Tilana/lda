<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh session from 2 
to 13 May 2011. The review of Samoa was held at the 12th meeting on 9 May 2011. The 
delegation of Samoa was headed by Fonotoe Nuafesili P. Lauofo, Deputy Prime Minister of 
Samoa. At its 16th meeting, held on 11 May 2011, the Working Group adopted the report 
on Samoa. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Samoa: Bangladesh, Poland, and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Samoa: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/WSM/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/WSM/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/WSM/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Latvia, the 
Netherlands and the United Kingdom was transmitted to Samoa through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Samoa continued to uphold, promote and protect the human rights of its people 
consistent with its cultural and environmental context. As a small island and least 
developed State, Samoa acknowledged the challenges it faced in realizing human rights for 
its people and the importance of working together in a concerted manner with the 
international community to that end. 
</p>
<p>6. Samoa highlighted some of the salient elements of the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the country and responded to the advance questions it had received from 
the Czech Republic, Latvia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>7. Concerning training of police officers on human rights issues, Samoa indicated that 
the Ministry of Police and Prisons had incorporated various training programmes on human 
rights issues for all police officers and that such training had also formed part of the police 
force&#8217;s pre-deployment preparations for United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. 
</p>
<p>8. On the establishment of a national human rights institution, Samoa would continue 
to work closely with its development partners and regional institutions in the development 
and establishment of a model that would best suit the culture and existing policy and legal 
framework of Samoa. 
</p>
<p>9. On the question of the decriminalization of abortion, Samoa explained that the 
Crimes Ordinance 1961 was currently being reviewed by the Samoa Law Reform 
</p>
<p> <b>3 </b></p>


<p>Commission. Samoa being a predominantly Christian country, decriminalization of 
abortion would need careful consideration and an ample public discussion in order to 
achieve a sustainable and practical amended legislation that would accommodate and 
reflect the sensitive nature of the issue. Currently, abortion could be made legal only when 
the continuation of a pregnancy might have implications on the life of the mother or of the 
unborn child. 
</p>
<p>10. On the question regarding a standing invitation to special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council, Samoa reaffirmed its standing invitation for any special procedures of the 
Council to visit Samoa as extended in paragraph 43 of its national report. 
</p>
<p>11. Regarding steps to address traditional attitudes towards domestic violence and 
gender discrimination, Samoa reported that the Domestic Violence Unit within the Ministry 
of Police and Prisons of Samoa, with the assistance from the New Zealand Police, as well 
as the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, had various community 
awareness and education programmes on domestic violence, which were publicized 
through, inter alia, television and radio talkback shows and in schools, youth groups and 
village communities. Those initiatives were aimed at disseminating information, educating, 
and enhancing public understanding at all levels of society on the scourge of domestic 
violence and gender discrimination. With assistance from the United Nations Population 
Fund (UNFPA), the Men against Violence Advocacy Group had been established to lead 
advocacy and to campaign, targeting men and village leaders to join forces to eliminate 
violence and gender discrimination. 
</p>
<p>12. In order to provide shelters for victims of violence, the Government of Samoa had 
been working closely with the Samoa Victim Support Group, a non-governmental 
organization (NGO) that provided services in this area, including through the provision of 
funding assistance to support the Group&#8217;s programmes for victims of violence and the 
shelters it operates. The Government&#8217;s proposed Community Sector Program, which was 
about to be completed, would facilitate financial and technical support for NGOs providing 
services in this area and enhance coordination between the Government and NGOs on child 
protection and violence against women and children. 
</p>
<p>13. Samoa indicated that the Family Safety Bill 2009, which comprehensively addressed 
domestic violence, was at the finalization stage and it was expected to be submitted to 
Parliament before the end of 2010. The review of the Crimes Ordinance 1961 included 
stiffer penalties for sexual crimes. 
</p>
<p>14. Regarding the question on available mechanisms for the review of police conduct, 
Samoa emphasized that unacceptable behaviour by police was not tolerated. Police officers 
found guilty of breaking the law and committing a crime were prosecuted in courts. The 
Professional Standards Unit of the Samoa Police Service, established to examine police 
misconduct, was reviewed by the Ombudsman, and appropriate recommendations made to 
the Minister of Police and the Attorney General for a final decision. The Police disciplinary 
regime was undergoing further review in order to continue to be able to provide a 
transparent process. The Public Service Commission also provided oversight on the public 
service as a whole. 
</p>
<p>15. On the issue of the legal status of patrilineal inheritance, Samoa explained that its 
laws did not prohibit or discriminate against women owning or inheriting property. 
Customary land was held collectively by a family under the custodianship of the family 
chief. The successor to the chiefly title could be a male or a woman. Title to freehold land 
was held individually, with no gender specifications on ownership and inheritance. The 
notion of patrilineal lineage of property, both customary and freehold, had no cultural or 
legal foundation in Samoa. 
</p>
<p><b>4</b>  </p>


<p>16. Concerning child street vendors and child labour, Samoa referred to its National 
Policy for Children 2010-2015, aimed at strengthening institutional mechanisms to enhance 
child protection programmes and services. Samoa noted that keeping child vendors off the 
streets remained a challenge. The pilot survey on child vendors conducted in 2006 noted 
that the existence of child vendors was due largely to issues of hardship and poverty. The 
implementation of the National Policy for Children, the National Policy for Women 2010-
2015 and the Community Sector Plan focusing on poverty alleviation would help to address 
this issue.  
</p>
<p>17. In addition, and in line with the Strategy for the Development of Samoa for 2010-
2012, the provision of an enabling environment conducive to the creation of income-
generation activities to support family and community livelihoods was a priority for Samoa. 
Furthermore, several ongoing and proposed poverty alleviation programmes for 
employment and income generation were in place. The Samoa School Fee Grant Scheme 
would provide free education for all children for the full eight years of primary school. 
</p>
<p>18. Concerning changes to the electoral system, Samoa explained that the nomination of 
a single candidate by a district signified the unanimity of a decision by the whole district 
and the confidence of district members in the one candidate who they felt best represented 
their interests in Parliament. Such village decisions involved a lengthy process of dialogue 
and consultation that might take months before a collective decision was made. Samoa 
considered that the nomination of one person was a form of democracy that demonstrated 
stability in village politics. 
</p>
<p>19. Samoa mentioned that it worked closely with its development partners and 
intergovernmental organizations in order to address its human rights challenges and help 
achieve its developmental challenges. Samoa thanked the Government of New Zealand, 
OHCHR, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the Secretariat of the Pacific 
Community for the training and the financial and technical assistance it had received to 
assist with putting together its national report and enabling the participation of Samoa in the 
UPR. 
</p>
<p>20. Samoa indicated that increasing the participation of women in public life and 
decision-making was one of the priority areas of the National Policy for Women. 
Awareness, capacity-building and training activities for women had also been conducted to 
enable women to take on leadership roles. A new initiative facilitated by the Ministry of 
Health, entitled Women in Leadership Advocacy, provided a forum to bring together 
women in leadership positions in the public sector to share experiences and lessons learned 
as a way to support each other as they pursued their leadership roles in Government. Samoa 
believed that contesting Parliament seats by women and men candidates alike must enjoy 
the nationwide decision-making process that was vested in a democratic general election. 
</p>
<p>21. While Samoa had not yet signed other international human rights conventions, many 
rights had been advanced and mainstreamed into Government policies and plans. Samoa 
would continue to actively assess the remaining conventions relative to its capacity to meet 
the financial, administrative, legislative and institutional obligations, to ensure that Samoa 
was able to deliver upon becoming a State party to those conventions. 
</p>
<p>22. Samoa noted the gaps and weaknesses in its legislative framework on upholding 
equality and non-discrimination based on sexual orientation, and that relevant legislation 
was being reviewed by the Samoa Law Reform Commission. Samoa indicated that 
<i>Fa&#8217;afafine</i>, gays and lesbians were integral members of Samoan society and were heirs to 
family chiefly titles and lands through extended family consensus, as all men and women of 
its society were. However, sexual orientation was a sensitive issue in Samoa given the 
religious and cultural beliefs of mainstream society. Nonetheless, Samoa was confident that 
</p>
<p> <b>5 </b></p>


<p>education, awareness and sensitization would pave the way for societal acceptance and 
prevention of discrimination that might arise out of sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>23. Plans were being formulated to reform the prisons through the law and justice sector 
programmes, such as the establishment of a prison system authority, independent of the 
Ministry of Police, with a view to providing improved service and realizing the basic rights 
of inmates. Samoa recognized the remaining challenges for the full realization of the rights 
of inmates or persons deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>24. Samoa was committed to achieving poverty alleviation and food security, enhancing 
social conditions and achieving the Millennium Development Goals in order to ensure an 
adequate standard of living for every Samoan. Priority was being given to the rejuvenation 
of the agriculture sector, as well as to reforms aimed at improving health care and services. 
Furthermore, access to education and training had been a priority of Samoa for a long time. 
</p>
<p>25. Samoa indicated that it was vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and natural 
disasters. Several programmes and initiatives were in place to ensure resilience and 
preparedness. The Government of Samoa continued to coordinate and monitor efforts in 
that regard through the National Disaster Council chaired by the Prime Minister and the 
National Advisory Committee, which consisted of the heads of all Government agencies. A 
national strategy on climate resilience was being developed with assistance from the Asian 
Development Bank. That work was made more imperative given the country&#8217;s experience 
with the devastating tsunami of 29 September 2009. 
</p>
<p>26. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment was implementing various 
adaptation and mitigation projects to address the adverse impacts of climate change, and 
Samoa would continue to invest in renewable energy sources, such as hydropower, solar 
energy and biofuel from coconut oil and biomass, as alternatives to fossil fuel. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, 31 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>28. A number of delegations commended Samoa for the presentation of its national 
report, the participation of civil society in its preparation, and the country&#8217;s participation in 
and commitment to the UPR process despite the challenges it faced as a small island State. 
The translation of the national report into the local language was also praised. 
</p>
<p>29. New Zealand noted that Samoa intended to establish a national human rights 
institution in compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for 
the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). It also noted the pervasive 
problem of domestic violence and the fact that Samoa was party to a number of core human 
rights instruments. While welcoming the setting up of the National Disability Taskforce, 
New Zealand noted the lack of a specific law on that issue. It also noted the existence of 
street vending by children during school hours. New Zealand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Algeria commended Samoa for its activities towards ensuring the right to education 
and health and women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. Algeria was encouraged by the country&#8217;s 
determination to improve the quality of life of its people as reflected in the strategy for 
development for 2008&#8211;2012. It noted the challenges faced by Samoa, stemming from the 
modest size of its economy and its vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters, and 
their impact on the effective enjoyment of human rights. It called for international solidarity 
to help Samoa ensure the enjoyment of human rights. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Canada welcomed the plan aimed at establishing a national human rights institution 
and favourably noted the setting up of the Domestic Violence Unit within the Ministry of 
</p>
<p><b>6</b>  </p>


<p>Police and Prisons, although it noted the poor living conditions in prisons, the alleged 
police abuses and the absence of provisions protecting people from discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Turkey<b> </b>commended Samoa for adopting a comprehensive framework for the 
enhancement of human rights. It<b> </b>encouraged Samoa to continue efforts to become party to 
core international human rights treaties. It commended the progress in establishing a human 
rights commission and encouraged further initiatives to start its functioning. Turkey 
appreciated the work on enacting a family safety law, which together with the new criminal 
code would make significant contributions to fighting sexual and gender-based violence 
against women and children. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Slovenia<b> </b>commended Samoa for planning to accede to the two Optional Protocols to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. While welcoming the high priority given to 
education, Slovenia noted the high dropout rate in primary education and inquired about 
measures taken to address it. Slovenia further inquired on measures taken to tackle 
domestic violence and to address the underrepresentation of women in decision-making 
processes. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Germany<b> </b>commended the achievements Samoa had made in the human rights area, 
but noted the concerns of the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding the low age 
of criminal responsibility, the absence of a juvenile justice system and the provision of 
alternatives to judicial proceedings and imprisonment. Germany sought information on the 
construction of a juvenile detention centre. Noting discriminatory common-law rules that 
have rendered difficult the prosecution of sexual offenders, Germany inquired about 
legislative changes to increase the threat of punishment for sexual violence in marriages 
and on measures protecting women from sexual and/or domestic violence. Germany made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>35. While noting that Samoa was party to a number of core human right treaties, France 
inquired whether the country intended to accede to the outstanding instruments. France 
further inquired on the advancement of the plan aimed at establishing a national human 
rights institution, and on plans to adopt a law prohibiting corporal punishment. France 
referred to laws punishing sexual activities between consenting adults of the same sex. 
France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Japan<b> </b>commended Samoa for being party to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and for its efforts to ratify the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It 
welcomed measures to address domestic and sexual abuse of women and children, 
including the National Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women, the Family Safety 
Bill 2009, and the amendment of the Crimes Ordinance 1961 Act to impose stricter 
penalties for such crimes. Japan noted treaty bodies&#8217; concerns over the situation of women 
in the employment sector and their limited political participation, and hoped Samoa would 
make further efforts in that regard. Japan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Chile noted that the culture promoted the respect of human rights in a peaceful and 
cohesive society. Chile noted that, despite the changes linked to modernization, Samoa still 
praised the values of mutual respect and reciprocity and the well-being of the person. Chile 
was concerned that climate change and natural disasters were threatening the enjoyment of 
human rights. While noting the measures taken by Samoa, Chile indicated that international 
cooperation was crucial in tackling those issues. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Cuba<b> </b>noted that, despite challenges faced, including financial constraints and limited 
capacity, and the adverse effect of climate change and natural disasters, Samoa was 
committed to promoting human rights. Cuba particularly noted health-related efforts, 
</p>
<p> <b>7 </b></p>


<p>including community plans and awareness-raising programmes in environmental health, 
water and sanitation, nutrition, food security, sexual and reproductive health, preventive 
health programmes, health research and promotion of public health. Cuba acknowledged 
measures on the rights of women and of persons with disabilities, efforts to boost economic 
growth through employment creation, and assistance provided for those affected by climate 
events, especially the 2009 tsunami. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Norway<b> </b>was concerned that Samoa had not yet ratified the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, that despite the ratification of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, children remained insufficiently protected in 
domestic law and that corporal punishment was lawful in the home and not explicitly 
prohibited in schools. It was also concerned that the country&#8217;s legislation discriminated 
against women regarding inheritance and did not afford similar protection to married and 
unmarried women against coerced sex. It noted women&#8217;s weak representation in 
government and welcomed the commitment of Samoa to equality and non-discrimination 
outlined in its national report. Norway commended Samoa for its support of the joint 
statement on ending acts of violence and related human rights violations based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity adopted by the Human Rights Council. Norway made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Argentina<b> </b>welcomed the information included in the national report, notably that 
relating to the measures taken on gender equality. Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Hungary welcomed the establishment of the Samoa Law Reform Commission in 
2008 and the ratification of a number of core human rights instruments. Hungary 
encouraged Samoa to further strengthen its human rights mechanisms with international 
and regional assistance. Hungary noted with satisfaction improvements in the education 
sector and suggested that Samoa increase the education budget. Hungary also noted 
measures taken on gender equality. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Australia<b> </b>welcomed the commitment made by Samoa to fulfil its human rights 
obligations, particularly under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and 
commended its National Development Strategy focusing on the advancement of women 
and children. Welcoming the establishment of the Domestic Violence Unit, Australia 
remained concerned about prevailing violence against women. It commended the country 
for the National Policy for Persons with Disabilities and the Inclusive Education 
Demonstration Program and encouraged Samoa to ratify the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. Australia noted the challenges Samoa faced in attaining 
development goals. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Thailand commended Samoa for continuing efforts to promote human rights despite 
the added challenges it faced following the 2009 tsunami. Thailand also noted a number of 
policies such as the 2009 Education Act and the Strategy for the Development of Samoa for 
2008-2012. Thailand commended the efforts of Samoa relating to its treaty body reporting 
obligations, which should be supported through technical cooperation. While noting the 
attention paid by Samoa to female offenders, Thailand recalled the United Nations Rules 
for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders 
(Bangkok Rules) applicable to those inmates. Thailand stood ready to continue and explore 
its cooperation with Samoa. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Brazil<b> </b>commended Samoa for abolishing the death penalty and for the priority given 
to education and health. It was concerned about gender equality, including the lack of 
appropriate legislation on discrimination against women; restrictions to freedom of 
expression and assembly; widespread use of corporal punishment against children; and 
limitations on the promotion of rights of persons with disabilities. It inquired about 
</p>
<p><b>8</b>  </p>


<p>intentions to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and measures to 
prevent violence against women and children, including domestic violence and trafficking. 
Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Spain emphasized the efforts made by Samoa in adopting the Strategy for the 
Development of Samoa for 2008-2012 and its co-sponsoring of the joint statement on 
ending acts of violence and related human rights violations based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity recently adopted by the Human Rights Council. Spain inquired about 
measures taken to promote the participation of women in political and social life due to 
their low representation in the Parliament and the Cabinet, and about measures taken to 
allow all Samoan citizens to run in parliamentary elections. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Slovakia<b> </b>acknowledged the vulnerability of Samoa to natural disasters and 
commended its commitment to establish a legal framework for refugee protection. It noted 
poor prison conditions and inmates being subjected to physical or sexual abuse. It also 
noted the concerns of the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding the low age for 
criminal responsibility, the potential exposure of children to sexual exploitation given the 
growing tourism industry, and the growing number of working children. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Mexico welcomed the significant efforts made to improve the human rights 
situation, particularly those towards the establishment of a national human rights institution. 
Mexico noted the prevailing economic constraints and inquired whether Samoa intended to 
seek international assistance to speed up the process to acceding to international 
instruments and to adapt national legislation accordingly. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. China<b> </b>acknowledged comprehensive measures taken by Samoa to promote and 
protect human rights and adhere to human rights treaties. China noted that Samoa was 
actively safeguarding the rights of vulnerable groups, including women and persons with 
disabilities, and recognized its endeavor to improve peoples&#8217; social and cultural well-being 
and the importance accorded to health. China acknowledged the challenges faced by Samoa 
as a developing country, especially challenges to meeting its reporting obligations, and 
called on the international community to provide all necessary assistance. 
</p>
<p>49. The United States of America<b> </b>commended the successful 2011 general elections, the 
commitment of Samoa to a free and fair electoral process and the role of an independent 
and vigorous press. The United States commended Samoa for reconsidering laws that 
restricted the human rights of individuals based on their sexual orientation; for attempting 
to address prison overcrowding; and for continuing to combat domestic violence. It 
expressed concern at reported police abuses and at governmental statements suggesting that 
the freedom of religion might be restricted, notwithstanding the final report of a 
commission of inquiry on freedom of religion, which was still pending. The United States 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Maldives<b> </b>noted the challenges faced by Samoa regarding human rights protection 
and promotion, given its size and capacity constraints. It also noted that the rich culture of 
Samoa was supportive of safeguarding human rights and acknowledged the country&#8217;s 
commitment to incorporate international obligations into domestic law. It sought 
information on gender-mainstreaming efforts and the impact of climate change on human 
rights. Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. The United Kingdom welcomed the prominence given by Samoa to human rights 
despite the capacity and resource challenges. It hoped that the consultation with civil 
society would continue in the UPR follow-up process. It noted the country&#8217;s efforts to 
address gender discrimination and urged Samoa to ensure that customs did not prevail over 
</p>
<p> <b>9 </b></p>


<p>the obligation to guarantee gender equality. It welcomed the proactive efforts made to 
address violence against women and children, and urged Samoa to pass the Family Safety 
Bill. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Indonesia<b> </b>noted that Samoa was the first Pacific Island country to gain independence 
in 1962 and acknowledged its culture, known as &#8220;<i>fa&#8217;asomoa</i>&#8221;, which promoted and 
protected human rights by providing the foundation of a peaceful and cohesive society. 
Indonesia further noted that the Constitution guaranteed the rights to life, to personal 
liberty, to fair trial, to freedom of religion, to speech, to assembly and association and to the 
freedom from inhumane treatment and from forced labour. Noting remaining challenges, 
Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. South Africa<b> </b>appreciated the steps undertaken to establish an independent national 
human rights institution and encouraged Samoa to continue to make that a priority objective 
with the necessary resources. South Africa noted that gender violence and discrimination 
against women were major challenges and inquired about the effectiveness of the steps 
being taken to address that serious challenge. South Africa made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Costa Rica<b> </b>recognized the efforts of Samoa to protect and promote human rights, 
and particularly the progress made in areas such as health and education. Noting the 
country&#8217;s efforts towards achieving equality for and non-discrimination against women, 
Costa Rica underlined the many remaining challenges in this regard. Costa Rica sought 
information on measures to mitigate the costs and effects of climate change on the full 
enjoyment of human rights. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Nicaragua recognized the steps taken towards human rights promotion despite 
budgetary constraints. Noting the economic constraints of Samoa, Nicaragua wanted to 
share its experience in guaranteeing economic, social and cultural rights through the 
implementation of alternative strategies based on community action, women&#8217;s 
empowerment and citizen&#8217;s participation in decision-making. Nicaragua stated that the 
UPR would help Samoa in building up a legislative and institutional framework. Nicaragua 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Ecuador acknowledged the efforts made by Samoa in implementing international 
standards for ensuring, respecting and promoting human rights. Ecuador made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Morocco noted a number of achievements made, particularly in human rights 
awareness-raising, the adhesion to a number of core human rights instruments and 
improvements made in the recognition of the rights of women to education, employment, 
and economic, social and political resources. Morocco underlined that Samoa would reach 
its goals only with international technical and financial assistance. Morocco made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Ireland<b> </b>noted with appreciation that Samoa was drafting a strategic plan on the 
requirements for establishing a human rights commission. Acknowledging the 1988 
establishment of the Ombudsman Office, Ireland was concerned at inadequate public 
awareness of the role of the Office and sought information on remedial measures, including 
heightening its profile. Ireland welcomed the establishment of the Professional Standards 
Unit to provide training to the Police on addressing violence against women and children 
and inquired about measures envisaged to eradicate those phenomena. Ireland commended 
the establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate alleged violations of religious 
freedom. Ireland made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>59. The Philippines acknowledged the steps taken by Samoa to strengthen the 
promotion and protection of human rights and commended Samoa for having ratified a 
number of international human rights instruments. It noted the possible establishment of a 
</p>
<p><b>10</b>  </p>


<p>national human rights institution and inquired about how Samoa used local culture and 
traditions to promote human rights. The Philippines further inquired about how Samoa 
addressed the climate change effects on human rights and about the areas in which it 
needed international assistance. The Philippines noted the efforts made by Samoa in 
enhancing women&#8217;s rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Samoa proceeded to respond to some of the concerns and questions raised during the 
interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>61. On the area of the advancement of women and improving the rights of children, 
Samoa pointed out that the Cabinet had endorsed the National Policy for Women, the 
National Policy for Children and the National Policy for Persons with Disabilities, which 
provided the strategic direction for the delivery of the obligations of Samoa under the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>62. On the issue of persons with disabilities, Samoa noted the recent establishment of 
the Unit for Persons with Disabilities under the Ministry of Women, Community and Social 
Development. That development would assist in the coordination and provision of support 
to the National Disabilities Taskforce and help advance efforts towards the ratification of 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>63. On the questions relating to the issue of violence against women and children, 
Samoa noted that it continued to conduct education, awareness and advocacy programmes 
in order to change mindsets and attitudes towards gender violence. The implementation of 
the policies for women and children would strengthen the policy and legal framework of 
Samoa through gender mainstreaming, delivery of gender trainings and the conduct of 
social impact assessments, in order that women and children might have full enjoyment of 
their human rights. 
</p>
<p>64. Regarding the effectiveness of steps taken to address violence against women, 
Samoa mentioned that it had confidence in the effectiveness of steps taken to tackle that 
problem, as evidenced in the number of reported cases that had reached the Courts. Samoa 
noted that it was continuing its advocacy and educational efforts to raise awareness among 
men and women about the importance of tackling the issue. 
</p>
<p>65. Concerning the ratification of international instruments, Samoa reiterated that it was 
a State party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the eight 
fundamental human rights conventions of the International Labour Organization, and a 
signatory to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. The Government would continue to actively assess the implication of 
accession to the remaining human rights conventions to which members had referred, in the 
context of its ability to meet the financial, legislative, institutional and administrative 
obligations required of Samoa as a State party. Samoa noted that while it was not yet a 
party to those other human rights conventions, their objectives and provisions had been 
already mainstreamed and incorporated in national plans and programmes. 
</p>
<p>66. With regard to the impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights of 
Samoans, Samoa indicated that climate change affected food security, the right to water, 
access to health, the right to life, the right to an adequate standard of living, and freedom of 
movement, due to internal displacements. National resources were redirected to climate 
change adaptation and mitigation programmes, including the rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of areas and communities that had been devastated or would be devastated 
by natural disasters and climatic events. Samoa looked forward to working closely with its 
development partners and intergovernmental organizations on mitigation and adaptation 
</p>
<p> <b>11 </b></p>


<p>projects. At the same time, Samoa would continue to invest in using renewable hydro, solar 
and biofuel energy as an alternative to fossil fuel. 
</p>
<p>67. Samoa indicated that a juvenile detention centre had been functioning since 2008 
under the Ministry of Police and Prisons. 
</p>
<p>68. The minimum age of criminal responsibility remained at 10 years; however, under 
the Young Offenders Act of 2007, a Youth Court had been established to try people 
between the ages of 10 and 17. 
</p>
<p>69. As to the establishment of a human rights institution, Samoa was in the process of 
drafting legislation to this end. 
</p>
<p>70. With regard to the situation of prisons, Samoa was also in the process of drafting 
legislation to remove the responsibility for prisons from the Ministry of Police and establish 
a fully separate prison authority. 
</p>
<p>71. Samoa thanked each delegation for their comments and inputs. Samoa considered 
that the UPR process afforded to it the opportunity to share its story on efforts to uphold 
and protect human rights in Samoa and the challenges it faced in that regard. 
</p>
<p>72. In recognizing the challenges Samoa faced as a small island developing State, 
Samoa remained committed to fulfilling its obligations and responsibilities and continuing 
to work closely with the civil society, regional and international partners in advancing 
human rights in Samoa.
