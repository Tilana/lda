<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate on the situation of human rights in Myanmar was established in 1992 by the 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1992/58 and extended by the Human Rights 
Council in its decision 1/102 and resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p>2. In March 2008, the Council reviewed the mandate, and in its resolution 7/32, extended it 
for another year. On 1 May 2008, Tom&#225;s Ojea Quintana (Argentina) officially assumed the 
function of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, succeeding 
Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report is submitted in accordance with Council resolution 7/31. It covers 
human rights developments in Myanmar since the previous report submitted to the Council 
(A/HRC/7/24) in March 2008 on the latest developments of the implementation of Council 
resolutions S-5/31 and 6/33. In view of the short time between the official assumption of his 
mandate and the timeline reporting constraints of the Council for the present session, the 
Special Rapporteur considers it important to inform the Council on the information brought to 
his attention relevant to the areas covered in the above-mentioned resolutions. However, he 
would like to point out that the present report should be observed as a preliminary analysis 
requiring further research and discussions with the Government of Myanmar.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>4. In the above-mentioned resolutions, the Government of Myanmar is requested (a) to ensure 
full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to investigate and bring to justice 
perpetrators of violations of the human rights of peaceful protesters during the demonstrations of 
September 2007; (b) to release, without delay, those arrested and detained as a result of 
the demonstrations, and to release all political detainees in Myanmar, including the 
General Secretary of the National League for Democracy (NLD), Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and 
to ensure that the conditions of detention meet international standards and include the possibility 
of visiting any detainee; (c) to lift all restraints on peaceful political activity of all persons by, 
inter alia, guaranteeing freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of opinion 
and expression, including for free and independent media, and to ensure unhindered access to 
media information for the people of Myanmar; (d) to engage urgently in a reinvigorated national 
dialogue with all parties with a view to achieving genuine national reconciliation, 
democratization and the establishment of the rule of law; and (e) to cooperate fully with 
humanitarian organizations, including by ensuring full, safe and unhindered access of 
humanitarian assistance to all persons in need in the country. 
</p>
<p>5. The Council also requested the Special Rapporteur to monitor the implementation of its 
resolutions and to conduct visits to the country. It encouraged the Government of Myanmar and 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to continue to 
engage in a dialogue with a view to ensuring full respect for all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. 
</p>
<p>6. The Council resolutions, while focusing on the tragic events of September 2007, are also 
relevant to key current situations in the country with regard to the constitutional process and the 
devastating effects of cyclone Nargis. In accordance with resolution 7/31, in the present report 
the Special Rapporteur focuses on the human rights issues pertinent to the current constitutional 
process in the country and the developments with regard to the crackdown on the demonstrations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of September 2007. He also reviews the impact on the human rights situation of the people of 
Myanmar of tropical cyclone Nargis and on access to humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, the 
report includes the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s overview of the methodology and programme of work 
that he would like to follow in discharging his mandate. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur addressed two letters to the Government of Myanmar. In the first 
letter, dated 6 May 2008, he expressed his distress and profound sympathy to the people of 
Myanmar following the devastating cyclone; in the second letter, dated 7 May, he focused on 
establishing formal contacts by introducing himself and requesting to visit the country. The 
Government of Myanmar responded to his first letter, expressing its deep appreciation on behalf 
of the people of Myanmar for his kind message regarding the tragic event, noting that the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s support and encouragement reflected the cooperation between the 
Government of Myanmar and the Council. At the time of finalization of the present report, the 
Special Rapporteur had not yet received any reply to his request for a visit. He very much hopes 
that, in accordance with the sense of collaboration expressed in the above-mentioned 
communication, his request will be accepted by the Government. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur would like to benefit from the expertise developed by his 
predecessors and explore with the authorities, national partners and the people of Myanmar 
positive ways to address the main human rights challenges in the country. He would also like to 
thank OHCHR and its Regional Office for South-East Asia for the support received in the 
implementation of his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p>9. In its resolution 7/31, the Council requested the Special Rapporteur to report to it at its 
eighth session on the implementation of resolutions S-5/1 and 6/33. In those resolutions, the 
Council addressed a number of requests to the Government of Myanmar in substantive thematic 
areas. With regard to the current constitutional process, the Council requested the Government to 
lift all restraints on the peaceful political activities of all persons by, inter alia, guaranteeing 
freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of opinion and expression, including 
for free and independent media, and to ensure unhindered access to media information for the 
people of Myanmar and to engage urgently in a reinvigorated national dialogue with all parties 
with a view to achieving genuine national reconciliation, democratization and the establishment 
of the rule of law. The Special Rapporteur therefore considers it relevant to provide the Council 
with the information set out below. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Developments in the constitutional process, including the referendum 
</b></p>
<p>10. On 19 February 2008, the finalization of the draft Constitution, the fourth step in the 
Government&#8217;s 7-step road map to democracy, was announced. On 9 April, it was announced that 
the referendum on the adoption of the new Constitution was scheduled for 10 May 2008, with 
multiparty democratic elections scheduled by the Government for 2010. The people of Myanmar 
have not been called to vote since 1990. 
</p>
<p>11. Copies of the 457-article draft Constitution were officially made public on 9 April and 
were reportedly on sale in bookshops at the price of 1,000 kyat ($1) a copy, a price that was 
reportedly unaffordable for a significant proportion of the population. The short time frame </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>between the official announcement of the referendum and 10 May, the date of its holding, raised 
deep concerns locally and internationally with regard to the readiness, preparedness, organization 
and carrying out of the referendum process. It was widely noted that the schedule fell far short 
of ensuring a far-reaching publicity campaign, inclusive of information dissemination, 
public-awareness programmes and free debate to enable members of the electorate to make an 
informed decision when casting their votes. 
</p>
<p>12. The atmosphere for a credible, widely acceptable referendum has been, regrettably, 
sombre. The calls from world leaders, including the Secretary-General, to the Myanmar 
authorities to make the constitution-making process inclusive, participatory and transparent and 
to engage without delay in a time-bound dialogue with others, including the General Secretary of 
NLD, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, were not properly heeded by the Government. The Government 
relied on a narrow sovereignty interpretation and used this as grounds not to accept the 
recommendation of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari, 
to invite international observers for the referendum. By inviting international observers, the 
referendum process would have been transparent, and the observers could have assisted in 
ensuring a free and fair process. The path for the referendum was further challenged by cyclone 
Nargis, which struck Myanmar on 2 and 3 May. 
</p>
<p>13. Despite the cyclone, the Government decided to proceed with the referendum, as had 
been announced by the commission responsible for organizing the referendum, in its 
statement 8/2008, according to which the referendum would be held, as scheduled, on 10 May, in 
all states and divisions, except in 40 towns in Yangon Division and 7 towns in Irrawady 
Division, devastated by the cyclone, where the referendum would be held shortly after, 
on 24 May. Subsequently, on 8 May, the Secretary-General noted that it might be more prudent 
to focus instead on mobilizing all available resources and capacity for emergency response 
efforts. 
</p>
<p>14. The referendum was held on 10 May 2008. Aung Toe, head of the Commission for the 
referendum, announced that the draft Constitution had been overwhelmingly approved 
by 92.4 per cent of the 22 million eligible voters, pointing out that there had been a turnout of 
more than 99 per cent. In the remaining 47 towns, the referendum was held on 24 May. 
</p>
<p>15. The NLD publicly dismissed the national referendum on the draft Constitution stating that 
it had not been inclusive and that it was unclear. It also pointed out that the Government had 
failed to discuss the drafting of the new Constitution with the representatives elected in the 1990 
parliamentary elections, and that decree No. 5/96 reportedly prohibited criticism of the national 
convention and allowed critics to be sentenced to up to 20 years of prison. On 17 May, the NLD 
rejected the Government&#8217;s claim that more than 92 per cent of voters had approved the draft 
Constitution in the first round of the referendum. 
</p>
<p>16. On several occasions, the Government announced that the referendum and the 2010 
elections were two crucial steps on the road to democracy. Such announcements are particularly 
relevant in the context of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In article 20, it is stated 
that &#8220;everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association&#8221; and &#8220;no-one may 
be compelled to belong to an association&#8221;. In article 21, it is stated that &#8220;everyone has the right to 
take part in the Government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives&#8221;, 
&#8220;everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country&#8221;, and that &#8220;the will of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>people shall be the basis of the authority of Government; this will shall be expressed in periodic 
and genuine elections, which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret 
vote or by equivalent free voting procedures&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. If properly carried out, this path would lead to the formation of an elected Government and 
create an excellent opportunity to establish the basis for economic, social and political reforms, 
address the country&#8217;s pressing humanitarian and human rights needs, find effective precautionary 
measures for the rapidly deteriorating health and education situation and find avenues for true 
dialogue with opposition leaders. 
</p>
<p>18. The lack of participation in the drafting process, its transparency, the challenges regarding 
public knowledge about its contents, the implications of the draft Constitution for the people of 
Myanmar before making an informed decision, and the conditions under which the referendum 
was held all raise significant concerns from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>19. The draft Constitution is said to have provisions that could compromise the enjoyment of 
the human rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This aspect will be 
developed in future reports of the Special Rapporteur. To that end, the Special Rapporteur hopes 
to receive in the near future, an official English-language translation of the draft. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Right to freedom of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly  
and association, and the role of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>20. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed under international law by a 
number of human rights instruments, notably under article 19 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. This universal right is particularly relevant to the democratization process. 
</p>
<p>21. After the announcement of the finalization of the draft Constitution, the Government 
intensified its campaign in support of the referendum and to ensure the acceptance of the 
Constitution by the people of Myanmar. A widespread media campaign encouraging citizens to 
vote in favour of the draft Constitution, as well as public rallies and activities, were reportedly 
held throughout the country. Public political debate, activism and organization are fundamental 
values encouraged by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in its articles 2, 18, 19, 20 
and 21. These provisions should provide space for all voices to be heard, including those that 
might be different, with varying perspectives enriching the pluralism of a vibrant democracy. 
</p>
<p>22. The provision included in the Referendum Law for the Approval of the Draft Constitution 
of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar No. 1/2008 and the existing provisions in the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council Law No. 5/96 threatened any opposition to the referendum. 
According to the Referendum Law, people who publicly stand against the referendum face fines 
and prison sentences. The Law has curtailed the peoples&#8217; right to express their views, the essence 
of modern democracy. Despite these provisions, reports were received that posters had been 
hung on walls and anti-referendum rallies held. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur received a number of allegations regarding the arrest, detention 
and bringing of charges against individuals who had expressed views against the referendum and 
the draft Constitution. Reports were received of acts of protest and anti-referendum rallies in 
several parts of the country, in particular in Yangon and Mandalay. On 4 March, in Yangon, a </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>number of demonstrators wearing T-shirts bearing anti-referendum slogans gathered near NLD 
headquarters; reportedly, seven activists participating in the rally were arrested. Several instances 
of harassment of NLD members (Myint Soe and Aung Ko Ko) were also reported after the NLD 
launched a &#8220;Vote No&#8221; campaign. A number of activists were also reportedly arrested in Sittwe 
following a peaceful demonstration against the referendum on 19 April. 
</p>
<p>24. According to the reports brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, the respect for 
voter anonymity at polling stations and during the collection of advance votes had not been 
respected. There were also accounts of pro-Constitution posters being displayed at polling 
stations and polling station administrators putting pressure on voters to vote in favour of the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>25. A solid and independent civil society is a good measure of democracy in a country. 
Human rights organizations should be part of a vibrant civil society. States members of the 
United Nations recognized the importance of human rights defenders when, in 1999, the 
General Assembly adopted by consensus the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (resolution 53/144). Human rights defenders are 
fundamental partners in democratization, and the Declaration provides a framework for their 
action, defining their rights and responsibilities and giving guidance on how their role should be 
supported and protected. The presence of human rights defenders and the possibility of 
conducting their work without hindrance and with full liberty are indicators of democratization. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Political prisoners and the path to democracy 
</b></p>
<p>26. Over the years, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council have 
denounced the situation of political prisoners in Myanmar. This situation is particularly relevant 
at a time when the country is supposed to be paving the way towards a democratic society. 
</p>
<p>27. Regrettably, the reported number of political prisoners and detention conditions continue to 
be appalling. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, as at 20 May 2008, 1,900 persons were 
in prison, allegedly on political grounds. 
</p>
<p>28. The situation of the General Secretary of the NLD, Aung Saan Suu Kyi, and in particular 
her house arrest, are issues of particular concern in this regard. According to Opinion No. 2/2007 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Government argued that Aung Saan Suu Kyi 
had been arrested because, in 2003, during her political activism in numerous towns, she had 
committed acts against peace and order of local communities, had made speeches against the 
Government and had campaigned with the intention of weakening the integrity of Myanmar and 
the solidarity of ethnic communities. On these grounds, the Government applied article 10 (<i>b</i>) of 
State Protection Law 1975, which established that a person who is a &#8220;threat to the sovereignty 
and security of the State and the peace of the people may be detained for up to five years, but no 
more than one year at a time&#8221;. On 25 May 2007, the Government extended Aung Saan Suu Kyi&#8217;s 
arrest for another year, reaching the limit of five years provided for by the Law. According to 
reliable information, in May 2008, the Government of Myanmar exceeded the limit by again 
extending Aung Saan Suu Kyi&#8217;s arrest with no new evidence or allegations against her. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>29. The situation of Aung Saan Suu Kyi is an issue of critical concern for the 
Special Rapporteur, since it compromises the fundamental human rights recognized by the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Articles 9, 10 and 11, which grant a number of rights to 
arrested persons, and articles 19, 20 and 21, which protect the principle of political rights, are all 
seriously affected in the case of Aung Saan Suu Kyi. In addition, given her responsibility as 
NLD General Secretary, her arrest affects the political rights of many other members of the NLD 
and of the people of Myanmar. 
</p>
<p><b>III. DEVELOPMENTS WITH REGARD TO THE EVENTS  
OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 2007 
</b></p>
<p>30. In its resolutions S-5/31 and 6/33, the Council called on the Government of Myanmar to 
investigate and bring to justice perpetrators of human rights violations with regard to the 
peaceful demonstrators of September 2007, and to release, without delay, those arrested and 
detained as a result of the demonstrations and to ensure that the conditions of detention met 
international standards and included the possibility of visiting any detainee. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur would like to provide more recent information brought to his 
attention in relation to the situation covered in the previous report (A/HRC/7/24).  
</p>
<p><b>A. Arrests, detentions, trials and releases in connection  
with the demonstrations of September 2007 
</b></p>
<p>32. In the previous report (A/HRC/7/24), the Special Rapporteur noted that 718 individuals 
had been arrested between August 2007 and February 2008 and that they were reportedly still 
detained at the time of finalization of the report. That figure included the 93 individuals 
confirmed by the Government to be in detention during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to 
Myanmar in November 2007. The Special Rapporteur has relied on information from various 
sources and it is incumbent on the Government to provide confirmation in order for the 
Special Rapporteur to present an accurate account. The Special Rapporteur has 
received information relating to individuals reportedly arrested and/or in detention in 
connection with the crackdown on the demonstrations of September 2007. These arrests 
contravene articles 9, 10, 11, 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>33. Regarding the situation of some members of the 88 Generation Students group, the Special 
Rapporteur has received information confirming that Khin Moe Ay, Aung Gyi (also known as 
Moe Aung Soe), Myat Hsan, Zaw Min, Htun Htun Win and Win Maw are all still detained in 
Insein prison. Kyaw Soe, Myo Yan Naung Thein and Win Maw are also still detained in Insein 
prison and have reportedly been charged under section 5 (<i>g</i>) of the penal code. Mon Min Soe 
(also known as Min Min Soe), included in the report as self-identified political activist, has also 
reportedly been identified as a member of the 88 Generation Student group and is reportedly still 
in Insein prison.  
</p>
<p>34. Regarding the situation of self-identified political activists, the Special Rapporteur is 
pleased to report that, according to information received, Myint Naing, Dr. Aung Moe Nyo and 
Htet Htet Aung have been released; however, Ye Thein (alias Ko Bo Naung) is reportedly still 
detained in Sittwe prison, Arakan State. U Khin Hla was reportedly transferred from Thandwe 
prison, Arakan State, on 8 February 2008, to Buthidaung prison, Arakan State, and charged </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>under sections 294, 506 and 427 of the Penal Code and has been sentenced to four years of 
imprisonment. Htay Myint, is reportedly still detained in Thayet prison, while Nay Myo Kyaw is 
still held in Insein prison. Kyaw Zin Win, who remains in Insein prison, has been allegedly 
charged under sections 6, 32 (<i>b</i>) and 13/1 of the Penal Code.  
</p>
<p>35. U Thet Wia, Sanchaung township NLD Chairman, who had allegedly been arrested in 
September 2007 for being in possession of information on forced labour and children in armed 
conflict and subsequently released on bail in January 2008, is still reported as released on bail.  
</p>
<p>36. Regarding the situation of Thet Zin, editor-in-chief of <i>Myanmar Nation </i>(<i>Myo Myanmar</i>) 
and Sein Win, both reportedly arrested for being in possession of the report of the previous 
Special Rapporteur, Thet Zin is still in detention in Insein prison and has been charged under 
section 17/20 of the Printing Act. With regard to the detained artists mentioned in the report of 
the Special Rapporteur, according to reliable sources they are still detained in Insein prison. 
</p>
<p>37. Human rights defender Aung Zaw Oo is still reportedly detained in Insein prison and is 
said to have been charged under section 5 (<i>g</i>) of the Penal Code. U Tin Hla, a member of the 
Federation of Trade Unions - Burma, on 11 January 2008, was reportedly charged under 
section 19 (<i>a</i>) of the Penal Code and sentenced to seven years imprisonment and is in Insein 
prison. On 7 November 2007, Thet Oo was reportedly charged under section 505 (<i>b</i>) of the Penal 
Code and sentenced to two years imprisonment in Taungoo prison, where he is now. Zaw Tun 
was reportedly charged on 7 November 2007 under section 505 (<i>b</i>) of the Penal Code; he is in 
Prome prison. On 18 October 2007, Shwe Pain was reportedly charged under section 505 (<i>b</i>) of 
the Penal Code and sentenced to two years of imprisonment; he is in Katha prison, 
Sagaing Division. Ya Zar and Zaw Kyi are both still detained in Kale prison. Shwe Thwe is still 
detained in Kale prison and has been sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment. 
Aung Naing Soe is still detained in Thandwe prison; the order for his solitary confinement was 
lifted on 13 December 2007.  
</p>
<p>38. In the previous report (A/HRC/7/24), information was provided concerning the arrest of 
two students. According to recent information received, Ye Myat Hein, a 17-year-old student, 
who had reportedly been charged but has never been brought before the courts, was finally 
brought to Bahan town court on 2 January 2008 and reportedly charged under sections 505 (<i>b</i>), 
143, 144, 145, 295 and 295 (<i>a</i>) of the Penal Code. He remains detained in Insein prison and has 
been allowed to communicate with his lawyer. Regarding the other student, Sithu Maung (alias 
Ya Pyeit), according to information received, he is also detained in Insein prison and has been 
charged under sections 505 (<i>b</i>), 143, 144, 145, 295 and 295 (<i>a</i>) of the Penal Code. He was taken 
to Bahan town court together with Ye Myat Hein and has been allowed to contact his lawyer 
also.  
</p>
<p>39. In relation to the reported detained monks, U Kaw Vida is still reportedly detained in 
Insein annex prison and has been charged under sections 134, 135 and 505 (<i>b</i>) of the Penal Code. 
U Gambira reportedly continues to be detained under the same charges. Another eight monks - 
U Pyinnyar Thila, U Nara Pati, U Vilathetka, U Sanda Vanna, U Eindriya, U Khaymar Vantha, 
U Zathi La and U Zar Nayya - have also reportedly been brought before the court together with 
U Kaw Vida. The Special Rapporteur was informed that a nun, Daw Thi La Nandi (also known </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>as Aye Aye), is still detained in Insein prison. She has reportedly been charged under section 295 
of the Penal Code after she allegedly appeared before Okkapala town court on 27 February 2008 
with seven other nuns.  
</p>
<p>40. In his next report to the Council, the Special Rapporteur would like to provide an analysis 
on the compatibility of the provision in the current Penal Code and its procedural frameworks 
with human rights standards. In this context, the Special Rapporteur will propose to the 
Government of Myanmar, in the course of a future visit, the possibility of setting up a national 
experts&#8217; conference that could enlighten him on the country&#8217;s procedures and serve as an open 
and ongoing forum for dialogue on these matters.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Conditions of detention: right to health and treatment 
</b></p>
<p>41. Information was received with regard to the health situation of Paw U Tun (alias 
Min Ko Naing), a member of the 88 Generation Students group active in the demonstrations 
against the sharp rise in fuel prices in August 2007; Paw U Tun has reportedly been suffering 
from a severe eye infection while in detention. He requested to visit an ophthalmologist, but the 
prison authorities allegedly refused this request, claiming that an eye doctor would not be 
available before May 2008. According to reports, Paw U Tun&#8217;s eye condition and acute pain 
prevented him from eating and sleeping. 
</p>
<p>42. Information has also been received with regard to the situation of one of the NLD members 
mentioned in the report. Aye Cho is reportedly suffering from hypertension and a heart problem 
and requires assistance.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Access to prisoners by international organizations 
</b></p>
<p>43. The reports received indicate that the detention conditions of detainees at Insein prison in 
Yangon remain appalling. Family members and relatives continue to report that they face many 
obstacles, including lengthy procedures, before they can visit detainees in prison. While some of 
the prisoners have had access to legal counsel during the reported trials, reports on the situation 
of most of the detainees can still only be obtained through contacts with prisoners&#8217; families.  
</p>
<p>44. According to the most recent information, there have been no visible developments in the 
access by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to the detainees in accordance 
with its mandate. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize his call to the 
authorities to re-engage with ICRC and provide free access to detention centres. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Investigations on the 31 reported killings and depuration  
of responsibilities for excessive use of force  
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur, as mandated by the Council, would like to continue to follow up 
on the steps taken by his predecessor in engaging in fruitful discussions with the relevant 
authorities with a view to clarifying the reported tragic deaths of at least 31 individuals during 
and/or as a result of the crackdown on the peaceful protests in September 2007. The excessive 
use of force contravenes article 29 (2) and (3) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. At the time of finalization of the present report, the Special Rapporteur had not received 
any further information from the relevant authorities on the status of the investigations on the 
deaths of the mentioned individuals and the investigations with regard to responsibility in the 
light of article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and its commentary. 
</p>
<p>47. A number of individuals continued to be reported as missing since the crackdown on the 
protests. While noting the difficulties in assessing the whereabouts of these individuals in view 
of the present circumstances, the Special Rapporteur would like to express his concern and hopes 
that the Government will put a mechanism in place in order to discover the whereabouts of these 
individuals. 
</p>
<p>48. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to focus in his dialogue with the 
Government on the importance of access to official information and the outcome of 
investigations; this will allow him to follow the process of identification and clarification of 
cases reported to him. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  THE IMPACT OF CYCLONE NARGIS 
</b></p>
<p>49. Tropical cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar on 2 and 3 May 2008, causing devastation in 
Ayeyarwady Division and directly hitting the country&#8217;s largest city, Yangon. A total of 40 towns 
in Yangon Division and 7 townships in Ayeyarwady Division are still on the Government&#8217;s list 
of disaster areas. As at 16 May, the official death toll had risen to more than 77,000. According 
to Government media, nearly 56,000 people remain missing, with the official number of injured 
being approximately 19,400.  
</p>
<p>50. Assessment teams in the country have reported major damage in affected areas, 
particularly in the low-lying Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) delta region, where the impact of the 
cyclone was compounded by a storm surge. At the moment of finalization of the present report, 
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that, of the 2.4 million 
cyclone-affected people, an estimated 1.4 million are located in severely affected areas of 
Ayeyarwady Division, including Bogale, Labutta, Ngaputaw, Dedaye, Pyapon, Kyaiklat, and 
Mawlamyinegyun. In addition, the Office estimates that 680,000 individuals reside in severely 
affected areas of Yangon Division.  
</p>
<p>51. In its resolutions, the Council has traditionally called on the Government to cooperate fully 
with humanitarian organizations, including by ensuring full, safe and unhindered access of 
humanitarian assistance to all persons in need in the country. Regrettably, and in view of the 
devastating effects of the cyclone, the recommendations made by the Council in October and 
December 2007 respectively continue to be of great relevance to the promotion and protection of 
the human rights of the people of Myanmar.  
</p>
<p><b>Promotion and protection of human rights in humanitarian crises as a result of 
natural disasters  
</b></p>
<p>52. In natural disasters, the timing of emergency assistance and the delivery of aid can 
determine life or death. This has been confirmed in a number of situations over recent years in 
almost all regions of the world. All too often, the human rights of disaster victims have not been 
sufficiently taken into account. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>53. In the situations created by natural disasters, the rights of the victims, in particular of 
children, women and the elderly and other vulnerable groups, to receive assistance and 
protection and to have their basic needs addressed should be the priority of the concerned 
Government, with its ultimate responsibility to protect the rights of its people. The victims of 
complex emergencies and natural disasters are not only those who are directly affected by the 
natural disaster, but may also include many others whose lives have been indirectly disrupted by 
the impact of these events and who are in need of help. Regrettably, the most recent natural 
disasters are of such great magnitude that international assistance is crucial for effective and 
timely action. However, the consequences of these disasters can take long to remedy.  
</p>
<p>54. The question of equal access to humanitarian aid, gender-based violence, enforced 
relocation, increased fear of recruitment of children into armed conflict or fighting forces in the 
areas where this phenomenon exists, involuntary resettlement, as well as issues relating to lost 
documentation and property, are human rights issues that have been often identified in situations 
of natural disasters and need to be addressed as part of the humanitarian process: immediate 
relief, and short-term and long-term recovery.  
</p>
<p>55. Concerns regarding the situation of children separated from their parents, increases in 
forced labour, the conditions of temporary shelter facilities and their management, the right to 
food and drinking water, the protection of the right to health and ultimately the right to life and 
the blockage of access to the affected areas have been expressed since the immediate aftermath 
of cyclone Nargis.  
</p>
<p>56. In a humanitarian crisis as a result of natural disasters, the risk of human rights violations 
is therefore demonstrably high, in particular in relation to the violation of economic, social and 
cultural rights and discrimination with respect to aid. While there are violations that can occur as 
a direct result of policies and actions, many others are the result of oversight. For this reason, the 
Special Rapporteur is of the view that, in order to avoid such violations, it is important that both 
the national authorities responsible and all national actors respect the human rights of all victims 
and others, and establish the necessary monitoring mechanisms in the early stage of 
humanitarian aid delivery and in recovery planning.  
</p>
<p>57. According to information brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, on 2 May, at 
around midnight, when cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar, many zinc roofs of the prison Insein in 
Yangon were torn off. Owing to the destruction in one area of the prison, some 1,000 prisoners 
were reportedly forced to congregate inside the main prison hall, which was then locked. 
Prisoners reportedly panicked, creating chaos inside the hall. In order to control the situation, it 
is reported that soldiers and riot police were called in and opened fire on the prisoners in that 
area. A number of prisoners were allegedly killed during the operation. The authorities should 
conduct a thorough and transparent investigation to clarify the facts and identify the perpetrators 
of these arbitrary killings. 
</p>
<p>58. The human rights principles of non-discrimination and accountability are essential in this 
process. The primary bearer of responsibility for providing assistance and protection is the 
Government of the affected country, which has the obligation to do everything in its power to 
prevent and limit the negative impact of natural disasters, such as those resulting from cyclone </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Nargis, which left so many dead and homeless. Assisting victims and recovering from such 
natural disasters may require the support of the international community to supplement the 
efforts of the authorities of the affected country.  
</p>
<p>59. The principles of equality and non-discrimination are contained in numerous human rights 
instruments to which Myanmar is a State party, such as the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
These principles are the key to ensuring a human rights-based response to natural disaster 
situations. Another key principle is the involvement of the affected communities in the decisions 
that will have an impact in their lives. The right to have access to free and impartial information 
and the right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by human rights law, should also be 
respected and provided. 
</p>
<p>60. In this context, the Special Rapporteur calls on all actors to pay special attention to the 
situation of women, children, and in particular the situation of orphans or children separated 
from their parents, internally displaced persons, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, 
persons living with HIV/AIDS and minority ethnic groups. It is essential that a full 
protection-coordination mechanism be established in the country, in close coordination with the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>61. To promote and facilitate a rights-based approach to disaster relief, the Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee adopted its Operational Guidelines on Human Rights and Natural Disasters 
in June 2006. The Special Rapporteur very much hopes that the Government of Myanmar and 
the international, regional and national organizations involved in the provision of assistance to 
address the needs created by the cyclone pay special attention to these Guidelines. While the 
Operational Guidelines are mainly addressed to intergovernmental and non-governmental 
humanitarian actors, they are certainly a very useful tool to guide the Government&#8217;s efforts to 
assist in getting the lives of its people back to normal. 
</p>
<p><b>V. METHODOLOGY, ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMME OF WORK  
OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR:  PRELIMINARY OVERVIEW  
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that, as his primary task, he would like to 
cooperate with and assist the Government of Myanmar in its efforts in the promotion and 
protection of human rights. The Special Rapporteur will highlight any shortcomings with a 
positive approach, in order to assist the authorities to remedy them.  
</p>
<p>63. Taking into consideration the major human rights issues set out above, the Special 
Rapporteur, within his mandate, will also identify particular topics that deserve special attention 
and present a programme of work in his next report to the Council. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that, in order to report on the progress made by 
Myanmar in the implementation of Council resolutions and to adequately monitor developments 
in the overall human rights situation of the people of Myanmar, in-depth research, including 
discussions with the experts in the country, is essential. In addition to receiving information from 
human rights organizations and international academic experts, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to engage with the experts in the country itself in order to advance the promotion and 
protection of human rights in the country. An outline for each thematic study will be prepared </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>after a preliminary examination of the subject based on existing documentation. The study will 
then be developed using a variety of inputs and sources, including material and reports prepared 
by government agencies, civil society organizations, the United Nations country team and 
academic institutions.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur expects the Government to accept his requests to visit the country 
regularly. Since time and resources are limited, such visits will have to be prepared carefully to 
maximize results. The Special Rapporteur also considers it important to continue engaging 
countries in the region as well in the discussions regarding progress made on the implementation 
of resolutions. In view of the important role of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, he 
will also carry out visits to neighbouring countries.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur welcomes full cooperation from the States members of the Human 
Rights Council in discharging his mandate. This includes the good offices of countries 
neighbouring Myanmar and other States in ensuring meaningful dialogue and cooperation 
between the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and the Government of Myanmar to achieve 
progress in the promotion and protection of human rights, especially at this crucial time, when 
the Government has set up its 7-step road map to democracy.  
</p>
<p>67. With the assistance of OHCHR and other institutions, the Special Rapporteur hopes to 
develop a computerized database of allegations of human rights violations that he receives. The 
database would help to continue strengthening the accuracy of the information received.  
</p>
<p>68. Effective coordination is a priority in the United Nations. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur envisages close cooperation with, among others, the Special Adviser to the 
Secretary-General on Myanmar, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Children and Armed Conflict, the International Labour Organization coordination mechanism on 
forced labour and other special procedures and mechanisms for oversight, and in the 
implementation of the international human rights instruments to which Myanmar is a State party, 
such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS  
</b></p>
<p>69. According to the information received since 26 March 2008, the situation of human rights 
in Myanmar reported by the previous Special Rapporteur has not changed for the better. It is a 
great concern of the present Special Rapporteur that almost no improvement has been made and 
that critical issues still have to be addressed.  
</p>
<p>70. Further development of the present report will need close cooperation with the 
Government of Myanmar, in order to improve the enjoyment of human rights of the people of 
Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>71. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur regrets that, owing to time constraints and the 
schedule of the Council, he must submit the present report without having a chance to explore 
thoroughly with the Government of Myanmar areas of cooperation and exchange of information.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Myanmar:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Immediate release of the General Secretary of the NLD, Aung Saan Suu Kyi, as 
an initial step in the reconciliation process, to be followed by the release of all other 
political prisoners; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Set-up an effective mechanism to establish the whereabouts of those who 
reportedly disappeared during and after the crackdown on the peaceful demonstrations in 
September 2007, and provide information on the progress of its work;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Guarantee the physical integrity of all political prisoners, and in particular 
access to medical treatment of those in need;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Prepare a public report on how the referendum was conducted and the lessons

democracy;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Continue to uphold the agreements made with the Secretary-General to allow 
international humanitarian workers and supplies unhindered access to the country and 
particularly to the areas affected by cyclone Nargis, and cooperate with the international 
community in monitoring questions of access and in assessing the need for effectiveness of 
the aid being supplied; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Extend full cooperation to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, accepting his 
requests for visits.
