</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the reports of the Secretary-General on the status of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child,<b>1</b> on the follow-up to the special session of the General Assembly on 
children<b>2</b> of 15 August 2007 and on the girl child<b>3</b> of 24 August 2007, as well as the Declaration

independent global advocate to promote the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence 
against children in all regions, in accordance with its resolution 62/141,   
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> in this regard the contribution of the International Criminal Court as a way to 
prevent violations of human rights and humanitarian law, in particular when children are victims 
of serious crimes, including the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and 
to bring perpetrators of such crimes to justice, and not to grant amnesties for these crimes and to 
strengthen international cooperation towards the goals of ending impunity,

</p>
<p> <i>Profoundly concerned</i> that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains 
critical and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> that regional instruments can strengthen but not weaken the norms of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of the family as a basic unit of society and that as such should 
be strengthened; that it is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support; that the 
primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children rests with the 
family; that all institutions of society should respect children&#8217;s rights and secure their well-being 
and render appropriate assistance to parents, families, legal guardians and other caregivers so 
that children can grow and develop in a safe and stable environment and in an atmosphere of 
happiness, love and understanding, bearing in mind that, in different cultural, social and political 
systems, various forms of family exist,

which are often irreversible for their physical and emotional integrity,

concerned at the great number of reservations to the Convention, urges States parties to withdraw

issues and independent ombudspersons for children, and to ensure adequate and systematic 
training in the rights of the child for professional groups working with and for children;   
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> States to strengthen their national statistical capacities, particularly in the 
area of juvenile justice and on children in detention, and, as far as possible, to use statistics 
disaggregated by, inter alia, age, sex and other relevant factors that may lead to disparities, and 
other statistical indicators at the national, subregional, regional and international levels to 
develop and assess social policies and programmes so that economic and social resources are 
used efficiently and effectively for the full realization of the rights of the child;

</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Affirms</i> its commitment to effectively integrate the rights of the child in its work and

specific needs of boys and girls;  
</p>
<p> 7.   <i>Decides</i> to incorporate into its programme of work sufficient time, at a minimum an

best practices that can be adopted by States and other stakeholders, and to assess the effective 
integration of the rights of the child in its work, beginning in 2009;  
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Urges</i> all stakeholders to take into full account the rights of the child in the universal

national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, migrant children, refugee children, internally 
displaced children and children of indigenous origin among the victims of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, stresses the need to incorporate special 
measures, in accordance with the principle of the best interests of the child and respect for his or 
her views, and the child&#8217;s gender-specific needs, in education programmes and programmes to 
combat these practices, and calls upon States to provide special support and ensure equal access 
to services for those children;  
</p>
<p><b>Freedom from violence

against children, including cruel, inhuman or degrading forms of discipline, harmful traditional 
practices and all forms of sexual violence;  
</p>

they do not pose a risk of harm to children;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary General to take urgent action on General Assembly

to pay particular attention to cases of international abduction of children by one of their parents 
or other relatives;  
</p>
<p> 18.  <i>Further calls upon</i> States to guarantee, to the extent consistent with the obligations 
of each State, the right of a child whose parents reside in different States to maintain, on a 
regular basis, save in exceptional circumstances, personal relations and direct contact with both 
parents by providing enforceable means of access and visitation in both States and by respecting 
the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development 
of their children;   
</p>
<p> 19.  <i>Reaffirms</i> the findings of the General Assembly in paragraph 16 of its 
resolution 62/141 and the importance of promoting appropriate parental care and family 
preservation where possible, and encourages States to adopt and enforce laws and improve the 
implementation of policies and programmes to protect children growing up without parents or 
caregivers; where alternative care is necessary, decision-making should be in the best interests of 
the child, in full consultation with the child and his/her legal guardians, and in this context, 
encourages the advancement of the draft United Nations guidelines for the appropriate use and 
conditions of alternative care for children; further attention should be given to these guidelines 
by the Council at its eighth session; </p>
