<b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a country-
by-country basis, summaries of reliable and credible allegations of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were brought to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur, and were transmitted to the Governments 
concerned. It also contains replies from Governments. This addendum does not 
illustrate the state of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment throughout the world, but rather reflects the state of information brought 
to the attention of the Special Rapporteur. 
 
2. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in transmitting these 
allegations to Governments, he does not make any judgement concerning the merits 
of the cases, nor does he support the opinion and activities of the persons on behalf of 
whom he intervenes. The prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment is a non-derogable right, and every human being is legally 
and morally entitled to protection. When the Special Rapporteur receives reliable and 
credible information that gives grounds to fear that a person may be at risk of torture 
or other forms of ill-treatment, he may transmit an urgent appeal to the Government 
concerned. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have a humanitarian 
and preventive purpose, and do not require the exhaustion of domestic remedies. 
Governments are requested to clarify the substance of the allegations, take steps to 
protect the person&#8217;s rights, and are urged to investigate the allegations and prosecute 
and impose appropriate sanctions on any persons guilty of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
 
3. During the period under review, i.e. from 16 December 2006 to 14 December 
2007, the Special Rapporteur sent 79 letters&#8727; of allegations of torture to 51 
Governments and 187 urgent appeals* to 59 Governments on behalf of persons who 
might be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment. Government responses 
received up to 31 December 2007 have been included. The responses received after 
that date will be duly reflected in a future communications report. 
 
4. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the timely responses received from 
Governments to the letters and urgent appeals transmitted. He regrets that many 
Governments fail to respond, or do so selectively, and that responses to older cases 
remain outstanding in large part. 
 
5. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has 
been obliged to reduce considerably details of communications sent and received, 
with attention given to information relating specifically to allegations of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. As a result, requests from 
Governments to publish their replies in their totality could not be acceded to. 
Moreover, attention is given to information in Government replies specifically 
relating to the allegations, particularly information on the following: 
</p>

statistical information on communications sent by special procedures in 2007 is available on OHCHR 
website : http://www.ohchr.org.

<p><b>Sanad Ali Yislam al-Kazimi</b>, a 37-year-old 
Yemeni national, detained at the U.S. Naval Base 
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In early January 2003, 
he was arrested in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 
where he was held for eight months and 16 days. 
On or about 16 to 18 August 2003, he was 
transferred to the custody of United States forces 
and taken to Kabul, Afghanistan. He was held in 
the &#8220;Prison of Darkness&#8221; (also known as the Dark 
Prison) for nine months. He stated that the worst 
treatment he has experienced since his capture 
occurred in this prison.  He suffered severe 
physical and psychological torture by Jordanian 
interrogators, who were supervised by U.S. 
personnel. It is reported that the torture was so 
extreme, going beyond the methods described 
above, that it prompted Mr. Al-Kazimi to attempt 
suicide three times by striking his head against 
the cell wall. As a result he sustained large visible 
scars on his scalp. Among other things, he was 
suspended with his arms above his head and 
beaten with electrical cables. On or about 16 May 
2004, he was transferred to Bagram, where he 
was held in U.S. custody for four months, and 
where he was tortured in a manner similar to that 
in the Prison of Darkness. On or about 18 
September 2004, he was transferred to 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he is currently 
detained. Mr. Al-Kazimi continues to suffer 
psychological trauma, inability/unwillingness to 
discuss details of treatment/torture, has attempted 
suicide, fears reprisals and continued abuse, and

Saudi national, detained at the U.S. Naval Base in 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was apprehended 
between October and December 2001 by 
Pakistani tribesmen who turned him over to the 
Pakistani military.  He was interrogated by 
Pakistani military, transferred to U.S. military 
custody shortly thereafter in Kohat, Pakistan, and 
then transferred to Kandahar, Afghanistan, where 
he was held for two months. In detention he 
reports that unidentified U.S. officials threatened 
him with firearms, strangled him with wires, and 
shocked him with electricity. In early 2002, he was 
transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he 
is currently detained. Mr. Al-Kazimi was not 
permitted to see a lawyer, relatives, or friends 
before his transfer to Guantanamo Bay.  He has 
not seen any member of his family since his arrest 
in early 2003. Mr. Al-Fawzan has not seen any 
member of his family since his departure for 
Afghanistan in October 2001.  His family only 
become aware of his imprisonment nearly two 
years after his capture and could only confirm it 
from photographs of Guantanamo Bay prisoners 
posted on the Internet.

<p>serious human rights abuses against the 
Congolese deportees, which have been 
committed by the Angolan security forces at the 
border between the Democratic Republic of 
Congo and Angola.  These abuses have been 
purportedly targeted toward groups of migrant 
workers mainly composed of Congolese citizens 
who are involved in informal diamond mining 
activities in Angola. The abuses reported include 
the systematic use of physical and sexual 
violence, confiscation of the migrant&#8217;s belongings 
and separation of family members during the 
expulsion process. Women were systematically 
raped by Angolan security forces, on many 
occasions in front of their children or in public. 
Women were continuously raped - while being 
expelled from their homes, in provisional detention 
facilities, at the checkpoints and during their 
transport to the border. In addition, the health 
situation of the expelled migrants is a major 
concern. As most of them have been involved in 
informal diamond mining, they and their families, 
including children, have been forced to submit to 
invasive bodily searches (including the anal and 
vaginal cavities) to uncover hidden diamonds. 
According to the reports, the searches are being 
conducted in such a manner that they are causing 
psychological and physical trauma to the 
deportees. The mental and physical health of 
female victims of sexual violence is of particular 
concern. It has been reported that they suffer from 
various pains in their vagina and lower stomach, 
and have been deeply traumatized by the abuse </p>

health care upon their arrival to the Democratic 
Republic of Congo. Furthermore, the migrants 
have been kept in incommunicado detention in 
harsh conditions before their deportations, 
subjected to beatings and other forms of ill-
treatment, and denied food and water provisions 
both during their detention and deportation to the

of arson and riot, pursuant to article 179 of the 
Penal Law, which states that &#8220;if one or more of the 
crowd starts to use violence in order to achieve 
the goal of their assembly, it is considered as a 
riot. He who participated in the riot and knew 
about it is punished with prison and is fined with

denied the accusations, but was not allowed by

and was prevented from defending himself. The 
Public Prosecutor decided to hold the accused in 
custody for 15 days. Mr. Ahmad has not had 
access to a lawyer at any stage of the 
investigation. After having been transferred back 
to the police station he was permitted to see 
family members, who discovered beating marks 
on his stomach and deep scratches on both arms. 
Mr. Ahmad&#8217;s right eye was reddened with a red 
clot of blood beneath it and he had no sight in this 
eye. He had not received any medical treatment

that took place in an area between the cities of 
Sanabis and Daih. The special forces dispersed

boots.  For two days he was treated at Bahrain 
Defence Force Hospital for a broken nose, injuries 
to his head, lacerations to his face, a dislocated

arrest of Ali Said al-Khabbaz are untrue and 
baseless. He was arrested for attending a 
peaceful demonstration. The right to express an 
opinion by peaceful means is guaranteed by the 
Constitution and by Bahraini law. No one has ever 
been arrested for exercising this right. Mr. Al-
Khabbaz was one of a group of around 40 
persons who took part in riots in the Sanabis area 
on 20 May 2007. They threw Molotov cocktails 
and stones at the security forces which had been 
sent to disperse the crowds, quell the rioting and 
protect the lives of citizens from these 
irresponsible acts of sabotage. The rioters set fire 
to rubbish skips on the main road, placing the 
residents of the area in danger. Mr. Al-Khabbaz 
was arrested in the Sanabis area while engaging 
in riotous behaviour and arson. There is no truth 
to the allegations that he was picked up in front of 
his home. His injuries were caused by a tumble 
that he took while fleeing from the security forces 
in order to evade arrest. He fell on his face, which 
caused him to have a nose bleed. Immediately 
afterwards, he assaulted and injured a policeman 
with a stone which he had in his hand. His

When his family requested to visit him on 22 May

independent judicial authority within the statutory 
48 hour time limit as prescribed by article 57 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedures.  He was then 
transferred to the military hospital for medical 
treatment. He was not detained in a police station. 
Officers at the station notified his family that he 
had been detained at the military hospital for 
having committed a crime. These procedures are 
consistent with international treaties. The Ministry 
of Interior did not receive any complaints from or

situated in the village of Kamarerabad. The 
military officers beat both men with goran sticks 
and fists and kicked them with boots at the time of

tied with ropes and taken to a temporary army 
camp situated at the Saline Water Fisheries

they were interrogated and ill-treated by army 
officers. Since their health conditions were

activities in the area. Based on the information 
extracted from the interrogation, another notorious 
criminal Mr. Waheduzzaman was apprehended.

both of them to the Paikgacha Upazila Health 
Complex, as they felt ill. They stayed at the health

at Kopilmoni on 17 January 2007. Both were 
brought to the joint forces camp. On the same day 
they were handed over to the local police station. 
As per the law of the country, police sent them to 
the local court under section 54 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code. After the hearing the learned

<p>and Mr. Wahed&#8217;s family, police officers agreed to 
take both men back to the hospital. It would have 
been impossible for them to move or stand in 
court due to their serious physical condition. As a 
result of ill-treatment Mr. Muzibur cannot move his 
right leg and Mr. Wahed has lost strength in the 
lower part of his body from his waist down. They 
have not received adequate medical treatment at 
the Paikgachha Upazila HLTH Complex. Family 
members hired a medical doctor at their own 
expense to treat the men. It is believed that 
military officials who arrested Mr. Muzibur and Mr. 
Wahed acted under the influence of police officers 
of the detective branch of Khulna acquainted with 
Mr. Muzibur&#8217;s business competitor. Mr. Muzibur

by military officers and subjected to threats and 
intimidation by officers of the detective branch and 
of the Paikgachha police following an earlier 
arrest on 2 November 2006.  Mr. Abdul Gafur and

During the interrogation, he fell ill at 9.45 p.m. and

Police immediately took him to the local health 
complex for treatment but the duty doctor of the 
health complex declared him dead. An unnatural

broken toe among other injuries. He was taken to 
a prison hospital and later to a general hospital in 
Satkhira district town.  On 28 January 2007, he 
was ordered to remain in detention for one month 
under the Special Powers Act, which provides for 
the detention of individuals who might commit 
prejudicial acts against the State. However, no 
official charges have been brought against him. 
Mr. Shahidul Islam has not had access to his

there as per existing procedures and 
subsequently hander over to Tala Police Station. 
The allegation of torture was thoroughly rejected. 
As some of Mr. Islam&#8217;s activities went against the 
interest of public safety, security and peaceful 
environment, the learned court of Satkhira ordered 
one month&#8217;s detention under the Special Powers 
Act 1974 since the date of his apprehension. The 
case is under investigation now and Mr. Islam has 
full access to seek legal recourse.

ground, beating people with electric batons and 
dispersing them using a water cannon, while 
some villagers defended themselves with 
machetes, bottles and barbed wire. This resulted

damage to property&quot; (Article 52). On 2 May 2007,

shelter. Many of the forcibly evicted families are 
now living in destitution along the roadside of 
National Road 4 under tarpaulins provided by 
NGOs. Reports indicate that this eviction order 
was issued without any judicial oversight and was 
not preceded or followed by any consultation with 
most of the families concerned. The reports 
received suggest that the forced evictions and 
house demolitions carried out were actions taken 
by the police and military police while executing a 
separate warrant issued by the Sihanoukville 
municipal court to search for illegal weapons. No 
such weapons were found.

</p>
<p>By letter dated 2 March 2007 the Government 
replied that the detainees' health is being

international legal obligations, as well as with 
international standards for the medical care of 
detained persons. The detainees are in no 
immediate risk. Moreover, both the basis of their

<p>detention under a security certificate since then. 
His certificate was upheld in October 2001 and he 
was denied bail in November 2003 and again in 
November 2005. Mahmoud Jaballah was arrested 
under a security certificate in August 2001, days 
before the hearing on his asylum claim. He had 
previously been detained under a security 
certificate for seven months in 1999 before a 
judge quashed the certificate. The second 
certificate was quashed by a judge as well, but, a 
third certificate having been issued, he was not 
released. Hassan Almrei was arrested under a 
security certificate in October 2001 and his 
certificate was upheld by a judge the same year. 
He has been refused bail twice. While de jure in 
immigration detention, the three men have spent 
most of the more than five (in the case of Mr. 
Mahjoub, more than six-and-a-half) years of their 
detention in a provincial (criminal) high-security 
prison, several of those years in solitary 
confinement. Mohammad Mahjoub, Mahmoud 
Jaballah and Hassan Almrei are now detained at 
the Kingston Immigration Holding Centre. The 
three men are currently on a liquids-only hunger 
strike. As of today (30 January 2007), Mohammad 
Mahjoub has been on hunger strike for 67 days, 
while Mahmoud Jaballah and Hassan Almrei have 
been on hunger strike for 56 days. They have 
been drinking only orange juice and occasionally 
clear broth. The authorities in charge of the 
Kingston Immigration Holding Centre are not 
medically monitoring their vital signs (i.e., blood 
pressure, cardiac and respiratory rate) and 
</p>
<p>detention and their conditions of detention are 
under active judicial scrutiny. The detainees are 
being housed at the Kingston Immigration Holding 
Centre (KIHC), which opened in 2006 specifcally 
for the purpose of housing persons who are 
subject to security certificates. Although it is within 
the confines of the federal penal institution of 
Millhaven Penitentiary at Bath, Ontario, the KIHC 
is a separate facility operated by the Canada 
Border Services Agency (CBSA), the 
governmental agency responsible for enforcing 
Canada's immigration laws. The KIHC allows 
individuals held under security certificates to be 
housed in isolation from the Millhaven general 
inmate population. Correctional Services Canada 
(CSC), the govemment department that is 
responsible for federal penitentiary administration, 
acts as a service provider to the CBSA. Pursuant 
to the Memorandum of Understanding between 
the two organizations for the operation of the 
KIHC, CBSA is responsible, with the support of 
CSC, for ensuring that all appropriate 
arrangements with medical and health care 
practitioners are in place to provide essential and 
emergency health care services. The CBSA 
provides funding for a nurse to respond to the 
needs of the KIHC detainees. Force feeding of a 
detainee who has the capacity to understand the 
consequences of fasting at the time he made the 
decision to fast is expressly not permitted. This is 
consistent with the principle that no medical or 
psychological care can be imposed without the 
detanee&#8217;s consent. Without providing specific </p>

<p>general health status of the three detainees. 
Moreover, Mohammad Mahjoub has not received 
treatment for his hepatitis C since September 
</p><p>2006. In addition, Mr. Mahjoub and Mr. Jaballah 
are particularly vulnerable to a variety of health 
difficulties because they were tortured in their 
country of origin. 
</p>
<p>personal information, Canada can inform the 
Working Group/Special Rapporteurs that this is 
not the first occasion that certain of these 
detainees have undertaken a hunger strike. In fact 
some of them have undertaken hunger strikes a 
number of times, at both the provincial facility 
where they were previously held, as well as at the 
KIHC. The Urgent Appeal refers to the detainees 
being on a &quot;liquids-only&quot; hunger strike, and as 
&quot;drinking only orange juice and occasionally clear 
broth&quot;. Canada can inform the Working 
Group/Special Rapporteurs that honey, soy milk, 
milk and a variety of juices are provided daily. The 
Urgent Appeal refers to information received that 
&quot;the authorities in charge of the Kingston 
Immigration Holding Centre are not medically 
monitoring the vital signs (i.e., blood pressure, 
cardiac and respiratory rate) and general health 
status of the detainees.&quot; Canada assures the 
Working Group/Special Rapporteurs that this 
information is incorrect. In fact, the detainees have 
medical and psychological care available should 
they choose to access it. A nurse visits the KIHC 
daily and is able to monitor the vital signs of the 
detainees if they consent; licensed physicians are 
also available to provide examinations and 
treatment. In the past, certain or all of the 
detainees have refused or obstructed 
psychological assessment and medical care. Only 
very recently did two of the detainees agree to a 
physical examination by a doctor. Health 
practitioners at the KIHC remain satisfied that all 
their detainees are in good condition and that

<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response

<p>there is no immediate threat to their health. 
Canada refers the Working Group/Special 
Rapporteurs to the 15 February 2007 Federal 
Court decision involving one of the detainees, Mr. 
Mahjoub, in which some of the conditions of 
detention, and medical care being provided, are 
described. Since the conditions of detention were 
only one of the factors considered by the Federal 
Court in its decision to release Mr. Mahjoub, it did 
not have to choose between the sometimes 
conflicting evidence on the subject. For this 
reason, Canada refers the Working Group/Special 
Rapporteurs to the following passages of the 
judgment for information purposes: paragraphs. 
36-39 [summary of affidavit of the manager of the 
KIHC respecting provision of health care, and Mr. 
Mahjoub's health records]; paras. 59-60 and 63-
66 [summary of Mr. Mahjoub's testimony 
concerning his health care]; paras. 76-82 
[summary of testimony of nurse in charge of 
health care at the KIHC]; paras. 100-102 [judge's 
consideration of conditions of detention]. The 
Urgent Appeal further refers to the fact that &quot;the 
indeterminate nature of confinement and the 
denial of access to an independent tribunal, 
prolonged over years, might lead to serious 
mental health problems and constitute ill-
treatment in violation of Article 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.&quot; With respect, Canada objects to the 
suggestion that the detainees' confinement is 
&quot;indeterminate&quot; and that they have been denied 
access to an independent tribunal. The cases of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 38 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>all three men related to their prospective removal 
from Canada are still before the courts; their 
detention has been reviewed by the Federal Court 
and maintained only because of their continuing, 
present danger to national security or to the safety 
of any person. With respect to the potential mental 
health problems that may arise out of their 
confinement, Canada reiterates that the detainees 
have psychological and medical care available, 
should they choose to access it. Canada is aware 
of the risks to the mental health of the detainees 
but considers that a certain amount of 
psychological stress is an inevitable consequence 
of the fact of detention. Nevertheless, it is 
committed to minimizing the potenfal impact of 
their confinement on the detainees. Some of the 
measures implemented in that regard include the 
availability of daily family visits and telephone use; 
spiritual and religious services; availability of 
special or religious diets on request; daily outdoor 
activity in the exercise yard; daily access to an 
indoor gym; shared library material; a common 
room where table games may be played; personal 
televisions; and medical care as described above. 
Therefore, the conditions of detention - including 
the access to medical care that is the subject of 
the Urgent Appeal - are presently before the 
Federal Court, which has indicated its availability 
to deal with the matter on an expedited and 
effective basis. Under an agreement with the 
Government of Canada, the Canadian Red Cross 
monitors the condition of people held in 
immigration detention in Canada, including at the 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>KIHC. The Canadian Red Cross is a neutral, 
independent body that provides independent 
monitoring of immigration detention facilities to 
promote humane treatment in accordance with 
national and international standards. Specially 
trained teams conduct visits of immigration 
detention facilities, which include private talks with 
detainees, individually or as a group, and a 
private, formal talk with the detaining authority. 
Any issues or concerns about the detention 
conditions are raised directly with the detaining 
authorities and are not publicly disclosed. The 
Canadian Red Cross has visited the KIHC three 
times - in June 2006, August 2006, and January 
</p><p>2007. Due to the confidentiality of its arrangement 
with the Red Cross, Canada cannot disclose 
further details of the visits. However, generally 
and as a matter of principle, any concerns that are 
raised are taken seriously-and are remedied to the 
furthest extent possible. Canada takes seriously 
the allegations made in the Urgent Appeal. It 
assures the Working Group/Special Rapporteurs 
that the detainees' health is being closely 
monitored and they are in no immediate risk. Any 
medical and psychological care 
that may be required is available to them but 
cannot be provided without their consent. Canada 
is in full compliance with its obligations to the 
detainees under international law and considers 
that the allegations made in the Urgent Appeal are 
unfounded. </p>

of the Government, there are consistent reports 
that a number of individuals involved in his trial 
have been targeted by the security forces 
including his wife, his lawyers, a member of his 
defence team and witnesses to his trial. On 27 
November 2006, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial 
before the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court lasted 
approximately 10 hours.  It is reported that on 1 
December 2006, he was sentenced to four years 
and three months&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;gathering 
crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional 
destruction of property&#8221;. According to reports, 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, <b>Yuan Weijing</b>, has 
been under <i>de facto</i> house arrest from 12 August 
2005 until 25 November 2006.  Since then, she 
had been continuously followed by local security 
personnel and persons in civilian clothes believed 
to have been hired by the police.  On 28 
November 2006, around midday, she was 
arrested by members of the Yinan County Public 
Security Bureau and detained for questioning.  
Their one-year-old child was also taken but was 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 14/02/07, the Government 
informed that on 10 June 2006, Chen was 
arrested, in accordance with the law, by the Yinan 
county public security bureau in Shandong 
province on suspicion of the offences of wilful age 
to property and assembling a mob to disrupt the 
flow of traffic and, on 21 June, he was taken into 
custody with the approval of the procuratorial 
authorities. On 19 August 2006, the Yinan county 
people&#8217;s court, meeting at first instance, found 
Chen guilty of the offence of causing wilful 
damage to property and sentenced him to seven 
months&#8217; fixed term imprisonment; it also found him 
guilty of the offence of gathering a mob to disrupt 
the flow of traffic and sentenced him to serve four 
years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment; the court decided 
that he should serve a combined sentence of four 
years and three months&#8217; fixed term imprisonment. 
Following his sentencing at first instance, Chen 
refused to accept the court&#8217;s verdict and lodged 
an appeal. The Linyi city people&#8217;s high court in 
Shandong province, meeting at second instance, 
found that the court of first instance had restricted 
Chen&#8217;s right to defence (the assigned defence 
counsel had not been accepted by Chen), a factor 
which might have adversely influenced the 
fairness of the proceedings, and, on 31 October 
2006, it quashed the original judgement and sent 
the case back to the court of first instance for 
retrial. The allegations in the letter that we have 
received that the case was sent back to the

<p>sent home later that day.  Approximately eight 
hours later, Yuan Weijing, was dragged out of 
police car and left in a barely conscious state on 
the side of the road near her village.  She was 
taken to Mengyin County Menglianggu Hospital 
where she was treated for extreme trauma 
however she was accompanied by up to 20 
policemen as an order of &#8220;residential surveillance&#8221; 
had been issued while she was in detention. She 
is also suspected of the offences of &#8220;gathering 
crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and for &#8220;intentional 
destruction of property&#8221;. Furthermore it is reported 
that the local authorities have intimidated 
witnesses and withheld evidence in order to 
prejudice Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial. Four other 
key witnesses have been subject to police 
harassment in relation to the most recent trial and 
were subjected to torture in order to provide false 
testimony against Mr. Chen Guangcheng in his 
previous trial.  According to reports, Mr. Chen 
Gengjiang was detained on 26 November 2006 
and held until after the hearing had taken place.  
He was forced to sign papers in which he agreed 
not to participate in the case.  On the same day, 
Mr. Chen Guangdong and Mr. Chen Guangyu 
disappeared after they had agreed to testify on 
behalf of the defence.  Later the same evening, 
Mr. Chen Guanghe was abducted by undercover 
police officers as he was on his way to meet with 
Mr. Li Fanping regarding the upcoming trial in 
which he was scheduled to testify the following 
day.  He was formally arrested on 28 November 
but his family was not informed of his arrest or his 
</p>
<p>original court because there had been insufficient 
evidence to convict Chen Guangcheng for the 
offence of gathering a mob to disrupt the flow of 
traffic are unfounded. On 27 November 2006, 
sitting at a reconstituted bench, the Yinan county 
people&#8217;s court reopened the case in open 
proceedings, Chen&#8217;s brother attended the court in 
the public gallery, and Chen&#8217;s defence was 
conducted by the lawyers Li Fangping from the 
Beijing Ruifeng law firm and Li Jinsong from the 
Beijing Yitong law firm. During the proceedings, 
Chen&#8217;s rights in litigation were fully upheld: he 
exercised his own rights to defence and the 
lawyers appointed by him also made submissions 
in his defence. On 1 December 2006 the court 
ruled at first instance and made public its verdict: 
for the offence of wilful damage to property, it 
sentenced Chen to seven months&#8217; fixed term 
imprisonment and, for the offence of gathering a 
mob to disrupt the flow of traffic, it sentenced him 
to four years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment, ruling that 
he should serve a combined term of four years 
and three months. After sentencing at first 
instance, Chen refused to accept the court&#8217;s 
verdict and once again lodged an appeal. The 
Linyi city intermediate people&#8217;s court, after hearing 
the case at second instance, ruled that Chen, as a 
means of giving vent to personal grievances, had 
caused and incited others to cause wilful damage 
to property, the amount of which was 
considerable, and that his conduct had infringed 
public and private ownership rights and 
constituted the offence of wilful damage to </p>

<p>whereabouts until 3 December 2006.  Previously, 
it is alleged that Mr. Chen Guanghe was detained 
and tortured before the first trial by members of 
the Yinan police in order to procure a false 
confession and to testify against Mr. Chen 
Guangcheng.  He was convicted on the basis of 
the false confession but granted a suspended 
sentence.  It is feared that his recent detention 
may be related to the fact that that he has 
submitted written testimony stating that his prior 
evidence had been coerced through torture. 
Members of Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s defence team 
have also been harassed, including his lawyers 
Mr. Li Jinsong,  Mr. Li Fangping and Dr. Teng 
Biao.  The two lawyers were apparently prevented 
from interviewing witnesses and obtaining further 
evidence for the retrial.  On 27 November 2006, 
as the trial was taking place, Dr Teng Biao was 
detained for five hours during which he was 
pushed to the ground by six or seven policemen 
who held him down while they searched him.  
They also apparently searched his bags and 
computer and confiscated his mobile phone.  
</p>
<p>property; it found further that Chen, with the aim of 
influencing and exerting pressure on the 
Government, had assembled a mob in order to 
block the flow of traffic, that the circumstances of 
his offence had been particularly serious, that he 
had been responsible for organizing the process 
of assembling a mob to block traffic, that he had 
directed the operation and had served as the 
ringleader and that his conduct had therefore 
constituted the offence of assembling a mob for 
the purpose of disrupting traffic. As the original 
court judgement had been based on clear facts, 
the conviction had been correct, the sentence had 
been commensurate with the offence and the trial 
proceedings had followed due process, the court 
dismissed the appeal and ruled that the original 
judgement should stand. This ruling was 
published on 12 January 2007. During the 
proceedings at second instance, the court also 
heard the views of Chen&#8217;s defence counsel and, in 
accordance with the applicable evidence, found 
that the facts set out in the accusation by the 
procuratorial authorities and the charges brought 
against the defendant were sound and accordingly 
handed down the judgement referred to above. In 
their conduct of the proceedings against Chen, the 
public security authorities fully upheld his rights in 
litigation and those of his family members, acted 
in strict compliance with the law and applied the 
law in a civilized manner. The proceedings in this 
case were all conducted in accordance with the 
law, the facts underlying the court&#8217;s judgement 
were clear, the evidence was ample and

<p>conclusive, the sentence was commensurate with 
the offence and the trial proceedings followed due 
process. With regard to the allegations in the letter 
which we have received to the effect that, on 30 
October 2005, Chen&#8217;s lawyers endeavoured to lay 
charges with the Yinan county court against public 
security officials from Shuanghou township for 
having caused intentional bodily harm to Chen, 
but that the court ignored this suit, it is our 
understanding that the Yinan county court did 
indeed receive an application from the lawyers to 
bring charges, but because the lawyers did not 
have Chen&#8217;s power of attorney, following an 
investigation the court determined that the lawyers 
were not authorized to act for the plaintiff and 
rejected the application. With regard to the 
allegations in the letter to the effect that Li Jinsong 
and Li Fangping filed an administrative and civil 
action with the Linyi city intermediate people&#8217;s 
court against the Linyi city public security bureau 
(including the bureau chief) and other government 
agencies, it is our understanding that the court did 
indeed receive such an application from the 
lawyers, in December 2006, which had been sent 
by expedited mail service, and that the matter is 
currently being investigated and no conclusion 
has been reached as yet. The allegations in the 
letter that public security officials have been 
harassing members of Chen&#8217;s family, his lawyers 
and other persons are entirely without substance.

May 2000. Further, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture visited Mr. Gyatso at Qushui Prison on 27 
November 2005 during his mission to China. Mr. 
Jigme Gyatso was sentenced to 15 years of 
imprisonment and five years of deprivation of 
political rights by the Lhasa Municipal 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court on 25 November 
1996 on charges of &#8220;planning to found an illegal 
organization and to seek to divide the country and 
to damage its unity&#8221;. During the meeting with the 
Special Rapporteur on torture, Mr. Gyatso 
explained that in May 2004 his sentence was 
extended by two years after shouting pro-Dalai 
Lama slogans at the Tibet Autonomous Region 
(TAR) Prison, upon which he was also kicked and 
beaten, and shocked with electric batons. Since 
meeting with the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Gyatso 
has been ill-treated and held in solitary

Lhasa Intermediate People&#8217;s Court to 15 years&#8217; 
imprisonment and 5 years&#8217; deprivation of political 
rights for the crime of seeking to divide the State. 
He accepted the judgement and did not file an 
appeal. In March 2004, while serving his 
sentence, Jinmei Jiacuo became involved in 
activities aimed at inciting separation of the State, 
for which he was indicted by the procuratorial 
authorities. On 18 May 2004 the Lhasa 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court sentenced him to 3 
years&#8217; imprisonment for the crime of inciting 
separation of the State, to be added on to the 7 
years and 27 days remaining from his original 
sentence; he was thus ordered to serve a further 9 
years and 27 days, with the expiry of his sentence 
to fall on 30 March 2014. Jin accepted the 
judgement and did not file an appeal; he is 
currently serving his sentence in the Qushui

Mr. Gyatso during his meeting with the Special 
Rapporteur on torture, Mr. Gyatso&#8217;s prison term 
was actually extended by three years for &#8220;inciting

taken together, nor shall it be any shorter than the 
longest of the individual sentences. It was 
pursuant to this provision that the Lhasa 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court issued the above-
mentioned sentence in respect of Jinmei Jiacuo. 
After entering prison, Jinmei Jiacuo enjoyed the 
same rights and treatment as other criminals. 
From November 2005, before he met with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in 
November 2005, until the present he has

<p>sources, namely: annual estimates of executed 
prisoners by whom a high percentage of organs 
are donated, according to the statement in 2005 
of the Vice Minister of HLTH, Mr. Huang Jiefu; 
willing donor family members, who for cultural 
reasons, are often reluctant to donate their organs 
after death; and brain-dead donors. Moreover, the 
short waiting times that have been advertised for 
perfectly-matched organs would suggest the 
existence of a computerized matching system for 
transplants and a large bank of live prospective 
donors. It is alleged that the discrepancy between 
available organs and numbers from identifiable 
sources is explained by organs harvested from 
Falun Gong practitioners, and that the rise in 
transplants from 2000 coincides and correlates 
with the beginning of the persecution of these 
persons. The Special Rapporteurs note reports 
that on 15 November 2006, Vice-Minister Huang 
reiterated at a conference of surgeons in 
Guangzhou that most organs harvested come 
from executed prisoners. And notwithstanding the 
reported stringent criteria in place for donors, 
including for those sentenced to death, the 
Government informed in its response of 28 
November, that voluntary donations, and 
donations between relatives are the two other 
legitimate sources of transplant organs. According 
to the allegations, based on data from the China 
Medical Organ Transplant Association, between 
the years 2000 and 2005 there were 60,000 
transplantations performed, or approximately 
10,000 per year for six years. This period 
</p>
<p>transplants between the years 2000-2005 and the 
numbers from identifiable sources of organs, 
submits the following response. First, China&#8217;s 
annual health statistics are compiled on the basis 
of categories of health disorder and not in 
accordance with the various types of treatment 
provided. For that reason, to date no Chinese 
authority has compiled official statistics on organ 
transplants for the period 2000-2005 and the 
allegations in the communication that we have 
received that, between the years 2000 and 2005, 
60,000 transplantations were performed are 
drawn from erroneous data cited in a report 
compiled by two Canadians investigating 
allegations of organ harvesting of Falun Gong 
practitioners in China. The report claims: 
&#8220;Professor Bingyi Shi, vice-chair of the China 
Medical Organ Transplant Association, says there 
were about 90,000 [organ transplants] in total up 
until 2005, leaving about 60,000 in the six-year 
period 2000 to 2005 since the persecution of 
Falun Gong began.&#8221; It has been ascertained that, 
in January 2007, during an interview with the 
BBC, Professor Shi Bingyi expressly clarified that 
on no occasion had he made such a statement or 
given figures of this kind, and these allegations 
and the related figures are pure fabrication. Given 
the above situation, the so-called &#8220;discrepancy&#8221; 
referred to in the communication that we have 
received does not make sense. In addition, from 
the point of view of medical science, during a 
person&#8217;s lifetime that person may express the 
wish to donate one or more organs after his or her 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>coincides with the alleged rise in the persecution 
of Falun Gong practitioners. In 2005, it is reported 
that only 0.5% of total transplants were accounted 
for by donations by relatives; non-relative brain 
dead donors were around nine in 2006; and 
estimates&#8212;given that the Government does not 
make public statistics on executions&#8212;for 2005 
indicate 1770 executions were carried out, and 
3900 persons sentenced to death. It is alleged 
that the discrepancy between the number of 
transplants carried out and the number of 
available sources is made up from the harvesting 
of organs from Falun Gong practitioners. 
However, it is also reported that the true number 
of executions is estimated to be around 8,000 to 
10,000 per year, rather than the figure of 1770 
executions referred above. As the Special 
Rapporteur on torture recommended in his report 
on his visit to China, he reiterates that the 
Government (E/CN.4/2006/6/para. 82, 
recommendation q) should use the opportunity of 
the restoration of the power of review of all death 
sentences by the Supreme People&#8217;s Court to 
publish national statistics on the death penalty. A 
full explanation of the source of organ transplants 
would disprove the allegation of organ harvesting 
of Falun Gong practitioners, particularly if they 
could be traced to willing donors or executed 
prisoners. The request for an explanation for the 
discrepancy in the number of transplants between 
the years 2000 to 2005 and the numbers from 
identifiable sources of organs is reiterated.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>death, so it is not possible to estimate the number 
of organ donors on the basis of a one-to-one 
correlation with the number of organ transplants. 
Second, as a State member of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), in carrying out organ 
transplants China unswervingly respects the WHO 
Guiding Principles on Human Organ 
Transplantation of 1991, strictly prohibits the 
buying and selling of human organs and insists on 
the principle that donations of human organs may 
only be made on a purely voluntary basis, with the 
prior written agreement of the organ donor. On 1 
July 2006, the Chinese Government promulgated 
its interim provisions on the clinical application 
and management of human organ transplantation, 
reaffirming that human organs may not be bought 
or sold; that medical establishments may only use 
transplanted human organs with the written 
agreement of the donors; that donors have the 
right at any time prior to transplantation to refuse 
donation of their organs; that medical 
establishments conducting human organ 
transplantation must be properly equipped to be 
able to ensure the quality and safety of medical 
treatment; and that ethical principles must be 
respected. The aim of these provisions is to 
standardize and strengthen the clinical application 
and management of human organ transplantation, 
and to ensure the quality and safety of medical 
treatment. In China, it is categorically prohibited to 
coerce persons sentenced to death into donating 
their bodies or organs or for their bodies or organs 
to be resold for profit. The organs and bodies of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 50 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>people sentenced to death may only be used in 
strict compliance with the relevant regulations. 
Primary among these are the following: (a) they 
may only be used with the prior written agreement 
of the prisoners themselves and of their family 
members; (b) they may only be used with the 
approval of the health authorities at the provincial 
level and of the provincial high court; and (c) units 
using such organs or bodies must secure the 
approval of the health authorities at the provincial 
and higher level and must be properly equipped to 
conduct the applicable medical research or to 
carry out the relevant transplantation surgery. 
Although China has strict prohibitory regulations in 
place relating to organ transplants, it is still hard to 
put a stop to certain unlawful practices. As soon 
as the relevant administrative bodies discover and 
verify that such unlawful activities are being 
conducted, the necessary action is taken to 
punish them in accordance with the law. Currently, 
regulations on the transplantation of human 
organs, as drafted by the Ministry of Health, have 
been issued and submitted to the State Council 
for its consideration and the State Council is 
soliciting the views of relevant Chinese and 
foreign experts and of WHO on the content of the 
draft text. It is our belief that the formulation of 
these regulations will help set in place a more 
standardized system for the management of 
human organ transplantation. Third, in order to 
ensure optimal use of the limited sources of 
organs, by drawing on current international 
practice, the relevant departments are currently

<p>giving close attention to the formulation of laws 
and regulations governing transplantation of 
human organs, exploring the creation of a human 
organ transplantation allocation system and 
applying the same organ allocation principles as 
WHO, the United States of America, the European 
Union and other bodies. It must be noted that the 
allegation in the report by the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur that China has &#8220;a 
computerized matching system for transplants&#8221; is 
inaccurate. To date, there is no institution in China 
responsible for coordinating and allocating organs 
and no network system in this area, nor does it 
have a live organ donor base and is not likely to 
establish such a donor base in the foreseeable 
future. Currently, the sourcing of organs and 
surgical operations involving organs are the 
responsibility of medical institutions. Fourth, the 
Chinese Government wishes to draw the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s attention to the following fact: the 
situation and the figures alleged in the 
communication that we have received are merely 
the product of agitation by Falun Gong; 
furthermore, most of them have already been 
revealed to be unfounded rumours.

Ablikim Abdureyim was sentenced to nine years&#8217;

case, the courts, in accordance with the law, 
safeguarded Ablikim Abdureyim&#8217;s lawful rights. 
Ablikim Abdureyim did not appoint defence

<p>March, Lin Zhiyong&#8217;s parents and younger brother 
came to labour re-education facility No. 3 in 
Guangzhou city to visit him and, on the afternoon 
of that same day, went to Chaitou labour re-
education facility to visit Liang Wenjian. The 
allegation in the communication that we have 
received that &#8220;their families have not been notified 
of their orders of detention and have not been 
allowed to visit them&#8221;, and that they are being held 
in incommunicado detention and subjected to ill-
treatment, are unfounded. Liang Wenjian 
underwent a period of labour re-education from 
December 1999 to April 2001 in the Chaitou 
labour re-education facility. During that period, the 
labour re education authorities dealt with her, in 
accordance with the law, in a civilized manner and 
there were no instances of her being required to 
perform overtime work or excessive physical 
labour, or being subjected to corporal punishment. 
Furthermore, as she demonstrated that she had 
responded well to re-education, on 25 April 2001 
the labour re-education facility arranged for her to 
complete her term outside the facility. The legal 
basis for the labour re-education order served on 
the eight persons named above is provided by the 
Chinese State Council directive on labour re-
education and the Council&#8217;s proposed modalities 
for labour re-education approved by the Standing 
Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress. 
The eight persons in question were ordered, in 
accordance with the law, to serve terms of labour 
re education for disrupting social order and their 
&#8220;arrests and detention&#8221; are not, as alleged in the </p>

<p>communication which we have received, &#8220;solely 
connected with their legitimate exercise of the 
right to freedom of religion or belief&#8221;.According to 
the relevant regulations, if persons undergoing 
labour re-education do not accept the labour re-
education order served on them, they may, within 
a period of 60 days of the date of receipt of the 
written order, apply to the Guangzhou city 
people&#8217;s government or to the Guangdong 
provincial labour re-education management 
committee for administrative review of the order, 
or, within a period of three months of  the date of 
receipt of the written order, lodge an 
administrative appeal directly with the people&#8217;s 
court. As has been ascertained, Wu Jiangyan and 
Liang Wenjian separately submitted applications 
for administrative review, on 3 April and 6 April 
respectively. The labour re-education authorities 
duly referred their applications for administrative 
review to the relevant department, on 4 April and 
7 April respectively.

<p>Ms.<b> Mao Hengfeng</b> (subject of previously 
transmitted communications, e.g. 
A/HRC/4/33/Add.1, para. 32). Prior to her trial on 
16 April 2007, she was detained in a small cell in 
which the floor was covered with excrement with 
the smell preventing her from sleeping. Reports 
also claim that prison guards had covered the only 
window in the cell.  Ms Hengfeng&#8217;s current 
conditions of detention are unknown.

<p>By letter dated 15/08/07, the Government 
informed that on 16 April 2007 she was sentenced 
by the Yangpu district people&#8217;s court to two years 
and six months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment for the 
offence of causing malicious damage to property, 
to run from 30 May 2006 to 29 November 2008. 
She is currently serving her sentence in the 
Shanghai women&#8217;s prison. Upon being admitted to 
prison, Mao underwent a physical examination 
which showed that, apart from an inclination to 
high blood pressure, all other indications were 
within the normal range. Mao is currently sharing

<p>a cell with two other women prisoners, she has 
not been sent to the punishment cells nor has she 
been placed in solitary confinement. Her eating 
and sleeping arrangements are normal. With 
regard to the issue of appeal, to date Mao has not 
submitted any written application, nor has she 
applied to see her lawyer, so there is no case here 
of the prison not allowing her to lodge an appeal. 
The prison officers, acting in accordance with the 
law, treat the prisoners in a civilized manner. Mao 
enjoys her rights on the same footing as the other 
prisoners, including the right to health and the 
right to appeal. The allegation that Mao has been 
subjected to ill-treatment is not supported by the 
facts.

June 2007, several fellow prisoners were ordered 
by the prison guards to beat him. As a result of 
the beatings, one of his ribs broke and he suffered 
from severe pain in the chest area. He was denied 
medical treatment. That same day, he began a 
hunger strike to protest against the beatings and 
the lack of medical treatment. The beatings were 
aimed at punishing him for having requested to 
file an appeal with the provincial high court. Being 
blind from birth, Mr. Chen Guangcheng needs the 
assistance of a lawyer to draft an appeal, but is 
now unable to do so, since he is has not been 
allowed to meet with him for more than 30

<p>Ms.<b> Mao Hengfeng </b>(subject of previously

May 2007 at approximately 6 a.m., she was 
transferred from the police detention centre to 
prison. She was given inadequate clothing which 
left her virtually naked. When she protested this 
treatment, she was beaten by police officers and 
placed in solitary confinement upon her arrival at 
the prison. Ms. Mao Hengfeng embarked upon a 
hunger strike as a gesture of protest against her 
situation. She was subsequently subjected to 
forced feeding on three occasions by prison 
guards who tied her hands and forced a tube 
down her throat. She was placed under constant 
surveillance by inmates that had been assigned 
the task by prison guards. They were also ordered 
to harass and verbally abuse her.  Ms. Mao 
Hengfeng is currently in poor health, suffering 
from high blood pressure and arthritis. These 
conditions are further aggravated by her 
inadequate living conditions. She has neither 
been provided with a chair, nor a bed. She has no 
choice but to lie on the floor, often in cold and 
damp conditions. Ms. Mao Hengfeng was visited 
by her husband on 28 June 2007. At this time her 
husband reported her ill-treatment and requested 
that the prison officials grant her lawyers access 
to visit her in order to prepare for her upcoming

<p>approximately 7.30 a.m., Mr. Zheng Enchong 
went to the Shanghai Municipal Higher People&#8217;s 
Court with his wife to register to attend the trial of 
Mr. Zhou Zhenghyi, a property developer. On their 
arrival at the courthouse they were surrounded by 
six police officers. Mr. Zheng Enchong  was 
knocked to the ground, and they dragged him 
along the ground and beat him for almost an hour. 
Mr. Enchong sustained injuries to his left hand in 
the course of the assault which was witnessed by 
hundreds of residents in the vicinity. The police 
officers forced Mr. Zheng Enchong and his wife 
into a taxi and were driven to his sister-in-law&#8217;s 
house, where they were met by five police 
vehicles and more than 30 police officers who 
prevented them from leaving.

<p>Higher People&#8217;s Court &#8230;, in order to register to 
attend the trial of Mr. Zhou Zhengyi&#8221;, that he was 
dragged 200 metres along the ground by six 
police officers, and subjected to an assault which 
lasted for one hour and that he was then forced to 
leave, and that, on that same day, at 
approximately 9 a.m., &#8220;more than 50 displaced 
residents &#8230; presented themselves &#8230; in order to 
attend the trial of Mr. Zhou Zhengyi&#8221; but that 
&#8220;security guards and police officers prevented 
them from entering the building&#8221; are simply not 
true. Enquiries have shown that the second 
division of the Shanghai city people&#8217;s procurator&#8217;s 
office only filed charges against Zhou Zhengyi 
with the Shanghai people&#8217;s intermediate court on 
17 August 2007: thus it was not possible for 
anyone to have attended the trial at the Shanghai 
people&#8217;s high court on 24 July. The six persons 
named in the letter are not to be found among the 
judicial police of the Shanghai people&#8217;s high court. 
At about 9 a.m. on 24 July, dozens of people 
claiming to be forcibly relocated residents from 
&#8220;Dongbakuai&#8221; (&#8220;Lot East 8&#8221;) demanded to attend 
the trial of Zhou Zhengyi. But following a perusal 
of the schedule of court hearings, and 
confirmation and notification that the Shanghai 
people&#8217;s high court was not holding any hearings 
that day, the people that had gathered promptly 
withdrew, no one tried to gain entry to the court 
and the security guards and police did not need to 
take any preventive action. </p>

secrets and having then transmitted these secrets 
to persons or bodies outside the country. On 12

approved by the Garz&#234; prefecture people&#8217;s 
procuratorate and he is currently being held at the

established that, in their handling of this case, the 
public security authorities were not culpable of any 
acts of torture. After being placed under measures 
of restraint by the public security authorities, 
Andruk Lopoe did not submit any complaints to 
the relevant judicial bodies. His case is currently 
still at the preliminary investigation and pretrial 
inquiry stage, in accordance with the law, and has

disrupting the normal order of the Square. Acting 
pursuant to article 34 of the Regulations on Public

process, the Shanghai public security authorities 
never employed any kind of coercive measures in 
respect of anyone, nor did any instances of 
beating occur. Moreover, there is no Yangpu

that in July 2000, Bu was ordered to serve a term 
of one year&#8217;s labour re-education for using a 
heretical cult to disrupt law and order. On 13 June 
2006, Bu was ordered by the Beijing city labour 
re-education committee to serve a further two and 
a half years&#8217; labour re-education, to run from 19 
June 2006 to 18 November 2008, for using a 
heretical cult to disrupt law and order. Bu is 
currently serving this term in the Tuanhe labour 
re-education facility in Beijing. Inquiries have 
established that, while being held in the Tuanhe 
labour re-education facility, Bu has not been 
subjected to any ill-treatment. The accusations in 
the letter that we have received that he was 
beaten by the police in the labour re-education 
facility and subjected to sleep deprivation are 
without substance. The Chinese labour re 
education facility operates a strict management 
system, under which the ill treatment of inmates 
undergoing labour re-education is categorically 
prohibited, and any persons disobeying this rule 
shall be punished in accordance with the law.

procuratorial representatives, specializing in

<p>supervision of the conduct of law-enforcement 
activities by the police in the labour re-education 
facility. As to the question whether Bu lodged an 
appeal or whether an appeal was lodged on his 
behalf by a representative, Chinese laws and 
regulations stipulate that persons undergoing 
labour re-education may, within 60 days of receipt 
of the labour re-education order, submit an 
application for administrative review to the local 
government office that issued the order or, within 
three months of receipt of the labour re-education 
order, lodge an administrative appeal directly with 
the local people&#8217;s court. This right is explicitly 
stated in the labour re-education order that was 
issued to Bu. On 5 May, Bu presented a power of 
attorney to the people&#8217;s police in the labour re 
education facility, naming his wife as his legal 
representative in dealing with all matters relating 
to his application for administrative review. The 
Chinese Government wishes to draw the attention 
of the Special Rapporteur to the fact that Falun 
Gong is not a religion, nor is it a spiritual 
movement. It is an anti-scientific, anti human, anti-
social cult. Falun Gong poses a serious menace 
to Chinese society, leading great numbers of its 
duped followers to cause harm to themselves, and 
even to take their own lives. The Chinese 
Government conducts patient persuasive 
counselling and educational work among rank-
and-file Falun Gong practitioners, fully upholds all 
their rights and helps them return to their normal 
lives. A small number of Falun Gong practitioners 
receive punishments in accordance with the law, </p>

<p>but this is not because of their opinions or belief: it 
is because their activities have breached the law,

<p>53.      <b>Gao Zhisheng</b> (A/HRC/4/33/Add.1, para. 44).<b> </b>By letter dated 12/02/07, the Government 
informed that on 15 August 2006, he was placed 
under investigation by the Beijing public security 
authorities, in accordance with the law, on 
suspicion of the commission of a criminal offence, 
and, on 21 September, his arrest warrant was 
approved by the procurator&#8217;s office. Beijing 
people&#8217;s procurator&#8217;s office No. 1 laid charges 
against Gao for the offence of fomenting 
subversion of the authority of the State and 
initiated proceedings against him with Beijing 
people&#8217;s intermediate court No. 1. On 22 
December 2006, the Beijing city people&#8217;s 
intermediate court No. 1 ruled that Gao&#8217;s conduct 
constituted the offence of incitement to subversion 
of the authority of the State, but in view of his 
meritous conduct denouncing the offences of 
other culprits, decided, in accordance with the law, 
that his penalty should be rendered more lenient 
and to reduce it below the statutory level. Thus, he 
was sentenced to three years&#8217; fixed term 
imprisonment, to be suspended for five years, and 
stripped of his political rights for one year. After 
the court handed down its judgment at first 
instance, Gao declared himself willing to accept 
the verdict and did not lodge an appeal. The 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 69 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>judgment has since become enforceable. In the 
course of the proceedings against Gao on the 
charge of incitement to subversion of the authority 
of the State, the public security authorities fully 
upheld his rights in litigation and those of his 
family and conducted the proceedings in strict 
compliance with the law, applying the law in a 
civilized manner. Three days before proceedings 
opened in this case, the court of first instance, in 
accordance with the stipulation of the law, notified 
the procurator&#8217;s office and the defence counsel 
and published in advance the dates and venue of 
the trial. When the court rendered its judgment, 
Gao&#8217;s family were present in the public gallery. 
When serving papers on Gao, the court expressly 
informed him of his rights in litigation to appoint a 
lawyer to conduct his defence. Gao indicated that, 
as he was himself a lawyer, he did not need to 
assign a lawyer and he did not agree to his family 
appoint one for him. For that reason, the lawyers 
from the Mo Shaoping law firm, appointed by his 
brother, were unable to act in his defence. Under 
these circumstances, the court decided, in order 
to ensure Gao&#8217;s rights in litigation were fully 
upheld, that it should appoint two lawyers to 
defend him, and Gao agreed to this appointment. 
In the course of the trial, in addition to conducting 
his own defence, Gao also received full defence 
services from his defence lawyers. The allegations 
that the police harassed Gao&#8217;s family members 
and others are unfounded.

informed that on 20 January 2001, Mr. Zhang was </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 70 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>sentenced to 13 years&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment 
by the Fangshan district people&#8217;s court in Beijing 
for the offence of using a heretical sect to engage 
in criminal activities and stripped of his political 
rights for 3 years. He is currently serving his 
sentence in Jilin city penitentiary in Jilin province. 
In December 2005, when undergoing a health 
check-up in prison, Zhang was found to be 
suffering from tuberculosis, but he maintained his 
firm conviction that, as a Falun Gong practitioner, 
when he fell ill he should not take any medicine or 
receive any injections, and that, as he himself was 
a disciple of the &#8220;dafa&#8221; - the major law, the 
master&#8217;s &#8220;dharma body&#8221; would protect and save 
him, and for these reasons he refused medical 
treatment. In February 2006, the prison 
management found that his condition had taken a 
turn for the worse, and only after being repeatedly 
advised and encouraged did he agree to receive 
treatment. While in hospital, Zhang received 
meticulous medical treatment and nursing care; 
his condition has now clearly improved and in 
clinical terms, he has been cured of his illness. He 
has undergone two medical examinations by Jilin 
City Central Hospital and showed no symptoms of 
fever; his breathing was smooth; both lungs free 
of rales; his heart rate normal and heartbeat 
regular and without murmur; his blood routine, 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate and myocardial 
enzyme count all normal; and his ECG normal. 
The results of a frontal chest X-ray show a 
calcification focus in the right pulmonary field. 
Zhang&#8217;s family members enquired as to whether

</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>he could be released for medical treatment 
outside the facility; the prison authorities deemed 
that his case did not meet the conditions for 
seeking medical attention outside the facility but 
special dispensation was granted to his family to 
be able to visit him outside regular visiting hours, 
with a view to fostering stronger relations between 
him and his family. To summarize, Zhang has now 
fully recovered from his illness and has been 
discharged from hospital, his state of mind is 
stable. His family members make frequent visits, 
and have expressed their satisfaction with the 
work of the prison staff. There is no question here 
of Zhang being subjected to ill-treatment or of his 
family being refused permission to visit him.

Bulaq al-Dakrur Police Station, where several 
police officers slapped him and kicked him with a 
stick on his hands and legs. On 19 January 2006, 
the public prosecutor ordered his release on bail, 
but instead he was taken back to the same police 
station. In the early morning of 20 January 2006, 
several police officers beat him, tied him by his 
wrists and ankles, and raped him with a stick. One 
of the officers made a video of the rape, which 
was later circulated and put on the Internet. On 9 
January 2007, Mr. Al-Kabir was sentenced to 
three months in prison by a criminal court in Giza. 
He is now in a prison in Giza. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated, 27/02/07, the Government 
informed that the Department of Public 
Prosecutions was informed that someone had 
downloaded from the Internet a section of a video 
showing acts of torture by the police. The 
Department of Public Prosecutions investigated 
the matter. It found that after Mr. Imad 
Mohammed Ali, a suspect in a case, had been 
released on 19 January 2006, he had continued to 
be held in detention by the investigation unit at 
Bulaq Police Station up until the evening of 21 
January 2006. During that time, his hands and 
feet were bound, his undergarments were 
removed and he was left naked. A police officer 
beat him, sexually assaulted him and attempted to 
insert a stick into his anus. A police sergeant 
kicked him all over his body and filmed the 
assault, using a mobile telephone. On 27 
December 2006, the Department of Public 
Prosecutions issued a warrant for the committal 
for trial before the criminal court of both the police 
officer and the police sergeant, pursuant to </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 84 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>articles 178, 268, paragraph (1), and 282, 
paragraph (2), of the Criminal Code. The men 
were charged with unlawful detention, sexual 
assault, torture, and the making and possession of 
indecent video images. The prosecution evidence 
included statements from witnesses, the victim 
and a voice expert, the results of a forensic 
examination by the Department of Public 
Prosecutions of the video images and places in 
which the assaults had taken place, and police 
records and logbooks proving that the victim had 
been released but had continued to be held. In 
light of the foregoing, it should be noted that 
torture is a serious offence under Egyptian law 
and is not time-barred from prosecution. It is dealt 
with directly by the judicial authorities, i.e. the 
Department of Public Prosecutions, and action is 
taken to deal with it regardless of whether the 
victim is an accused or a convicted person or a 
prisoner in another case. Compensation is 
awarded according to the outcome of the criminal 
proceedings. Under Egyptian law, the criminal or 
civil courts can order compensation in respect of a 
proven criminal offence. This shows Egypt&#8217;s 
determination, as a matter of general policy, not to 
tolerate or facilitate torture, to punish anyone 
found guilty under Egyptian law of committing 
torture, and to ensure that persons who commit 
these offences do not evade punishment.

May 2005 he was transferred to Al-Minyal

according to initial police reports, Mr. Ashraf Sa&#8216;id 
Youssef had caused his own injuries by 
repeatedly banging his head against the wall of

however, that he was also bruised on his chest 
and arms. The public prosecutor announced that 
he had ordered the deceased&#8217;s body to be made 
available for a forensic examination to establish 
the cause of death. Two years later, the results of 
this examination, as well as of any other inquiry 
into the circumstances of his death, remain 
unknown. Mr. Muhammad Ahmed was arrested on 
29 April 2005 in connection with the bombings. He 
died in custody on the same day. An official of the 
Ministry of Interior is reported to have stated, 
without further details, that Mr. Muhammad 
Ahmed had health problems that may have 
caused or contributed to his death. Relatives of 
the deceased are reported to have told the media

Emergency Supreme State Security Court 
(ESSSC) sitting in Al-Islamiliya on charges arising 
from the bomb attacks committed in Taba and 
Nuweiba on the Sinai Peninsula in October 2004, 
which killed 34 people and injured more than 100. 
In September 2006, the ESSSC announced the 
death sentences against these men, while other 
defendants were sentenced to long prison terms. 
The death sentences were then submitted to the 
office of the Mufti. On 30 November 2006, the 
ESSSC announced that the Mufti had approved 
the death sentences and that it now confirmed 
them. There is no appeal against the sentences of 
the ESSSC, which can only be commuted by the 
President. Reports indicate that the men had their 
first contact with their lawyers when the trial 
began, months after their arrest, and were only 
able to communicate with their lawyers during 
court hearings. The majority of the defendants 
denied the charges against them and claimed that 
they had confessed under torture. Upon request 
of the defence lawyers, the court ordered medical 
examination of the defendants. The medical 
exams, which were carried out several months 
after the alleged torture, did not confirm the 
allegations of the accused. The cases of the men 
were submitted to the African Commission on

them admissible in May 2007. The African

and both Al-Badiya and Gozor Al-Kamar 
encampment resorts were blown up by car 
bombs. As a result of the three incidents, 34 
persons were killed and 157 were injured. 
Pursuant to the provisions of the emergency law 
of the country, and based upon the findings of the 
security investigations which were sufficient to 
indicate the involvement of Mohamed Gayez 
Sabah, Ossama Abdel Ghany al-Nakhlawy, and 
Mohamed Yunis Elayyan Abu Gareer and others 
in the aforementioned incidents, the three 
suspects and other suspects were arrested The 
three suspects together with the other suspects 
were referred to the Public Prosecution Office 
(PPO) for investigation. The PPO instigated the 
investigation. Suspect Mohamed Gayez Sabah 
was interrogated during four investigation 
sessions. Suspect Ossama Abdel Ghany al-

Mohamed Yunis Elayyan Abu Gareer was 
interrogated during 25 sessions. All the suspects 
confessed to the crimes they had committed. The 
three and others were referred to the court for 
committing the aforementioned crimes. 
Throughout all trial sessions, the court responded 
to all the requests of their defence. The court 
allowed the attorneys to visit them whenever a 
visit was requested. The court allowed the 
attorneys to obtain the certificates and affidavits 
they needed from different agencies, responded to

executions until it has decided the merits of the 
case. The Government&#8217;s delegation before the

advised ratification of the death sentences and 
that the President might ratify at any time.

<p>of the investigation and trial minutes, took heed of 
the statements of all the witnesses of the defence 
and responded to the request of the three 
suspects to refer them to the Forensic Medicine 
Authority. The court heard the pleadings of the 
suspects&#8217; defence throughout the 12 sessions. On 
30 November 2006, the court issued by 
consensus the death sentences on the three 
suspects after it received the opinion of the Mufti 
of Egypt who confirmed that the death penalty 
concurs with Islamic Shari&#8217;a. According to the 
provisions of the Egyptian law, courts should seek 
the opinion of the Mufti on the issuance of death 
sentences in order to confirm how far the death 
penalty concurs with Islamic Shari&#8217;a. The Mufti&#8217;s 
opinion in that regards is an advisory one. The 
court sentenced the lapse of claim on two persons 
who were dead, life imprisonment on one person, 
and 5 to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment on the other 
suspects. After the judgment was issued, the 
three convicts brought two grievances to the 
Judgments Ratification Office in which they 
repeated the same pleas that were previously 
presented to the court. The Counsellor (Judge in 
High Court appointed by the Supreme Judicial 
Council) who examined the judgment studied the 
grievances of the convicts and concluded in his 
memorandum that: the judgment satisfied all the 
legal elements according to Egyptian law; the 
judgment took into consideration evidence upon 
which the court established the validity of the 
claim against the accused persons through their 
statements, testimonies of witnesses, the police </p>

<p>investigations and the forensic medicine and 
criminal laboratory reports; the judgment 
encompassed the incident appropriately according 
to the affirmed facts, encompassed all the 
pleadings and pleas of the defence as contained 
in the two grievances of the convicts, and 
responded to them sufficiently without prejudice to 
the right of the defence; in its response on the 
&#8220;invalidity of the complementary referral order,&#8221; 
the judgment noted that the PPO is not allowed to 
investigate the same incident with the same 
accused person after the case is referred to the 
court, however, this restriction does not jeopardize 
the prosecution&#8217;s right to investigate another 
person accused of the same incident but who has 
not been referred to the court, which is what the 
Court of Cassation concluded in its judgment; and 
the protested judgment is concurrent with the law, 
and none of the convicts forwarded whatever may 
affect its validity. On the basis of the above, the 
examining Counsellor issued a memorandum 
supporting the conclusions reached in the 
judgment of the State Security Emergency Court, 
hence the President ratified this judgment. 
Therefore, there remains for the convicts to 
petition the President to use his constitutional 
competence of granting pardon. The Government 
informed that in the PPO&#8217;s investigation minutes 
the lawyers attended the investigation sessions 
with the suspects. The lawyers were allowed to 
present their pleadings and affirm their requests in 
the sessions. The PPO did not refuse any request 
from the lawyers to appear with their clients. It is

<p>worthy to note that the law applicable at the time 
of investigation did not stipulate that the PPO has 
to delegate a lawyer to attend the investigation 
process, but it was mandatory to delegate a 
lawyer if the case is referred to the court. 
However, during the past term of the People&#8217;s 
Assembly, Article 124 of the Criminal Procedure 
Law was amended within comprehensive 
amendment on procedures, controls and rules of 
preventive detention by virtue of the Law No. 
145/2006 which made the appearance of the 
lawyer with the defendant mandatory before the 
beginning of interrogation in felonies. The PPO 
has become obliged to delegate a lawyer for the 
suspect who does not have a lawyer. It is affirmed 
in the minutes of the court sessions that the court 
responded to all the requests of the lawyers to 
visit the accused whenever  a visit was requested

request to obtain photocopies of the investigation

Mohamed Abu Gareer visited him 16 times until

were subjected to torture, Article 42 of the 
Constitution provides that &#8220;Any citizen arrested, 
detained or whose freedom is restricted shall be 
treated in a manner concomitant with the 
preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral 
harm is to be inflicted upon him. He may not be </p>

<p>detained or imprisoned except in places defined 
by laws organizing prisons. If a confession is 
proved to have been made by a person under any 
of the aforementioned forms of duress or 
coercion, it shall be considered invalid and futile.&#8221; 
And Article 57 provides that &#8220;Any assault on 
individual freedom or on the inviolability of the 
private life of citizens and any other public rights 
and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and 
the law shall be considered a crime, whose 
criminal and civil lawsuit is not liable to 
prescription. The State shall grant a fair 
compensation to the victim of such an assault.&#8221; 
The Egyptian penal code criminalizes committing 
and ordering acts of torture in articles 126 and 
282; and criminalizes unjustified detainment and 
penalties exceeding those decided by articles 127 
and 280. In compliance with the constitutional 
provisions and with article 57 of the Constitution, 
criminal procedure law stipulates in its article 15 
that the aforementioned crimes may not lapse by 
prescription. Article 203 of the same law stipulates 
that the court shall not rely on any confession 
made by a person under any form of duress or 
coercion. The preceding is in full harmony with the 
African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights 
and the Convention against Torture, and is 
confirmed by the precedents and the legal 
sentences by the Egyptian judiciary. Furthermore 
pursuant to the judicial principles on the scope of 
criminal liability, the assessment of the value of 
confession as an evidence is subject to the 
principle of &#8220;judicial discretion&#8221;. Consequently, the 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 91 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>adoption of a confession is subject to the 
discretion of the judge. The judge decides whether 
he is convinced with the confession as a reliable 
evidence for conviction, or to disregard it if there is 
a legal justification. The judge&#8217;s competence to 
assess the value of a confession entails as well 
his competence to interpret it, define its 
significance and explore its motives. This principle 
applies whether the confession was judicial or 
non-judicial, whether it took place in the process 
of factual investigation, interrogation or even 
before a normal person. The judge does not rely 
on a confession if he is not convinced with it even 
in the case of the accused person insists on his 
confession. In such a case the judge may issue an 
acquittal and clarify in the causation why he did 
not take the confession into consideration. If it is 
proved that the confession was made under 
duress or coercion, it should be considered as 
invalid. But this does not prevent the court from 
taking other evidence to prove the accusation. In 
this respect, it is worthy to mention that the court 
judgment against the suspects took into 
consideration all the circumstances related to the 
facts according to the satisfaction of the court 
based upon the papers of the case, the 
investigations, the court sessions and the related 
hearings of witnesses and the written and verbal 
pleadings of the defence in order to clarify the 
facts, the elements of the crime and the provisions 
of the law applicable thereon. The courts 
considered, scrutinized and analyzed all the 
evidence of the crime including the related </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 92 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>medical and technical reports and the public 
prosecution investigations to reach the facts upon 
which its judgment was established. The court 
responded to all the pleas of the defence during 
the trial including the plea of the invalidity of the 
confessions because they were made under 
physical and moral duress. However, the court 
was satisfied that the confessions of the suspects 
and the other accused persons during the 
investigations were made by persons who have 
the will and the discernment and are fully aware of 
the charges against them. Moreover, it was found 
when the accused persons appeared for the first 
time before the public prosecutor that they were 
free from any injuries. The court was certain that 
the suspects were fully aware that the 
investigations were made by the PPO and that it 
had informed them with the charges against them; 
and the court was convinced that their 
confessions were valid. The PPO investigation 
scripts affirmed that the Prosecutor viewed the 
suspects and remarked that they were free from 
apparent injuries. The pleadings concerned with 
torture were forwarded to the court. The court 
responded to the lawyers&#8217; request to refer the 
suspects to forensic medicine as mentioned in the 
causes of the judgment. The court had no 
suspicions about the suspects&#8217; confessions before 
the PPO throughout the numerous investigation 
sessions. Moreover, the suspects brought 
complaints to the Judgments Confirmation Office. 
The documents indicate quite evidently that the 
right to litigation was not violated. The suspects

<p>had a fair and just trial before a legal national and 
competent court. The trial sessions were public 
and were attended by the lawyers who 
represented the respondents; and the trial was 
concluded in a reasonable period. Hence this 
negates the occurrence of any violation by the trial 
of article 14 of the ICCPR. For all the above 
reasons, the allegations that the rights of the three 
suspects were violated are incorrect and 
groundless.

between the militias of the Council of Somali 
Islamic Courts and the Transitional Federal 
Government of Somalia, supported by armed 
forces of Ethiopia, caused a large flow of refugees 
seeking to cross the border from Somalia into 
Kenya. On 2 January 2007, Kenyan authorities 
announced the closure of the border for security 
reasons. Since then, it is reported that the Kenyan 
security forces have been patrolling the border 
and have arrested a number of those seeking to 
cross it. Kenya has deported at least 84 of those 
arrested back to Somalia, from where they were 
taken to Ethiopia. In late March, the Ethiopian 
Government released five persons arrested and 
detained under these circumstances. On 10 April 
2007, the Government announced that 29 more of 
the transferred detainees would be released, 
however, so far none of the 29 persons have been 
freed. The persons named above were arrested 
between 30 December 2006 and February 2007 
as they tried to cross the border from Somalia into 
Kenya. They were detained in various locations in

against the Governments of Somalia and Ethiopia. 
The Government of Somalia, due to the lack of 
adequate and secure facilities or functional 
prisons, requested that the Government of 
Ethiopia hold these individuals and undertake 
investigations into their activities. However, the 
allegation that there are more than seventy others 
in addition to those named in the communication 
is false, as are the allegations that the detainees 
are held incommunicado, and that they might be

cooperating with the competent Ethiopian 
agencies in arranging the return of their nationals. 
It is also not true that they were not afforded the 
opportunity to challenge the legality of their 
detention. All detainees have appeared before the 
competent Court in accordance with the relevant 
national legal procedures consistent with 
international obligations of the country. Although 
security experts from the respective countries of 
origin of the detainees have been involved in 
questioning some of the suspects, this was done 
in the presence of Ethiopian personnel in order to 
ensure that no detainee was subjected to torture, 
inhumane or degrading treatment. The physical </p>

<p>76.  Georgia 05/10/07 AL TOR The Government intends to include into this action 
plan <b>draft guidelines for the use of &#8220;diplomatic 
assurances&#8221;</b> against torture in its anti-torture 
action plan.  The Special Rapporteur has stated 
(A/60/316) that &#8220;diplomatic assurances are 
unreliable and ineffective in the protection against 
torture and ill-treatment: such assurances are 
sought usually from States where the practice of 
torture is systematic; post-return monitoring 
mechanisms have proven to be no guarantee 
against torture; diplomatic assurances are not 
legally binding, therefore they carry no legal effect 
and no accountability if breached; and the person 
whom the assurances aim to protect has no 
recourse if the assurances are violated.&#8221; He has 
indicated &#8220;that States cannot resort to diplomatic 
assurances as a safeguard against torture and ill-
treatment where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that a person would be in danger of 
being subjected to torture or ill-treatment upon 
return&#8221; and called &#8220;on Governments to observe 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 6/12/07, the Government replied 
that it is fully committed to the implementation of 
the absolute prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, 
crystallized as a ius cogens norm of international 
law and as entrenched in the Constitution of 
Georgia. It considers the elaboration of the anti-
torture action plan by the inter-agency Council on 
the Coordination of the Measures Directed against 
Torture, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment an effective tool to fulfil these 
obligations. Whereas guidelines on diplomatic 
assurances where included in the initial version of 
the action plan in accordance with the respective 
recommendations of the Committee against 
Torture (CAT/C/GEO/CO/3, 25 July 2006, para. 
11), they were deleted after deliberation in the 
Council taking into account the opposition of non-
governmental organizations. As regards the 
suggestions of the OHCHR Office in Tbilisi in 
relation to the need for the anti-torture plan to 
cover all places of detention, improve healthcare </p>

<p>the principle of non-refoulement scrupulously and 
not expel any person to frontiers or territories 
where they might run the risk of human rights 
violations, regardless of whether they have 
officially been recognized as refugees.&#8221; (paras 51 
and 52). Further he stated (E/CN.4/2006/6, paras 
31-33) that &#8220;diplomatic assurances with regard to 
torture are nothing but attempts to circumvent the 
absolute prohibition of torture and refoulement, 
and that rather than elaborating a legal instrument 
on minimum standards for the use of diplomatic 
assurances, the Council of Europe should call on 
its member States to refrain from seeking and 
adopting such assurances with States with a 
proven record of torture.&#8221; In light of the above, the 
inclusion of guidelines on the use of diplomatic 
assurances in Georgia&#8217;s anti-torture action plan 
risks undermining the very aim of the action plan &#8211; 
guaranteeing that the absolute prohibition of 
torture is implemented.  
</p>
<p>for persons deprived of their liberty, strengthen 
non-custodial measures and include protective 
measures for vulnerable groups, the Government 
assured the Special Rapporteur that they are fully 
covered by the Action Plan.

The Public Defender (Ombudsman) of Georgia,

with rubber truncheons. He was present in the 
protest to document the police actions. The riot 
police also raided the offices of two television 
stations, Imedi TV and Kavkasia, taking them off 
the air. Imedi radio station and Internet website 
were also suspended. Demonstrators who 
gathered outside Imedi TV headquarters to 
protest its suspension were dispersed by the 
police with tear gas and physical attacks. Later in 
the evening of 7 November, the Government 
declared a state of emergency for 48 hours, 
suspending a number of fundamental rights. The 
state of emergency was later extended to 15 
days. In particular, all public demonstrations in the 
country were banned and only the state television 
was allowed to broadcast news. It is believed that 
around 500 protesters were injured, 100 of which 
remain hospitalized.

<p><b>Organization of secret transfers of terrorist

Sarajevo. The Government does not have further 
detailed information to conclude whether the 
allegations are accurate. It is correct that at the 
time two German liaison officers were deployed to </p>

<p><b>Nechle</b>, from Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
Incirlik, Turkey in January 2002. From there they 
were flown to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they 
continue to be detained without charges. Two 
German military officers, working at EUCOM, 
were assigned as liaison officers and tasked with 
obtaining and communicating information between 
the German and U.S. authorities. Furthermore, 
information regarding this case was displayed on 
sources accessible to the public such as the 
website of EUCOM. 
</p>
<p>U.S.-EUCOM. The German liaison detachment 
acts as a point of contact for the U.S. forces in 
Germany and is mainly responsible for the 
exchange of information between U.S.-EUCOM 
and the German territorial commands. From 21 
January 2002 onwards this detachment was 
augmented by an additional officer and senior 
NCO. These additional soldiers joined a 
multinational planning group which dealt with 
issues of support for the U.S. in preparing and 
implementing Operation Enduring Freedom and 
developed exercise scenarios for basic planning. 
None of the liaison officers were involved in 
planning or activities connected with the transfer 
and transport of the terror suspects. The case of 
the transfer of the &quot;Algerian Six&quot; has already been 
presented and commented on by the Special 
Rapporteur of the Council of Europe, Mr. Dick 
Marty. On 27 November 2006, the Association of 
Public Broadcasting Corporations of Germany 
(ARD) current affairs television programme Report 
Mainz broadcast a report about the transfer of six 
Algerian citizens from Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
Guantanamo via Turkey, and the alleged role of 
U.S.-EUCOM headquarters in Stuttgart-Vaihingen. 
Immediately prior to the broadcast of the report, 
S&#252;dwestrundfunk (SWR) 2 sent a press release to 
the Stuttgart Public Prosecution Office dated 23 
November together with photocopies of various 
documents intended as evidence of the 
responsibility of U.S.-ELCOM headquarters. The 
Stuttgart Public Prosecution office instituted an 
appraisal of the matter on 27 November 2006 on 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>the basis of the information provided by 
S&#252;dwestrundfunk, and forwarded this to the office 
of the Public Prosecutor General at the Federal 
Court of Justice, asking it to examine whether it 
should potentially take over the matter. This was 
done in view of the fact that the Public Prosecutor 
General at the Federal Court of Justice is the 
competent authority pursuant to section 142a of 
the Courts Constitution Act (CCA) for criminal 
prosecution with regard to the offences listed in 
section 120 (1) and (2) of that Act. Because this 
list is exhaustive, the Federal Public Prosecutor 
General can only take over criminal proceedings if 
there is suspicion of an offence that is listed in 
section 120 (1) and (2) of the Act. This is due to 
the fact that under the division of jurisdiction in the 
German Basic Law, criminal prosecution is 
fundamentally the remit of the L&#228;nder (constituent 
states of the Federation); section 120 (1) and (2) 
of the CCA more closely define the exceptional 
cases of federal jurisdiction referred to in Article 
96 paragraph 5 of the Basic Law. The importance 
of a case on its own cannot give rise to the 
Federal Public Prosecutor General having 
jurisdiction. In the present case, the Stuttgart 
Public Prosecution Office contacted the Federal 
Public Prosecutor General, because the facts, as 
they stood, might cover the offence of abduction 
pursuant to section 234a of the Criminal Code, 
and could therefore give rise to jurisdiction on the 
part of the Federal Public Prosecutor General 
(section 120 (2) first sentence no. 1, in conjunction 
with section 74a (1) no. 5 of the CCA). As a </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 108 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>mandatory requirement within the definition of this 
criminal offence, the victim must have been 
exposed to the danger of being persecuted for 
political reasons. Having regard to Article 16a (1) 
of the Basic Law, the Federal Public Prosecutor 
General takes the legal view that political grounds 
within the meaning of section 234a of the Criminal 
Code include racial, religious or philosophical 
grounds, and beyond these, association with a 
political party or group. The persecution must 
therefore involve one of these elements. A 
contravention of the rule of law alone, however, 
does not necessarily turn persecution into political 
persecution within the meaning of this penal 
provision. The Federal Public Prosecutor General 
therefore decided on 21 December 2006 to refrain 
from initiating investigation proceedings, because 
no sufficient factual indications were apparent for 
any of these criminal offences, which, according to 
the definitive statutory regulation, can give rise to 
the Federal Public Prosecutor General having 
jurisdiction to prosecute. In particular, the Federal 
Public Prosecutor General did not see sufficient 
indications for the criminal offence of abduction 
according to section 234a of the Criminal Code. 
This decision of the Federal Public Prosecutor 
General did not mean that the examination of the 
criminal information process has been concluded. 
Rather, it meant only that jurisdiction over the 
criminal persecution remains with the Stuttgart 
Public Prosecution Office which had the task of 
examining the facts of the case with respect to 
other criminal offences such as unlawful 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 109 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>deprivation of liberty (section 239 of the Criminal 
Code). The same criminal procedure instruments 
are available to it for this purpose as to the 
Federal Public Prosecutor General. The Stuttgart 
Public Prosecution Office has therefore 
undertaken a further examination of the 
allegations. With its order of 11 January 2007, it 
then also refrained from initiating investigation 
proceedings on suspicion of unlawful deprivation 
of liberty or other criminal offences (not within the 
remit of the Federal Public Prosecutor General), in 
accordance with section 152 (2) of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure. According to this order, there 
was no suspicion of criminal conduct by German 
citizens, in particular by German liaison officers 
working at the U.S.-EUCOM headquarters, which 
would have required the initiation of investigation 
proceedings. In this respect, it stated that there is 
merely information that liaison persons of the 
German armed forces work at U.S.-EUCOM 
headquarters in Stuttgart-Vaihingen and were also 
working there at the time of the action in question. 
However, there was no information linking these 
persons to participation in the transfer of the six 
Algerians to Guantanamo. The Public Prosecution 
Office also stated that it was not known which 
persons were involved in arranging the handover, 
in whatever manner, on the U.S. side, and it also 
was not known who was responsible for the action 
(particularly at the U.S.-EUCOM headquarters in 
Stuttgart). Furthermore - according to the order - 
members of the U.S. forces are not subject to 
German jurisdiction. Article VII 3 (a) (u) of the </p>

<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>Agreement Between the Parties to the North 
Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of Their 
Forces (NATO Status of Forces Agreement - 
SOFA) of 19 June 1951 establishes a primary 
right for the U.S. military authorities to exercise 
jurisdiction over a member of their force or of a 
civilian component in relation to offences arising 
out of any act done in the performance of official 
duty. According to the Public Prosecution Office, 
the act in the present case - provided that it 
involved criminal liability - would without doubt 
constitute such an act done in the performance of 
official duty. In conclusion, the Stuttgart Public 
Prosecution Office was not able to establish that 
anyone subject to German jurisdiction was in fact 
involved in any criminal offence under German 
law and therefore no further investigations were 
carried out. Moreover, it stated there has been no 
waiver by the U.S. authorities of their primary right 
to exercise jurisdiction over U.S. military 
personnel in EU-COM, nor is such a waiver 
expected. Since the group of prisoners was not 
transferred through Germany to Guantanamo, 
Cuba, the question of what safeguards are in 
place to ensure no such transfers occur, does not 
arise. Measures taken in the fight against 
terrorism, such as arrests of individuals, their 
transfer from the custody of one State to that of 
another, and the treatment afforded to detainees, 
must at any time be in conformity with the relevant 
rules of international law, including &#8211; where 
applicable - the rules of international humanitarian 
law and recognized human rights standards. The

four days. Arun Lal Das also recounted a specific 
incident on 7 January 2007, when the jail 
superintendent and jail constable attempted to 
sever his penis as punishment for refusing to pay 
them extortion money. Earlier, jail officials as well 
as the district administration had denied that Arun

witnessed burn marks on his body, and knife 
marks and cuts on his penis. The court ordered

died on 21 April as he was being taken to hospital 
allegedly following a beating while in police 
detention in the Tengarang district the day before. 
It has been alleged that he was brutally beaten 
and that this assault proved fatal. It is also the 
Government&#8217;s understanding that while he was 
remanded into police custody on 20 April, his 
family was informed of his arrest. Investigations 
are currently ongoing. The facts of the case are 
being elucidated by the pertinent authorities in

<p>dedicated effort. Mr. Uripno was questioned while 
in custody, then he was taken to hospital the 
same day where he died. An autopsy was ordered 
and it was as a result of the findings of this report 
that his parents sought the assistance of the 
Jakarta Legal Institute and thereafter went to the 
Jakarta Police to denounce the treatment and 
subsequent death of their son. In connection to 
this case, Indonesia is also aware that his family 
later sent a letter of complaint to the Komnas Ham 
(Indonesia&#8217;s National Human Rights Commission) 
detailing their concerns. The latter commenced 
investigations, however, as this also requires a bit 
of time to verify the facts and reliably identify the 
perpetrators, their conclusions cannot be publicly 
transmitted until then. In connection to the 
response of the local authorities, the Internal 
Affairs department of the Tangerang Police has 
also been conducting their independent 
investigation into this matter. This unit originally 
questioned 19 police officers working in the 
Serpong district who were at the time suspected 
of being implicated in this unfortunate death of a 
detainee. Nine police officers have since been 
officially named as suspects in the case and have 
been duly arrested. Of the nine police officers, two 
were name key suspects in April. The other seven 
are still being investigated for complicity in the 
acts of violence perpetuated against the victim, 
while he was in their custody. However a chain of 
causality must be clearly established before any 
final conclusions can be presented. Furthermore 
the judiciary and its branches must be allowed the </p>

<p>time and space to effectively carry out their 
functions and come to a concrete solution of the 
issue before them without interference from the 
Executive, as clearly stipulated in the 1945 
Constitution. The Government reiterates, as it has 
done on many other similar occasions, its 
opposition to the use of torture, whether as a 
means of coercion or punishment. As well as 
being a signatory to CAT, Indonesia has also 
provisions in its laws that clearly state that 
freedom from torture is a non-derogable right. 
Indeed, this is evident in the provisions of Law No. 
39 of 1999 on Human Rights, in particular article 
4, as well as articles 9 and 39 of Law No. 26 of 
2000 on the Human Rights Court. The latter 
guarantees any violations of this right will be 
brought to justice. Moreover, Indonesia continues 
to do its best to assure the dissemination of 
information on the implementation and application 
of CAT and other such provisions within the 
national security services in order that incidents 
and tragedies such as those concerning Mr. 
Urpino do not occur. It is the Government&#8217;s belief 
that its local government authority will do 
everything within its prescribed authority to verify 
the facts of the case and determine the 
perpetrators and how they should be prosecuted 
before the law and whether it will be disciplinary, 
administrative or penal measures that will be 
undertaken. The provisions of national law 
however preclude the interference of the 
Government from matters that have been 
constitutionally set to be handled by the judiciary.

<p>Furthermore, any considerations for compensation 
depend entirely on the findings of the courts and 
subsequent rulings thereof. Until the ruling of the 
court establishes the chain of events and 
causality, the right punishment for the perpetrators 
and the possibility of compensation cannot be 
anything more than an expectation. The 
Government further wishes to clarify again that the 
judiciary can only allow for the stipulation of 
compensation when the facts of the case 
determine such would be warranted and not 
before. However, this decision again lives 
exclusively within the powers of the judiciary 
which excludes any interference by the executive.

<p>city of Kermanshah for the rape of three boys 
when he was 13 years of age. On 19 July 2007, 
the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence. 
The execution occurred despite the retraction on 
the part of the witnesses during the trial of their 
evidence, despite reports that Mouloudzadah&#8217;s 
confessions were coerced, and despite the fact 
that the Head of the Judiciary had ordered that the

existence of the hooligan network of Mr. 
Moloudzadeh being involved in ravishment, 
raping, blackmail, assault and battery and knife-
stabbing. Repeated commitment of crimes after 
the age of 18, are ascertained by the court of 
justice and the allegation of his minority, or under 
age at the time of committing crimes is 
categorically unfounded and denied. The 
Provincial Court, comprised of five judges, 
unanimously found him guilty through Verdict No. 
35 of 7 June 2007, and sentenced him to 
punishment in accordance with the law. Therefore, 
the allegation of issuing a verdict on the basis of 
the judge&#8217;s personal knowledge is baseless and 
rejected. The State Supreme Court, pursuant to 
exhausting of examinations and domestic 
remedies confirmed the verdict No. 423 of 1 
August 2007. In the course of investigations the 
accused enjoyed the services of two lawyers. 
None of the Judiciary Branches and Appeal had

Moloudzadeh (21 years of age was ascertained); 
and the verdict was carried out upon the approval. </p>

terrorism related crimes.  Until the end of May, 
none of them have been allowed to receive visits 
from their lawyers or families. In the absence of 
any incriminating evidence against them the 
competent judge would have been willing to issue 
a decision for their release on 24 April 2007.  
However, the judge declined to do so for fear of 
reprisals and ordered their transfer to the Serious 
Crimes Unit &#8211; Eastern Canal.  It is alleged that the 
investigating officer, together with another, were 
involved in fabricating evidence against them.  
Photomontages were made of the detainees 
holding explosives for use as evidence.  After their 
interrogation and ill-treatment at the Serious 
Crimes Unit &#8211; Eastern Canal on 24 April 2007, 
two of the detainees, Mr. Ghasan Ibrahim Hussein 
and Mr. Jamal Khalil Abdulrahman, were severely 
ill-treated again by the investigator to extract false 
confessions.

in the afternoon at the intersection of Auezov and 
Abay streets in Almaty. He was apprehended, put 
in a police car and driven around the city for about 
an hour before being taken to the city department

officers beat him inside the car while he remained 
handcuffed. Between 1 and 8 September 2006, 
while he was in the investigators&#8217; offices, he was 
beaten with hands and different objects on various

prosecutor&#8217;s office for Naryn opened an 
investigation into the death of the victim. In early 
January 2007 a forensic examination of the report 
from the initial autopsy concluded that the 
damage to the head, which caused Mr. Sakeev&#8217;s 
death, had been sustained prior to the detention. 
Based on the result of that examination, combined 
with a vague testimony of the victim&#8217;s brother 
obtained in unknown circumstances, the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office concluded that the cause of the 
victim&#8217;s death was natural and therefore the case

<p>behaviour. Some of the children have been at the 
clinic for four or more years. Corporal punishment 
is regularly used. The nurses punish the children 
by tying them to radiators or chairs for many 
hours. Sometimes the children are forced to sit 
down on the floor with their hands bound behind 
their back, their feet tied together, and with their 
heads tucked between their knees. Another form 
of punishment is forcing the children to stand still 
for long periods with their hands tied behind their 
backs with short breaks during meals.  As a result 
of ill-treatment, half of the children have bruises 
and marks from being bound. The drug 
&#8220;aminazin&#8221;, which has strong side-effects, is 
regularly used as means of punishment. Some 
children suffer from tuberculosis and receive no 
medication, and are not separated from the 
others. One 12-year-old girl had a groin hernia 
and suffered from severe pain, and did not receive 
any treatment. There is no running water in the

container in which they wash. All the children

to open fire, as a result of which the deputy chief 
of the Jalalabad province internal affairs office, S. 
Mamytov, and operations officers Z. Shermatov 
and M. Zhanybekov received serious gunshot 
wounds and were hospitalized. The group that 
had put up resistance subsequently fled the 
scene. During the search of the aforementioned 
domicile, one RG-5 hand grenade, one 
Kalashnikov AK automatic rifle with 178 cartridges 
and one IZH-18 rifle with 17 cartridges, as well as 
45 books, 12 audio cassettes and 17 compact 
discs with religious extremist content, were 
confiscated. The procurator&#8217;s office instituted 
criminal proceedings in connection with this 
incident, and R.I. was arrested on the basis of 
article 94 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of

<p>officers. R.I. has stated that she does not know 
the chief of the internal affairs office, that neither 
he nor other internal affairs officers beat her, and 
that her miscarriage was not related to the actions 
of law enforcement bodies. According to the 
information provided by Tashkumyr Hospital, R.I. 
miscarriage was caused by psychological stress; 
there were no indications that she had been 
subjected to violence. She was placed in a 
psychiatric hospital where she received the 
necessary medical care. On 6 October 2006, the 
Jalalabad procurator&#8217;s office decided not to 
institute criminal proceedings owing to the lack of 
evidence that the police officers had committed an 
offence. This decision was well-founded, and no 
reasons have been adduced for rescinding it. It 
has not been established that R.I.&#8217;s rights, either 
at the time of her arrest or during the investigation, 
were violated. Considering that R.I. was accused 
of committing particularly serious offences and 
that, as a result of her actions, officers of the 
Jalalabad province internal affairs office received 
serious bodily harm, there is no provision in

<p>Procedure of the Kyrgyz Republic. In accordance 
with the requirements of Kyrgyz criminal 
procedural legislation, a police line-up of suspects 
was held, during which R.G.D. identified the 
perpetrator. Forensic medical and biological 
examinations were ordered. Subsequently, an 
investigator of the district internal affairs office 
repeatedly took unwarranted decisions to 
terminate criminal proceedings against the 
perpetrator on the grounds of lack of sufficient 
evidence. The Issyk-Kul district procurator&#8217;s office 
made a recommendation to the Issyk-Kul 
provincial internal affairs office concerning the 
investigator; as a result, he was subjected to a 
disciplinary measure, which took the form of a 
reprimand. On 20 December 2006, the perpetrator 
was indicted for the commission of an offence 
contrary to article 129, paragraph 1, of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure and was placed under 
house arrest. On 23 December 2006, he was 
arrested and, on the basis of article 94 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, placed in pretrial 
detention. On 21 December 2006, the criminal 
case involving the rape of R.G.D. was referred to 
the Issyk-Kul interdistrict court, where it is being 
heard. With regard to the enquiry concerning 
&#8220;bride-kidnapping&#8221; in Kyrgyzstan, the following 
information is provided. In 2006, 73 statements 
and communications from citizens concerning the 
coercion of women into marriage were registered. 
With regard to 57 of the reported incidents, 
investigators of internal affairs offices took 
decisions not to institute criminal proceedings </p>

<p>because citizens withdrew their original 
statements. Criminal proceedings were instituted 
in connection with the remaining 16 incidents. The 
results of investigations of nine incidents were 
referred to the courts (in five cases, the courts 
handed down the verdict of guilty, four cases are 
still being heard). In two criminal cases, the 
investigation was suspended in connection with 
the search for the accused persons. Five criminal 
cases are being investigated. For the period under 
consideration, no criminal cases have been 
terminated and no defendants have been 
acquitted by the courts.

<p><b>Vasiliy Grilyanov</b>, in preliminary detention at 
Riga Central Prison since December 2006. Mr. 
Grilyanov is alleged to be suffering from severe 
spinal atrophy and has been officially recognised 
as a &quot;1st group invalid&quot;. In spite of his illness, he 
has not been receiving any special assistance in 
the prison, which means that he can go to the 
toilet and wash himself only occasionally. Guards 
or other members of staff do not come to his cell 
for several days in a row, and therefore he does 
not receive food and water regularly. Mr. 
Grilyanov has not received medical treatment or 
any medication for his condition, which causes it 
to deteriorate further and exacerbate his pain. He 
has filed complaints with the prison administration, 
prison doctors and the prosecutor's office, but has 
not received any replies.

the victims from being subjected to the trial. Thirty 
four women and three men, who were unable to 
pay the fee, were detained by local authorities in 
Buotou. A team of witchdoctors from Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, 
was hired to perform the trial by ordeal. The town

witchcraft and were responsible for causing a lack

<p>of development and employment in Buotou.  The 
37 persons were then severely assaulted and 
forced to sit outside in the rain and sun and were 
denied food (only some received some food from 
their relatives). Their heads were shaved and mud 
and chilli pepper was rubbed on their heads, into 
wounds caused during the beating and into the 
women&#8217;s vaginas. They were threatened that they 
would be subjected to the &quot;sassywood 
procedure&quot;, wherein the victim must prove his or 
her innocence by consuming poison without 
dying, and were ordered to confess to being 
witches. They were released on 24 October 2006 
following the intervention of Liberia National 
Police (LNP) and United Nations Police (UNPOL). 
On 24 December 2006, Ms. Tuakerseh Gborgan 
died in Sanniquillie, apparently as a result of the 
injuries sustained during the trial by ordeal. 
Hunger and lack of adequate medical treatment 
may also have contributed to her death. On 24 
November 2006, police arrested eight people 
alleged to have participated in this procedure, 
among them the witch doctor, Buotou Town Chief, 
and the Zone Chief.  The eight men were charged 
with aggravated assault on 27 November 2006 
and released on bail by the Sanniquillie 
magistrate&#8217;s court the same day. The Youth 
Leader was not arrested. On 22 June 2007, the 
witch doctor was indicted for murder in the Nimba 
county circuit court. However, on 16 July, he was 
acquitted after the circuit court judge granted a 
defence motion to dismiss the case on the ground 
that there was inadequate evidence to prove the

<p>charge beyond a reasonable doubt. In his 
decision, the judge referred to the lack of a valid 
coroner&#8217;s report and forensic investigation. There 
is neither a morgue nor a forensic practitioner in 
Nimba county. The prosecution case had also 
been weakened by a medical report it had 
tendered which was inconclusive in its findings 
regarding the deceased's condition at the time she 
first sought medical treatment. That medical report 
had been prepared by the son-in-law of one of the 
men who ordered the trial by ordeal, raising 
further concerns that the available medical 
evidence was neither impartial nor 
comprehensive. None of the other alleged 
perpetrators has been brought to justice as of 
now. In accordance with the Executive Law, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) has responsibility 
for overseeing &#8220;tribal government&#8221; and 
&#8220;administering the system of tribal courts&#8221; in 
Liberia. The MIA&#8217;s role includes the issuance of 
licences to sassywood practitioners and 
herbalists, among others, and it would appear that 
in practice this includes authorizing instances of 
trial by ordeal. Use of poison sassywood was 
publicly declared illegal at the end of 2006, but, in 
spite of the fact that the Ministry of Justice has 
initiated some prosecutions against practitioners 
of sassywood, it is reported that the Government 
has failed to send a strong and unambiguous 
message regarding the illegality of all forms of trial 
by ordeal and other arbitrary practices. 
Furthermore, MIA officials still authorize such 
ceremonies to go ahead. For example, in the case </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 164 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>of a farmer and security guard who lives in the Po 
River area of Montserrado county, MIA officials 
were going to authorize a trial by ordeal to take 
place, until the Solicitor-General was seized of the 
matter and the case was transferred to the office 
of the county attorney in Monrovia. Judging by the 
description given by MIA personnel to UN 
personnel, the intended ceremony appeared to 
resemble a trial by ordeal in that there was a 
threat of serious harm as punishment, the 
procedure was arbitrary and it was to take place in 
the context of witchcraft or supernatural 
phenomena. It further appears that the farmer had 
been deemed to be guilty and the aim of the 
ceremony was not to determine guilt or innocence 
but was an attempt to prevent alleged future 
crimes. He was to take an oath and consume a 
substance that would punish him in the future if he 
broke that oath. The ceremony, which would not 
be permitted even under the Revised Rules and 
Regulations of the Hinterland, clearly violates the 
human rights guarantees contained in the 
Constitution and the international human rights 
treaties ratified or acceded to by Liberia. It is also 
reported that trial by ordeal that is of a &#8220;minor 
nature&#8221; and does not &#8220;endanger life&#8221; is permitted 
by Art. 73 of the Regulations. Article 2 of those 
Regulations provides that they are to be applied to

are 164 Eritreans who are currently being held in 
centres for illegal migrants after being caught 
attempting to migrate illegally to Europe. They are 
being well-treated and are provided with 
humanitarian and health assistance, as witnessed 
by many foreign media representatives and 
delegations from States and non-governmental 
organizations which have visited these camps. 
Eritrean nationals come to the Great Jamahiriya, 
either because they are fleeing from compulsory 
military service or for other reasons. The truth is 
that most of them enter Libya as a transit zone 
and are bound for the northern shores of the 
Mediterranean Sea. This is a breach of the laws in 
force in the Great Jamahiriya. The above-
mentioned special rapporteurs should therefore 
address this outrageous situation, in accordance 
with their mandates, with the State of origin, 
instead of directing insults and rash accusations at 
the Great Jamahiriya. The repatriation of these 
Eritrean nationals is an appropriate step to take, 
especially as this is what most of them want after 
failing in their attempt to migrate illegally to 
European shores. It is important to distinguish 
between persons who enter the Great Jamahiriya 
illegally with a view to migrating to other States 
and those who enter as refugees seeking 
protection from persecution on account of their 
political views, race, religion or social status. Many 
people tend to confuse the two. Act No. 6 of 1987

from Libya. Anyone who breaches this Act will be </p>

Great Green Document on Human Rights, the 
Promotion of Freedom Act and the relevant laws, 
and pursuant to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the Convention 
against Torture, to which Libya is a party, the 
competent Libyan authorities have no right to 
extradite or repatriate an individual where there is 
evidence to show that that individual will be 
subjected to torture or an unfair trial. The Great 
Green Document and the Freedom Act guarantee 
freedom of conscience, expression and opinion 
and freedom of worship. Everyone is entitled to 
security of person and not to be subjected to 
cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment. Article 431 
of the Criminal Code prescribes a sentence of 
imprisonment for public officials who use violence 
against individuals. Article 435 of the Code 
prescribes a term of imprisonment for any official 
who commits or orders torture. Some members of 
the police may use force during arrests in order to 
deal with individuals who resist arrest. One police 
officer has been convicted for abuse of authority. 
Such cases are isolated cases and those

thus to provide any information. It would appear, 
however, that Mr. Ismail Al-Khazmi was held at

<p>  <b>Heng Peo</b> (A/HRC/4/33/Add.1, para. 135) By letter dated 13/02/07, the Government 
informed that prior to his dismissal, Mr. Heng Peo 
was the Personal Advisor to the Prime Minister of 
Cambodia on Security Issues, Undersecretary of 
State to the Minister of Interior and former Police 
Commissioner of Phnom Penh. Mr. Heng Peo left 
Cambodia for Singapore on 23 July 2006. Based 
on the information obtained by the Malaysian 
authorities, while in Singapore, he sought political 
asylum from the Government of Australia, without 
success. He had also submitted a claim for 
refugee status to the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR). The UNHCR declined to 
grant him such status on 25 August 2006. Mr. 
Heng Peo subsequently submitted an appeal, 
which was also rejected. The Singapore 
authorities subsequently detained Mr. Heng Peo 
at the end of August 2006 for violating immigration 
laws and ordered him to leave the country. The 
Malaysian authorities have ascertained that Mr.

<p>Heng Peo had entered Malaysia through the 
Immigration entry point at the Johor Causeway on 
1 September 2006 at 7.57 p.m. On 5 September 
2006, the Cambodian Government made an 
official request to the Government of Malaysia for 
the latter to arrest and deport Mr. Heng Peo to 
Cambodia, who is wanted in connection with the 
murder of a judge in 2003, as well as for charges 
of attempted murder and kidnapping in Cambodia. 
On 3 October 2006, Mr. Heng Peo was arrested 
by the Malaysian authorities for exceeding his 
entry permit, which allowed him to stay in the 
country for a period of 30 days. On the same day, 
an Australian firm representing Mr. Heng Peo, 
filed an application in the High Court in Kuala 
Lumpur seeking an interim order for a stay of 
deportation to prevent the Malaysian authorities 
from deporting Mr. Heng Peo to Cambodia, 
requested for his deportation to the `Last Port of 
Embarkation', and Mr. Heng Peo also filed a writ 
of habeas corpus. Following the suit, the judge 
allowed Mr. Heng Peo to remain in Malaysia until 
his application for habeas corpus was heard in the 
High Court on 17 October 2006. The order for a 
stay of deportation was further extended and a 
new hearing date set for 3 November 2006 when 
Mr. Heng Peo's previous counsel discharged 
himself and a new counsel was appointed in his 
stead. On 19 October 2006, the High Court 
decided that Mr. Heng Peo should be deported, 
and that the deportation should be to the 'Last 
Port of Embarkation', i.e. Singapore. The 
Prosecution, however, appealed the ruling of the </p>

<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>High Court on the grounds that the authority to 
determine the destination of deportation was the 
sole prerogative of the Director-General of 
Immigration, as provided by the Immigration Act, 
and that the High Court could not usurp such 
authority. The Court of Appeal affirmed on 21 
December 2006 that such authority was vested 
solely in the Director-General of Immigration and 
thus overturned the decision of the High Court. In 
any case, Mr. Heng Peo could not have been 
deported to the `Last Port of Embarkation' i.e. 
Singapore following a letter which had been 
issued by the Commissioner of Immigration and 
Checkpoints Authority of Singapore to the effect 
that Mr. Heng Peo was barred from entering that 
country. Following the decision by the Court of 
Appeal, the Malaysian authorities had to proceed 
to deport Mr. Heng Peo to Cambodia on 21 
December 2006 in accordance with the rules and 
procedures currently in force in the country 
pertaining to such matters. Regarding the appeal 
to the Malaysian Government to take all measures 
to guarantee the rights and freedoms of Mr. Heng 
Peo, to ensure the accountability of any person 
guilty of the alleged violations and to adopt 
effective measures to prevent the recurrence of 
these acts, clearly, the substance of your 
communication pertains to a matter of deportation, 
and not of torture or ill-treatment of Mr. Heng Peo 
while in Malaysia. In this context, this portion of 
the communication is not relevant insofar as the 
Malaysian Government is concerned, and it 
should instead be addressed to the appropriate

<p><b>Hussein Salah</b>, a 29-year-old sand-miner, and a 
well-known opposition activist, resident at 
Naazukeege, Hithadhoo Island, Addu Atoll. On 9 
April 2007, he was arrested on Hithadhoo Island. 
Subsequently he was transferred to Male, where 
he arrived in the evening of 12 April. There he was 
held at the Alhoulhu Vehli Detention Centre, 
where, according to witnesses, he was severely 
beaten for several hours resulting in injuries to his 
face and legs. He died on 13 or 14 April. His body 
was discovered floating in the inner harbour of 
Male on 15 April 2007. At first there were attempts 
by officials to bury the body without a death 
certificate, but in the end a government employed 
doctor issued one. Initially the family&#8217;s request for 
an independent forensic examination was refused. 
However, following protests, on 20 April the body 
was transferred to Colombo, Sri Lanka, where a 
Judicial Medical Officer examined the body. The 
report that resulted from this examination 
contradicted earlier findings of Maldivian police 
and lacked credibility because of inexplicable 
delays and because the Government intervened. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 28 September 2007 the 
Government replied, with reference to police 
investigations, that Mr. Hussain Salah had been 
taken into police custody on 9 April 2007 in Addu 
Atoll on suspicion of possessing drugs. He had 
prior criminal convictions for banned substance 
abuse and burglary. Although drugs were found at 
his arrest location, no further drugs were 
discovered during the body search. However, Mr. 
Salah&#8217;s urine tested positive for opiates. Mr. Salah 
was kept in custody for further investigation and 
then transferred to Male&#8217; by boat as is normal 
practice. The journey from Addu to Mal&#233; takes 
about two days by boat. On the way to Male&#8217;, 
when the vessel was in transit in the island of 
Gadhdhoo, Mr. Salah complained of a headache 
and requested to be taken to the health centre on 
the island. He was attended by the doctor at the 
Gadhdhoo Health Centre who prescribed him 
medication which was administered to him. On 
arrival in Male&#8217;, Mr. Salah was detained at Atholhu 
Vehi (police custodial centre) and, following 
established procedure, was asked about his 
health and well-being. In response, Mr. Salah 
noted that he suffered from intermittent 
headaches. This information was recorded in 
writing along with Mr. Salah&#8217;s signature and 
fingerprint. Mr. Salah was released from custody 
by the police on the night of 13 of April. Records </p>

<p>show that Mr. Salah left custody with his personal 
possessions around 9.10 p.m. His mother was 
notified of his release over the phone. Mr. Salah&#8217;s 
body was discovered around 7.45 a.m. on 15 April 
2007 floating in the harbour on the south-side of 
Male&#8217;. When the Maldives Police Service received 
this information, an investigating team was 
dispatched to the scene. Since the body was 
covered in mud, no external injuries were evident 
on the body. Without further delay, the body was 
removed and taken to the Indhira Gandhi 
Memorial Hospital and then transferred to the new 
Cemetery in Male&#8217;. A team of doctors examined 
the body. During the examination bleeding was 
noted from the nose and ear as well as swelling of 
the left cheek. The doctors recommended that a 
post-mortem be carried out to ascertain the cause 
of death. The Government wishes to reiterate that 
it did not attempt to bury the body without a death 
certificate. On 21 April, following a request by Mr. 
Salah&#8217;s family and given that the Maldives did not 
have the required facilities, an independent post-
mortem examination was carried out at the Office 
of the Judicial Medical Officer in Sri Lanka. The 
body had been transferred by the Government in 
order to respond to the request of the family of the 
deceased. The preliminary findings of the post-
mortem concluded that death was caused by 
drowning. It ruled out the possibility that death had 
been caused by physical violence. The 
subsequent report further confirmed these 
findings. Mr. Hussein Salah was buried on 28 April 
2007 in Male&#8217;. Copies of the report have been

</b></p>
<p>provided to the OHCHR. The Government wishes 
to reiterate that it did not attempt to intervene in 
this process. Throughout the process, the 
Government sought to balance the need to follow 
due legal process to discover the precise cause of 
death with the equally important need to be 
sensitive to and respond to the particular needs of 
Mr. Salah&#8217;s family. Further, the Government 
facilitated at its own expense the transfer to Sri 
Lanka for the post-mortem examination since the 
Maldives do not have the facilities not the trained 
professionals to conduct this procedure. 
Representatives of the Human Rights 
Commission also traveled to Colombo to oversee 
the process. The Government invited Amnesty 
International to be present, but they were not able 
to respond in time. The Maldives Police Service is 
conducting a full investigation into the death of Mr. 
Salah. Their findings so far indicate that the death 
did not happen in custody and that there is no 
cause to believe that Mr. Salah had suffered any 
ill-treatment at the hands of Police Officers. 
Similarly, the Human Rights Commission of the 
Maldives is conducting a full investigation into the 
matter. The results have not been published yet. 
Also, an independent inquiry was carried out by 
the Petition Committee of the People&#8217;s Majlis 
(Parliament). This inquiry focused on procedural 
matters relating to how the body was dealt with 
from the time it was discovered until the time it 
was buried. The Committee found that all parties 
involved in the case had acted in good faith. There 
were nonetheless procedural issues that needed </p>

page 180 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>to be looked at and improved in the future. The 
Committee therefore recommended that improved 
guidelines and regulations be put in place for 
dealing with cases such as that of Mr. Salah, 
when there is uncertainty as to cause of death. So 
far no prosecutions have been undertaken in 
relation the case and no compensation has been 
paid. Finally, the Government reiterated its 
commitment to the protection and promotion of 
human rights.

de Derechos Humanos (CNDH) solicit&#243; la 
exhumaci&#243;n del cuerpo de la Sra. Ernestina 
Ascencio Rosario debido a que se detectaron 
diversas omisiones e inconsistencias en la 
primera necropsia practicada por personal m&#233;dico 
de la Procuradur&#237;a General del Estado de 
Veracruz. Durante la exhumaci&#243;n, los peritos

primera necropsia &#8220;traumatismo craneo-
encef&#225;lico, fractura y luxaci&#243;n de v&#233;rtebras 
cervicales&#8221; no se encontraba debidamente 
sustentada. Con base en los resultados de la 
segunda necropsia, la CNDH emiti&#243; cuatro 
comunicados de prensa en los que se indica 
como causa de muerte una anemia aguda por 
sangrado del tubo digestivo secundario y &#250;lceras 
g&#225;stricas p&#233;pticas agudas, sumado a la presencia 
de tumoraciones hep&#225;ticas malignas, un proceso

solicitud para dar vista del caso al Ministerio 
P&#250;blico, a efectos de investigar la alegaci&#243;n de

juez estatal de informar a la Procuradur&#237;a General 
de Justicia del Estado, de las pruebas sobre las 
supuestas torturas sufridas por el Sr. Alvarado. El 
tribunal federal habr&#237;a resuelto que los tribunales 
estatales no est&#225;n obligados a informar al 
Ministerio P&#250;blico sobre la necesidad de iniciar 
una investigaci&#243;n por tortura. No existir&#237;an 
pruebas que vinculen al Sr. Alvarado con los

que corresponde al Sr. Alvarado probar su 
inocencia de haber participado en el delito que se 
le imputa, lo cual podr&#237;a transgredir sus derechos 
a un debido proceso y a la presunci&#243;n de 
inocencia. En tal virtud, no conforme con su

el juez federal habr&#237;a reconocido la ausencia de

que el juez competente precisara los elementos 
de prueba que acreditaran su responsabilidad y 
dictara una nueva resoluci&#243;n sobre el formal 
procesamiento. Sin embargo, el juez estatal 
habr&#237;a dictado una nueva resoluci&#243;n el 28 de

autoridad federal. El Sr. Alvarado habr&#237;a vuelto a 
presentar un recurso de amparo contra esa 
resoluci&#243;n, volviendo a ganar dicho juicio. La 
autoridad federal habr&#237;a ordenado al juez estatal, 
por segunda vez, precisar las circunstancias 
espec&#237;ficas que demostraran la supuesta 
responsabilidad del Sr. Alvarado. No obstante, el 
10 de mayo de 2007, el juez estatal habr&#237;a 
emitido una resoluci&#243;n en la que se ordenaba el 
formal procesamiento de Pedro Alvarado, 
omitiendo nuevamente precisar los elementos 
probatorios que acreditaban su supuesta 
responsabilidad. En contra de dicha resoluci&#243;n, el 
Sr. Alvarado habr&#237;a acudido a un tribunal federal, 
por considerar que el juez estatal omiti&#243; dar 
cumplimiento a la sentencia de amparo en la que 
se ordenaba precisar las circunstancias 
espec&#237;ficas de la conducta que se le imputa. Sin 
embargo, el tribunal federal declar&#243; improcedente 
tal inconformidad. El Sr. Alvarado, por tercera 
vez, habr&#237;a presentado una demanda de amparo 
por no existir prueba que acreditara su 
participaci&#243;n en el delito que se le imputa. Dicho 
juicio se encontraba pendiente de resolver. Tras

their sexuality. They were told that their blood 
would be tested to determine whether they were 
lesbian. The women were released after ten hours 
on the condition that they return with staff from the

the Maoists called the couple derogatory names 
for homosexuals including &#8220;chakka&#8221; and &#8220;hijara&#8221; 
and ordered the girls to join the Maoist party and 
undergo the training for the Maoist militia. As the

carry weapons, they were beaten, verbally 
abused, and deprived of food almost everyday. 
After being detained for almost one month, they

emergency, thousands of lawyers have been 
arrested and detained in all provinces of Pakistan. 
Many of them are being held for up to 90 days 
under the Maintenance of Public Order law. It is 
reported that Mr. Munir A. Malik, former president 
of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), is 
being held in Attock Fort under the custody of the 
military intelligence service. Numerous instances 
of torture are said to have occurred here during 
the past months. Munir A. Malik, who is known to 
suffer from a heart condition, was visited by 
government doctors on 10 November. There have 
been no further reports on his current condition. 
Aitzaz Ahsan, current president of the SCBA, is 
being held in Adiala Prison in Rawalpindi. His 
lawyer has repeatedly been denied access to him. 
On 6 November, the authorities at the Adiala 
Prison denied access to Atizaz Ahsan's lawyer, 
even though the deputy commissioner of 
Islamabad administration had given permission.  
Mr. Tariq Mahmood, former President of the 
Supreme Court Bar Association had been 
imprisoned in Adiala Prison. No one has been 
allowed to see him and it is reported that he has 
been transferred to an unknown place. The 
whereabouts of Ali Ahmed Kurd, former Vice 
Chair of the Pakistan Bar Council, who was also 
detained on 3 November is unknown. Mr. Ali 
Ahmed Kurd has been handed over to intelligence 
agencies and has been maltreated. Mr. Abrar 
Hassan and Mr. Ahsan Bhoon are said to be held 
incommunicado since their arrest on 3 November.

p.m., she was apprehended by a group of military 
officers of the 19th Infantry Battalion as she 
disembarked from a bus at Kananga. They 
covered her eyes and took her to the military 
headquarters at Barangay Aguitinh, Kananga. 
She was suspected of involvement in the killing of 
a soldier at the Kananga market earlier that day. 
Ms. Marilou Aligato was tortured in order to force 
her to reveal the whereabouts of her alleged 
companions from the paramilitary group, the New 
People&#8217;s Army. One of the officers put a plastic 
bag over her head and tied it around her neck, 
and two other men hit her legs with their weapons. 
She was hit in the chest, head and back by other 
soldiers. She was kept in military custody for three 
days and later moved to Kananga Municipal 
Prison. On 26 January 2007, Ms. Marilou Aligato 
was transferred to the sub-provincial jail in Ormoc 
City, where she is currently being detained in a

member of the 19th Infantry Battalion of the 
Philippine Army based in Kanaga, Leyte was shot 
to death at the public market of Kanaga by two 
unidentified assailants. The gunmen reportedly left 
the crime scene in a hurry on a motorcycle. A 
sergeant and corporal immediately followed the 
assailants and arrested at the scene was a 
woman suspected to be an accomplice, who was 
later identified as Marilou Cabagoy Alegato. She 
was left behind allegedly to monitor the situation. 
Confiscated from her was a cellphone containing 
text messages implicating her as the lookout and 
accomplice in the killing of the soldier. On 8 
November 2006, Ms. Alegato signed a waiver of 
her rights pursuant to the provisions of Art. 125 of 
the Revised Penal Code, duly subscribed and 
sworn to her before the assistant prosecutor of the

two L 300 FB vans whose plate numbers were 
covered. He was handcuffed and taken to a place 
he did not know and interrogated. Mr. Guerrero 
was forced to give names and addresses of family 
members, colleagues and of leaders of non-
governmental organizations in Southern Tagalog, 
as well as his password to access his computer 
and e-mails. During the interrogation he was 
severely beaten on his head with a water bottle 
and fists. Plastic bags were put over his head and 
tightened until he could not breathe any more. He 
was forced to shake his head for about an hour 
and was beaten when he stopped. He was 
threatened that his family would suffer if he did not 
cooperate. He was also threatened with death, 
burning or burial. He continued to be beaten 
throughout the whole interrogation session. He 
was also called &#8220;pastor-impostor&#8221;, which offended 
his religious feelings. After about twelve hours, he 
was put back in the van, still handcuffed and 
blindfolded, and taken to Camp Pantaleon Garcia. 
Mr. Guerrero has been charged in connection with 
a murder case of 1990 and with inciting to 
sedition. Mr. Guerrero&#8217;s abduction is said to be 
linked to the fact that the UCCP has been 
included in a military orientation document called 
&#8220;Knowing the Enemy&#8221; and listed as a leftist front 
organization. About 30 UCCP pastors, and lay 
workers have been killed since 2001.

Cavite PNP, Fidel Posadas, said that Pastor 
Berlin Guerrero was lawfully arrested by elements 
of the Naval Intelligence and Security Force, 
Philippine Navy with the assistance of the 
intelligence based on two standing warrants of 
arrest for murder and inciting to sedition. The 
Government further informed that Pastor Berlin 
Guerrero&#8217;s case was pending before the Regional 
Trial Court Branch 18 in Bacoor, Cavite under 
Criminal Case No. B-91-254. The judge, on 2

these injuries corroborated the allegations of ill-
treatment and that Pastor Berlin Guerrero is likely

<p>Security Prison. Mr. Ibram has been mistreated by 
prison officials several times over a prolonged 
period, most recently on 11 April 2007. In section 
no. 8, cell no. 117, two officers chained Mr. Ibram 
to the bed, sealed his mouth with tape, and 
punched him in the chest and abdomen with 
gloves filled with lead, and a hammer. As a result 
of that treatment he broke an arm and sustained 
numerous bruises. While Mr. Ibram has submitted 
several complaints about previous mistreatment 
and also about the incident described above to 
the National Penitentiary Administration, to the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and Courts, no measures 
have been taken in response. On the night of 14 
to 15 January 2006, Mr. Prisacaru was raped in 
the medical unit (room no. 54) of Iasi High 
Security Prison by a fellow prisoner. The three 
other prisoners present in the room pretended not 
to hear his screams and no guard intervened. 
When he consulted the Iasi Legal Medical 
Institute, it was found that he had been raped, but 
no treatment was administered. When he filed a 
complaint with the local prosecutor&#8217;s office, the 
prosecutor advised him to withdraw the complaint 
because of lack of evidence and witnesses, and 
because the medical certificate's conclusions did 
not exclude that he might have consented to the 
sexual act. The alleged perpetrators and their 
relatives threatened to kill him if he complained. 
On 7 March 2007, Mr. Prisacaru was again raped 
in room no. 50, department VI of the same facility,

several rib fractures, bruises all over his body and 
a black eye. In this state he was raped again by 
another inmate. The guards did not intervene and 
the inmates prevented him from reaching the 
door. The next day he consulted the medical unit, 
but no mention was made of his injuries in the 
medical report and no treatment was 
administered. In general, in Iasi Prison inter-
prisoner violence is not only common, but also 
tolerated and often encouraged by officers who 
use it to maintain discipline.

was arrested on 5 July 2007 in a clinic in 
Murmansk where she had gone for a medical 
examination needed to renew her driver&#8217;s license. 
Following her arrest, Ms. Arap was transferred to 
a psychiatric hospital 150 km outside Murmansk, 
where she was injected with drugs against her 
will. She was also beaten and tied to a bed. On 18 
July 2007, the local district court ordered that Ms. 
Arap be subjected to compulsory treatment. Since 
then she has been held in a wing for violent 
patients. On 8 June 2007, Ms. Arap&#8217;s article on 
the reported ill-treatment of children in psychiatric 
hospitals in the Murmansk region was published 
in a newspaper of the &#8220;United Civil Front&#8221;. In 
particular, she had reported about the use of 
electroshock and alleged that patients had been 
beaten and raped repeatedly. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 19/09/07, the Government 
informed that she had been under psychiatric 
observation at the municipal outpatient clinic in the 
closed city of Severomorsk since 18 June 2004 for 
an acute psychotic disorder with suspected 
schizophrenia and a paranoid syndrome. She had 
been committed to the Murmansk provincial 
neuropsychiatric clinic, a State health facility, for 
treatment in 2004. Ms. Arap saw a psychiatrist on 
several occasions in 2006, sometimes at the 
insistence of family members. She received the 
necessary outpatient psychiatric care. On 5 July 
2007, Ms. Arap visited a psychiatrist from the 
Severomorsk municipal outpatient clinic for the 
medical clearance that she needed to obtain a 
driving licence. During the consultation, the 
psychiatrist found medical reasons why Ms. Arap 
should not drive. It was explained to Ms. Arap that 
she would need to undergo psychiatric tests 
before a panel in accordance with article 3 of 
Federal Act No. 3185-1 of 2 July 1992 on </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1

<p>psychiatric assistance and guarantees concerning 
its availability to the public (hereinafter referred to 
as &#8220;the Act&#8221;). Ms. Arap disagreed with the 
psychiatrist&#8217;s opinion, however, and turned 
aggressive, screaming and running around the 
consultation room. She also started threatening to 
complain to the procurator&#8217;s office and accused 
the physician of trying to &#8220;stick her in the 
madhouse&#8221;, motivated, according to Ms. Arap, by 
plans to take over her apartment. Ms. Arap also 
began to make threats against various people and 
to claim that her telephone was being tapped by 
the secret service and that her neighbours were 
&#8220;gassing her&#8221;. Moreover, her speech was 
confused and irrational and she jumped from one 
subject to another without responding to the 
physician&#8217;s remarks. The psychiatrist diagnosed 
Ms. Arap&#8217;s condition as an acute psychotic 
disorder, as evidenced by the thought disorders 
manifested as irrationality, incoherence, delusions 
and confused behaviour. It was impossible to 
leave Ms. Arap without qualified psychiatric help 
under such circumstances and, acting on the 
grounds stipulated in article 29, paragraph (a), of 
the Act, the psychiatrist took the decision to 
commit her to the Murmansk provincial 
neuropsychiatric clinic for treatment, until such 
time as a court could take a decision. In 
accordance with article 303 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure of the Russian Federation and article 
32 of the Act, Ms. Arap was examined by a panel 
of experts from the Murmansk provincial 
neuropsychiatric clinic on 6 July 2007 and was

<p>diagnosed with &#8220;paranoid-type schizophrenia and 
a shift-like affective paranoid syndrome&#8221;. On the 
basis of the panel&#8217;s findings, an application was 
submitted to the Leninsky district court in 
Murmansk, for Ms. Arap to be committed to a 
psychiatric hospital under article 29, paragraph 
(a), of the Act. On 18 July 2007, a special session 
of the Leninsky district court was convened (case 
No. 2 1483), with the participation of a procurator 
and a lawyer. The application by the Murmansk 
provincial neuropsychiatric clinic for Ms. Arap to 
be committed to hospital was granted. As a result 
of ward overcrowding (one member of nursing 
staff for every 30 patients, instead of every 25, as 
recommended), Ms. Arap was transferred along 
with 20 other patients of the Murmansk provincial 
neuropsychiatric clinic, following standard 
procedure, to the Murmansk provincial psychiatric 
hospital on 26 July 2007. Ms. Arap was examined 
by the psychiatrist in the hospital&#8217;s admissions unit 
and presented no signs of injury or physical 
deterioration. On 27 July 2007, she was examined 
in the ward by a panel of psychiatrists consisting 
of the chief consultant of ward No. 3, the chief of 
ward No. 2, and the chief of ward No. 1. The panel 
found that the patient was suffering from paranoid-
type schizophrenia with affective paranoid 
syndrome and confirmed that compulsory hospital 
treatment was necessary. On 9 August 2007, as 
Ms. Arap had been in hospital for an entire month 
and in the light of the recommendation of the 
principal outside psychiatric expert of the 
Murmansk provincial health committee that </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 228

<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>another medical examination should be carried 
out in accordance with the legally prescribed 
schedule (as from the time of hospitalization), a 
medical examination of Ms. Arap was carried out 
by a panel of psychiatrists. The panel found that 
Ms. Arap met the criteria for compulsory hospital 
treatment set out in article 29, paragraph (c), of 
the Act; this necessitated a further consideration 
by the court of the issue of extending Ms. Arap&#8217;s 
compulsory hospital treatment. On 11 August 
2007, a special session was convened of the 
Apatity municipal court in Murmansk province, by 
decision of which Ms. Arap&#8217;s compulsory hospital 
treatment was extended. On 28 August 2007, 
pursuant to the findings of the psychiatrists of the 
Murmansk provincial neuropsychiatric hospital 
and in accordance with article 40 of the Act, Ms. 
Arap was released from hospital into outpatient 
care at her place of residence consequent to an 
improvement in her state of health. The Leninsky 
administrative district procurator&#8217;s office in 
Murmansk closely examined Ms. Arap&#8217;s committal 
to the psychiatric hospital, but did not find that the 
law had been breached in any way where the 
committal procedure was concerned.

Muhametsobirov, K. Kasimhujaev, U. Alimov, S. 
Sabirov, R. Naimov, H. Hamzaev, M. 
Tashtemirov, H. Hadjimatov and M. 
Rustamhodjaev are accused of having actively 
participated, in May 2005, with a view to disrupting 
the national sovereignty and the territorial integrity 
of Uzbekistan, in the terrorist acts and mass 
disorders which took place in Andijon and which 
had the following serious consequences: the 
deaths of more than 180 persons, including law 
enforcement officers and military personnel; they 
also stole a significant quantity of firearms and 
ammunition and caused particularly extensive 
damage to State property. On 20 June 2005, the 
above-mentioned persons were arrested in the 
city of Ivanovo and remanded in custody. They 
are all charged with membership of the religious 
extremist organizations Islamic Party of Turkestan 
and Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami, which were declared 
to be terrorist organizations by the Supreme Court 
of the Russian Federation on 14 February 2003 
and whose activities are prohibited in the territory 
of the Russian Federation. During the 
investigation, some of the detainees alleged that 
their prosecution by the procuratorial authorities of 
Uzbekistan was politically motivated.  At the 
request of the Office of the Procurator-General of 
the Russian Federation, Uzbekistan has given

<p>assurances that the detained persons will be 
criminally prosecuted only for those offences for 
which they will be extradited by the Russian 
Federation, that after the completion of the judicial 
proceedings and the serving of their sentences 
they will be free to leave the territory of 
Uzbekistan and will not be expelled, transferred or 
extradited to a third State without the consent of 
the Russian Federation, and also that the death 
penalty will not be imposed on them. Furthermore, 
the Office of the Procurator-General of Uzbekistan 
has provided assurances that the purpose of the 
request for extradition is to bring the suspects to 
criminal account for the commission of especially 
heinous crimes and is not aimed at persecution for 
political motives or in connection with racial 
background, religious belief, nationality or political 
views. They will be afforded every opportunity in 
the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan for 
defence, including the assistance of lawyers, and 
they will not be subjected to torture, coercion or 
any other form of cruel or degrading treatment or 
punishment. In the Russian Federation, the 
above-mentioned persons are guaranteed the 
right of defence and have access to defence 
lawyers to provide them with legal assistance in 
connection with their extradition. The Ivanovo 
provincial office of the Russian Federal 
Immigration Service has refused to grant I.

of the European Court of Human Rights and 
President of Section on the applicability of rule 39 
of the rules of the Court to the case of Ismoilov 
and Others v. Russia (application No. 2947/06), 
the Office of the Procurator-General of the 
Russian Federation instructed the Director of the 
Federal Penal Correction Service to suspend any 
action to extradite, deport or forcibly remove the 
above-mentioned persons to Uzbekistan until 
further notice. At the beginning of December 
2006, the Oktyabr district court of the city of 
Ivanovo granted the appeals of the applicants, 
ruled that the decisions of the Federal Immigration 
Service to refuse to grant Ismoilov and the others 
temporary asylum in the territory of the 
Russian Federation were unlawful and ordered 
the Ivanovo provincial office of the Federal 
Immigration Service to rectify the violations 
committed. The Ivanovo provincial office of the

<p><b>Badawi Hasan Ibrahim</b> and <b>Abd-al-Rahim Ali</b> 
were sentenced to death on 23 November 2006 
for the murder of 13 police officers killed during 
riots which took place in May 2005 at a camp for 
internally displaced people. The men were 
sentenced to death after the relatives of the dead 
police officers refused to spare their lives in return 
for payment of diya (blood money). It is alleged 
that the seven men confessed to their murder 
charges under torture, including severe beatings. 
From their arrest in May 2005 until October 2005, 
they had no access to legal counsel. Three 
members of the family of Fathi Adam Mohammed 
Ahmad Adam, including his 70-year-old mother 
and 15-year-old brother, were arrested and held 
for three days to force him to give himself up. On 
18 May 2005 there were riots at the Soba Aradi

inhabitants resisted the authorities' attempt to 
forcibly evict all of them. There were violent 
clashes, and 13 policemen and about 30 
residents, including children, were killed. On 24 
May the security forces threw a cordon round the 
area, not allowing anyone to enter or leave while 
they raided the residents' houses and shacks, 
arresting some 240 people, most of whom were 
subsequently released. They were held in various

&#8220;whoever commits the offence of sexual 
intercourse in the absence of a lawful relationship 
shall be punished with: a) execution by stoning

verdict on 13 March 2007, convicting the accused 
for adultery, based on her confession. Ms. 
Amouna Abdallah Daldoum was tried before a 
court of first instance of Jazirah State, and was 
convicted by the court on 6 March 2007 of 
adultery, based on her confession. Both accused 
are married and engaged in intercourse with 
others during their husbands&#8217; absence. They 
appealed the verdicts and the Jazirah State 
Appeal Court issued a ruling overturning the 
convictions and sentences, and returning the case 
files for retrial for a number of reasons, including 
the fact that they had not had legal assistance 
during the proceedings. The two women know 
Arabic very well and so the court did not have to 
appoint an interpreter, in accordance with the 
Criminal Procedure Code. The case files are 
before the Jazirah State Court of First Instance.  </p>

of Elazig province, Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. She 
is at imminent risk of deportation. In 1988, while 
still living in Turkey, Leyla Kasim, then 16, was 
forced by her parents to enter a marriage with a 
31 year-old man. Her husband abused her and 
their two sons, both physically and mentally, 
almost every day throughout their marriage. 
Sometimes he would lock her and their two 
children out of the house and they would be 
forced to sleep outside. He also repeatedly 
threatened Leyla Kasim that he would hang her 
and make it look like suicide if she did not obey 
him. Leyla Kasim sought support from her family 
several times, but was told to return to her 
husband. Moreover, her mother threatened to 
marry her again to an even older man if she did 
not obey. In 2004, following a relationship with 
one of her husband&#8217;s friends, which was 
discovered by her family and discussed in a

in order to provide comprehensive information. 
While awaiting further examination, her 
deportation has been temporarily suspended. The 
Government informed that the facts alleged in the 
summary corresponded to the facts that Ms. Leyla 
Kasim had indicated in her asylum application. 
However, the Swedish Migration Board and the 
former Swedish Appeal Board had found strong 
reasons to question the credibility of Ms. Leyla 
Kasim&#8217;s story. The lack of credibility was the main 
reason that her application for asylum was 
rejected. In the decision of the Swedish Migration 
Board of 26 August 2005, the Board concluded, 
on the basis of a thorough investigation, that Ms. 
Leyla Kasim would not be subjected to violence or 
honour killings in case she is returned to Turkey.

<p>village meeting, Leyla Kasim went into hiding. 
According to reports, her brothers announced that 
they would kill her if they found her. Subsequently, 
she received help in leaving her village and 
fleeing the country.  Leyla Kasim arrived in 
Sweden on 31 March 2005, where she applied for 
asylum on 1 April 2005, referring to the risk of 
violence committed in the name of honour. Her 
asylum application was rejected by the Swedish 
Migration Board (Migrationsverket) on 26 August 
</p><p>2006. Following that decision Leyla Kasim 
appealed to the Swedish Alien's Board 
(Utl&#228;nningsn&#228;mnden), which rejected her 
application on 29 October 2005. This decision 
could not be appealed, and the authorities 
prepared for her deportation. On 15 November 
2005, temporary legislation came into force, which 
allowed for a review of rejected asylum 
applications. Leyla Kasim&#8217;s application was 
reviewed in accordance with the new legislation, 
but once again rejected.  The latter decision could 
not be appealed.  In March 2006 a new Aliens' Act 
came into force, according to which asylum 
applications are tried in first instance by the 
Swedish Migration Board. This decision of the first 
instance can be appealed to the Migration Court. 
If there are exceptional reasons or if there is a 
need for a legal precedent, this decision can be 
appealed a second time to the Appellate Migration 
Court. However, the procedure in the new Aliens' 
Act does not apply to those asylum-seekers who, 
like Leyla Kasim, already had their case tried in 
full. Leyla Kasim, after having exhausted all the 
</p>
<p>of 29 October 2005, comes to the same 
conclusions. According to the Swedish Aliens 
Act&#8217;s chapter 12 paras 18 and 19, once the 
rejection of an asylum claim has entered into 
force, Ms. Kasim can only apply for a stay of 
deportation. The applicable legislation is much 
more restrictive. However, for the purpose of 
further investigation, Ms. Leyla Kasim&#8217;s 
deportation has been suspended. The Board has 
appointed a public counsel for her and has held 
an oral investigation with the two of them. As a 
result, the Migration Board has decided to reject 
the stay of deportation because, in its view, it is 
unlikely that Ms. Layla Kasim will be subjected to 
honour related violence when deported to Turkey.   </p>

their stay in Nong Khai IDC, the Immigration

<p>immigration officials have applied stricter 
measures toward the Lao Hmong which resulted 
in deterioration of their conditions of detention. All 
of them are confined to tiny cells, without access 
to daylight and are not allowed to leave the cells. 
They have no access to clean, potable water but 
have to drink water from bathrooms inside the 
cells. These restrictions, as well as limited access 
to medical care, have caused the spreading of 
diseases, such as rashes, diarrhea, respiratory 
infections and fever, especially among children. 
Furthermore, contact with the outside world is not 
permitted as no visits or phone calls are allowed.

needs of the large number of children and 
arranged that the medical doctor visit the children 
on a daily basis between 9 and 12 a.m. Also a 
physician from a non-governmental organization 
was allowed to visit during these hours. After 
seven Laotian Hmongs escaped from the 
detention centre, with only two of them 
apprehended to date, immigration officials were 
compelled to take more stringent security 
measures. The hunger strike staged by the 
Laotian Hmongs protesting the congested living 
conditions began on 15 August and ended on 19 
August 2007. Even before the hunger strike 
occurred, the Immigration Bureau was requesting, 
and will continue to do so, funds from the 
Government to expand facilities at IDC. Fully 
aware of the urgency of the situation the 
Immigration Bureau is also looking into expanding 
the facilities in a temporary manner with a third 
party, which is expected to be completed within 
the next two months. In the meantime the 
detainees have been allowed to move around 
outside the detention rooms during the day. With 
regard to access to safe drinking water and food 
from outside, it is important to note, that there 
have never been any restrictions and that nobody 
had to drink water from bathrooms as alleged. It 
should also be stressed that officials from the UN

<p>Government considers the above-mentioned 
Laotian Hmongs illegal immigrants, subject to 
judicial process in accordance with the Thai 
Immigration Act of 1979 (B.E. 2522). Once these 
illegal immigrants are arrested, they will be 
detained in a detention facility of the Immigration 
Bureau before being repatriated to their countries 
of origin. This modus operandi is practiced by all 
countries around the world. However, the Royal 
Thai Government has treated these illegal 
immigrants in compliance with humanitarian 
principles and with international norms under 
international human rights and humanitarian law, 
including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. In addition, although Thailand is not 
party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, she has 
principally attempted to observe the non-
refoulement principle and has never repatriated 
people with POC status accorded by UNHCR. It 
should also be noted that the context and 
circumstances of illegal migration in Thailand is 
different from those in other countries, especially 
in Europe since Thailand is a country of first 
asylum and faces a large influx of several 
thousand displaced persons and illegal 
immigrants who enter the country in search of 
better economic conditions. Furthermore, Thailand 
is a developing country with limited financial 
resources and needs to take into consideration 
concerns relating to national security when 
dealing with illegal immigrants. In relation to the 
case of the Laotian Hmongs in Nong-Khai IDC, </p>

<p>the Royal Thai Government has suspended all 
actions based on humanitarian principles and 
given the lack of clarity as to the cause for which 
they have left their country. The Royal Thai 
Government has recently established a screening 
mechanism, an internal body to transparently 
verify the identity and nationality of more than 
7000 Laotian Hmong illegal immigrants in 
Petchaborn Province. This mechanism will also 
identify the persons with genuine fear of 
persecution and help to find avenues for further 
action acceptable to all parties concerned. 
Thailand has to bear the heavy burden of 
sheltering illegal migrants for decades. Our 
responses have always been based on 
humanitarian considerations. The Royal Thai 
Government hopes that all parties concerned 
understand the difficult position faced by Thailand 
and take appropriate steps in finding a durable 
solution.

diagnosed with various chest ailments. The ward&#8217;s 
medical chief concluded that &#8220;at present, patient 
G.P. Donchu is seriously somatically ill, [&#8230;] the 
forecast regarding G.P. Donchu&#8217;s health condition 
is unfavorable given his prolonged detention&#8221; and 
stated that Mr. Donchu &#8220;requires treatment and 
further examination at a specialized (cardiologic) 
institution&#8221;. At a recent court hearing, when an 
ambulance had to be called to treat Mr. Donchu, 
the treating doctor found that Mr. Donchu &#8220;was on 
the brink of a micro stroke or a micro infarction&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 15/08/07, the Government 
informed that he was arrested on 22 June 2005 on 
suspicion of the commission of an offence 
covered by article 364, paragraph 3, of the 
Criminal Code of Ukraine. On being admitted to 
the Artemovsk remand centre on 4 July 2005, Mr. 
Donchu was examined at the centre&#8217;s medical 
unit, following which he was referred for treatment 
for chronic illnesses from which he was found to 
be suffering. Since 4 July 2005, Mr. Donchu has 
been in custody at the Artemovsk remand centre 
of the Ukrainian Criminal Corrections Service in 
Donetsk province. The following diagnosis was 
drawn up after his medical examination: 
&#8220;Rheumatism (inactive phase), combined heart 
valve disease with a stenosis of the aortic 
isthmus, cardiac decompensation at the 2B stage, 
hypertension, chronic ciliary tachyarrhythmia 
accompanied by chronic bronchitis and respiratory 
failure of degree 1-2.&#8221; During his custody in the 
remand centre, the detainee has repeatedly 
received medical assistance (including, in 2005, 
specialized treatment in the local health care unit 
of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health), in accordance 
with the recommendations of the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Health, in response to symptoms of 
rheumatism, combined mitro-aortal insufficiency,

<p>cardiac fibrillation in the tachysystolic phase, 
cardiac decompensation at the 2A stage and 
chronic obstructive bronchitis. In addition, on five 
separate occasions (8 February 2006, 18 October 
2006, 4 December 2006, 27 March 2007 and 12 
June 2007), Mr. Donchu was examined by 
specialists from the cardiology division of 
Artemovsk central district hospital. In order to 
meet Mr. Donchu&#8217;s need for inpatient treatment in 
a specialized hospital unit, on 12 June 2007, he 
was sent for a consultation at the cardiology 
division of Artemovsk central district hospital. His 
examination confirmed the original diagnosis and 
recommendations were drawn up for his treatment 
in the medical unit of the remand centre with 
prescribed medication under the supervision of a 
doctor. At the current stage, the detainee&#8217;s health 
state is consistent with the chronic illnesses from 
which he has been found to be suffering. He 
undergoes regular check-ups and when his 
chronic conditions worsen, he is properly treated 
with the prescribed medication. On 23 October 
2006, the remand centre authorities submitted 
report No. 9/11575, to the Nikitinsk district court in 
the city of Horlivka in Donetsk province, which, 
since 11 October 2006, has been responsible for 
considering Mr. Donchu&#8217;s case, confirming that 
the defendant is suffering from the specified 
illnesses and reporting on his worsening state of 
health. In this connection, Mr. Donchu and his 
legal counsel have applied to the court (twice in 
2006 and twice in 2007 - in January and in June) 
for the measure of restraint applied against him to </p>

<p>be replaced by a non-custodial measure. By its 
decisions of 11 January and 12 June 2007, the 
court rejected those applications. During the court 
hearings on 12 and 26 June 2007, emergency 
medical services were called when Mr. Donchu 
suffered health crises. When questioned on this 
matter, a doctor from the emergency medical 
services (who was called out on 12 June) 
explained that, following a diagnosis of increased 
arterial pressure and having reviewed the results 
of a cardiogram, injections of verapamil and 
corglycon were administered to the defendant to 
bring down his blood pressure and heart rate. The 
doctor also confirmed that Mr. Donchu was in no 
danger of a heart attack and did not need to be 
hospitalized, although he did recommend that the 
court proceedings be deferred. A paramedic with 
the emergency medical services (who was called 
out on 26 June), said that Mr. Donchu had 
complained of discomfort in his chest area and of 
feeling weak. An examination showed that his 
cardiogram was within the normal range. In order 
to alleviate his heart pain and to stimulate cardiac 
activity, injections of analgin, dimedrol and 
corglycon were administered. Mr. Donchu&#8217;s state 
of health improved and he did not need 
hospitalization. Mr. Donchu is being treated in 
accordance with the doctor&#8217;s recommendations 
and his state of health is being monitored by 
specialists from the central district hospital in 
Artemovsk and the medical unit at the remand 
centre. At the current time, Mr. Donchu is in

unit, consisting of officers wearing masks and 
special uniforms, was deployed to a high security 
section of the colony, presumably in response to 
numerous complaints by the prisoners about poor 
conditions of detention. For an hour, the officers 
severely beat up the prisoners held in that section. 
Later that day, around 8 p.m., 12 prisoners with 
serious bodily injuries were admitted to the 
infirmary. The injured prisoners, some of them on 
stretchers, were taken to the hospital by officers of 
the special unit.

informed that pursuant to the Ukrainian Counter-
Terrorism Act, six special detachments have been 
set up under the Ukrainian Criminal Corrections 
Service, which include an interprovincial 
detachment reporting to the Criminal Corrections 
Service for Kiev city and province. The special 
detachment regulations were ratified by order No. 
167 of 10 October 2005 of the Criminal 
Corrections Service. Under the regulations, the 
special detachment is a paramilitary formation 
designed to intercept and prevent both crimes of a 
terrorist nature within the facilities of the criminal 
corrections system and activities intended to 
disrupt the work of the corrections services, to 
ensure the protection of their staff and to carry out 
other measures to maintain the necessary 
conditions for the serving of punishments and the 
conduct of searches. In accordance with the 
Service&#8217;s rules and regulations and pursuant to 
order No. 94 of 7 June 2007 passed by the chief 
of the Criminal Corrections Service for Kiev city 
and province and the duly ratified plan of action,

<p>searches and the monitoring of the prisoners&#8217; daily 
routine. Between 6 a.m. and 12.10 p.m. officers 
from the detachment, working together with 
employees of the facility itself, conducted 
searches and technical inspections in the high 
security section of the colony and in units of 
rehabilitation section No. 4, and also of the 
prisoners held in those facilities. Those searches 
led to the discovery and confiscation of a large 
quantity of prohibited items: kitchen knives, 
medical syringes, sharpened metal blades, home-
made electrical appliances and playing cards. 
During the spot searches, no physical coercion 
was employed against the prisoners. After the 
conduct of the searches, the relevant reports were 
drawn up and a drop-in session organized for the 
prisoners to come and discuss personal matters. 
No complaints or applications were filed by the 
prisoners. Following those procedures, a number 
of complaints were filed with the Office of the 
Procurator-General by human rights groups from 
Kharkiv and Sevastopol, the Ukrainian chapter of 
the International Helsinki Federation for Human 
Rights, the Public Committee for the Protection of 
Constitutional Rights and Civil Freedoms, the 
Kherson Provincial Charity Fund, the International 
League for the Human Rights of Ukrainian citizens 
and by a people&#8217;s deputy in the country&#8217;s fifth 
parliamentary session. These complaints alleged 
that physical force and special measures had 
been applied by staff of the special detachments 
against the prisoners, as a result of which many

<p>admitted to hospital for medical treatment. No 
reports or complaints to this effect were submitted 
to the law enforcement agencies by the prisoners 
themselves or by their relatives. Acting on the 
instructions of the Procurator-General of Ukraine, 
officials from the Ukrainian procuratorial service 
undertook to check these allegations, making on-
site visits in the company of representatives of 
human rights organizations, who had the 
opportunity freely to interview the prisoners. The 
checks established that, during the procedures 
described above, no physical force or special 
measures had been applied, no prisoners had 
suffered bodily injuries and none had been 
admitted to hospital for medical treatment. In the 
light of the findings of this check, the actions taken 
by officers of the special detachment under the 
State Corrections Service for Kiev city and 
province and by the staff of Buchansk correctional 
colony No. 85 were deemed lawful, a finding 
which was accepted by the chairman of the board 
of the International League for the Human Rights 
of Ukrainian citizens, who also took part in the 
check. Certain media outlets published distorted 
information about this exercise. For the purpose of 
the check, the colony was visited by staff from the 
Office of the Ukrainian Procurator-General and 
from the secretariat of the Human Rights 
Commissioner of the Supreme Council of Ukraine.

Ukrainian Transport Authority, and, on the 
decision of the Solomensk district court of 22 July 
2007, was sent to remand centre No. 13 of the

Federation had issued an international search 
warrant for having committed an offence under

According to information provided by the 
Ukrainian State Committee on Ethnic and

the Kyiv Migration Department on 8 August 2007. 
As required by the Refugees Act, on 23 August

interviewed Mr. Susarov at Kyiv remand centre 
No. 13. On the basis of the consideration of his 
application and the interview conducted, during 
which the applicant provided information which

<p>status (in other words, Mr. Susarov&#8217;s application 
form was accepted). In accordance with the 
Refugees Act, Mr. Susarov was officially 
registered with the relevant document. The 
decision as to whether to grant Mr. Susarov 
refugee status will be taken by the State 
Committee on Ethnic and Religious Affairs and 
may be appealed in a court of law. The question 
of Mr. Susarov&#8217;s extradition will be taken up only 
after his application for refugee status has been 
dealt with. The Ukrainian Security Service in 
cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
the Office of the Procurator-General and the State 
Committee on Ethnic and Religious Affairs has 
considered the matter of the extradition to the 
Russian Federation of the Russian citizen, Lema

Koktysh left Belarus, for fear of an unfair trial 
resulting in a death sentence, and moved to 
Ukraine. Prior to his arrest, he had been engaged 
in social activities supporting the youth in 
Baranovici and organised music festivals. After he 
had established a Catholic youth organisation, 
local police urged Mr. Koktysh not to register the 
organisation and, when he persisted, warned him 
that they would find a reason to arrest him.

national, a former police officer in Loum, and 
currently held at Oakington detention centre in 
Cambridge. He is due to be deported on 9 March 
2007 at 9 pm. Mr. Koiman was detained in his 
home country Cameroon between 20 November 
2004 and 11 February 2005 based on allegations 
that he supported the political opposition. He was 
at first held in solitary confinement in a detention 
centre in Douala in a very dark cell measuring 1.5 
m x 2.0 m. During that time he was frequently 
forced into uncomfortable positions and severely 
beaten with rubber whips on his buttocks and 
soles. After three weeks he was transferred to a 
disciplinary prison in Edear, where he shared a 
cell with other inmates. The cell was extremely 
dirty, light was scarce, he frequently had no 
access to water, and the little water that he 
received was of poor quality, as was the food. He 
was not given food for prolonged periods and not 
allowed to exercise. During his custody, he had no 
access to a lawyer and was never produced 
before a court. As a result of the treatment and 
the detention conditions, he sustained eye and 
stomach conditions, and scars mainly on his 
buttocks and the soles of his feet. He also suffers 
from depression. In February 2005 Mr. Koiman 
fled to the United Kingdom, where he asked for 
asylum on 14 April 2005. His claim, after having 
been considered by several instances, was finally 
rejected on 22 February 2007 based on the 
argument that the medical evidence was not 
&quot;completely conclusive&quot; and did not constitute 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 28/10/07, the Government 
responded that Mr. Koimon claimed to have 
entered the United Kingdom at Gatwick on 3 April 
2005 using a French passport to which he was not 
entitled. There is no evidence to substantiate this. 
He sought asylum on 14 April 2005, on which date 
he was informed of his liability to removal from the 
United Kingdom as an illegal entrant. His case 
was accepted into the fast track procedure and, as 
an integral part of that procedure, he was detained 
at Harmondsworth. He was interviewed on 22 
April 2005 about the basis of his claim. On 25 
April 2005 his asylum claim was rejected. The 
Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) 
accepted that Mr. Koimon had been a policeman 
in Cameroon at some point but did not accept as 
true any other aspect of his claim. IND took the 
view that Mr. Koimon's motives for coming to the 
United Kingdom were primarily for economic self-
betterment. Mr. Koimon's appeal against this 
decision was heard by an Immigration Judge and 
dismissed on 4 May 2005. The Immigration 
Judge, who had the benefit of hearing evidence 
from Mr. Koimon in person, held that the appellant 
had not been able to satisfy him that he had 
suffered persecution for a Convention reason 
whether of race or imputed political opinion or 
otherwise. If the appellant were genuinely at risk 
of a material period of detention in Cameroon it 
might be possible for him to argue that he would 
be subjected to treaiment violating his rights under 
Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention. 
However, the Judge did not believe that Mr. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>&quot;independent corroborative evidence&quot;.  Koimon had been detained and escaped in the 
manner that he described and he therefore did not 
believe that he was at further risk of detention. 
There was no evidence to support the appellant's 
assertion that he might be at risk of his life if he 
were to return. Mr. Koimon applied to the Asylum 
and Immigration Tribunal for a reconsideration of 
that decision. In rejecting his application a Senior 
Immigration Judge held that: &quot;The application 
identifies no error of law on the part of the 
Immigration Judge. When read as a whole, the 
determination is a full, fair and properly reasoned 
one which accurately describes the appellant's 
account and adequately explains why the claims 
are dismissed. There is no real possibility that the 
Tribunal would decide the appeal differently on 
reconsideration. An appeal would have no 
prospect of success. &quot; Mr. Koimon refused to 
cooperate with procedures to obtain a travel 
document for him and because his return to 
Cameroon was therefore no longer imminent he 
was released from detention on 14 July 2005. On 
12 December 2006 Mr. Koimon's solicitors made a 
purported fresh application on his behalf citing an 
asserted interference with his human rights under 
Articles 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 13 of the ECHR. 
Those representations were rejected on 22 
February 2007. On 23 February 2007 Mr. Koimon 
was detained under Immigration Service powers 
and directions were set for his removal to 
Cameroon on 2 March 2007. These were deferred 
for administrative reasons on 1 March 2007 and 
were reset for 9 March 2007. On 5 March 2007, </p>

<p>Mr. Koimon's legal representatives lodged an 
application for judicial review with the 
Administrative Division of the High Court. Mr. 
Koimon was released from detention on 9 March 
2007 pending the outcome of his application to the 
Court. With regard to the specific concerns raised 
by the Special Rapporteur, the Government 
replied that the standard of proof required in an 
asylum claim is referred to as &quot;reasonable 
likelihood&quot;. The asylum case worker is guided in 
this by the published Asylum Policy Instructions 
(API). The API on Assessing the Claim states: 
&quot;The decision maker will seldom be able to say 
with certainty whether or not an applicant will be 
persecuted if returned to their country of origin. 
The appropriate test for a decision maker to apply 
is to consider whether, at the date when they are 
making their decision, there is a reasonable 
degree of likelihood of the applicant being 
persecuted in their country of origin. The courts 
have said that a &#8220;reasonable degree of likelihood' 
has the same meaning as the term &#8220;real risk&#8221;, 
which is the test used by decision makers when 
assessing whether an applicant will be subjected 
on return to treatment which violates Article 3 of 
the European Convention on Human Rights. This 
does not require the decision maker to be satisfied 
on the balance of probabilities that the applicant is 
more likely than not to suffer persecution for a 
Convention reason in their country of origin. 
Where the objective country evidence, applied to 
the applicant's case, suggests that there is a 
continuing reasonable likelihood that the applicant 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 281 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>would face persecution in their country of origin, 
the applicant should normally be granted refugee 
status. Decision makers should bear in mind that 
however well-founded an applicant's 
original/historic reasons for fleeing their country of 
origin, they are only entitled to a grant of asylum 
where at the date of decision they continue to 
have a well-founded fear of persecution for a 
Convention reason. However, if an applicant has 
already been subjected to, or threatened with, 
persecution or serious harm, this could be a 
serious indication that persecution or harm might 
happen again. The Government also underlined 
that, in order to maintain the integrity of the 
asylum system and to deter unfounded 
applications it is important that it is able to enforce 
the return of those who are found not to be 
genuinely in need of international protection and 
who have no right to remain in the United 
Kingdom. It only enforces the return of those it is 
satisfied were not in need of protection, and the 
UK would not seek to enforce the return of Mr. 
Koimon to Cameroon unless it is satisfied it was 
safe to do so. The rationality of this decision has 
been confirmed by the independent Asylum and 
Immigration Tribunal. As with returns to all 
countries, the Home Office does not actively 
monitor the treatment of individual Cameroonian 
nationale once they have been removed from the 
United Kingdom. Had it been considered that an 
individual was likely to suffer persecution on his 
return then he would not be removed. It would 
generally be inappropriate and impractical for the </p>

page 282 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>United Kingdom to actively monitor individual 
citizens of another country once they return there. 
It is necessary to take a pragmatic approach, but 
one that certainly should not be interpreted as 
disinterest. The Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office follows the human rights situation through 
its network of posts around the world, including in 
Cameroon. It will pass to the Home Office any 
allegations that returnees have been mistreated, 
and where appropriate may be asked to make 
discreet enquiries, often through NGOs or other 
third parties. Such information will always be 
taken fully into accourt as a factor in the 
formulation of asylum policies and hence in the 
decision whether it is safe to return an individual.

is at risk of being forcibly returned to Jordan. This 
follows the decision on 26 February 2007 by the 
Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) 
to dismiss his appeal against his deportation, on 
&#8220;national security&#8221; grounds. He is expected to be

has recognised the value of Memoranda of

<p>By letter dated 10/05/07, the Government replied 
that its position on torture was clear: it rejects all 
forms of torture absolutely and without exception, 
wherever and by whomever it is committed. It 
works hard with our international partners to 
eradicate this abhorrent practice and abides 
strictly by its human rights obligations under 
international law. On 11 August 2005, the Home 
Office notified Mr. Othman that it intended to 
deport him to Jordan. Mr.Othman was entitled to 
appeal against this decision and he did so. His 
appeal was heard before the Special Immigration 
Appeals Commission (SIAC) (an independent 
Court in the UK) in May 2006. SIAC considered all 
the written and oral evidence on national security 
and on Mr. Othman's safety on return to Jordan, 
and ruled on 26 February 2007 that he presents a 
threat to the national security of the UK, and

<p>security of this country and safeguarding the 
rights of these individuals on their return. I am 
very pleased that the court has confirmed this and 
that this procedure will enable us to meet our 
international obligations.&quot; Article 3 of the 
Convention against Torture provides that no State 
party shall expel, return (refouler), or extradite a 
person to another State where there are 
substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture. 
In this regard, paragraph 9 of General Comment 
20 on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in 
which the Human Rights Committee, states that 
State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the 
danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment upon return to another 
country by way of extradition, expulsion or 
refoulement.&#8221; Furthermore, paragraph 5 of the 
Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on Human 
Rights urges States not to expel, return (refouler), 
extradite or in any other way transfer a person to 
another State where there are substantial grounds 
for believing that the person would be in danger of 
being subjected to torture. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s report of his mission to Jordan 
(A/HRC/4/33/Add.3), he concluded that in the 
General Intelligence Directorate, which is the pre-
eminent institution entrusted with counter-
terrorism activities in Jordan, torture is routinely 
practiced. Moreover, with reference to previously 
transmitted communications 
(E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.1, para. 518), he reiterated 
</p>
<p>importantly, that it would be safe to return him to 
Jordan. The evidence that the Court considered 
included the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on his 
mission to Jordan. In a lengthy and considered 
judgment, the Commission explained how it 
reached its conclusion. SIAC noted that safety of 
return of an lndividual depends on all the 
circumstances relating to him, which is a 
conclusion that the European Court of Human 
Rights (ECtHR) and SIAC have also reached in 
various other cases (see the Othman vs Secretary 
of State judgment by SIAC considering this point 
of principle). The circumstances relevant to Mr. 
Othman's case are his profile in Jordan and the 
significant media interest in any story surrounding 
him; that he will benefit from assurances in the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU); and that 
there will be independent monitoring of the 
conditions under which he is detained in Jordan 
(these circumstances are outlined further below). 
The Commission's conclusion was therefore that, 
notwithstanding the evidence on the conditions of 
detention by the General Intelligence Directorate 
(GID), Mr. Othman would be safe on return. The 
UK is not ignoring its obligations, but vigilantly 
observing them, and an independent court has 
found that deportation would be consistent with 
international obligations because of Mr. Othman's 
particular circumstances. Mr. Othman is appealing 
this judgment to the Court of Appeal. Once 
domestic remedies have been exhausted, 
Mr.Othman will also have the opportunity to bring 
a case before the ECtHR. At no stage during </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 284 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>that such memoranda of understanding do not 
provide any additional protection to deportees. 
They do not relieve the Government of its 
obligation to respect the principle of non-
refoulement under article 3 of the Convention 
against Torture. 
</p>
<p>these proceedings will Mr.Othman be deported 
until his case has been finally determined by the 
courts.   The British Government's priority is to 
protect public safety and national security. The 
British Govemment does not believe that foreign 
nationals who pose a threat to national security 
should be allowed to remain in the UK if they face 
no real risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment in their country of nationality. 
In its judgement, SIAC ruled that: &quot;the national 
security basis for deportation is well proved. There 
is no evidence that Abu Qatada's views have 
moderated nor his desire to propagate them. His 
Control Order did not remove the threat he poses. 
His deportation would further reduce the risk and 
remove his presence as an adviser and preacher 
in this country, making the lives and well being of 
those resident here safer.&quot; The British 
Govemment signed an MOU on Deportation with 
Assurances (DWA) with the Hashemite Kingdom 
of Jordan on 10 August 2005. The MOU provides 
for assurances between the two govemments that 
anyone returned under the MOU will not be 
mistreated or suffer inhuman or degrading 
treatment. The MOU also provides for a 
monitoring mechanism for those returned. 
SIAC found no justification for comments from 
some NGOs that the UK Government's efforts to 
negotiate and rely on MOUs are an attempt to 
evade the UK's international obligations. In 
addition, SIAC noted that, according to the 
jurisprudence of the ECtHR, reliance can lawfully 
be placed on diplomatic assurances; the weight to 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 285 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>be given to them depends upon the circumstances 
of each case. The UK Government will not remove 
someone where there is a real risk of torture, even 
where assurances have been given. 
Arrangements for independent monitoring provide 
an additional layer of protection. The UK is 
providing training to support the bodies appointed 
in respect of the MOU agreed to date, including in 
Jordan, and is also working on human rights 
capacity building more generally. The UK 
Government acknowledges that SIAC also 
concluded that torture does take place in Jordan 
within the GID. However, SIAC also concluded 
that the fact that the MOU had been accepted at a 
high level, and that the GID had been involved in 
negotiations at a high level, meant that the GID 
would not ignore the MOU. Mr. Othman has been 
convicted in absentia by the Jordanian courts on 
two charges, and will be retried should he return 
to Jordan. SIAC's view was that there was no real 
risk that Mr.Othman's Article 3 ECHR rights would 
be breached in the period up to the conclusion of 
a retrial. SIAC also took the view that, regardless 
of the MOU, Mr. Othman's return and subsequent 
treatment would be a matter of intense local and 
international media interest and scrutiny. If he 
were to be tortured or ill-treated, there would 
probably be a considerable outcry in Jordan, 
regardless of the MOU. SIAC concluded that the 
existence of the MOU and the monitoring. 
arrangements significantly reinforced the 
conclusion that there would be no real risk of ill-
treatment. The Government also noted the report </p>

<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to Jordan in 
June 2006 and its content which was also 
considered by SIAC in reaching its conclusion. 
The visit took place at the invitation of the 
Jordanian Government. A Jordanian spokesman 
said on 29 June 2006 that Jordan will &quot;carefully 
examine and seriously look into every allegation 
made&quot;. We also note that the Al-Jafr Prison,

characterised by wide-spread torture, killings and

</p>
<p>By letter dated 11 October 2007, the Government 
replied that, Mr. Palanivelauthan Pathmananthan 
claimed to have entered the UK illegally on 20 
April 1997. He claimed asylum on 28 April 1997. 
He was initially not interviewed about his claim on 
account of his being a minor. His asylum claim 
was refused on 28 November 2001, the decision 
being served on him on 3 January 2002. He 
appealed against this decision. A supplementary 
refusal letter containing a human rights 
consideration was served on him 27 June 2002. 
His appeal was dismissed by an independent 
immigration Adjudicator on 27 June 2003. The 
Adjudicator did not find Mr. Pathmaanthan&#8217;s 
account at all credible and did not accept that he 
was of an adverse interest to the Sri Lankan 
authorities. He accepted that Mr. Pathmananthan 
had been compelled to work for the LTTE for a 
month but on his release there was no further 
interest in him. The Adjudicator did not accept that 
Mr. Pathmananthan had been tortured. Whereas 
he had claimed that the Sri Lankan authorities had 
broken his arm with iron bars and that he had 
treated this most serious and painful injury himself 
with cream supplied by the agent rather than seek 
professional medical help even after his arrival in 
the UK. This account was simply not believed. His 
application for permission to appeal to the 
Tribunal was refused on 25 August 2003 and he 
had exhausted all available avenues of appeal on </p>

</b></p>
<p>18 September 2003. On 7 August 2006 his 
solicitors made a purported fresh application for 
asylum on Mr. Pathmananthan&#8217;s behalf. This was 
treated as further representations and rejected on 
4 July 2007. His return to Sri Lanka was set for 11 
July 2007, but was deferred by his solicitors 
making an application to the High Court of Justice 
for permission to apply for a judicial review of the 
decision to remove him from the UK. That 
application was rejected by the High Court on 24 
July 2007 as being entirely without merit and the 
judge directed that renewal of the application 
should not be a bar to removal. Mr. 
Pathmananthan&#8217;s removal was reset for 9 August 
2007, but he refused to board the aircraft and 
became so disruptive that the aircraft&#8217;s crew 
refused to take him. He will be returned to Sri 
Lanka under escort. Mr. Ratnasingham 
Suthakaran arrived in the UK at Dover on 6 
November 1999, without documents, and claimed 
asylum. His application for asylum was refused on 
5 July 2004 and his appeal was dismissed on 16 
December 2004. The Adjudicator made adverse 
findings on his credibility. At his appeal Mr. 
Suthakaran produced a medical diagnosis 
document, which stated he had symptoms of 
suffering from reactive depression, and which he 
claimed was proof that he needed medical care 
after being ill-treated by the Sri Lankan army. On 
the sole basis that the authenticity of that 
document had not been challenged the 
Adjudicator found that there was a reasonable 
likelihood that Mr. Suthakaran had on one

<p>occasion been detained by the army and tortured 
but that he had been released without further 
interest and that there was no connection with the 
LTTE. Mr. Suthakaran&#8217;s application for permission 
to appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal 
was refused on 14 March 2005. He exhausted all 
available avenues of appeal on 13 April 2005. 
Since then his solicitors have made a series of 
purported fresh asylum claims on his behalf, all of 
which have been rejected. On 14 June 2006 his 
solicitors lodged an application in the High Court 
for permission to apply for judicial review of the 
rejection of Mr. Suthakaran&#8217;s third purported fresh 
asylum claim, which was refused by the Court as 
being wholly without merit on 11 October 2006. An 
oral hearing set for 16 February 2007 was 
adjourned after the solicitors lodged a 
considerable quantity of what was said to be fresh 
material. The application was rejected at an oral 
hearing on 11 June 2007. On 28 June 2007 he 
made further submissions which were rejected on 
12 July 2007. Removal directions in place for 13 
July 2007 were deferred when his solicitors made 
another application for permission to apply for 
judicial review, which was refused on 31 July 
</p><p>2007. Removal was set for 3 August 2007, but Mr. 
Suthakaran became disruptive on board the 
aircraft and the airline removed him from the flight. 
Mr. Suthakaran was removed to Sri Lanka, under 
escort, on 9 August. As with returns to all 
countries, the Home Office does not actively 
monitor the treatment of individual Sri Lankan 
nationals once they have been removed from the </p>

<p>UK: Had it been considered that an individual was 
likely to suffer persecution on his return, then he 
would not have been removed. It would generally 
be inappropriate and impractical for the UK to 
actively monitor individual citizens of another 
country once they return there. It is necessary to 
take a pragmatic approach, but one that certainly 
should not be interpreted as disinterest. The 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office follows the 
human rights situation through its network of posts 
around the world, including Sri Lanka. It will pass 
to the Home Office any allegations that returnees 
have been mistreated, and where appropriate may 
be asked to make discreet enquiries, often 
through NGOs or other third parties. Such 
information will always be taken fully into account 
as a factor in the formulation of asylum policies 
and hence in the decision whether it is safe to 
return an individual.

<p>TOR; Yemeni national, detained at the U.S. Naval Base 
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In early January 2003, 
he was arrested in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
He was held for eight months and 16 days. For 
the first two months, he was held in an unknown 
location in or near Dubai. Thereafter, he was 
transferred to a location about a two-hour car 
drive away, believed to be the State Security 
facility in the vicinity of Dubai Airport. Here he was 
held for approximately six months before being 
transferred to United States of America military 
custody in Afghanistan, despite being told that he 
was being returned to Yemen. While in detention 
in Dubai, he was subject to: spatial disorientation, 
where his eyes and ears were covered, and a 
black bag covered his head; temporal 
disorientation by being held in complete darkness 
with no indication of the time of day; beatings with 
fists; extreme climate conditions due to frigid and 
excessive air conditioning; was kept naked for 22 
days, sometimes shackled; subject to simulated 
drowning, where black goggles were placed over 
his eyes, his arms and legs were tied together 
then lifted by a machine into a pool of cold water, 
held under water and then pulled out; he was 
threatened with rape; his genitals and buttocks 
were fondled by his captors; and he was regularly 
insulted. On or about 16 to 18 August 2003, he 
was transferred to the custody of United States 
forces and taken to Kabul, Afghanistan. He was 
held in the &#8220;Prison of Darkness&#8221; (also known as 
the Dark Prison) for nine months. He stated that 
the worst treatment he has experienced since his </p>

<p>capture occurred in this prison.  He suffered 
severe physical and psychological torture by 
Jordanian interrogators, who were supervised by 
U.S. personnel. It is reported that the torture was 
so extreme, going beyond the methods described 
above, that it prompted Mr. Al-Kazimi to attempt 
suicide three times by striking his head against 
the cell wall. As a result he sustained large visible 
scars on his scalp. Among other things, he was 
suspended with his arms above his head and 
beaten with electrical cables. On or about 16 May 
2004, he was transferred to Bagram, where he 
was held in U.S. custody for four months, and 
where he was tortured in a manner similar to that 
in the Prison of Darkness. On or about 18 
September 2004, he was transferred to 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he is currently 
detained. On the evening of 14 January 2007, it is 
reported that Mr. Al-Kazimi was &#8220;IRF&#8217;ed&#8221; (the 
acronym for beating given by Initial Reaction 
Force team &#8211; used to subdue prisoners and deal 
with discipline issues).  While he was using the 
toilet in his cell, he covered his lower body with a 
blanket, a common and accepted practice at 
Guantanamo.  On this evening, two guards, one 
female and one male, ordered him to remove the 
blanket that was covering his lower body.  Not 
wanting to expose himself to a female, Mr. Al-
Kazimi refused.  The IRF team was then 
summoned. It arrived in full riot gear, bunched 
together behind a large plastic shield, marching in 
formation, and stomping and chanting loudly.  
They marched into the cell and piled on top of him

<p>to secure his arms and legs and hold his head 
down.  Mr. Al-Kazimi did not resist.  He was 
punched, kicked, and otherwise beaten by the IRF 
team who used their shield, fists, elbows, knees, 
and boots on his face, neck, arms, torso, and 
back. He sustained multiple bruises on face, neck, 
arms, and torso, severe swelling in face and neck 
associated with the bruising, pain and soreness in 
his joints and muscles, and a painful headache. 
Two military officers (not doctors) took Mr. Al-
Kazimi&#8217;s blood pressure on the morning of 15 
January 2007. He continues to suffer 
psychological trauma, inability/unwillingness to 
discuss details of treatment/torture, has attempted 
suicide, fears reprisals and continued abuse, and 
finds himself talking to himself on a regular basis. 
Mr. Al-Kazimi suffers from chronic constipation, 
hemorrhoids, and blood in his feces since his 
detention in the Prison of Darkness.  He attributes 
this to his torture and abuse there as well as 
currently receiving a diet that is low in fiber (which 
he believes exacerbates his condition).  <b>Fahd

custody shortly thereafter in Kohat, Pakistan, and 
then transferred to Kandahar, Afghanistan, where 
he was held for two months. In detention he

<p>him with firearms, strangled him with wires, and 
shocked him with electricity. In early 2002, he was 
transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he 
is currently detained.  While in Guantanamo he 
reports that he suffered severe abuse and torture 
in the course of over 20 interrogations which were 
carried out during his first three years&#8217; of 
imprisonment.  Mr. Al-Fawzan reports that 
interrogators focused on groups of ten prisoners 
at a time for two-month periods. He no longer 
actively participates during interrogations and 
consequently U.S. personnel rarely interrogate 
him. Among the abuse he was subjected to: 
coffee, water and disinfectant were sprayed on 
him; interrogators flicked their cigarette ashes on 
him; his genitals and buttocks were fondled and 
groped by female interrogators; was forced to 
watch simulated sex acts between soldiers; 
interrogators would offer him sex with women to 
entice him to speak; was subjected to loud music 
and strobe lights for long periods of time meant to 
disturb sleep and concentration; was subdued 
with pepper spray; and frightened and intimidated 
by the use of dogs. He was subjected to simulated 
drowning, where interrogators would put a hose to 
his mouth and nose and then turn the water flow 
on full.  One interrogator would hold Mr. Al-
Fawzan&#8217;s mouth open by grabbing the tender part 
of the jaw while other soldiers would pin him to the 
ground.  The hose would then be turned on full 
and left on for approximately ten seconds.  The 
interrogators would then spray him with cold water 
from the hose before repeating the process again.

<p>Further, he received beatings from six-person 
Initial Reaction Force (&#8220;IRF&#8221;) teams during 
interrogations.  The IRF team would pile up on Mr. 
Al-Fawzan with their plastic shields, pin down his 
arms and legs and beat him with their fists and 
feet.It is reported that since the detainees were 
arrested, they were tortured for purposes of 
intimidation, coercion to extract information, and 
punishment (i.e. &#8220;IRFing&#8221;) for not complying with 
demands by U.S. personnel. It is reported that 
prisoners at Guantanamo routinely refuse to ask 
for medical treatment due to a fear that treatment 
will be withheld, or that knowledge of their medical 
condition by interrogators will be exacerbated 
during interrogations. Likewise, they refused 
medical treatment. Mr. Al-Kazimi was allowed to 
call his wife once and with his own cell phone 
during his imprisonment at the UAE state security 
headquarters. He was told to act as if everything 
was normal.  Mr. Al-Kazimi was not permitted to 
see a lawyer, relatives, or friends before his 
transfer to Guantanamo Bay.  He has not seen 
any member of his family since his arrest in early 
</p><p>2003. Mr. Al-Fawzan has not seen any member of 
his family since his departure for Afghanistan in 
October 2001.  His family only become aware of 
his imprisonment nearly two years after his 
capture and could only confirm it from 
photographs of Guantanamo Bay prisoners 
posted on the Internet. At Guantanamo, the 
detainees&#8217; lawyers have visited them five times:  
July 2006, September 2006, November 2006,

<p><b>Sameh Sami Khouzam</b>, aged 37, an Egyptian 
national, currently detained in York County Prison, 
Pennsylvania. He is at imminent risk of forcible 
return to Egypt. He arrived from Egypt at John F. 
Kennedy Airport on 11 February 1998, where he 
applied for asylum.  Wanted on a murder charge 
in Egypt, he was taken into custody upon his 
arrival. On 24 February 2004, a review of the 
decision of removal by the Board of Immigration 
Appeals by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals 
granted him relief from removal under the 
Convention Against Torture. The Court found that 
there was a substantial likelihood that he would be 
tortured if returned to Egypt. On 6 February 2006, 
the United States District Court for the District of 
New Jersey granted a petition for habeas corpus, 
and ordered his release from detention, subject to 
monthly reporting to the Department of Homeland 
Security.  On 29 May 2007, he was detained 
when he appeared for his monthly appointment.  
He was informed that diplomatic assurances had 
been received from the Government of Egypt on 
24 January 2007. The assurances were sufficient 
to ensure that he could be removed without any 
danger of torture upon his return. The Secretary of 
the Department of Homeland Security was 
thereby revoking the deferral of his removal. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 3/07/07 the Government replied 
that Mr. Khouzam arrived in the United States on 
11 February 1998 and was denied admission 
because the U.S. Department of State had 
cancelled his non-immigrant visa while he was en 
route to New York after the Government of Egypt 
notified the U.S. Embassy in Cairo that Mr. 
Khouzam was suspected of committing the brutal 
murder of Ms. Hekmat Zaki Mohammend Youssef 
just hours before leaving Egypt. U.S. immigration 
laws allow inadmissible aliens to pursue certain 
forms of relief and protection from removal. Mr. 
Khouzam has been afforded a full and fair 
opportunity to do so. Among these safeguards is 
protection based on regulations that implement 
U.S. obligations under Article 3 of the UN 
Convention Against Torture, under which the 
United States has agreed not to remove a person 
from the United States to a country in which it is 
more likely than not that the person would be 
tortured. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit, in a decision published on 24 
Feburary 2004, upheld a Board of Immigration 
Appeals (BIA) decicion finding Mr. Khouzam 
removable from the U.S., but granting him a 
deferral of removal to Egypt on the basis that it 
would be more likely than not that he would be 
tortured there, in that same 2004 opinion, based 
on credible evidence, the court of appeals also 
upheld a BIA finding that there are serious 
reasons to believe that Mr. Khouzam murdered 
Ms. Youssef. Pursuant to regulatory procedures 
that implement U.S. obligations under the

<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response

<p>Convention Against Torture (CAT) in the 
immigration context, the U.S. Department of State 
engaged in discussions and other 
communications with the Government of Egypt  
concerning the treatment that Mr. Khouzam would 
receive if he were removed to that country, in the 
course of these classified diplomatic 
communication, the Government of Egypt 
provided formal written assurances to the United 
States Government that Mr. Khouzam will not be 
tortured if he is removed to Egypt. The United 
States does not agree with the non-binding 
opinion of the Human Rights Committee that 
Article 7 of the ICCPR creates a non-refoulement 
obligation on States Parties, not does it share the 
view that diplomatic assurances are never reliable 
or effective in protecting against torture. At the 
same time, the United States does not believe that 
diplomatic assurances are appropriate in every 
case or that they would serve as a substitute for a 
case-by-case analysis of whether U.S. obligations 
under Article 3 of the CAT would be met. As the 
U.S. has previously explained, including when it 
appeared before the Committee Against Torture in 
May 2006, the U.S. employs properly tailored 
diplomatic assurances from foreign governments 
related to torture in appropriate cases. After 
careful review, the Department of State 
determined and formally conveyed its view to the 
Department of Homeland Security that the 
assurances received from the Government of 
Egypt regarding the treatment of Mr. Khouzam 
were of sufficient reliability to enable the Secretary </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 300 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>of Homelend Security to conclude that if Mr. 
Khouzam were removed to Egpyt with these 
assurances, it would not be more likely than not 
that he would be tortured. In evaluating the 
credibility of assurances of this nature, the U.S. 
Government considers, among other relevant 
information, information concerning the judicial 
and penal conditions and practices of the country 
providing assurances; political and legal 
developments in the country providing the 
assurances, the identiy and position of the official 
relaying the assurances and the ability of that 
person to speak on behalf of that government; and 
U.S. diplomatic relations with the country 
providing the assurances. In this case, the 
Department of Homeland Security agreed with the 
Department of State&#8217;s assessment and concluded 
that the assurances were sufficiently reliable to 
permit Mr. Khouzam&#8217;s removal to Egypt. The 
Secretary of Homeland Security thereby 
terminated his deferral of removal. Mr. Khouzam, 
who had been released with monitoring, was 
retaken into custody by the  Department of 
Homeland Security on 29 May 2007 for the 
purpose of effecting his removal to Egypt. Mr. 
Khouzam challenged the U.S. Government&#8217;s 
actions by means of a federal court litigation in 
both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit and the U.S. District Court for the Middle 
District of Pennsylvania. On 15 June 2007, 
Federal District Court Judge ruled to grant Mr. 
Khouzam a hearing on the question of whether 
the may be lawfully removed to Egypt to face trial

<p>  <b>135 African American men</b> (A/HRC/4/33/Add.1, 
para. 321).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>By letter dated 14/08/07, the Government replied 
that from 2002 through July 2006, allegations of 
physical abuse at Areas 2 and 3 of the Chicago 
Police Headquarters were investigated by an 
independent Special Prosecutor appointed by the 
Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the Circuit 
Court of Cook County. The Special Prosecutor 
assembled a team of attorneys and investigators 
to assist him in the on-going investigation of the 
approximately 150 allegations of abuse. After an 
exhaustive and independent inquiry, the Special 
Prosecutor presented his report on 19 July 2006. 
The report concluded that only three of the 150 
cases presented credible allegations that would 
support indictment of a handful of police officers. 
Therefore, the United States respectfully posits 
that the statement that 135 African American men 
were abused is not correct. The three cases 
identified by the Special Prosecutor as rising to 
the level of potential indictment involved 
complainants Phillip Adkins, Alfonso Pinex and 
Andrew Wilson. The specific forms of alleged 
abuse identified by the Special Rapporteur are 
also not fully supported by the factual record. 
Neither Phillip Adkins nor Alfonso Pinex alleged 
the types of physical abuse identified in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter. The Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s letter identifies 68 persons who have </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 304 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</b></p>
<p>allegedly been accused of abuse. A number of 
police officers are the subject of allegations of 
misconduct involving citizens, many of which are 
found to be not sustained or unfounded. Not all of 
the individuals identified have had allegations of 
torture made against them. We would like to note 
that investigator Michael Goldston&#8217;s report from 
1990, which the Special Rapporteur refers to, was 
found to be unreliable and methodologically 
unsound by the Police Foundation (a private 
independent organization that works to improve 
American policing and enhance the capacity of the 
criminal justice system to function effectively). Mr. 
Goldston did not interview any complainants, 
police officers or witnesses to allegations of abuse 
during his investigation, but simply reviewed old 
records, many of which were previously not 
sustained by the Office of Professional Standards 
(OPS) investigator who actually interviewed the 
individuals. (The OPS is an all-citizen 
investigatory force employed by the City of 
Chicago since the 1970s that investigates any and 
all complaints of physical abuse by Chicago police 
officers. The Special Rapporteur notes that the 
City of Chicago suspended a commander and 
instituted formal disciplinary hearings before the 
Police Board resulting in his separation from the 
Chicago Police Department in 1993. Two former 
detectives were also alleged to have been 
involved in the abuse of Andrew Wilson. The 
Police Board recommended discipline against 
them, but its findings were ultimately overturned 
on appeal to the Circuit Court of Cook County.

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.1 
page 305 
</p>
<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response

<p>The letter is also correct in asserting that Dr. John 
Raba of Cermak Health Services at the Cook 
County Jail requested that the then-
Superintendent of the Chicago Police Deparment 
investigat the allegations of abuse made  by 
Andrew Wilson. The letter fails to mention that a 
complaint register investigation was opened by 
OPS with respect to Andrew Wilson, but it was 
closed in 1985 and found to be not sustained 
based on Andrew Wilson&#8217;s unwillingness to 
cooperate with OPS. Dr. Raba&#8217;s letter was 
forwarded to the former State Attorney and action 
was taken. The letter was provided to the head of 
the Special Prosecutions Unit of the Cook County 
State&#8217;s Attorney&#8217;s office with the specific 
responsibility to investigate allegations of 
misconduct by the Chicago police officers. Dr. 
Raba&#8217;s letter was also forwarded to the Assistant 
State&#8217;s Attorney who prosecuted Andrew Wilson. 
As he did with OPS, Andrew Wilson refused to 
cooperate with the Special Prosecutions Unit of 
the Cook County State&#8217;s Attorney&#8217;s office. The 
U.S. Department of Justice currently has the 
matter open and is reviewing the Special 
Prosecutor&#8217;s report and will review any additional 
information regarding the mistreatment of persons 
by those who are acting under the color of law. 
There are several pending civil suits in the U.S. 
District Court for the Notrthern District of Illinois 
arising from allegations of physical abuse at Area 
</p><p>2. Those cases include Madison Hebley v. Burge 
et al., 03 C 3678, Aaron Patterson v. Burge et al., 
03 C 4433, Stanley Howard v. City et al., 03 C </p>

</b></p>
<p>8481, Leroy Orange v. Burge et al., 04 C 168, and 
Darrel Cannon v. Burge et al., 05 C 2192. As 
stated above, in the three cases the Special 
Prosecutor found to support an indictment, he also 
found that prosecution of the officers in these 
three cases is barred by the statute of limitations. 
The Illinois statute of limitations bars initiating 
prosecution of felonies more than three years after 
the commission of the crime.  Thus no offenses 
alleged to have been committed by police officers 
under the command of the above commander can 
be prosecuted. The investigation of the 
commander by the Civil Rights Section of the U.S. 
Department of Justice was closed as of December 
2001 because of the statute of limitations. The 
case of Shadeed Mumin and the case of Andrew 
Wilson were reopened by the Department of 
Justice, and on 18 May 1993 prosecution was 
again declined because of the statute of 
limitations. The UN Committee Against Torture 
has called upon some States Parties to remove 
statutes of limitations for the crime of torture. In 
February 2007, Illinois passed a new law relating 
to the issue of statutes of limitations in regard to 
police mistreatment of prisoners. Public Law 094-
1113 (the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2006) states 
that &#8220;if the compelling of a confession or 
information by imminent bodily harm of threat of 
imminent bodily harm results in whole or in part in 
a criminal prosecution of the plaintiff, the 2-year 
period set out in this Section shall be tolled during 
the time in which the plaintiff is incarcerated, or 
until criminal prosecution has been finally

<p>adjudicated in favour of the above referred 
plaintiff, which ever is later.&#8221; The law, which will go 
into effect on 1 January 2008 will also provide 
enhanced civil remedies for victims and boost the 
penalty for authorities convicted of inflicting bodily 
or great bodily harm (or threatening such har) to 
obtain a confession. The statement that 24 
individuals are currently serving prison terms on 
the basis of confessions that may have been 
obtained by torture or ill-treatment is incorrect. 
None of the individuals identified by the Special 
Rapporteur were found by the Special Prosecutor 
to have made credible allegations supporting an 
indictment of any Chicago police officer, and many 
of the identified individuals, allegations were found 
by the Special Prosecutor to be unreliable, not 
credible, inconsistent or otherwise 
uncorroborated. Further, the defendant&#8217;s 
confessions were not necessary for the 
convictions obtained. For example, with respect to 
Reginald Mahaffey, the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Seventh Circuit stated that, &#8220;even disregarding 
Mahaffey&#8217;s confession, the state presented 
powerful evidence at trial of his guilt.&#8221; Similarly, 
Leonard Hinton is incarcerated upon substantial 
evidence other than his confession; the Seventh 
Circuit concluded that &#8220;the trial court would have 
convicted (Hinton) even if the confession were not 
introduced at trial due to the wealth of other 
corroborating evidence that the State produced 
which established Hinton&#8217;s guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt.&#8221; We also note that Andrew 
Wilson&#8217;s conviction was likewise obtained without </p>

<p>the use of the confession he provided to 
detectives at Area 2. Over the past two decades 
the U.S. Department of Justice has opened and 
closed several cases relating to this matter. As 
previously stated, the U.S. Department of Justice 
currently has the matter open for review but 
cannot release any further details about its 
investigation. The U.S. would like to emphasize 
that its law continues to provide strict rules 
regarding the exclusion of coerced statements 
and the inadmissibility of illegally obtained 
evidence in criminal trials. The Fifth Amendment 
to the U.S. Constitution not only bars the 
government from calling the defendant as a 
witness at his trial, but also from taking statements 
from the accused against the accused&#8217;s will. If a 
defendant confesses, he may seek to exclude the 
confession from trial by alleging that it was 
involuntary. The court will conduct a factual inquiry 
into the circumstances surrounding the confession 
to determine if law enforcement officers acted in a 
way to pressure or coerce the defendant into 
confessing and, if so, whether the defendant 
lacked a capacity to resist pressure. See Colorado 
v. Connelly, 479 U.S: 157 (198). Physical coercion 
will render a confession involuntary. See Brown v. 
Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936). In addition, the 
laws of the State of Illinois and the United States 
provide opportunities for the identified individuals 
to challenge their convictions. Among other things, 
the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILSC 
5/1-122 et seq., is available to all of the identified 
individuals. Thirteen of the individuals have

<p>availed themselves of the opportunities provided 
to make their allegations under the Post-
Conviction Hearing Act. After exhausting state 
court remedies, these individuals have the 
additional opportunity to seek a writ of habeas 
corpus in the federal district court. All pending 
post-conviction matters involving allegations of 
abuse at Area 2 are being handled and responded 
to by the Attorney General of the State of Illinois. 
The identified individuals could also request 
executive clemency from the Governor of the 
State of Illinois.

claims, personnel of the relevant law enforcement

Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of

was never once subjected to solitary confinement 
in the punishment cell (the regulations of the 
Central Penal Correction Department of the

inmates who were also being subjected to 
disciplinary measures for violating the prison&#8217;s 
custodial system. An investigation conducted by 
the Navoi procurator&#8217;s office relating to the 
supervision of the observance of laws in places of 
deprivation of liberty found that the disciplinary 
measures taken against Mr. Umarov were 
justified. During the time that Mr. Umarov was

was unable to walk for several days. He was also 
subjected to a method called &#8220;Northern Aurora&#8221;, 
which means hitting somebody hard on his head

eight years in prison. She is currently being 
detained at Tashkent Prison.  Ms. Tadjibaeva 
spent seven months in solitary confinement and 
was held in a psychiatric unit for mentally ill and

shall be guaranteed immunity of domicile. No one 
may enter a dwelling place, carry out a search or

the rights and freedoms of citizens proclaimed by 
the Constitution and laws of Uzbekistan. Everyone 
shall be entitled to judicial defence of his rights

&quot;On citizens' applications&quot;, citizens have the right 
to appeal to competent bodies in order to protect 
legitimate rights and interests, and also to restore

legislations of Uzbekistan make provisions for 
relevant punishment against unreasonable refusal

term of consideration of an application without a 
valid excuse, adoption of a decision contradicting 
the law and consequently causing essential harm

Despite this, some citizens, pretending to be 
victims of alleged violations by state bodies, 
refuse to submit applications to such institutions 
and instead target the attraction of attention of 
international human rights or other organizations 
to themselves. Thus, they pursue a political 
purpose to cause a wave of criticism against 
Uzbekistan. In this regard the Special Procedures 
mechanisms are advised to inform their sources of 
allegations on violations, and consequently Ms.

the convicted offender M. Seitkarimov has not 
complained to the prison administration about the 
use of illegal forms of treatment against him by

serious crime, and for an amount over 600g, the

convictions and offences tried by courts of the 
United Kingdom upon various types of crimes. 
During the investigation and trial on Luong in Viet 
Nam, he played many cunning tricks against the 
concerned agencies, inter alia, he pretended to be 
suffering from mental sickness, with a view to 
avoiding criminal responsibilities. The 
investigation agency sent Luong to the Central 
Council of Mental Medical Jurisprudence for 
examination. The results were negative and 
showed he had full civil capacity to carry out his 
criminal responsibilities. During the time he was 
monitored and examined, he was able to 
communicate with his family members, bribe 
cadres of the concerned agencies and the Central 
Council, and organize his escape from the Central 
Institute of Mental Health. This demonstrates that 
Luong was not mad at all; he was fully able to be 
aware of and control his behaviour. The trial on 
the above-mentioned individuals was totally lawful 
and in full accordance with criminal procedures 
recognized by the international community. The 
trial was attended by representatives of the British 
Consulate because a few offenders held British 
passports (like Le Manh Luong). The Government 
is of the view that the application of the death 
penalty must be based on the specific conditions 
of each country. In Viet Nam, it is necessary to 
maintain the death penalty on persons who 
commit to extremely dangerous crimes. The death 
penalty is a necessary and effective deterrence to 
crimes.

<p>On 11 March 2007 police arrested around 50 
opposition activists in connection with a &#8220;prayer 
meeting&#8221; organized by the &quot;Save Zimbabwe 
Campaign&quot; of Harare, which was declared illegal. 
Police had imposed a temporary ban on rallies 
and demonstrations on the basis of section 24 of 
the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). As 
citizens approached the sports field where the 
meeting was to be held on 11 March 2007, riot 
police forcefully blocked the entrance to the 
grounds and fired tear gas onto the crowds. <b>Gift 
Tandare</b>, the Youth Chairperson of the National 
Constitutional Assembly (NCA) was shot dead.  
On 11 March 2007, various leaders and members

but was himself assaulted for seeking to protect 
their rights. All the above detainees were released 
following the order of the High Court on 12 March, 
to allow the arrested opposition leaders to be 
seen by medical doctors and their lawyers, to be 
brought to court by 12 p.m. on 13 March.  Several 
participants of the meeting are said to have 
sustained injuries following excessive use of force 
by riot police, in their attempt to disperse the 
demonstrators. Moreover, arrests have been 
reported in Masvingo and in Mutare, where 125 
activists of the opposition have been picked up. In 
addition, student leaders at the University of

<p>On 29 March 2007, <b>Edward Chikombo</b>, a 
cameraman for the state broadcaster Zimbabwe 
Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), was abducted 
by armed men from his home in a township 
outside the capital Harare.  His body was found a 
few days later, in bushes 50 miles west of Harare. 
Mr. Chikombo was a sympathizer of the 
opposition Movement for Democratic Change 
(MDC) and his murder could be linked to the 
dissemination, out of Zimbabwe, of television 
images of the opposition leader Morgan 
Tsvangirai after he was beaten up by police on 11 
March. On 1 April 2007, police arrested Mr. <b>Gift

that the Zimbabwe Republic Police is not aware of 
any beatings on Gift Phiri while he was in police 
custody or the motive for the alleged kidnapping 
and subsequent death of Edward Chikomba. 
Regarding Gift Phiri, he is a stringer for a weekly 
newspaper, &#8220;The Zimbabwean.&#8221; Gift Phiri was 
practicing journalism without having been 
accredited by the Media and Information 
Commission, which is a statutory requirement 
under the Access to Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act, Chapter 10:27, for all practicing 
journalists. On 1 April 2007, he was arrested and </p>

Zimbabwean and beat him severely while in 
detention. On 5 April, he was released on bail, 
and immediately hospitalized for treatment. He 
has been charged with &#8220;practicing as a journalist 
without accreditation and publishing false news&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>detained by the police. At no time was he 
assaulted while in police custody. On 5 April, he 
was taken to court where he was remanded out of 
custody to June 4. While in court, Gift Phiri never 
raised any allegations of assault by the police 
while in custody. It is custom in Zimbabwe that all 
suspects brought to court are asked by the 
presiding magistrate if they have any complaints 
against the police or about their treatment while in 
custody. If such complaints had been raised at 
this stage, the magistrate would have, as is the 
norm, ordered that an investigation into the 
allegations be looked into before the case the 
suspect is facing goes to for trial. He last 
appeared in court on 4 June and the case was 
remanded to 9 July for trial. Regarding Edward 
Chikomba, at the time of his alleged kidnapping 
and subsequent death, he was not a cameraman 
for the state broadcaster (Zimbabwe Broadcasting 
Corporation) as was alleged. He was retrenched 
together with others during the retrenchment 
exercise carried out by the ZBC in 2001. The 
circumstances of his disappearance are that on 29 
March 2007, at around 6 p.m., it is alleged that Mr. 
Chikomba was bundled into an Isuzu twin cab as 
he was about to get to his house. Four men are 
said to have been involved in the abduction. The 
truck is said to have driven at high speed towards 
the city centre of Harare. On the same day his 
relatives who indicated that they had heard him 
shouting for help as he was taken away made a 
report at Glenview Police Station. The police 
opened a kidnapping docket. On 1 April, his body

<p>Members of the <b>Women and Men of Zimbabwe 
Association</b> (WOZA-MOZA).On 6 June 2007, 
around 200 members of the Women and Men of 
Zimbabwe Association (WOZA-MOZA) undertook 
a silent and peaceful march through the city of 
Bulawayo to launch a document entitled &quot;Ten 
steps to a new Zimbabwe&#8221;. The Association was 
also expressing its concern that Zimbabwean civil 
society was excluded from the ongoing dialogue 
initiated by the Movement for Democratic Change 
(MDC) and mediated by South African President 
Thabo Mbeki, creating the danger that pertinent 
issues on civil, political, economic and social 
rights and democracy would be given not enough 
attention. After having walked one block, one 
group of participants was violently dispersed by 
the riot police . Five WOZA members, namely Ms. 
<b>Rosemary Sibiza</b>, Ms. <b>Angeline Karuru</b>, Ms. 
<b>Martha Ncube</b>, Ms. <b>Sangeliso Dhlamini</b> and Ms. 
<b>Pretty Moyo</b>, were badly beaten with baton 
sticks, arrested and detained at Bulawayo Central 
Police Station. Upon hearing that five of their 
colleagues had been beaten, another group of 
women went to the police station. The police 
officers then assaulted the women, before 
arresting Ms. <b>Jenni Williams</b>, WOZA National 
</p>
<p>By letters dated 19/06/07 and 4/09/07, the 
Government informed that this is not the first time 
that the Woman of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) has 
deliberately violated the laws of Zimbabwe with 
the sole intention of attracting the attention of 
human rights groups. Similar allegations have 
been raised and responded to before. Laws are 
put in place to regulate human behaviour in the 
absence of which would be chaos and a 
breakdown in law and order. Such laws are not 
unique to Zimbabwe, but are also found in most 
other countries including those which claim to be 
first democracies. For as long as a section of the 
society makes it its prime concern activity to 
violate the laws of the country, the police as 
custodians of the law will not tire in enforcing such 
laws, even if they are deemed to be unpopular. 
The police is fully commited in the observance of 
human rights. Courses on human rights are part of 
the teaching curriculum. On 6 June 2007, a group 
of about 30 members of WOZA converged at the 
Bulawayo city centre with the intention to hold an 
illegal demonstration. At about 11:30am the group 
started to march along George Silundika Street 
between 8th and 9th Avenue. They were waving 
placards denouncing the President of South </p>

another WOZA leader. Following the arrest of the 
WOZA women, attorney Kossam Ncube went to 
the police station to represent them. At the police 
station, superintendent accused him of being 
&#8220;unethical&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and stated that 
lawyers had no business at the police station as 
he sought to speak to his clients. He also ordered 
Mr. Ncube to leave and pushed him out of the 
station. On 7 June 2007, Mr. Ncube tried again to 
meet with his clients but was denied access by 
the police. 
</p>
<p>Africa, Thabo Mbeki&#8217;s mediation in Zimbabwe. 
The police ordered the demonstrators to disperse 
and five members who defied the order were 
arrested. Those arrested were Sizimisele Ndlovu, 
aged 23, Samkeliso Dlamini, aged 38, Angeline 
Karuru, aged 25, Rosemary Siziba, aged 43, and 
Martha Ncube, aged 47. They were taken to the 
police station. Meanwhile another group of WOZA 
members numbering about 25 and led by 
Jennipher Williams and Magodonga Mhlanga 
regrouped and marched towards Central Police 
Station, where they staged a demonstration in 
solidarity with their arrested colleagues. This 
group was also ordered to disperse by the Officer 
in Charge of the police station. They did not hand 
themselves over as alleged in some circles. While 
at the station, they were allowed access to their 
lawyers Cossam Ncube and Caca Phulu of 
Goglan and Welsh legal practitioners. Ironically, 
the said lawyers are reported to have arrived at 
the police station and sought to see their clients 
well before the arrest of their clients. At no stage 
were the accused denied access to their lawyers. 
The first group of five accused persons were 
charged in relation to criminal nuisance, taken to 
court on 8 June, remanded out of custody to 21 
June on $100,000. Jennipher Williams and 
Magodonga Mhlanga were charged with 
participating in an unlawful demonstration and 
criminal nuisance. They were released on 
$100,000 bail and will appear in court on 22 June

<p>288.  20/07/07 JAL HRD; TOR <b>Beloved Chiweshe</b>,<b> </b>the Secretary-General of the 
Zimbabwe National Students&#8217; Union (ZINASU), 
and <b>Munjodzi Mutandiri</b>, former President of 
Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) 
Students&#8217; Union. On 26 June 2007, at 
approximately 6 p.m., they were driving to 
Sotherton when their car was intercepted by 
police who ordered them to go to Sotherton Police 
Station. At the police station, Mr. Chiweshe and 
Mr. Mutandiri were identified as having appeared 
on a list of activists currently being sought by the 
Government. They were questioned as to the 
whereabouts of other known activists. Mr. 
Chiweshe and Mr. Mutandiri were then forced 
onto a truck and brought to a sewer discharge 
river where they were instructed to drink the 
sewer water and perform 83 press-ups in honour 
of President Mugabe&#8217;s age and 27 to represent 
Zimbabwe&#8217;s national sovereignty. Mr. Mutandiri 
collapsed as a result. After taking their belongings, 
including their clothes, mobile phones and money, 
the police left them in the river where they were 
found two hours later. The two are currently 
receiving medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 10/12/07, the Government 
informed that the police does not have any record 
of this matter. It is puzzling that academics at the 
highest institutions of learning would sink so low 
as to fail to know that if they are assaulted, ill-
treated or handled in any manner that constitutes 
an offence in a democratic country such as 
Zimbabwe, the first port of call would be a police 
station where such threats are reported and 
investigations instituted. True the perpetrators of 
the alleged assault could have been police officers 
from Southerton as alleged, but Southerton is not 
the only police station in the country. They should 
have made a report immediately or any time after 
the alleged ill-treatment. Given that the two were 
so ignorant of this fact, by virtue of their level of 
education should at least have been brave 
enough to consult other members of the student 
fraternity, as to the way forward when face with 
such a situation. Therefore, it is puzzling that 
learned people of the caliber of Mr. Chiweshe and 
Mr. Mutandiri want to blame the police or the 
Government of inaction when it is clear that no 
report of the alleged treatment was ever made to 
the police, an institution that has the sole duty of 
investigating all cases brought before it. One 
would not be amiss in concluding that the 
allegations are completely false and only meant to 
tarnish the image of the Government and its 
various arms like the police. In the absence of an 
official report there is little the police can do to 
investigate the allegations.
