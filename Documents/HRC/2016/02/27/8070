<p><b> II. Definition and scope 
</b></p>
<p>7. The right to solidarity is a human right by virtue of which every human person and 
all peoples are entitled to enjoy equally the benefit of a harmonious international society 
with a just and fair international political and economic order, in which all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms may be fully realized. 
</p>
<p>8. All peoples and human beings, without distinction as to race, colour, sex, sexual 
orientation, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, family, economic or social status, 
level of education or political or other conviction, should have the right to live in dignity 
and freedom and to enjoy the right to international solidarity and should, on their part, 
contribute to it. 
</p>
<p>9. International solidarity is not limited to international assistance and cooperation, aid, 
charity or humanitarian assistance; it is a broader concept and principle that includes 
sustainability and equal respect for all sovereign States and peoples in international 
relations, especially international economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all 
members of the international community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of 
benefits and burdens, the right of peoples to peace and the preservation of ecological 
systems. </p>


<p>10. The promotion of international solidarity is a duty common to all peoples and States. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. Both international law and international human rights law uphold international 
solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Charter of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>12. The concept of solidarity has defined the core purpose of the United Nations since 
its creation, which drew the peoples and nations of the world together to promote peace, 
human rights and social and economic development. It is in the spirit of solidarity, unity 
and harmony that the Organization is determined &#8220;to achieve international co-operation in 
solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, 
and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms 
for all&#8221; (Art. 1-3), and &#8220;to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in attainment 
of these common ends&#8221; (Arts.1-4).1 
</p>
<p><b> B. Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 
</b></p>
<p>13. The fundamental value of solidarity is explicitly expressed in the preamble to the 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action: 
</p>
<p>Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the 
aspirations of all the peoples for an international order based on the principle 
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, including promoting and 
encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect 
for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, peace, 
democracy, justice, equality, rule of law, pluralism, development, better standards of 
living and solidarity, 
</p>
<p>Determined to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international 
community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights 
endeavours by an increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and 
solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Millennium Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>14. In the Millennium Declaration, the General Assembly reaffirmed certain 
fundamental values and principles essential to international relations in the twenty-first 
century, including &#8220;a collective responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity, 
equality and equity at the global level&#8221;, and the principle of international solidarity, stating 
that &#8220;global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs and burdens 
fairly in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice. Those who suffer or 
who benefit least deserve help from those who benefit most.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>  
 1  See also the reference made in Article 55 of the Charter. </p>


<p><b> D. International Human Solidarity Day  
</b></p>
<p>15. In its resolution 60/209, the General Assembly recalled that, in the Millennium 
Declaration, the Heads of State and Government, inter alia, identified solidarity as one of 
the fundamental and universal values that should underlie relations between peoples in the 
twenty-first century, and in that regard decided to proclaim 20 December of each year 
International Human Solidarity Day.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Value and importance of the right to international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>16. Solidarity stems from the shared value of all human beings by expressing mutual 
concern for the well-being of others. 
</p>
<p>17. Solidarity is a conscientious response to the suffering of others. The goal is not just 
to alleviate suffering but to remove the obstacles or burdens that exclude others from 
participating in and enjoying the fundamental rights to which all human beings are entitled. 
</p>
<p>18. Solidarity among Governments and peoples has pivotal importance for the 
realization of the goals of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>19.  The principle of international solidarity is indispensable to meet the common 
challenges of humankind in the contemporary world, and requires States to act with 
common but differentiated responsibilities, taking into account their historical advantages 
and contributions to the challenges facing humanity. 
</p>
<p>20. In the light of the interdependence among people throughout the world, there is a 
need to establish new, equitable and global links of partnership and intra-generational 
solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind. 
</p>
<p>21. In an era of globalization, circumstances are often beyond the control of individual 
States. Collective efforts and international solidarity are the precondition to realize the 
common goals of mankind, such as: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Maintaining sustained international peace, and peace within States 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Responses to regional conflicts 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sustainable development 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Combating international terrorism and extremists 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The eradication of poverty 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protecting the common environment and combating natural and man-made disasters  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Responses to global economic and financial crises 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Combating HIV/AIDS and other serious diseases 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Responses to international emergencies 
</p>
<p><b> V. Basic guidelines

<p>22. Basic guidelines could address: 
</p>

</p>
<p>(c) Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States; </p>


<p>(d) The permanent sovereignty of each nation over its own natural wealth and 
resources; 
</p>
<p>(e)  The right and the responsibility of each State and, as far as they are 
concerned, each nation and people to determine freely their own objectives of social 
development, to set their own priorities and to decide, in conformity with the principles of 
the Charter of the United Nations, the means and methods of their achievement, without 
any external interference; 
</p>
<p>(f) Peaceful coexistence, peace, friendly relations and cooperation among States, 
irrespective of differences in their social, economic or political systems; 
</p>
<p>(g) The peaceful settlement of international disputes without resorting to or 
threatening the use of force; 
</p>
<p>(h) Harmonious coexistence and progressive advancement of all civilizations and 
religions. 
</p>

political will and commitment for the complete fulfilment of the purposes and principles of 
the Charter of the United Nations in a true spirit of solidarity and harmony.

all human rights and social justice globally; 
</p>

development and the elimination of obstacles to development, as well as the attainment of 
the Millennium Development Goals; 
</p>
<p> (e) The elimination of all forms of discrimination, such as discrimination against 
indigenous peoples, minorities, migrant workers, children, the aged and people with 
disabilities, and, in particular, discrimination against women, and gender equality in all 
aspects of human endeavours; 
</p>
<p> (f) The elimination of poverty and the assurance of a steady improvement in

<p> (l) The adoption of effective measures, at both the regional and international 
levels, to combat transnational crime and crimes against humanity, to bring to justice those

</p>
<p>25. Transnational corporations should play a vital role in exploiting the resources of 
developing countries in an honest manner, without plundering those countries. 
</p>
<p>26. Land grabbing by States and non-State actors should be stopped where the interests 
of the local population, especially small farmers, are disregarded. 
</p>
<p>27. Business enterprises have a major role to play in promoting international solidarity 
by not pursuing the objective of making profits at all costs. 
</p>
<p>28. Aid should not be granted with any conditionality, for example, where it is attached 
to an obligation to purchase expensive equipment from the donor country or to employ the 
services of highly-paid consultants. 
</p>
<p>29. Non-governmental organizations play a crucial role in promoting international 
solidarity by mobilizing public opinion and carrying out studies. 
</p>
<p>30. States should mobilize public opinion, at both the national and international levels, 
in support of the principles and objectives of international solidarity, mainly through 
education and human rights education. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Implementation measures and methods

interdependence
