Financing for the P-51 platform
(Rio de Janeiro, December 2, 2005). – PETRÓLEO BRASILEIRO S/A - PETROBRAS,
[Bovespa: PETR3/PETR4, NYSE: PBR/PBRA, Latibex: XPBR/XPBRA], a Brazilian international
energy company, announces that will be signed on Monday, 5 December, the contract for the
funding of US$ 402 million for the Brazilian content of the P-51 semi-submersible platform, which
is being built in Brazil. This has been granted by the National Bank for Economic and Social
Development (BNDES) to its subsidiary Petrobras Netherlands B.V.
The financing will be amortized over 10 years after the end of the construction period of the
platform, which is scheduled for the last quarter of 2007.
The construction of the platform is being performed through three contracts: Engineering, Supply
and Construction with the consortium FELS SETAL/TECHNIP; Construction and Assembly of
the motor-compressors with Nuovo Pignone; and Construction and Assembly of the turbo-
generators with Rolls Royce. These three contracts amount to approximately US$ 810 million.
The P-51 will be one of the company platforms with the largest processing capacity. It will
produce 180,000 barrels of petroleum daily, in the Marlim Sul Field in the Campos Basin, with
operations due to start in 2008. The P-51 construction project estimates a global minimum
national content, including assets and services, of 60% and a minimum assets content of 40%.
The BNDES financing is the main source of funds for the P-51 construction. At the same time
there are others credit lines, already agreed, with Banco BNP Paribas, guaranteed by the credit
agencies for European exports and with the Nordic Investment Bank, for the funding of the
imported equipment for the platform. BNP Paribas will also be the mandatory financing bank of
BNDES.
The Marlim Sul Field was discovered in November 1987 and is located approximately 120
kilometers off shore the north of the state of Rio de Janeiro, in water depths ranging from 850 to
2,400 meters and covering an area of about 600 km2 . The current development concept for the
field comprises four production stages, known as Modules 1, 2, 3 and 4. Module 2 includes the
installation of the P-51 in a water depth of 1,250 meters. The flow of the oil will be realized by an
oil pipeline to a fixed platform in shallow waters, the Rebombeio Autônoma Platform 1 (PRA-1);
an oil pipeline to the P-38 platform (a Floating Storage and Offloading vessel), located in the
Marlim Sul Field; and an oil pipeline to the FPSO-MLS (a Floating Production Storage and
Offloading vessel), also situated in the Marlim Sul Field. The gas produced will flow to land using
two gas pipelines: one from P-51 to the P-40 platform, located in the Marlim Sul Field; and one
from P-51 to the gas pipeline in the Barracuda Field.
Currently, the Marlim Sul Field has 57 wells in production and 42 Injectors. The production peak
of 390,000 bpd should occur in 2013. The average oil production in 2004 was 179,000 bpd.
Since the entry into operation of the P-43 and P-48 platforms, Petrobras is close to national self-
sufficiency in petroleum. The average in 2005 should reach 1,700,000 barrels per day for a
demand of approximately 1,800,000 barrels. By the first half of 2006, Petrobras crude oil
roduction should equal or even surpass the levels of internal consumption, with an average
annual forecast of 1,910,000 barrels per day.
This level will be sustainable and will rise due to the entry into operation of the P-51 and the 35
other major projects that the company has in its portfolio. These will allow annual increases in
production, arriving at 2,300,000 barrels in 2010, without taking into account any future
discoveries.
