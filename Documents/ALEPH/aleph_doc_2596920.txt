\ﬁtol E&P Limited ("Vital") completed on 21 August 2015, resultinginihejointventure being classlﬂedas a non 7
current asset held for sale and remeasured to {a i r valueless costoidi sposal.

and tubulars, cernenti ng and casingaccessories a rid drillingtools with a n origina l costofapproxirna tel y US$1.1
million, The Company is considering the sale of the oil field equipment or its deployment into the field. The

On 15 June 2016 a proposed transaction with Clipfort Ltd 8V ("CIipfort") was terminated, The Company was
disappointed thatthe transaction did notproceed as signiﬁcanttime, effort and resources ha d been allocated to
this opportunity however, as the Company was unable to complete due diligence nor other transaction related
matters to its satisfaction,the parties agreed to terminate the Heads of Terms.

AZONTO PETROLEUM LIMITED— HALF YEAR REPORT
The reduction in the Company’s operating activities during 2015 including the Vloco disposal, an employee
redundancy programme and the closure of the London operating office late in thevear has led to a slgniﬁca nt
fail in the Company’s administrative expenses in the six months to 2015 compared to 2015. Administrative
expenses for the six months to 30 June 2016 were $1,054,495 (2015: $5,398,349) net ofexpenses recovered
from parmers or capitalised of nil (2015:51,620,455)1Within the gross expenses total employeeand director
compensation expense, excluding share-based payments, was $351,046 (2015: $2,749,222), and other general
administrative costs were $610,685 (2015: $3,193,453).The 2015 expense also includes $391,312 Dfadd i ti onal
costs associated with the Cl i pforttransaction.
In the six month period to 30 June 2016 share based payments were $92,760 (2015:5551,967). The lower share
based expense is dueto the timing of share option awards and performance rights granted to employees.The
expense is also higher in both periods due to the Impact of the redundancy programme which accelerated the
timing of the expense but does not affect the Company’s cash flow.

The gain on settlement of Iia bliities for the six month period to 30 June 2016 was nil (2015: $345,658). The gain
in 2015 principally related to the settlement of outstanding liabilities from the disposal of 65% ofVioco in
November 2013 at amounts lower this n originally provided.

The foreign currency loss for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was $148,686 (2015: gain $243,699). The
movement is due to the strengthening ofthe Australian dollardurlngthe period affectingthe cash balances held
in US dollars.

The net loss before tax was $1,179,801 (2015: $35,318,728i and the net loss after tax was $1,181,375 (2015:

We have reviewed the accompanying halfeyear financiai report of Azonto Petroleum Limited, which
comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity and the consolidated statement of cash fiows for the half-year ended on that date, notes
comprising a statement of accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors‘
declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the

Directors' Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor‘s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether,
on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe
that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving
a true and fair view of the consolidated entity's financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Azonto Petroleum
Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the
annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opiniont
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which
has been given to the directors of Azonto Petroleum Limited, would be in the same terms if given to
the directors as at the time of this auditor’s review report.
