<p><b>  Report of the independent international 
commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
Republic</b>*  ** 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic has reached new levels of brutality. In the 
present report, the commission of inquiry documents, for the first time, the systematic 
imposition of sieges, the use of chemical agents and cases of forcible displacement. War 
crimes, crimes against humanity and gross human rights violations continue apace. Referral 
to justice remains paramount. 
</p>
<p> The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/24, 
covers the period from 15 January to 15 May 2013. The findings are based on 430 
interviews and other collected evidence. 
</p>
<p> Government forces and affiliated militia have committed murder, torture, rape, 
forcible displacement, enforced disappearance and other inhumane acts. Many of these 
crimes were perpetrated as part of widespread or systematic attacks against civilian 
populations and constitute crimes against humanity. War crimes and gross violations of 
international human rights law &#8211; including summary execution, arbitrary arrest and 
detention, unlawful attack, attacking protected objects, and pillaging and destruction of 
property &#8211; have also been committed. The tragedy of 4.25 million internally displaced 
persons in the Syrian Arab Republic is compounded by recent incidents of these persons 
being targeted and forcibly displaced. 
</p>
<p> Anti-government armed groups have also committed war crimes, including murder, 
sentencing and execution without due process, torture, hostage-taking and pillage. They 
continue to endanger the civilian population by positioning military objectives in civilian 
</p>
<p>  
 * The annexes to the present report are circulated as received, in the language of submission 
</p>
<p>only. 
 ** The present report was prepared pursuant to an ad hoc request of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>made at its twenty-second session, and was therefore submitted after the deadline for 
regular documentation. 
</p>

<p>areas. The violations and abuses committed by anti-government armed groups did not, 
however, reach the intensity and scale of those committed by government forces and 
affiliated militia. 
</p>
<p> There are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical agents have been used as 
weapons. The precise agents, delivery systems or perpetrators could not be identified. 
</p>
<p> The parties to the conflict are using dangerous rhetoric that enflames sectarian 
tensions and risks inciting mass, indiscriminate violence, particularly against vulnerable 
communities. 
</p>
<p> War crimes and crimes against humanity have become a daily reality in the country, 
where the harrowing accounts of victims have seared themselves onto the conscience of the 
members of the commission. 
</p>
<p> There is a human cost to the increased availability of weapons. Transfers of arms 
heighten the risk of violations, leading to more civilian deaths and injuries. 
</p>
<p> A diplomatic surge is the only path to a political settlement. Negotiations must be 
inclusive and represent all facets of the cultural mosaic making up the Syrian Arab 
Republic.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1.  As the violence escalates in the Syrian Arab Republic, harrowing accounts of 
victims continue to sear themselves on the conscience of the international community. It is 
urgent to de-escalate the conflict and curtail the flow of weapons to allow diplomacy to end 
the violence. 
</p>
<p>2.  In the present report, the independent international commission of inquiry on the 
Syrian Arab Republic1 sets out its findings based on investigations of incidents occurring 
between 15 January and 15 May 2013.  
</p>
<p>3.  For information on the interpretation of the commission&#8217;s mandate and its working 
methods, and its factual and legal findings concerning events in the Syrian Arab Republic 
between March 2011 and 15 January 2013, reference should be made to the previous 
reports of the commission.2  
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>4.  Lack of access to the country continued to hamper the commission&#8217;s ability to fulfil 
its mandate.  
</p>
<p>5.  On 28 March 2013, the commission addressed a letter to the Permanent Mission of 
the Syrian Arab Republic in which it reiterated its request for access to the country to seek 
information with regard to five specific incidents (see annex I). No response was received. 
Since October 2012, all requests for meetings with the Permanent Representative of the 
Syrian Arab Republic in Geneva have been unsuccessful.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>6.  The methodology employed was based on the standard practices of commissions of 
inquiry and human rights investigations, as noted in previous reports. 
</p>
<p>7.  The commission relied primarily on first-hand accounts to corroborate incidents. 
The present report was based on 430 interviews conducted in the region and from Geneva, 
including via Skype and telephone with victims and witnesses inside the country. The 
number of interviews conducted since the mandate began in September 2011 stands at 
1,630. 
</p>
<p>8.  Photographs, video recordings, satellite imagery and medical records were collected. 
Reports from Governments and non-governmental sources, academic analyses and United 
Nations reports, including from human rights bodies and mechanisms and humanitarian 
organizations, also formed part of the investigation. 
</p>
<p>9.  The standard of proof was in accordance with that applied in previous reports. This 
standard is met when reasonable grounds exist to believe that incidents occurred as 
described. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The commissioners are Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro (Chairperson), Karen Koning AbuZayd, Vitit 
</p>
<p>Muntarbhorn and Carla del Ponte. 
 2 S-17/2/Add.1, A/HRC/19/69, A/HRC/21/50 and A/HRC/22/59. See also the webpage of the 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry on the website of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights 
(www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx). </p>


<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political context 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Syrian opposition 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Syrian Arab Republic remains engulfed in an escalating civil war. The Syrian 
National Dialogue Forum, launched on 24 March 2013 by the Government and the 
domestically-based opposition to promote national reconciliation, has not shifted the 
momentum towards a political solution. Similarly, Presidential Decree No. 23 of 16 April 
2013, hailed as the most comprehensive amnesty to date, has fallen short of achieving the 
demobilization of the Government&#8217;s opponents.  
</p>
<p>11. The confirmation on 21 April 2013 of the resignation of the President of the Syrian 
National Coalition, Moaz al-Khatib, like the announcement on 13 May of the creation of a 
new opposition group, the Union of Syrian Democrats, demonstrated the deep divisions 
besetting the Syrian opposition abroad. Such divisions stem partly from the opposition&#8217;s 
reliance on patrons with often-conflicting agendas. 
</p>
<p>12.  The erosion of political authority and the rule of law in the country continued apace. 
The Government has not fulfilled its governance duties, as it cannot ensure security for 
citizens in areas under its rule, and struggles to provide basic services. At the same time, a 
dangerous stage of fragmentation and disintegration of authority prevailed in areas under 
the control of anti-government armed groups, despite attempts to fill the vacuum left by the 
withdrawal of the State by the creation of local councils. 
</p>
<p>13. One exception was the north-east of the country, where Syrian Kurds have unified 
under the Kurdish Supreme Council. Syrian Kurds are increasingly running their own 
affairs, while avoiding, whenever possible, being dragged into the fray.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional dimension 
</b></p>
<p>14. Military encroachments on sovereignty have opened the possibility of violence 
consuming the region. The Secretary-General of Lebanese Hizbullah has publicly asserted 
his group&#8217;s intervention in the conflict on the side of the Government, while some Lebanese 
Sunni clerics have called for and recruited volunteers to fight in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
The proclamation by Jabhat Al-Nusra of its allegiance with Al-Qaida, and the group&#8217;s 
public admission of association with Al-Qaida in Iraq, raised concerns about the possibility 
of the country becoming embroiled in the global jihadist cause. The war in the Syrian Arab 
Republic affects the domestic political dynamic in neighbouring States and strains the 
relationship among their diverse communities, threatening their fragile internal stability. 
</p>
<p>15. The explosion of two car bombs in Reyhanli on 11 May 2013, in Hatay province in 
Turkey, near the Syrian border, provoked intense public debate concerning the policy of the 
Government of Turkey with regard to the Syrian Arab Republic. There are fears that 
violence will spread increasingly to one of the most culturally and religiously mixed areas 
in Turkey. At a meeting of the Security Council on 30 April, the Permanent Representative 
of Jordan stated that, at the current pace, the exodus of Syrian refugees could soon represent 
&#8220;a threat to our future stability&#8221;. Israel has increased its involvement in the Syrian crisis by 
</p>
<p>targeting what it alleges are weapons shipments bound for Hizbullah and other sites inside 
the Syrian Arab Republic. Exchanges of fire were also reported in the Golan Heights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. International dimension 
</b></p>
<p>16. The current political impasse and military escalation are the by-product of the 
regional and international stand-off between the Government&#8217;s supporters and its </p>


<p>opponents, translating into arms consignments and political backing to both sides by their 
respective allies: witness the decision taken by the European Union to allow a ban on 
weapons deliveries to the Syrian opposition to lapse on 1 June, and the announcement of a 
shipment by the Russian Federation of S-300 missile batteries to the Government. Other 
international initiatives include meetings held by the pro-opposition Friends of Syria, and 
an international conference held in Tehran on 29 May. 
</p>
<p>17. On 7 May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei 
Lavrov, and Secretary of State of the United States of America, John Kerry, launched a 
joint political initiative aimed at convening an international conference to follow-up on the 
meeting held in Geneva on 30 June 2012, after which a joint communiqu&#233; was issued.3 
Although no date has been set, an inclusive conference could break the diplomatic 
stalemate by delivering a comprehensive political process to end the violence.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Military context 
</b></p>
<p>18. Hostilities in the Syrian Arab Republic have steadily expanded in recent months to 
new regions, increasingly along a sectarian divide. Brutal tactics adopted during military 
operations, particularly by government forces, have frequently led to massacres and 
destruction on an unprecedented scale. The conflict has become even more complex as 
violence has spilled over into neighbouring countries, threatening regional peace and 
stability.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>19. Government forces continued to prioritize the control of major urban centres and 
main lines of communication connecting strategic regions. With the exception of Ar 
Raqqah, the Government has held all major cities despite facing serious challenges in 
Aleppo, Dara&#8217;a and Dayr az Zawr. Recently, it launched ground operations in the 
Damascus countryside and in Dara&#8217;a and Homs governorates to expel armed groups from 
strategic positions and to maintain the country&#8217;s main supply routes. In other operations, 
government forces sought to cut supply lines connecting armed groups with their support 
networks in neighbouring countries.  
</p>
<p>20. Meanwhile, the army, supported by &#8220;popular committees&#8221;,4 has increasingly relied 
upon its long-standing strategy of denying food and medical supplies to restive localities as 
a tactic to prevent the expansion of armed groups and to force the displacement of the 
population. 
</p>
<p>21. In regions held by armed groups in the northern and eastern governorates, 
government forces resumed their brutal and often indiscriminate campaign of shelling, 
using a wide variety of weaponry. Besides the continuous use of aerial bombardments, they 
fired strategic missiles, cluster and thermobaric bombs. This appears to be part of a broader 
strategy aimed at eroding civilian support for anti-government armed groups and at 
damaging infrastructure. The majority of these attacks targeted towns and neighbourhoods 
controlled or infiltrated by armed groups rather than the military bases of those groups. 
</p>
<p>22. Defections and casualties affected the strength and cohesion of government forces. 
To generate combat power, the Government increasingly relied on militia recently 
transformed into the National Defence Army, a paramilitary force. Drawn mainly from pro-
</p>
<p>  
 3 See A/66/865-S/2012/522. 
 4 See A/HRC/22/59, para. 22. </p>


<p>Government communities, these self-defence forces were systematically engaged in combat 
operations alongside army units.  
</p>
<p>23. Recently, Hizbullah fighters are openly supporting the Syrian military during 
operations conducted near Al Qusayr along the Lebanese border, while members of the 
General Command of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine have done the same 
around Yarmouk camp in Damascus. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>24. Anti-government armed groups have reinforced their control over regions seized in 
the northern and eastern governorates, but failed to push further into the key areas of 
Damascus, Aleppo and Homs. Lacking unity of command, operational discipline and 
logistical support, they have struggled when facing Government strongholds, where 
fighting has largely stalemated. 
</p>
<p>25. The Supreme Joint Military Command Council, created to ensure unity of command 
at the national level, has failed to centralize different sources of logistical support, integrate 
command networks and alleviate the influence of radical groups. The inability to support its 
units logistically has undermined the Council&#8217;s attempts to unite the armed groups under its 
</p>
<p>authority. 
</p>
<p>26. Anti-government armed groups have also conducted sporadic shelling of pro-
Government areas such as Fou&#8217;a (Idlib), and imposed a tight siege on pro-Government 
villages in northern governorates, such as the Shia localities of Nubul and Zahra in Aleppo.  
</p>
<p>27. The rise in Government-supported minority militia and the positioning by both sides 
of bases within their respective supportive communities has fostered hostilities along 
sectarian lines. Provocative rhetoric, such as recent statements by the spokesperson of the 
Free Syrian Army (FSA), risks inciting mass, indiscriminate violence against minority 
communities.  
</p>
<p>28. Armed groups are still equipped mainly with small arms and light weapons, but 
there has been an increase in the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems, as well as 
indirect fire assets, provided predominantly by supporting countries and armed groups in 
the region. They used mortars and artillery guns to target army positions, but also pro-
Government localities, usually those hosting army positions. 
</p>
<p>29. The ongoing violence has accelerated radicalization among anti-government 
fighters, allowing radical groups, in particular Jabhat Al-Nusra (also known as the Al-Nusra 
Front), to become more influential. Jabhat Al-Nusra has been part of, and occasionally co-
leads, most  major operations conducted by other anti-government armed groups given its 
better organization and discipline, greater operational efficiency and access to external 
support. Since the announcement of ties with the Iraqi wing of Al-Qaida, there appears to 
be growing support for the group from regional extremist groups providing recruits and 
equipment. Foreign fighters with jihadist inclinations, many from neighbouring countries, 
continued to reinforce its ranks. Tensions and clashes emerged over governance and 
authority matters between Jabhat Al-Nusra and local groups. 
</p>
<p>30. Other radical groups consolidated alliances that engage in significant combat 
operations in the north and around Damascus. With no permanent affiliation to the Supreme 
Joint Military Command Council, alliances such as the Syrian Islamic Front and the Syrian 
Islamic Liberation Front have developed their own governance structures, including 
security, political and judicial mechanisms. </p>


<p><b> 3. Other forces 
</b></p>
<p>31. The &#8220;People&#8217;s Protection Committees&#8221; of the Democratic Union Party, officially 
affiliated to the Kurdish Supreme Council, have reinforced their authority over several 
Kurdish towns. Trying to avoid the fighting, they have sporadically clashed with both 
government forces and anti-government armed groups over control of Kurdish localities in 
the north and north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic. Clashes are becoming more frequent 
with anti-government armed groups despite local military agreements and occasional 
coordinated joint operations, such as in Sheikh Maqsood (Aleppo). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Socioeconomic and humanitarian context 
</b></p>
<p>32. According to estimates of United Nations humanitarian agencies, 6.8 million people, 
trapped in conflict-affected and opposition-held areas, and refugees in neighbouring 
countries are in need of urgent assistance. Half of these are children.  
</p>
<p>33. Shortages of food, medicine, fuel and electricity, especially acute in besieged cities, 
have had a grave impact on the fundamental economic and social rights of the Syrian 
people. Precarious water and sanitation conditions lead to a rising risk of summer 
epidemics. The destruction of hospitals in the country&#8217;s main cities severely undermined 
</p>
<p>the provision of health services, particularly for individuals suffering from chronic diseases. 
According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, one fifth of the country&#8217;s schools are 
being used for military purposes or have been converted into shelters, affecting education 
for hundreds of thousands of children. 
</p>
<p>34. Despite the rapidly growing humanitarian needs, access to people in conflict-
affected areas remains severely hindered. Humanitarian workers face bureaucratic and 
operational obstacles. Besides security risks, the proliferation of checkpoints controlled by 
the Government and the armed opposition restricts cross-line humanitarian operations. 
Health-care providers continue to be targeted by government forces and members of some 
anti-government armed groups. 
</p>
<p>35. The number of internally displaced Syrians is now 4.25 million. The spread of the 
conflict to cities once viewed as safe has forced many Syrians into recurrent displacement. 
Internally displaced persons have been targeted in Homs governorate. To date, 1.6 million 
Syrians have become refugees.5 Women in refugee camps face gender-based violence, 
including rape, forced marriage and sexual exploitation.  
</p>
<p>36. The situation of Palestinian refugees in the Syrian Arab Republic has deteriorated in 
recent months. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the 
Near East estimates that 235,000 Palestine refugees are displaced. Some 53,000 fled to 
Lebanon, 6,000 to Jordan, and 1,000 to Gaza. 
</p>
<p>37. At the international donors&#8217; conference held in Kuwait on 30 January 2013, donors 
pledged $1.5 billion in aid. To date, only $700 million have been secured. 
</p>
<p>  
 5 According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are 1,528,924 
</p>
<p>refugees: 476,838 in Lebanon, 474,405 in Jordan, 350,736 in Turkey, 148,028 in Iraq, 68,865 in 
Egypt and 10,052 in other North African countries. </p>


<p><b> III. Violations concerning the treatment of civilians and hors de 
combat fighters 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Massacres 
</b></p>
<p>38. During the period under review, 17 incidents potentially meeting the definition of 
massacre6 were recorded. In the incidents discussed below, the fact of intentional mass 
killing and, in some cases, the identity of the perpetrator, were confirmed. Other cases 
remain under investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Sanamayn 
</i></p>
<p>39. Government forces attacked Sanamayn (Dara&#8217;a) on 10 April 2013. Approximately 
300 fighters from the opposition Martyrs of Al-Sanamayn Brigade were inside the city. In 
accordance with observed patterns, the attack began with shelling followed by a ground 
invasion. Suffering from a lack of weapons and ammunition, the armed group withdrew 
from the city after heavy losses.  
</p>
<p>40. Civilians fleeing the attack appear to have been targeted and killed. Eleven members 
of the Al-Itmah family and seven members of the Al-Nassar family were killed when their 
cars were hit by shells. Multiple allegations of the use of human shields were received, but 
could not be corroborated. According to multiple, second-hand accounts, government 
forces were assisted by Hizbullah fighters amid allegations of atrocities against women and 
children. Such information was not corroborated. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Baniyas 
</i></p>
<p>41. Government forces and affiliated militia attacked the village of Al-Bayda on 2 May 
2013, and a neighbourhood in Baniyas (Tartous), on 3 May. Video material shows dozens 
of bodies of women and children apparently killed at close quarters. Evidence gathered 
indicates that the perpetrators were Government-affiliated militia. The investigation 
continues. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Dayr az Zawr 
</i></p>
<p>42. Eleven men appear to have executed by gunshot to the back of the head on an 
unknown date. A known leader of Jabhat Al-Nusra from Saudi Arabia, Qassoura Al-
Jazrawi, reportedly shot the men who were kneeling in front of him, hands tied and 
blindfolded. Al-Jazrawi claimed to be carrying out a sentence handed down by the &#8220;Sharia 
Court for the Eastern Region in Dayr az Zawr&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>  
 6 See A/HRC/22/59, para. 42. </p>


<p><b> 3. Incidents remaining under investigation 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Abel village 
</i></p>
<p>43. The rural village of Abel (Homs) was allegedly the site of a battle between FSA and 
government forces in late March. Thirteen people were killed, including five women and 
four children. The bodies were apparently burned. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Al-Burj 
</i></p>
<p>44. On 30 March, in Al-Burj (Homs), 11 people, including eight women, were killed in 
circumstances that could amount to summary execution. Government and armed groups 
traded accusations.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Tartous, Homs highway 
</i></p>
<p>45. On 10 April, a Bedouin family staying on a roadside near an Alawite village was 
attacked and killed. The mother, father and seven children (all under 18 years of age) and 
the grandmother were murdered in their tents. Locals who filmed the scene blamed 
Government-affiliated militia, while distant family members appeared on television 
blaming &#8220;terrorist gangs&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Jdeidet al-Fadel 
</i></p>
<p>46. Multiple accounts concerned incidents in Jdeidet al-Fadel (south-western 
Damascus), between 15 and 24 April. Anti-government armed groups were present in the 
town, which was home to thousands of internally displaced persons. The FSA purportedly 
overtook a checkpoint outside nearby Jdeidat Artouz, prompting a Government military 
operation on 15 April by the 100th Regiment and the 4th Division. Access to the area was 
blocked by Government snipers. As fighting intensified, the civilian population and 
hundreds of opposition fighters were trapped inside. Individuals fleeing were killed, though 
it could not be confirmed whether they were fighters or civilians. Multiple allegations of 
extrajudicial executions of anti-government fighters were recorded.  
</p>
<p><i> (e) Nubul 
</i></p>
<p>47. Nubul, a Shia village in Aleppo, has been under siege by anti-government armed 
groups since July 2012. In an effort to bring food and medicine to the village, and acting on 
information that passage would be allowed, 30 to 40 men from Nubul left for Afrin in mid-
April. Near Al Ziyara village, the convoy was ambushed and 15 to 20 men were killed; the 
rest were detained. Evidence indicates that some of the men in the convoy may have been 
lightly armed for protection against attack. The commission could not confirm the 
circumstances, and therefore the legality, of their deaths. Allegations that the bodies were 
mutilated were uncorroborated. 
</p>
<p><i> (f) Khirbat Al Souda 
</i></p>
<p>48. On 15 May, government forces entered Khirbat Al Souda (western Homs) in an 
apparent effort to attack opposition forces there. Allegations of summary execution were 
made afterwards based in part on video evidence. 
</p>
<p><i> (g) Execution of prisoners in three governorates 
</i></p>
<p>49. Investigations are ongoing as to whether, in response to an attack by anti-
government armed groups, security officials in Gherz central prison in March, Sednaya 
prison in April and Aleppo prison in May, executed inmates in an attempt to stave off 
attack. </p>


<p>50. Reasonable grounds exist to believe that the war crime of murder was committed in 
two massacres perpetrated by government forces and affiliated militia, and one perpetrated 
by anti-government armed groups. The killing in Baniyas and Sanamayn match the pattern 
of widespread attacks on a civilian population by the Government and may therefore 
amount to murder as a crime against humanity. In incidents that remain under investigation, 
the fact of the killing was confirmed. However, neither the perpetrator nor the 
circumstances could be determined. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Other unlawful killing 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Summary executions and the war crime of murder  
</b></p>
<p>51. Patterns of summary executions and murder have emerged. Detained persons 
believed to be opposition sympathizers are the most frequent victims of such crimes. 
Revenge killings have become increasingly common and are a direct violation of the 
prohibition of reprisals. Killing civilians by sniper fire and the killing of hostages and 
detainees when a detention centre comes under attack are noted patterns of violations by 
both pro- and anti-government groups. </p>
<p><b> 2. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>52. More than 200 bodies have been recovered from a waterway in Queiq (Aleppo) 
since 81 bodies were first discovered there on 29 January. One doctor described having 
personally seen 140 bodies. Many victims had gone missing in Government-controlled 
areas of the city. Some of those recovered had been in detention by either Air Force 
Intelligence or Military Intelligence. Family members discovered as much by paying bribes 
to the intelligence agencies for unofficial information or because other detainees released 
from the facilities confirmed their presence.  
</p>
<p>53. In January, in Dara&#8217;a, two men were detained in a house occupied by Military 
Security in Al Shajarah. Military Security withdrew on 16 March. The following day, 
relatives found the men in the house, shot dead and bearing clear signs of torture. In 
January, two men were shot dead at a checkpoint near Kherbet Ghazalah bridge, and a third 
was heavily injured. The injured man was then killed by soldiers. 
</p>
<p>54. Field executions continued to be reported during large-scale military operations. One 
interviewee, whose regiment conducted operations in Al Waar and Bab Amr (Homs), 
described executing civilians, including two young children, in their homes so that they 
would not give away the soldiers&#8217; location to nearby FSA fighters.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>55. Video footage emerged showing a child participating in the decapitation of two 
kidnapped men. Subsequent investigation confirmed the authenticity of the video and that 
the men were soldiers, killed as depicted. It was not possible to identify the perpetrators. 
Evidence indicates that the Usud Al-Tawhid Brigade committed the initial kidnapping.  
</p>
<p>56. Three separate incidents of killing by sniper fire attributed to anti-government armed 
groups were recorded in Damascus. In February, and on 7 and 20 April, three children, 
including a toddler, were killed in Sayda Zaynab. On 19 April, another youth was killed in 
Al-Bahdaliya.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>57. Government forces and affiliated militia and anti-government armed groups have 
perpetrated the war crime of murder and the human rights violation of summary execution. 
Murders by government forces were part of a widespread attack against a civilian 
population amounting to a crime against humanity. Despoiling bodies of the deceased, </p>


<p>including through burning and mutilation, is a war crime found to have been perpetrated by 
individuals on both sides.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. War crime of sentencing or execution without due process 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Anti-government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>58. During the period under review, armed groups established judicial and 
administrative mechanisms across Aleppo, Dara&#8217;a, northern Idlib, Ar Raqqah, Al-Hasakah, 
Dayr az Zawr and parts of eastern Damascus governorate, attempting to fill the vacuum 
created by the absence of Government institutions.  
</p>
<p>59. In Aleppo, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, Idlib, Dayr az Zawr and Ar Raqqah governorates, 
civilians and hors de combat Government soldiers were sentenced and executed without 
due process. Armed groups apply the loose standard of &#8220;having blood on one&#8217;s hands&#8221; to 
denote responsibility for criminal conduct deserving the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>60. In Dara&#8217;a and Ar Raqqah, armed groups used public show trials and executions of 
detainees affiliated with the Government to assert their authority and instil fear among 
civilians. In Yarmouk camp, Damascus, two people accused of being Government 
collaborators were hanged in a public square on 3 March without recourse to a regularly 
constituted court. On 14 May, fighters claiming to be from the Islamic State of Iraq and the 
Levant executed three Alawite men in a public square in Ar Raqqah city. The judgement 
stated that the execution was in retaliation for the massacre in Baniyas and Homs on 2 and 
3 May. A series of trials in Ar Raqqah city and in Al-Shajarah (Dara&#8217;a) in April had 
sectarian dimensions. Witnesses stated that captured Alawite soldiers were consistently 
found guilty and executed, while non-Alawites were imprisoned or released. 
</p>
<p>61. In Aleppo, divisions among armed groups compromised efforts to establish a 
cohesive justice system. Attempts to establish independent civilian law enforcement 
structures were obstructed by armed group commanders wary of interference in their 
interests. Failure to agree on an applicable body of law means order is enforced arbitrarily, 
and courts are not regularly constituted. 
</p>
<p>62. Two competing bodies administer justice in Aleppo. The Judicial Council applies 
legal doctrine derived from regional sources of law, while the Sharia Board applies 
interpretations of Islamic law. Both have close functional links to the FSA, compromising 
their impartiality and independence, while the provision of basic guarantees essential to fair 
trial varies widely. According to one interviewee, the Sharia Board in Aleppo does not 
permit defence lawyers to participate in proceedings.  
</p>
<p>63. The war crime of sentencing and execution without due process was committed by 
armed groups in Aleppo, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, Idlib, Dayr az Zawr and Ar Raqqah. In the 
</p>
<p>cases described, sentences were passed and individuals &#8211; who were either hors de combat fighters or civilians &#8211; were executed with no previous judgement pronounced by a court 
providing the judicial guarantees generally recognized as indispensable under international 
law.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>64. Government forces continue to use deprivation of liberty as a weapon of war, and to 
collectively punish localities perceived to be supporting the armed opposition.  
</p>
<p>65. Family members of alleged armed group members are arrested and detained. In one 
documented incident, on 10 April, a man whose brother was wanted for arrest was detained </p>


<p>by the 1st Division at a checkpoint at the entrance to Kesweh (Damascus) to coerce him 
into providing information about his brother.  
</p>
<p>66. Government forces routinely arrest and detain persons as punishment for exercising 
their basic rights. In mid-January, following a peaceful demonstration in Al-Suwayda, 
security forces conducted mass arrests. Some of those arrested were children as young as 12 
years.  
</p>
<p>67. In Um Walad (Dara&#8217;a), Government military and security forces arrested men at 
checkpoints on the sole criteria of being of military age. In January, while raiding 
predominantly Sunni neighbourhoods in Latakia city, government forces detained men, 
women and children. After holding them for a prolonged period, they were released without 
charge and without being informed of the reason for their detention.  
</p>
<p>68. Government forces made widespread arbitrary arrests of persons in areas where they 
have re-asserted control. In mid-January, government forces arrested students, including 
children, owing to their perceived loyalty to the armed opposition following a ground 
assault on Egeirbat (eastern Hama). Government forces carried out a similar wave of arrests 
in Nawa (Dara&#8217;a) in mid-March. In April, during a ground assault on Sunni villages around 
Al Qusayr (Homs), Hizbullah fighters arrested more than 50 civilians during house 
searches.  
</p>
<p>69. The armed forces of the Syrian Arab Republic have broad, unchecked powers to 
detain civilians they suspect of harbouring opposition loyalties. The arrest or detention of 
persons as punishment for exercising fundamental human rights is per se arbitrary. Arrests 
conducted on discriminatory grounds, such as the religious or geographic origin of persons, 
also violate international human rights law. The arrest and detention of all men of fighting 
age is an indication of arbitrariness, and the mass arrest of civilians, including women, 
children and the elderly, in areas perceived as supporting the opposition amounts to 
collective punishment and is illegal under international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Hostage-taking 
</b></p>
<p>70. There has been a dramatic rise in hostage-taking. Often sectarian in nature, it sparks 
reprisals and fuels inter-communal tensions. Foreigners, including journalists, businessmen 
and peacekeepers, have also been seized. Families cannot afford the ransom, and the 
consequences of non-payment have been lethal.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>71. The commission investigated but did not confirm allegations that the army and 
popular committees took hostages in Kesweh (Damascus) and Muzayrib (Dara&#8217;a), in April. 
</p>
<p>In Muzayrib, in April, civilians held by the army on a bus were threatened with death 
unless the FSA ceased attacks. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>72. Members of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the 
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) were seized on 6 March by the 
Al-Yarmouk Martyrs Battalion near the Golan Heights. The same group seized four 
UNDOF peacekeepers on 7 May. A third incident occurred days later, when 18 anti-
government fighters held three UNTSO peacekeepers in the area of separation between 
Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic. In all three cases, the kidnappers were seeking to 
leverage the hostages to halt a Government attack. All were released unharmed.  </p>


<p>73. In February, members of an anti-government armed group abducted a Sunni male in 
Damascus, mistaking him for an Alawite officer. He was tortured and suffered sectarian 
and other derogatory language before eventually persuading his captors that he was the 
wrong man. Nevertheless, his family was forced to pay a ransom. 
</p>
<p>74. Kidnappings have markedly increased in Aleppo and in the north, in areas beyond 
Government control. Two lawyers from the besieged town of Nubul were kidnapped in 
February while returning from Afrin with a delivery of flour. They are still being held by 
members of Ahrar Al-Sham. A detention facility run by the Al-Badr Martyrs Brigades in 
Hayan contains dozens of people being held for ransom. 
</p>
<p>75. On 9 February, two priests from Aleppo (one Greek Orthodox, the other Armenian 
Catholic) were abducted at an anti-government checkpoint. On 22 April, two bishops from 
Aleppo (one Greek Orthodox, the other Assyrian Orthodox) were abducted by unidentified 
gunmen. Their driver was shot and killed. The gunmen have not been identified. Other anti-
government armed groups have attempted to find the priests, who remain missing.  
</p>
<p>76. In Dara&#8217;a in mid-May, anti-government armed groups reportedly abducted the 84-
year-old father of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. No group has claimed 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>77. Anti-government armed groups have kidnapped individuals and held them hostage 
in violation of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, amounting to a war crime. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Enforced disappearance  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>78. Enforced disappearances have been carried out by Government officials, including 
Military Intelligence, and by affiliated militia acting on behalf of or with the support of the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>79. Large numbers of individuals, mainly young men, were arrested at Government and 
affiliated militia-controlled checkpoints throughout the country, including in Shin (Homs), 
Nawa (Dara&#8217;a) and Qatana (Damascus), and held for prolonged periods. Some were taken 
to unknown locations and have not been heard from since. In other cases, arrests were 
followed by a refusal by Government officials to disclose the whereabouts of the persons 
concerned. In most cases, relatives did not try to ascertain the fate of those arrested owing 
to well-founded fears of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>80. Such acts place the persons concerned outside the protection of the law, in violation 
of their fundamental rights to liberty and security, and constitute a threat to their right to 
life. Such victims face torture and ill-treatment. Depriving detainees of contact with the 
outside world causes continuing anguish to their families. 
</p>
<p>81. Government forces and affiliated militia perpetrated enforced disappearance. Where 
part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, these enforced 
disappearances constitute a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>82. Torture is endemic in detention centres and prisons. At the Military Police 
headquarters in Latakia, Government security officers beat, slapped repeatedly and kicked 
an opposition activist. She was humiliated and verbally abused. Other detainees in the same </p>


<p>facility were tortured regularly and held in cramped cells containing vermin and insects. 
Detainees were stripped naked, subjected to electrical shocks and suspended for prolonged 
periods from the ceiling by the arms with their toes barely touching the ground (<i>shabh</i>). 
One survivor stated &#8220;death is better&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>83. Detainees held at the Latakia Military Security branch are systematically tortured, 
beaten with batons and cables, punched, kicked and subjected to <i>dulab</i>, whereby detainees 
are forced into a tyre and beaten.  
</p>
<p>84. Persons detained at the Military Security branch in Dara&#8217;a were consistently 
subjected to electric shocks, beatings and the stretching of limbs (<i>busat al rih</i>). Hundreds of 
detainees were held in dangerously overcrowded conditions, forcing them to sleep standing 
up. In a facility operated by the 38th Regiment in Bosra (Dara&#8217;a), detainees were subjected 
to <i>shabh</i>, had boiling water poured on them and electric shocks administered.  
</p>
<p>85. In an underground facility in Branch 285, the General Intelligence Directorate in 
Damascus, hundreds of detainees are held in deplorable conditions in cramped cells. 
Detainees are denied medical care, and the health and hygiene needs of female detainees 
are ignored. Victims described how guards routinely beat detainees at 7 p.m. every day and 
used the <i>shabh, dulab, busat al rih </i>and <i>falaqa </i>torture methods.  
</p>
<p>86. Detainees held in Adra Prison (north-eastern Damascus) and in Homs Central Prison 
suffered from inadequate food and water, insufficient sanitary installations and a total 
absence of medical care. In Adra Prison, detainees were held in inhumane and degrading 
conditions in cramped cells. Detainees released from the Military Security and Air Force 
Intelligence prisons in Ar Raqqah city and the Military Security Branch detention centre in 
nearby Al-Tabqah bear extensive signs of torture.  
</p>
<p>87. The ill-treatment described by victims detained in Government prisons and facilities 
amounts to cruel treatment and torture. Government officials wilfully cause great suffering 
and serious injury to body and health, using torture to instil fear, extract confessions and 
punish. Such conduct amounts to a violation of common article 3 of the Geneva 
Conventions and is a war crime. The systemic ill-treatment and torture documented in 
detention centres across the Syrian Arab Republic are evidence of a State policy of torture, 
constituting a crime against humanity.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>88. Torture has been documented in detention facilities run by the Judicial Council and 
the Sharia Board in Aleppo. Detainees suspected of being members of the <i>Shabbiha</i> were 
subjected to severe physical or mental pain and suffering to obtain information or 
confessions, or as punishment or coercion.  </p>
<p>89. In contested areas, individuals have been beaten at checkpoints controlled by anti-
government armed groups. In January, Jabhat Al-Nusra fighters arrested a man on the road 
from Saraqib (Idlib) to Aleppo on the suspicion that he was Shia. He was detained for three 
days. When released, he bore extensive bruises and other signs of torture. At an FSA 
checkpoint in Aleppo city, persons perceived to be supportive of the Government were 
harassed and subjected to beatings and other ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>90. Severe ill-treatment for any reason based on discrimination of any kind amounts to 
torture and is a violation of international humanitarian law. The war crime of torture and 
cruel treatment has been perpetrated by Jabhat Al-Nusra fighters and other anti-government 
armed groups. </p>


<p><b> G. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>91. Sexual violence has been a persistent feature of the conflict. Chronic underreporting 
has made judging the magnitude of this violation difficult. Fear of rape is a driving 
motivation for families fleeing the violence.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>92. In the case of pro-government forces, sexual violence was committed during house 
searches, at checkpoints and in detention centres, often as part of interrogations by 
intelligence services. One woman detained in Latakia described how she was threatened 
with gang rape during her interrogation. She also described other detainees being stripped 
naked while subjected to electric shocks. In Branch 285, the rape and sexual abuse of male 
detainees by their interrogators was reported. There were no indications of action taken by 
senior commanders to investigate, prevent or punish acts of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>93. Rape and other inhumane acts, as crimes against humanity, have been committed by 
government forces and affiliated militia. Rape, torture and inhumane treatment are 
prosecutable as war crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>94. A limited number of interviews described women being segregated during house 
searches in Aleppo city during joint operations by armed groups, with an implication of 
possible sexual violence. One interviewee stated that she had been the victim of a sexual 
assault in Yarmouk (Damascus), in April. 
</p>
<p>95. During the assault in Yarmouk, the war crime of sexual violence was committed. 
Based on limited information, it was not possible to reach a finding in relation to the other 
accounts. 
</p>
<p><b> H. </b>Violations of children&#8217;s rights <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Unlawful killings and injuries  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Government forces and affiliated militia 
</i></p>
<p>96. Children continue to be the victims of shelling and aerial bombardments by 
government forces. Examples include attacks on Kaljabrin (Aleppo), on 23 January; Al 
Huwash (Hama), on 7 February; Saa&#8217;sae (Damascus) on 28 and 29 March; Al-Houlah 
(Homs) on 29 March; and Sanamayn (Dara&#8217;a) on 10 April. In late February, a 14-year-old 
child was shot by a sniper positioned in the Ba&#8217;ath party offices in Dara&#8217;a Al-Balad.  
</p>
<p>97. Government sieges have led to health and nutrition crises that disproportionately 
affect children under 5 years and nursing mothers. A clinician in Al-Houlah stated that 13 
children had died between August 2012 and April 2013 from malnutrition and lack of 
medication.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Anti-government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>98. Children were killed in attacks by armed groups. In April, a 2-year-old boy died 
after being shot by a sniper firing from an opposition neighbourhood while on a street in 
Sayda Zaynab (Damascus). A 12-year-old boy in Nubul (Aleppo) was killed during rocket 
attacks in April by armed groups besieging the town. Child malnutrition increased in 
Nubul. </p>


<p><b> 2. Abductions, arbitrary arrests, detention and torture 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Government forces and affiliated militia 
</i></p>
<p>99. Government forces and militia detained children at checkpoints and during house 
raids. Several arrests in Dara&#8217;a appeared to target children of suspected FSA members. 
</p>
<p>Others held children as hostage in exchange for detainees held by the FSA. During the 
attack of 10 April on Sanamayn, children were forced to watch the torture or killing of 
parents. In April, checkpoint personnel in Rastan (Homs) threatened to shoot two girls aged 
9 and 7 who had started crying during their father&#8217;s interrogation.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Anti-government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>100. In December 2012, a woman and her 6-year-old daughter were kidnapped from Al-
Fou&#8217;a (Idlib) and held in an underground detention facility in Saraqib. They were released 
in January on payment of ransom to Jabhat Al-Nusra. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Recruitment and use of children 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Anti-government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>101. Some armed groups recruit and use children for active participation in hostilities. A 
14-year-old boy from Homs underwent training in the use of weapons with the Abu Yusef 
Battalion, which then used him to keep track of soldiers&#8217; movements in Al-Waar. Other 
groups reject underage volunteers. Commanders in Dayr az Zawr refused to accept a 15-
year-old boy, calling his parents to come collect him.  
</p>
<p>102. Casualty statistics indicate that 86 children were killed in hostilities as combatants. 
Of those, nearly half died in 2013. These figures suggest that the use of children in combat 
is increasing.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations concerning the conduct of hostilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Unlawful attacks 
</b></p>
<p>103. Civilians bear the brunt of violent and often indiscriminate attacks. Government 
forces continued their campaign of shelling and aerial bombardment. Instances of armed 
groups shelling Shia enclaves in Aleppo, Idlib and Damascus governorates were recorded. 
There were multiple bombings, mainly in Damascus, for which no party claimed 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>104. Government forces conduct their military operations in flagrant disregard of the 
distinction between civilians and persons directly participating in hostilities. Extensive 
aerial and artillery capabilities continue to be deployed. Increasingly, even less precise 
weaponry, such as surface-to-surface missiles, thermobaric bombs and cluster munitions, 
are being used. There is a strong element of retribution in the Government&#8217;s approach, with 
civilians paying a price for &#8220;allowing&#8221; armed groups to operate in their towns. 
</p>
<p>105. Attacks by artillery shelling, barrel bombs and aerial bombardment were particularly 
fierce in heavily contested areas of strategic importance, such as Aleppo and Homs cities. 
Yarmouk (Damascus) has been heavily shelled, leading to an exodus of Palestinian 
refugees into Lebanon. Such attacks did not discriminate between military targets and 
civilian objects, and were conducted across the country in numerous locations. Areas more </p>


<p>firmly under anti-government armed group control, such as Ar Raqqah city and Dayr az 
Zawr villages, continue to be subjected to shelling and bombardment. There were multiple 
accounts of surface-to-surface missiles causing massive destruction in the north, such as in 
the Ard Al-Hamra neighbourhood on 23 February and Hreitan (Aleppo) on 29 March. 
Thermobaric bombs were used in Al Qusayr on 20 March. Cluster munitions were used in 
numerous locations, including Qarah, in rural Damascus, between 3 and 6 April.  
</p>
<p>106. Towns in northern Aleppo and Idlib governorates have been largely emptied of 
civilians, turning them into de facto military zones. It is clear that the Government could 
take greater precautions to protect civilians that remain. In May, shortly before the attack 
on Al Qusayr, government forces dropped leaflets advising civilians to leave the area. In 
the context of Government attacks, such precautions remain an anomaly. 
</p>
<p>107. Multiple accounts were received &#8211; from former residents of towns across Dara&#8217;a, 
Sha&#8217;ar and Ashrafiyah neighbourhoods (Aleppo) and Yarmouk (Damascus) &#8211; of snipers 
targeting persons, without distinction. Casualties included women and children.  
</p>
<p>108. Government forces consistently transgressed the fundamental principle of the laws 
of war that they must, at all times, distinguish between civilian and military objectives. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>109. Armed groups continue to operate within civilian areas. This endangers the civilian 
population and violates international legal obligations to avoid positioning military 
objectives within or near densely populated areas. Some armed groups take precautions to 
safeguard the civilian population. On 6 February, in Al-Tabqah (Ar Raqqah), fighters 
warned residents to evacuate the area in advance of an attack. Prior to the attacks on Al 
Qusayr in May, armed groups assisted in the evacuation of civilians. 
</p>
<p>110. There were isolated instances of the shelling of towns and villages by armed groups, 
usually on the pretext that the attacks were directed against government forces. On 24 April 
and on 4 and 6 May, Liwa Al-Tawhid, Ghuraba Al-Sham and Jabhat Al-Nusra fired scores 
of mortars and home-made rockets into Nubul and Zahra (Aleppo). There were multiple 
civilian casualties, including a 12-year-old boy. In February, armed groups in Aleppo city 
fired mortars into Government-controlled areas. In March, groups fired mortars into Sayda 
Zaynab and the surrounding neighbourhoods of Damascus. They shelled Fou&#8217;a (Idlib) 
throughout 2013. All areas attacked had a majority Shia population. There were reports of 
snipers from armed groups firing into Nubul and Sayda Zaynab throughout early 2013, 
causing civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>111. Anti-government armed groups used mortars, rockets and snipers in a manner that 
failed to distinguish civilian from military objectives, committing unlawful attacks.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Undetermined perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>112. The use of improvised explosive devices (usually car bombs) continued. All but one 
attack took place in Damascus. The first attack, on 15 January, was the bombing of Aleppo 
University, which killed more than 80 people. Bombs exploded in Damascus on 21 
February near the Ba&#8217;ath party headquarters and in the Barzeh neighbourhood; on 21 
March, at the Al-Iman mosque; on 8 April, near the Central Bank; on 29 April, near the 
former Ministry of the Interior; and on 30 April, in central Damascus. No party claimed 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>113. With the exception of the bombing in Barzeh neighbourhood, where the majority of 
casualties were soldiers, the bombings demonstrated no clear military objective. The attacks 
spread terror among the civilian population. The large number of civilian deaths and 
injuries evidenced a disregard for human life.  </p>


<p>114. As armed factions in the Syrian Arab Republic proliferate, it is increasingly difficult 
to determine the perpetrators of such attacks. While these acts constitute crimes under 
domestic law, they may also amount to war crimes if it is determined that the perpetrators 
are parties to the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Specifically protected persons and objects 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Historic objects 
</b></p>
<p>115. On 13 April, the seventh century minaret of the Al-Omari mosque in Dara&#8217;a was 
destroyed. On 24 April, the twelfth century minaret at the Umayyad mosque in Aleppo 
collapsed, after being shelled. Government forces and anti-government armed groups 
traded blame. 
</p>
<p>116. Across the Syrian Arab Republic, historic monuments are being damaged and 
destroyed. No party to the conflict is abiding by its obligation to respect cultural property 
and to avoid causing damage to it in the context of military operations. Both government 
forces and anti-government armed groups have rendered sites open to attack by placing 
military objectives in them. 
</p>
<p>117. The army has established bases in the ancient citadels of Aleppo, Homs and Hama. 
Anti-government armed groups are based near the edges of the citadel in Aleppo, placing it 
at risk of further damage. In Maaret Al-Numan, in north-western Idlib, an armed group 
based itself in a seventeenth century caravan trading post, which had been a museum. 
Nearby artefacts were destroyed by shelling. 
</p>
<p>118. The Roman ruins of Bosra (Dara&#8217;a) have been damaged, as have ruins in the ancient 
desert city of Palmyra. The outer walls of the Krak des Chevaliers, a Crusader fortress in 
Homs, were marred by rocket fire. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization, five of the country&#8217;s six World Heritage sites have been 
</p>
<p>damaged. 
</p>
<p>119. Looting, sometimes committed by parties to the conflict, has ravaged historic sites. 
Byzantine mosaics in the &#8220;dead cities&#8221; in the north and the Roman city of Apamea were 
</p>
<p>removed. Interpol lists an Aramaic bronze statue dating back to the eighth century B.C. as 
having been stolen from the Hama museum. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Religious objects 
</b></p>
<p>120. On 17 January, the Kafr Nabudah mosque in Hama was shelled. The shelling of the 
Bilal mosque in Al-Habit (Idlib) on 27 January and 7 February followed. In the attack on 21 
April against Jdeidat Al-Fadel (Damascus), government forces burned the mosque. Where 
attacks on the mosques had no military objective, the war crime of attacking protected 
objects was committed.  
</p>
<p>121. In early January, fighters from an anti-government armed group looted and 
destroyed Al-Husseiniya, a Shia religious centre in Al-Tabqah (Ar Raqqah). On 11 
February, a nearby Orthodox church was looted and destroyed. Armed groups in Al-Tabqah 
committed the war crime of attacking protected objects. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Hospitals and medical personnel 
</b></p>
<p>122. The deliberate targeting of medical personnel and hospitals and the denial of 
medical access continue to be disturbing features of the conflict. 
</p>
<p>123. State and field hospitals in Jasem and Tafas (Dara&#8217;a), Adra (Damascus countryside); 
Hajar Al-Aswad and Yarmouk (Damascus), and Sha&#8217;ar and Ansari (Aleppo) have been </p>


<p>shelled and bombarded by government forces. Some, such as the Zarzor hospital in Ansari, 
have been hit repeatedly. Some State hospitals have been used as military bases by 
government forces. Snipers are positioned at the Al-Houlah hospital, with tanks and 
artillery at its entrance. 
</p>
<p>124. Medical personnel have been attacked. Zarzor hospital staff members went missing 
and are reportedly being held by Air Force Intelligence in Aleppo. A nurse in a field clinic 
in Homs was wanted for arrest because he provided medical assistance to armed groups. 
</p>
<p>125. In Aleppo and Homs, accounts were received of wounded and sick persons being 
refused medical treatment on political and sectarian grounds. Civilians avoided seeking 
treatment in Government-administered hospitals owing to a well-founded fear of arrest. 
One doctor in an Aleppo hospital described the arrest of wounded young men by security 
forces.  
</p>
<p>126. Government forces committed the war crime of attacking protected objects and the 
war crime of attacking objects or persons using the distinctive emblems of the Geneva 
Conventions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Pillaging and destruction of property 
</b></p>
<p>127. Justifying their actions either as &#8220;spoils of war&#8221; or as retribution for supporting the 
opposing side, parties to the conflict burn, loot and pillage homes and businesses. The ever-
increasing numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons leave behind belongings, 
which are then appropriated by soldiers and armed groups.  
</p>
<p>128. Fleeing families frequently have their few possessions stolen at checkpoints or by 
thieves taking advantage of the lawlessness. While vast amounts of property have been 
destroyed as a result of shelling, a violation is recorded when reasonably believed to be a 
deliberate targeting of an opponent&#8217;s property. Both pillage and deliberate property 
destruction are war crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>129. In a now familiar pattern, following shelling and ground attacks, government forces 
and <i>Shabbiha</i> secure an area and conduct house searches. While inside homes, they steal 
valuables, irrespective of whether the occupants are present. At checkpoints, cars and 
money are taken from those coming from known opposition neighbourhoods.  
</p>
<p>130. Prolonged fighting in Dara&#8217;a has displaced tens of thousands, leaving homes and 
businesses unguarded. In Dara&#8217;a city, Jasem, Musayfrah, Al-Abassiyah (in February and 
March), Sanamayn and Um Waleed (in April), the homes of suspected anti-government 
sympathizers were stripped bare. In many cases, theft was followed by the burning of the 
homes and businesses.  
</p>
<p>131. In early April, on the outskirts of Hama, an internally displaced woman returned 
home a month after her village had been bombed and raided by government forces. She 
found her house and car had been burned, as had those of her neighbours. Items, such as 
television sets and furniture, had been looted.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>132. During the March fighting in Ar Raqqah city, the Shia and Alawite communities 
fled. Most have not returned. Their homes were confiscated by armed groups, their 
properties looted and resulting items sold off. Looting of the homes of loyalists was 
rampant in Al-Tabqah, when anti-government groups, including Jabhat Al-Nusra, took over </p>


<p>in February. The Orthodox Church and the home of its bishop were looted, and much of the 
church property destroyed. 
</p>
<p>133. In Yarmouk (Damascus), armed groups either stole cars and trucks or coerced 
residents into giving them up. In Aleppo, groups at checkpoints steal from Alawite or Shia 
civilians.  
</p>
<p>134. The &#8220;Islamist Sharia Commission&#8221; in Aleppo and Jabhat Al-Nusra in Yarmouk and 
in Idlib have attempted to curb such theft, arresting or expelling members of some of the 
groups involved. 
</p>
<p>135. Anti-government armed groups and government forces and affiliated militia have 
committed the war crimes of pillage and destruction of property. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Illegal weapons 
</b></p>
<p>136. As the conflict escalates, the potential for the use of chemical weapons is of 
deepening concern. Chemical weapons include toxic chemicals, munitions, devices and 
related equipment as defined in the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction. The Protocol 
for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of 
Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, which the Syrian Arab Republic has ratified, is also 
applicable. The use of chemical weapons is prohibited in all circumstances under customary 
international humanitarian law, and is a war crime under the Rome Statute.  
</p>
<p>137. The Government has in its possession a number of chemical weapons. The dangers 
extend beyond the use of the weapons by the Government itself to the control of such 
weapons in the event of either fractured command or of any of the affiliated forces gaining 
access. 
</p>
<p>138. Anti-government armed groups could gain access to and use chemical weapons. 
This includes nerve agents, though there is no compelling evidence that these groups 
possess such weapons or their requisite delivery systems.   
</p>
<p>139. Allegations were received concerning the use of chemical weapons by both parties. 
The majority concern their use by government forces. In four attacks &#8211; on Khan Al-Asal 
(Aleppo), on 19 March; Uteibah ( Damascus) on 19 March; Sheikh Maqsood 
neighbourhood (Aleppo) on 13 April; and Saraqib (Idlib), on 29 April &#8211; there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that limited quantities of toxic chemicals were used. It has 
not been possible, on the evidence available, to determine the precise chemical agents used, 
their delivery systems or the perpetrator. Other incidents also remain under investigation.  
</p>
<p>140. Conclusive findings &#8211; particularly in the absence of a large-scale attack &#8211; may be 
reached only after samples taken directly from victims or the site of the alleged attack have 
been tested. It is therefore of utmost importance that the panel of experts, led by Professor 
Sellstr&#246;m and assembled under the mechanism established by the Secretary-General to 
investigate into the alleged use of chemical and biological or toxin weapons, be granted full 
access to the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Sieges 
</b></p>
<p>141. Siege warfare has entered the arsenal of the parties to the conflict. Government 
forces and affiliated militia have systematically employed sieges across the country, 
trapping civilians in their homes by controlling the supply of food, water, medicine and </p>


<p>electricity. In some instances, anti-government armed groups have also employed this 
tactic.  
</p>
<p>142. There is a clear prohibition on the use of starvation as a method of warfare under the 
laws of war. In the context of a siege, inhabitants must be allowed to leave and the 
besieging party must allow free passage of foodstuffs and other essential supplies. Parties to 
the conflict must allow and facilitate the unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>143. Government forces lay siege to areas with a heavy presence of anti-government 
armed groups to contain their operational forces and compel withdrawal. The blockade of 
Yarmouk (Damascus) was tightened in January. Food and medicine to the remaining 
10,000 residents is strictly rationed, with bread limited to two bags for each family, 
irrespective of its size. The prolonged siege of the Al-Houlah villages (Homs) has 
harrowing consequences on the lives of civilians trapped therein. A former resident 
witnessed a baby die of malnutrition, and stated that food shortages had affected nursing 
mothers. The sick and wounded cannot be evacuated from Al-Houlah, while the lack of 
medication at the field hospital has forced doctors to resort to desperate measures, including 
amputation. 
</p>
<p>144.  As a tactic of attrition, government forces also impose sieges upon towns and 
villages considered sympathetic to the opposition or containing anti-government armed 
group fighters. Settlements in southern Dara&#8217;a have been subject to blockades, where 
government forces cut off food, electricity, fuel, water and medical supplies. Al-Shajarah 
town, near Dara&#8217;a, was besieged from February to April, following intensive shelling, 
causing many to flee. Government forces surrounded the remaining civilians, suggesting a 
punitive element to the deprivation of access to food and medicine. Such sieges appear 
calculated to render living conditions unbearable, forcing civilians to flee and exposing 
anti-government armed group fighters as military targets. 
</p>
<p>145. Towns in strategic locations have also been tightly surrounded and sealed to create a 
buffer against the infiltration of armed opposition. Cooperating with military forces, 
Popular Committees have prevented food supplies from entering Nawa (Dara&#8217;a) and 
Kesweh and Qatana (Damascus).  
</p>
<p>146. Government forces and affiliated militia have imposed sieges and blockades on 
towns without complying with their obligations under international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>147. Anti-government armed groups have besieged Shia enclaves in predominantly Sunni 
areas, claiming that they hosted Government military forces. Since July 2012, anti-
government armed groups in Aleppo have surrounded Nubul and Zahra, blocking food, fuel 
and medical supplies to 70,000 residents. As the siege tightened in recent months, the 
population, especially women and children, began to suffer from malnutrition. The 
wounded and sick cannot receive medical treatment. People attempting to leave the villages 
are often kidnapped, held for ransom or killed.  
</p>
<p>148. The manner in which anti-government armed groups have laid siege violates their 
obligations under international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> F.  Forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>149. In the Syrian Arab Republic, hundreds of thousands of civilians are on the move, 
searching for ever-dwindling safe havens. Many are fleeing aerial bombardments and </p>


<p>ground attacks by government forces. Others &#8211; often, but not exclusively, from the Alawite, 
Shia, Druze and Christian communities &#8211; are fleeing attack by anti-government armed 
groups. Within this context, specific instances of forcible displacement have been recorded.  
</p>
<p>150. In March and April, internally displaced civilians &#8211; predominantly from Homs 
governorate &#8211; sought refuge in Deir Atiyah, a town in northern Damascus. Between 19 and 
23 April, government forces shelled Deir Atiyah and sent a message to the town authorities 
that the internally displaced were to be forced to leave the town; failure to do so would 
result in an attack against the town. In late April, the municipal office of Deir Atiyah 
informed the displaced that they had four days to leave before their quota of bread was 
withdrawn. Shortly thereafter, there was an exodus of internally displaced persons, many 
from Homs city and Al Qusayr, from Deir Atiyah. 
</p>
<p>151. The indiscriminate bombardment of civilian locations constitutes an attack on a 
civilian population. Such attacks are widespread in the Syrian Arab Republic, and 
conducted by government forces pursuant to an organizational policy. The forcible 
displacement of those who sought refuge in Deir Atiyah was undertaken by perpetrators 
with knowledge of such attacks, and therefore constitutes a crime against humanity. The 
war crime of displacing civilians has also been committed. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>152. A review of the evidence collected since January has satisfied the commission that 
the gravity of the crimes committed by government forces and affiliated militia and anti-
government armed groups, the prevalence of such crimes and the alarming rate at which 
they continue to be perpetrated lend force to the recommendation made by the commission 
that there must be a referral to justice at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>153.  The discussions surrounding the prospects of an international conference have not 
included any reference to the issue of accountability. While such diplomatic efforts may 
signify a significant step towards breaking the impasse in the Syrian Arab Republic, the 
imperative to stop the violence cannot obscure the reality that there can be no enduring 
peace without justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>154. During the period under review, consistent and corroborated accounts indicated that 
government forces committed gross violations of their obligations under international 
human rights law and common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, perpetrating war 
crimes and crimes against humanity. The documented violations are consistent and 
widespread, and evidence of a concerted policy implemented by the leaders of the military 
and the Government.  
</p>
<p>155. No convincing domestic efforts have been made to investigate these crimes or to 
bring those responsible to justice. The international community also bears the burden of 
having failed to ensure accountability for the perpetrators.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>156. The evidence collected indicates that several individuals in anti-government groups 
committed war crimes in violation of their obligations under common article 3 of the 
Geneva Conventions. The takeover of Ar Raqqah in March ushered in a period of 
lawlessness in the conduct of anti-government armed groups as they turned to violence to 
assert their authority. The commanders of anti-government armed groups have consistently </p>


<p>failed to take appropriate disciplinary steps and, in most cases, been directly involved in the 
commission of crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>157.<b> There is a human cost to the political impasse that has come to characterize the 
response of the international community to the war in the Syrian Arab Republic. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>desperation of the parties to the conflict has resulted in new levels of cruelty and 
</b></p>
<p><b>brutality, bolstered by an increase in the availability of weapons. Increased arms 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfers hurt the prospect of a political settlement to the conflict, fuel the 
</b></p>
<p><b>multiplication of armed actors at the national and regional levels and have devastating 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences for civilians.  
</b></p>
<p>158.<b> The erosion of the State and of political authority in parts of the country is 
compounded by the fractious nature of the various parties claiming control of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>territory. Syrians are confronted with intensifying damage, displacement and despair. 
</b></p>
<p><b>War rages at key flashpoints, deepening the sectarian divide and spilling over into 
</b></p>
<p><b>neighbouring countries.  
</b></p>
<p>159.<b> While the nature of the conflict is constantly changing, there remains no 
military solution. The conflict will end only through a comprehensive, inclusive 
</b></p>
<p><b>political process. The international community must prioritize the de-escalation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>war and work within the framework of the final communiqu&#233; of the Action Group for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Syria (Geneva communiqu&#233;).</b>7<b>  
</b></p>
<p>160.<b> All parties are obliged to respect human rights and international humanitarian 
law. Both they and their supporters share the responsibility to commit to a peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>solution.  
</b></p>
<p>161.<b>  Accountability must be re-emphasized at all levels.  
</b></p>
<p>162.<b> Humanitarian access should be sustained and enlarged, with full commitment 
from all parties. 
</b></p>
<p>163.<b> The commission of inquiry renews the recommendations made in its previous 
reports, and highlights those below. 
</b></p>
<p>164.<b> The commission recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Support the peace process based on the Geneva communiqu&#233; and the

</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Join the peace process in a constructive spirit, presenting a unified

</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Reject extreme elements and compel all groups to respect human rights

</b></p>
<p>168.<b> The commission recommends that OHCHR and other United Nations agencies:
