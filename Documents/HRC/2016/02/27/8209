<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, Anand Grover, visited Viet Nam from 24 
November to 5 December 2011. He notes that Viet Nam faces a number of obstacles in 
achieving full realization of the right to health. While it is commendable that the 
Government of Viet Nam has shown a commitment towards improving the health of its 
people, the Special Rapporteur has a number of serious concerns regarding health systems 
and financing, access to medicines and issues surrounding HIV/AIDS, including 
rehabilitation centres. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur examines health systems and financing 
within Viet Nam, noting that the increasing privatization of the health sector and the 
decentralization of health governance present a number of serious challenges pertaining to 
access to health care and increasing out-of-pocket expenditures. There are also a number of 
concerns regarding the national social health insurance programme, including the coverage 
of the scheme and the quality of the services provided. The report also addresses access to 
medicines in Viet Nam. Current mechanisms of drug procurement and price regulation 
have been unsuccessful in curtailing high drug prices in the country, presenting a

<p>significant barrier to access to medicines, especially for the poor and near poor. The 
potential impact of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement on access to medicines in Viet 
Nam is also of concern. The Special Rapporteur also considers issues related to the 
prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, focusing on such areas of concern as: 
epidemiological surveillance and data collection; stigmatization and discrimination of 
vulnerable groups; and reduced international donor funding. The detention and mandatory 
treatment of persons who use drugs and female sex workers in rehabilitation centres is of 
particular concern to the Special Rapporteur. He concludes the report with 
recommendations addressed to the Government of Viet Nam.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur reports on his visit to Viet Nam, 
conducted at the invitation of the Government from 24 November to 5 December 2011. The 
purpose of the mission was to ascertain, in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation, how the 
country has endeavoured to implement the right to health, as well as the measures taken for 
successful realization of the right to health, and the obstacles encountered both at the 
national and international levels.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur focused on the health system and health 
financing in Viet Nam; he also addressed the following issues: the international and 
domestic legal framework of Viet Nam; access to medicines, primarily related to drug 
procurement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA); and prevention and 
control of HIV/AIDS, including rehabilitation centres. The Special Rapporteur visited 
Hanoi, Hai Phong and Ho Chi Minh City, as well as sites in Dong Nai, Ha Tay and Thai 
Nguyen.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with senior Government officials from the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and 
Social Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment 
and the Ministry of Planning and Investment, as well as from the Office of the National 
Assembly. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur also held meetings with the 
representatives of civil society organizations, development partners, academics, legal experts 
and health professionals. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Viet Nam 
for its invitation and its full cooperation during his visit. He also would like to thank all those 
who met with him, gave their time and extended cooperation to him during the mission.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Viet Nam and the right to health  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>4. Over the three decades following its nearly 30 years of continual military conflict, 
Viet Nam has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing economies. This rapid 
economic growth has resulted in a nearly 75 per cent reduction of poverty in the country 
and a general increase in standards of living.1 In moving from near isolation to almost full 
integration into the global economy, Viet Nam has introduced fundamental structural 
changes to its economy, which have had significant impacts on aspects of the right to health 
and health systems. These structural changes, which first began in 1986 with a series of 
liberalizing economic reforms known as <i>doi moi</i> (renewal),2 are part of an overall process 
of restructuring the Vietnamese economy into a &#8213;socialist-oriented market economy&#8214;. 
Additional changes to the Vietnamese economy, in particular the introduction of a new 
intellectual property law, have come about due to the country&#8217;s accession to the World 
Trade Organization as of 2006. 
</p>
<p>5. During this period of economic transformation, Viet Nam has seen marked 
improvements in the well-being of its people. The country has made significant progress 
towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals, in particular with regard to reducing

<p>poverty3 and achieving universal access to primary education and gender equality.4 
Moreover, the economic benefits of the country&#8217;s growth have been distributed equitably 
among its people, permitting household incomes to grow along with increased household 
consumption and savings. Improvements to the health system in Viet Nam have to some 
degree corresponded with the country&#8217;s economic rise, demonstrating a strong commitment 
to ensure access to health care for all. A functioning health system is the basis for the 
exercise of the right to health, and data indicates that admirable advances have been made 
in many key health areas, including child and maternal health.5 The Special Rapporteur 
commends Viet Nam on these significant advances. 
</p>
<p>6. Despite these improvements, many critical health areas still need to be addressed. 
Changes in the economic system of Viet Nam have brought about additional concerns, such 
as increasing inequality. Moreover, the country&#8217;s transition to a middle-income economy 
will also mean that it will be the beneficiary of less overseas development assistance,6 
which comprises the majority of funding in some critical health areas, such as HIV/AIDS 
prevention and treatment.7 Many important donors, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Department for International Development of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, have already indicated that they would 
scale back their in-country programming and support.8 At the same time, the Vietnamese 
economy has felt the reverberations of the global economic crisis, which has resulted in, 
among other things, the reduction of central Government spending on health. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International and domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. Viet Nam is a party to a number of international treaties that recognize the right to 
health, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, including its two Optional Protocols. Viet Nam has signed but not ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In the national legal order, 
international treaties must be given effect through domestic law. 
</p>
<p>8. At its universal periodic review in May 2009, the Government of Viet Nam 
supported the review&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations, which called, inter alia, for the 
country&#8217;s accession to or ratification of further principal human rights instruments, namely 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment; the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities; the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance; as well as the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women

</p>
<p>(A/HRC/12/11, para. 99). In that context, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
take concrete measures with a view to achieving that commendable objective in a timely 
manner. 
</p>
<p>9. The 1992 Constitution of Viet Nam (revised in 2001) contains a number of 
provisions relating to the right to health. Article 50 refers to the State&#8217;s obligation to respect 
</p>
<p>and provide for &#8213;human rights in all respects&#8214;, including economic, cultural and social 
rights. It is specifically stated that &#8213;citizens are entitled to health care&#8214; (art. 61), and that 
citizens have a right to have their health protected by law (art. 71). The Constitution also 
provides that the State has a duty to &#8213;develop &#8230; health care&#8214; (art. 112). The State&#8217;s role in 
the financing, developing and administration of health protection, disease prevention, 
dispensing of medication, health-care insurance and health care generally is described in 
article 39. This provision specifies &#8213;mountain inhabitants&#8214; and ethnic minorities as 
vulnerable groups to whom preferential treatment should be directed.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Health systems and financing 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Vietnamese health system, until the early stages of doi moi, was funded and 
administered entirely by the State and was available to Vietnamese free of charge. In 1989, 
however, Viet Nam instituted partial user fees as a method of financing public health-care 
goods and services.9 In 1993, the Regulation on Health Insurance issued under Decree 
No. 299 provided for the first time an insurance-based system in the country.10 Since the 
introduction of the national health insurance programme, Viet Nam has moved towards a 
more mixed public/private system of health-care financing and provision. 
</p>
<p>11. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur learned that the Government&#8217;s current 
strategy towards ensuring the economic sustainability of the health system consists 
primarily of issuing government bonds and encouraging greater foreign and domestic 
private investment, including through public-private partnerships. This strategy is part of a 
more systemic shift toward the socialization policy aimed at expanding non-State payments 
for social services and promoting the role of non-State actors in delivering health, education 
and other services.11 The socialization policy has resulted in a greater involvement of the 
private sector in the provision of health goods and services on a for-profit basis and 
increased reliance on individual households to cover health-care costs.12 The Special 
Rapporteur notes with appreciation that Viet Nam is still laudably committed to providing 
health care for all. This is demonstrated by National Assembly resolution 18, which 
commits the Government to ensure the growth rate of spending on health consistently 
exceeds the growth rate of overall government spending,13 and the fact that Government 
spending on health has risen from 4.8 per cent to 10.2 per cent between 2002 and 2008.14

</b></p>
<p>12. Privatization, however, poses numerous challenges to ensuring full realization of the 
right to health, particularly for the poor and near poor. Privatization of health care often 
results in a number of troubling outcomes, including increased inequity in the accessibility 
of health care and greater out-of-pocket expenditures.15 For example, since the introduction 
of health insurance in Viet Nam, household health expenditure has grown to approximately 
60 per cent of all total health expenditure.16 These outcomes result from a reliance on 
profit-generation to ensure the continued existence of the health system, in contrast to a 
public system funded largely or entirely by the State. While in many cases the substitution 
of State-delivered services with private services may be acceptable or even an 
improvement, it is unlikely that the private sector will fill all the gaps left by the effective 
withdrawal of the State from the health sector. Studies have demonstrated that privatization 
of health care in Viet Nam has already led to a growth in inequity and has reduced access 
for some populations, as hospitals increasingly tailor the quality of health services 
according to patients&#8217; ability to pay.17  
</p>
<p>13. One of the primary responsibilities of the State under the right to health, however, is 
to ensure that all persons have access to affordable health care. The Special Rapporteur 
commends Viet Nam for its commitment to ensuring health care for all, as discussed below, 
but notes that the Government should remain vigilant in order to prevent privatization from 
negatively impacting the realization of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>14. In addition to privatization, a hallmark of the country&#8217;s reforms since doi moi is the 
process of fiscal decentralization, which ranged from the increased proportion of taxes 
assigned to local governments, since 1996, to the growing decentralization of the budgetary 
process to provinces, following the adoption of the State Budget Law in 2002.18 Provinces 
can borrow in domestic markets to finance capital expenditures and infrastructure 
investment approved by the People&#8217;s Council. Viet Nam has also decentralized its health 
system and health financing mechanisms,19 partially in response to decreased funding from 
the central Government. As a result, provincial-, district- and commune-level health 
facilities have been granted greater management autonomy from the central Government. 
While this may provide local authorities with flexibility to better address their local 
situations, it also shifts the financial burden of health care from the central Government to 
local authorities and institutions.  
</p>
<p>15. Experience from other countries shows that decentralization may generate and 
exacerbate inequities in the health system by restricting the availability and accessibility of 
health goods and services.20 Decentralization creates strong incentives for local health 
authorities and institutions to generate revenue by increasing the costs of goods and 
services. Increased costs may further limit access for the poor and near poor, particularly

</p>
<p>given the high rates of inflation in Viet Nam. Moreover, decentralization has already 
resulted in the increased provision of new and high-tech medical services in hospitals.21 
While this is a necessary improvement to the health system, the Government must ensure 
this does not come at the expense of a limited availability of less profitable preventative 
services. 
</p>
<p>16. Privatization and decentralization in Viet Nam could thus undermine the availability, 
accessibility and affordability of health care for all, particularly for the poor, near poor and 
ethnic minorities. Privatization shifts costs to the consumer and often makes health care 
more expensive. Decentralization, as currently structured, creates incentives for lower level 
government authorities to approach health care as a for-profit system in order to generate 
needed revenue, rather than as a public good. The combined effect of privatization and 
decentralization is greater autonomy for subnational-level health authorities to seek private 
investment in public health entities in order to generate revenue, in part to account for 
decreased central Government funding. The likely result is greater inequity in the health-
care system, expressed through higher costs for goods and services, increased out-of-pocket 
expenditures, reduced rural access, and reduced availability of services that generate lower 
profit margins, such as primary care.  
</p>
<p>17. Privatization and decentralization have resulted in partial private ownership of public 
hospitals.22 In some instances, this has led to an increase in the abuse of services, including 
unnecessary testing and the use of high-tech services, over-prescription of medicines and 
patient overload.23 These results are exacerbated by the predominant use of the fee-for-service 
payment mechanism in Viet Nam.24 The Ministry of Health has recommended that Viet Nam 
continue to &#8213;assess and implement joint ventures, business partnerships and participation of 
private investors in investments in curative care facilities&#8214;.25 The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government to take a cautious approach, in line with its previous decision to 
temporarily halt the sale of shares in public hospitals due to concerns relating to equality and 
efficiency.26 All further decisions to &#8213;equitize&#8214; (part-privatize) public health entities must be 
critically assessed in the light of deleterious impacts on the right to health, and the impact on 
accessibility for vulnerable groups in particular. 
</p>
<p>18. In order to ensure adequate public funding for health services at the provincial, 
district and local levels, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to consider 
alternative revenue-generating mechanisms, such as progressive taxation, instead of relying 
solely on privatization. During the mission, it was indicated that the Government is 
considering an excise tax on tobacco products and a step increase in the social insurance tax 
from 4.5 to 6 per cent to generate funds to be directed toward public health expenditures. 
Such measures would be welcome developments. Furthermore, in order to reduce costs and 
facilitate efficient public spending on health care, the Government must take additional 
steps. For instance, it must consider reforming the fee-for-service payment system to one 
that better controls costs, such as capitation or bundled payments.27 This would protect the 
user from abuse of services and lead to lower costs for the health system as a whole.

<p>19. As part of the shift from a fully public health-care system to a mixed one, the 
Government has developed a national social health insurance programme (SHI) and 
instituted user fees. Commendably, the Government has also attempted to address some of 
the concerns arising from this restructuring by introducing programmes specifically 
targeting the poor and the near poor, such as the Health Care Funds for the Poor policy, 
which has now been incorporated into the SHI as health insurance for the poor (HIP). As 
currently implemented,28 the SHI comprises two types of insurance: compulsory health 
insurance and voluntary health insurance. Compulsory health insurance, created in 1992, 
was initially limited to formal sector employees, retirees, war veterans, the disabled and 
select other groups. However, it has since expanded to include the poor, near poor, ethnic 
minorities, and persons from communes in difficult socio-economic circumstances, through 
Health Care Funds for the Poor, and children under 6, through a pre-existing policy 
providing free health-care for this group. Formal sector employees are compulsorily 
enrolled and a premium is drawn from their salary accounts, while those covered under HIP 
receive 100 per cent support for their premium from the State and children under 6 do not 
pay any premium at all. Voluntary health insurance currently covers all persons ineligible 
for compulsory health insurance, including students and farm workers. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for its commitment to expanding 
the scope of SHI coverage, as demonstrated by the fact that SHI expenditure as a proportion 
of total public health spending rose from 7.9 per cent to 17.6 per cent between 2005 and 
2008.29 The SHI, however, in its current form still does not adequately ensure universal access 
to health care. Health insurance coverage is still relatively low, standing at 60 per cent.30 
Moreover, although HIP has allowed many vulnerable groups to gain access to care, the 
scheme requires refinement in order to ensure physical and economic accessibility for the 
poor, near poor and ethnic minorities. For example, there are significant problems with 
respect to the portability of benefits. All insured persons are registered at the nearest local 
health facility once they enrol in SHI. While enrollees can obtain a letter of referral from their 
designated facility in order to change their designation, it is difficult to do so and therefore 
referrals are infrequently obtained.31 Moreover, many communal health centres are incapable 
of referring patients to higher levels because they have not yet been incorporated into the 
institutional system. Even when referrals are made, district and provincial health-care 
facilities are often hesitant to accept such patients&#8212;though they are required by law to do 
so&#8212;due to the lengthy and complicated processing procedures necessary to obtain 
reimbursement. This is particularly problematic for HIP enrollees, most of whom are 
registered at the commune level, where services are limited and the quality of services is 
perceived to be poorer as compared to the district and provincial level.32 
</p>
<p>21. There is also a concern that not all populations in need benefit from subsidized 
coverage under SHI. Under the compulsory health insurance programme, only the 
individual worker is covered and not his or her dependents.33 In 1991, the Government 
introduced a programme that provides free health insurance for all children under 6. 
</p>
<p>  
 28 The current health insurance regime is implemented in Viet Nam in accordance with the Law on 
</p>
<p>Health Insurance, which was adopted by the National Assembly in 2008 and entered into force on 1 
July 2009.

<p>However, the implementation of this programme has been limited and, according to some 
reports, there are still approximately 1 million children under 6 who are not yet enrolled in 
the scheme.34 Moreover, according to the Government, nearly 1 million children under 6&#8212;
12 per cent of all children under 6&#8212;have not yet received their insurance cards. In the 
interim, however, the Government notes that children may use their birth certificate instead 
of an insurance card to receive health insurance benefits. Considering the serious problems 
in Viet Nam relating to the malnourishment of children under 5,35 it is essential that the 
Government make all efforts to ensure that all children under 6 are enrolled in the SHI and 
have uninterrupted access to health insurance benefits under the programme.  
</p>
<p>22. Additionally, access to insurance benefits for all SHI enrollees is further constrained 
because local public health facilities are allowed to establish private wards for fee-paying 
patients.36 These patients may thus gain access to better quality care than insured patients, 
including on-demand services such as choice of doctor, choice of room and choice of 
scanning technology. As a result, critical modalities of treatment and necessary space are 
allotted to fee-paying patients, while insured patients may be forced to seek treatment 
elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the Government&#8217;s commitment to the 
poor under HIP, however, there are a number of concerns regarding both the scope and 
coverage of the programme. While HIP provides full health insurance coverage for the poor 
and 50 per cent coverage for the near poor,37 it appears to have reduced out-of-pocket 
expenditures only by 13 per cent.38 This reduction is not sufficient to ensure financially 
accessible health care required under the right to health, because out-of-pocket expenditures 
account for nearly 50 per cent of all household health expenditures in Viet Nam.39  
</p>
<p>24. Moreover, catastrophic health costs in Viet Nam have steadily remained at 
approximately 12 per cent.40 While under HIP the poor should not have to make co-
payments for covered services, in reality they are often required to make such payments.41 
Additionally, studies suggest that while those who are enrolled in HIP are entitled to the 
same benefits as those enrolled in other forms of the SHI, in fact, they often receive fewer 
benefits.42 This is especially true for people under the direct reimbursement model, in part 
because providers must often wait long periods of time for government reimbursement.  
</p>
<p>25. The poor and near poor, especially those in rural and mountainous areas 
predominantly populated by ethnic minorities, are often burdened by additional 
expenditures on food, travel and accommodation in order to access basic health services. In 
many instances, these expenditures amount to more than the cost of the health services 
sought. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Government of its decision to increase 
the level of reimbursement for basic health services for the near poor from 50 per cent to 70 
per cent since 2012, along with subsidies for travel and food expenses for the poor. The 
Special Rapporteur commends this development, but cautions that there is a need for more 
robust support for the poor and near poor in order to fully realize their right to health.

<p>Moreover, even these subsidies will be undermined if informal payments to health 
providers, or &#8213;envelope&#8214; payments, are not addressed. Envelope payments increase out-of-
pocket expenditures for all users in the health system and impede access to health-care 
goods and services for the poor and the near poor. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government recognizes that there are concerns about the general quality of health 
care, both public and private. During the mission, Government officials further acknowledged 
that particular populations have voiced complaints regarding the quality of health-care 
services, especially in rural areas. The rural-urban disparity in health-care quality is of 
significant concern to the Special Rapporteur. The disparity is more apparent at the communal 
level and for persons enrolled under HIP than at higher service levels or for those with other 
versions of the SHI. The right to health requires the Government to ensure that good quality 
health goods and services are available and physically and economically accessible without 
discrimination for all segments of the population, regardless of geographic location. 
</p>
<p>27. Rural-urban disparity is not unique to Viet Nam. In most countries, the quality of 
health care in rural areas is inferior to that available in urban areas, and is often at an 
unacceptably low level. In Viet Nam, the issue is exacerbated by the fact that ethnic 
minorities live predominantly in rural areas, and are thus especially vulnerable. The 
Government has a special obligation to ensure that vulnerable groups, including ethnic 
minorities, have access to good quality health goods and services. Ethnic minorities in Viet 
Nam also face widening disparities in the provision of social services, including education, 
and access to water and sanitation.43 The right to health requires States to ensure access for 
all to the underlying determinants of health, including safe and potable water, adequate 
sanitation, housing, food and health-related education.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Access to medicines 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Drug procurement: international reference pricing and decentralization  
</b></p>
<p>28. As the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights underlines in its general 
comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, State 
parties have an obligation to provide access to safe, efficacious and affordable medicines, 
and to ensure access for vulnerable populations, such as ethnic minorities, the rural poor 
and people living with HIV. The obligation to fulfil the right to health requires States to 
adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial, promotional and other 
measures towards achieving full realization of the right to health. In the case of access to 
medicines, this means adopting policies that ensure safe, efficacious and affordable 
medicines are available.   
</p>
<p>29. Prices for some medicines in Viet Nam are substantially higher than in other 
countries that are similarly economically situated, and in many instances even higher than 
similar medicines in high-income countries.44 Although Viet Nam has reduced poverty 
levels considerably, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) remains relatively low and a 
sizeable portion of the population is still impoverished. The country&#8217;s per capita GDP is 
currently about US$ 1,300 per year, placing it in the world&#8217;s bottom third.45 As previously 
indicated, the majority of health-care expenditures are out-of-pocket expenditures, and

<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>medicine purchases constitute the bulk of those expenditures.46 Rising medicines costs will 
thus result in an even greater portion of household income devoted to health expenditures. 
Therefore even small increases in medicines prices will result in reduced accessibility of 
drugs for much of the country&#8217;s population, especially vulnerable populations, including the 
poor and near poor. The State&#8217;s responsibility under the right to health therefore includes a 
strong imperative to ensure low medicine prices. 
</p>
<p>30. In 1989, Viet Nam began to liberalize the pharmaceutical sector through measures 
such as the reduction of restraints on the production and sale of pharmaceuticals. Soon 
after, medicines prices increased many times their international reference prices and 
became increasingly unaffordable for most people, according to some reports.47 In 2003, the 
Government acknowledged the problem and issued Circular 08, which provided guidelines 
for price management for essential medicines. Unfortunately, the Circular was unsuccessful 
in reducing medicine prices. In 2004, the Government issued Decree 120,48 which was the 
first legal instrument specifically designed to control medicine prices. Joint Circular 
No. 11/2007/TTLT-BYT-BTC-BCT was later implemented to control wholesale mark-ups 
of medicines in the supply chain through the declaration of a reasonable wholesale price to 
the Ministry of Health. Through a series of other decrees and circulars, the Government of 
Viet Nam has attempted to establish a system of international reference pricing to control 
the price of medicines.49 The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for 
recognizing the gravity of the matter and seeking to address it. He cautions that the 
measures currently in place to control drug prices are both inadequate and unenforced, and 
calls on the Government to critically assess its current price referencing system. 
</p>
<p>31. Viet Nam seeks to control medicines prices through international reference pricing. 
International or external reference pricing is &#8213;the practice of using the price(s) of a 
pharmaceutical product in one or several countries in order to derive a benchmark or 
reference price for the purposes of setting or negotiating the price of the product in a given 
country&#8214;.50 Reference pricing is only effective at securing the lowest-priced drugs when the 
level of economic development in the countries selected as reference points is similar to 
that of the purchasing country. However, according to some reports, while a tentative list of 
reference countries has been suggested, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand 
and the Philippines, no reference country basket has yet been adopted.51 In addition to the 
selection of a basket of reference countries, international reference pricing must specify 
both the type of price for comparison and the standard of pricing. The type of price refers to 
the point on the supply chain at which the price is assessed. Because prices differ at each 
level of the supply chain (for example, the wholesale price will be different from the price 
at point of purchase), specification of the appropriate type of price is essential to setting an 
effective benchmark with which prices in Viet Nam are to be compared. The type of price 
to be used in the comparison, however, has not been specified by the decrees.

 48 Decree 120 was superseded by other acts, including the 2006 Decree 79/2006/ND-CP.   
 49 Four key Government Decrees and Circulars, Nos. 08, 120, 11 and 79, have provided the general 
</p>
<p>guidelines and legal mechanisms for government pharmaceutical procurement policy and price 
control. Of these Decrees, Nos. 11 and 79 established the current medicines pricing system in Viet 
Nam.

</b></p>
<p>32. Further, the pricing standard used in Decrees 120 and 79 is the highest price 
standard compared to medicines in the same category. This standard allows for the 
reference price to be &#8213;no higher than&#8214; the highest price found in the reference countries for 
the same category of medicine.52 The problems stemming from this price standard were 
sought to be corrected by Joint Circular No. 11/2007/TTLT-BYT-BTC-BCT, which uses an 
average price standard, meaning that medicines must be no higher than the average price 
for the same medicine found in reference countries. However, even if an average price 
standard is used and if the reference basket includes some countries that have very high 
drug prices, then the average price will be artificially buoyed.  
</p>
<p>33. Even if the flaws in the current system are addressed, however, studies indicate that 
international reference pricing is open to manipulation by pharmaceutical companies.53 
International reference pricing, if used at all, should be utilized in conjunction with other 
price control mechanisms. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government 
to explore alternative mechanisms to ensure that medicines are procured at the lowest prices 
possible, thereby maximizing access to medicines as required by the right to health. 
</p>
<p>34. The decentralization process has exacerbated problems relating to access to 
medicines in Viet Nam. The Government has shifted some drug procurement 
responsibilities to the provincial and district level authorities along with other health-care 
management responsibilities. In doing so, it has unnecessarily forfeited its bargaining 
power as a bulk purchaser. This will likely lead to higher medicine prices and greatly varied 
costs of medicines throughout the country. Additionally, the purchase of medicines by sub-
national institutions is made through a tendering process, as compared to direct 
purchasing.54 While two circulars have granted the Ministry of Health the authority to set 
maximum tender prices, the Ministry has not yet determined the way forward, and therefore 
no maximum tender price list exists.55 Lack of maximum tender prices and the reduced 
bargaining power of sub-national buyers have worked together to apply further upward 
pressure on medicines prices, thus negatively impacting realization of the right to health.56 
</p>
<p><b> B. Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the country&#8217;s negotiations towards the 
adoption of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) with a view to increasing 
exports for the country. The TPPA is a multilateral free trade agreement among Brunei, 
Chile, New Zealand and Singapore that first entered into force in 2006. Six additional 
countries are now in negotiations to join the agreement: Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, 
the United States of America and Viet Nam. The TPPA is meant to further liberalize the 
economies of the Asia-Pacific region and increase trade among members of the agreement. 
In negotiating free trade agreements, States bear responsibility for ensuring compliance 
with pre-existing legal obligations, including commitments under international human 
rights treaties. Under article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, Viet Nam is obliged to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health. The 
obligation to respect requires that States do not interfere with the right to health. Thus Viet 
Nam must ensure that any agreement it enters into does not interfere with the availability

</p>
<p>and accessibility of safe, efficacious and affordable medicines, as required under the right 
to health. 
</p>
<p>36. Of the countries currently involved in the negotiation of the TPPA, Viet Nam is by 
far the least economically developed. As previously stated, most recent estimates place the 
per capita GDP of Viet Nam at approximately US$ 1,300. Peru, which is most closely 
situated to Viet Nam among the negotiating parties, has a per capita GDP of over 
US$ 5,500; the remaining parties, including the United States and Australia, have 
substantially higher per capita GDP figures. Less developed economies rely heavily upon 
the availability of generic medicines in order to make medicines affordable for the majority 
of their populations. As stated in earlier reports of the Special Rapporteur, intellectual 
property protections increase drug prices by restricting or preventing generic 
pharmaceutical competition from entering the market (see, for example, A/HRC/11/12). If 
recent draft versions are any indication, the final version of the TPPA is likely to contain 
provisions that significantly alter the scope of Vietnamese intellectual property law, as the 
agreement would be primarily oriented towards benefiting more economically developed 
countries. Most of the other negotiating countries currently employ greater intellectual 
property protections and will seek to maintain at least their current levels of protection in 
the agreement. If Viet Nam adopts recent drafts of the TPPA, it will delay or prohibit low-
cost generic drugs from entering the market, further restricting access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>37. During the mission, Government officials informed the Special Rapporteur that the 
Government of Viet Nam is interested in promoting the growth of its domestic generic 
pharmaceutical industry in order to ensure the availability of low-cost medicines and to 
promote development. While this is welcome, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to realistically assess the numerous and complex challenges involved in 
developing such local industries. Large-scale generic medicine production would serve to 
reduce medicine prices and further the economic development of Viet Nam. Intellectual 
property provisions in recent drafts of the TPPA, however, would make it very difficult, if 
not impossible, for generic drug manufacturers to enter and remain viable in the market. 
</p>
<p>38. The negotiating power of Viet Nam is weaker than that of the more developed 
countries in the TPPA negotiations, due to the country&#8217;s greater need for increased access 
to developed country markets. In addition, Viet Nam is more likely to have fewer resources 
devoted to the negotiations and less technical capacity to interpret the intellectual property 
provisions of the agreement in order to determine their impact on the right to health.  
</p>
<p>39. The decision-making process followed by Viet Nam during the TPPA negotiations 
has lacked transparency and has not involved the participation of civil society and affected 
communities. This is despite concerns raised by civil society organizations about potential 
adverse impact on the right to health in Viet Nam in the event of the adoption of the TPPA. 
The participation of the population in all health-related decision-making at the community, 
national and international levels is an important aspect of the right to health.57 Allowing 
input from civil society and affected communities groups during the TPPA negotiations is 
therefore essential. Additionally, input from these stakeholders will strengthen the 
Government&#8217;s capacity to critically assess the draft agreement in order to, among other 
things, ensure access to affordable medicines in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>40. If adopted on the basis of recent drafts, the TPPA may limit the use of Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) flexibilities and introduce 
</p>
<p>  
 57 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 14, para. 11. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/15/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>TRIPS-plus provisions.58 For example, the TPPA would eliminate pre-grant oppositions to 
patents in Viet Nam. Pre-grant oppositions allow third parties to challenge the legitimacy of 
a patent application prior to completion of the review process by the patent authority. Pre-
grant opposition is critical in countries with reduced technical capacity to review patents 
because it allows interested third parties with additional capacity to supplement the review 
process. Moreover, the elimination of pre-grant oppositions may delay the entrance of 
generic drugs into the market because generic producers must wait to challenge patents in 
separate proceedings following review by the patent authority. Such limitations will further 
increase medicine prices, as evidenced by the experience of other countries.59 Numerous 
recent studies have demonstrated the pricing impact of free trade agreements that introduce 
TRIPS-plus provisions, such as expanded data exclusivity protections, or that restrict the 
use of TRIPS flexibilities.60 
</p>
<p>41. Increased medicine prices not only affect the individual but also have serious 
implications for the sustainability of the entire health system. Expenditures on medicines 
account for the majority of health-care costs in Viet Nam, amounting to approximately 60 
per cent of all health expenditures. Prices for medicines have increased substantially in 
recent years, and this trend appears likely to continue. Unless the Government of Viet Nam 
intervenes by improving its drug procurement and pricing regulations and ensures that 
access to medicines is not restricted by the TPPA, the overall health system may become 
crippled by excessive medicine prices. With a view to ensuring the accessibility of 
medicines in Viet Nam, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that, if 
Viet Nam accedes to the TPPA, it retains the ability to use all TRIPS flexibilities and that it 
does not accept TRIPS-plus measures and/or expand intellectual property protections 
beyond that which currently exist under Vietnamese law. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Prevention and control of HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>42. The number of people living with HIV in Viet Nam remains high, despite an 
apparent stabilization in the rate of seroconversion. While HIV prevalence according to 
official statistics is among the lowest in the region, at 0.47 per cent for people aged 15 to 
49,61 due to the country&#8217;s large population the absolute number of affected individuals is 
significant. The official reported number of people living with HIV in Viet Nam is 
244,656,62 but other sources estimate that the number is higher.63 Lack of accurate official 
data, in part a product of underreporting, is a systemic concern. The role of epidemiological 
surveillance and data collection in realizing the right to health, in particular with respect to 
the prevention, treatment and control of diseases, is paramount. Accurate data is essential in

 62 As of 30 September 2011, according to the information received from the Government of Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>in April 2012.  
 63 For example, one report indicates that the number of people living with HIV in Viet Nam in 2010 was 
</p>
<p>254,387 (WHO, UNAIDS and UNICEF, <i>Global HIV/AIDS Response: Epidemic Updated and Health 
Sector Progress towards Universal Access-Progress Report 2011</i> (2010), p. 104). UNAIDS estimated 
the total in 2009 to be 280,000 (<i>UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic</i> (2010), p. 111.  </p>

</p>
<p>order to identify disease trends, design effective interventions, and monitor and evaluate 
these interventions. Deficiencies in HIV/AIDS data and statistics represent a barrier to 
addressing the epidemic in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>43. Problems of data collection and intervention design are exacerbated by the 
stigmatization of vulnerable groups. The Commission on AIDS in Asia confirmed that the 
HIV epidemic in Asia is largely driven by vulnerable groups, including female sex workers 
(FSWs), injecting drug users (IDUs) and men who have sex with men (MSM).64 
Stigmatization and discrimination of IDUs, FSWs and MSM often arises from, and is 
perpetuated by, criminalization (or de facto criminalization) of the activities of these 
groups. Stigma contributes to the spread of the epidemic by deterring affected individuals 
from accessing such health services as HIV testing and treatment for fear of criminal 
sanctions, violence and discrimination. Furthermore, stigmatization and discrimination 
present barriers to the development and implementation of preventative measures tailored 
to the needs of these vulnerable groups.   
</p>
<p>44. International donors provide about 70 per cent of all HIV/AIDS funding in Viet 
Nam.65 As Viet Nam has grown into a lower middle-income country, however, international 
donors have already begun to reduce funding. The reduction in funding has affected 
HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care programmes and the effect will worsen as donors 
continue to reduce their support. The Government of Viet Nam should take measures to 
ensure that adequate resources are channelled into HIV/AIDS programmes as international 
funding decreases. The measures should aim not only to maintain current levels of prevention, 
treatment and care for people living with HIV, but also to expand these programmes in future, 
as it is likely that even less international support will be available then.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Detention and de facto criminalization 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur has commented extensively, in previous reports, on the 
negative impacts of criminalization and stigmatization on the right to health of sex workers 
and people who use drugs (PWUD) (see, for example, A/HRC/14/20 and A/65/255). The 
HIV/AIDS epidemic in Viet Nam is aggravated by the de facto criminalization of drug use 
and sex work. In Viet Nam, sex work and drug use are classified as social evils and are 
amenable to administrative penalties.66 PWUD and FSWs can be referred to &#8213;rehabilitation 
centres&#8214; and detained in order to receive compulsory treatment for 3 to 18 months, in the 
case of FSWs, and 1 to 4 years, in the case of PWUD. The law also applies to minors aged 
12 to 18 years. Deprivations of liberty resulting from administrative sanction in Viet Nam 
are indistinguishable from criminal detention, and thus generate and perpetuate the 
stigmatization of PWUD and FSWs. With regard to minors, article 37 (b) of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child explicitly provides that the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a 
child &#8213;shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period 
of time&#8214;. 
</p>

<p>governance and guidance of health, health care and the health industry of Viet Nam, it is 
not directly involved with health services delivery in the centres. 
</p>
<p>47. There are two categories of rehabilitation centres: &#8213;05 centres&#8214; for FSWs and &#8213;06 
centres&#8214; for PWUD. During meetings with representatives of the Ministry of Labour, 
Invalids and Social Affairs, the Special Rapporteur learned that there are 183 rehabilitation 
centres with 46,000 detainees (also called &#8213;learners&#8214;). Between 2000 and 2010, 
approximately 309,000 people, including minors, had been detained.67 The stated purpose 
of these centres is to &#8213;improve [the] health, living and occupational skills&#8214; of detainees and 
to &#8213;construct their awareness about the value of the labour, and their responsibilities toward 
themselves and their communities&#8214;.68 In order to accomplish these goals, the centres 
employ variety of approaches: labour therapy, moral education and vocational training. As 
a part of labour therapy, detainees are forced to perform labour for little to no remuneration. 
While some treatment for communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, is 
available in some of the centres, many centres do not possess adequate HIV/AIDS and 
tuberculosis prevention, treatment and care services.  
</p>
<p>48. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed that rehabilitation centres 
have been ineffective in dissuading drug use and sex work, which is their stated objective. 
The Special Rapporteur was also informed by a number of PWUD who had been detained 
in rehabilitation centres that they returned to using drugs upon their release. Furthermore, 
the majority of detainees currently in the centres have been detained at least once before.69 
</p>
<p>49. Compulsory detention in the centres raises serious concerns about the due process 
rights of detainees, because they have no right to formally challenge their determination as 
PWUD or FSWs prior to detention and after determination; in practice, it is effectively 
impossible to do so. Treatment in the centres is mandatory in the majority of cases. Thus 
detainees are denied the right to be free from non-consensual treatment and the right to 
informed consent, which are core components of the right to health. In its general comment 
No. 14, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights holds that: &#8213;The right to 
health contains both freedoms and entitlements. The freedoms include the right to control 
one&#8217;s health and body, including sexual and reproductive freedom, and the right to be free 
from interference, such as the right to be free from torture, non-consensual medical 
treatment and experimentation&#8214; (para. 8). According to the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime, &#8213;only in exceptional crisis situations of high risk to self or others can 
compulsory treatment be mandated for specific conditions and for short periods that are no 
longer than strictly clinically necessary&#8214;.70 
</p>
<p>50. The right to health requires the availability of good quality, evidence-based 
treatment. Treatment provided for PWUD and FSWs in rehabilitation centres is not 
evidence based. It is also ineffective, as demonstrated by high rates of relapse to drug use 
and the absence of evidence globally supporting the effectiveness of detention in preventing 
women from returning to sex work after release.71 The right to health further requires 
medical practitioners and other health professionals to meet adequate standards of

<p>education and skill. In 2008, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs reported 
that 49 per cent of the staff at centres had only primary level education, 15 per cent had 
received training in health care, and most had only a basic knowledge of HIV or overdose 
prevention.72 
</p>
<p>51. Rehabilitation centres are also counterproductive to the Government&#8217;s HIV/AIDS 
efforts. Persons detained in most centres do not receive adequate HIV/AIDS and 
tuberculosis prevention, treatment and care services.73 Although HIV prevalence is 
approximately 50 per cent in the centres, most lack even basic HIV services74 and there are 
currently only 14 centres that provide antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV.75 
</p>
<p>52. Furthermore, the threat of detention discourages at-risk and affected populations 
from seeking out HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care services. From discussions with 
health professionals, it became evident that many people living with HIV do not access 
health-care services until their health deteriorates to a terminal state. As a result, they die 
unacceptably premature deaths. In one regional hospital, visited by the Special Rapporteur, 
there were about five AIDS-related deaths per month. This provides strong evidence that 
the country&#8217;s response to HIV among PWUD is not working. It is unlikely that this number 
of AIDS-related deaths would occur in an environment free of stigmatization, including the 
threat of detention and non-consensual treatment.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Access to treatment and therapy 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the law in Viet Nam does not effectively 
distinguish between drug use and drug dependence. Drug dependence is a chronic, 
relapsing disorder76 that involves psychosocial and biological factors, including altered 
brain function.77 By contrast, drug use is not a medical condition. Importantly, there is 
strong evidence supporting medical treatment for drug dependence, specifically opioid 
replacement therapy (ORT) for opioid dependence,78 while medical treatment is not 
indicated for drug use alone. Indeed, most PWUD do not develop a dependence disorder 
and therefore do not require medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that the Government of Viet Nam has 
implemented a number of pilot methadone maintenance therapy programmes. Following 
the visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that the Government has authorized the HIV/AIDS 
Prevention and Control Department of the Ministry of Health to approve a plan to scale up 
ORT programmes in the country. The Government also informed the Special Rapporteur 
after the visit that it was considering the issuance of a decree on ORT with a view to

<p>providing a legal framework for the introduction of ORT nationwide. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes both developments. 
</p>
<p>55. ORT programmes are cost-effective and have been demonstrated globally to be 
more effective in reducing drug use and facilitating the reintegration of people who are 
dependent on opioids back into the community (A/65/255, paras. 50-55). ORT also allows 
people to receive treatment while continuing their lives within the community, which has 
the additional benefit of de-stigmatizing people who are drug dependent. Moreover, given 
the existing evidence base confirming the safety and efficacy of ORT and the global 
acceptance and adoption of such therapy as an effective medical treatment for drug 
dependence, clinical testing of ORT in Viet Nam is unnecessary. In its current guidelines 
on the subject, WHO acknowledges the strength of the evidence in favour of ORT in 
reducing drug use, criminal activity, HIV risk behaviours and transmission, as well as 
overall mortality.79 The Guidelines recommend that the following procedures, among 
others, be adopted in all settings as minimal requirements for treatment of opioid 
dependence: widely accessible pharmacological treatment, to be administered by trained 
health care professionals; mandatory informed consent for all treatment; and psychosocial 
support for all opioid dependent patients.80 
</p>
<p>56. In the light of all of the above, it is the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view that the existence 
and continuation of rehabilitation centres violate the right to health.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur, however, notes with satisfaction that the draft 
administrative reform law pending at the National Assembly would expand key due process 
protections for PWUD and discontinue detention of FSWs in rehabilitation centres. These 
changes are welcome and would have significant positive health impacts, especially with 
respect to HIV/AIDS. The Special Rapporteur was also pleased to learn that the 
Government was planning to review and reorganize the system of rehabilitation centres 
towards investing in small and medium-sized voluntary drug treatment centres at the 
community level. There is also a perspective within the Government and the National 
Assembly that favours the closure of centres. The Special Rapporteur wholeheartedly 
supports the closure of the rehabilitation centres and recommends the implementation of 
alternative treatments for PWUD, including methadone treatment and community-based 
vocational training. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Participation in decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>58. The participation of affected populations in health decision-making is an essential 
component of the right to health. Community participation is vital for effective health 
governance at every level, including the collection of accurate data, the formulation of 
effective interventions, the successful implementation of those interventions, and the 
ongoing monitoring of their impact. In the <i>Joint Annual Health Review 2010</i> it was 
acknowledged that community and civil society participation in health-related decision-
making is limited. It is crucial that the Government encourage and incorporate inputs from 
affected populations in the provision of health-care services in order to effectively address 
the HIV epidemic in Viet Nam and improve the health system at large.  
</p>
<p>59. Participation in health-related decision-making is also critical to empowering 
vulnerable groups. Empowerment of affected populations, particularly IDUs, FSWs and

<p>MSM, will encourage community-guided and community-led initiatives towards raising 
awareness of the issues faced by these groups. Such initiatives will also help combat the 
stigmatization and discrimination in the society. This will assist with the rehabilitation of 
IDUs and their reintegration into the wider community, ultimately improving the health 
outcomes of these populations. Moreover, other experiences show that community-led 
initiatives are more sustainable in the long run. For these reasons, the Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government to facilitate the participation of vulnerable populations, 
including IDUs, FSWs and MSM, in the formulation and implementation of all decisions 
affecting their health. The Special Rapporteur also encourages community-based peer 
groups of current and former PWUD and FSWs, such as those currently operating in Hanoi, 
Hai Phong and Ho Chi Minh City, which offer support to PWUD and FSWs through group 
meetings, small loans, overdose prevention and connections to health and harm-reduction 
services. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the advances made in the 
overall health system of Viet Nam</b>, including the Government&#8217;s efforts to improve 
</p>
<p><b>child and maternal health and its stated commitment to ensuring access to health 
</b></p>
<p><b>goods and services for the poor and near poor.  
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Viet Nam to consider the 
following recommendations pertaining to its health system and health financing: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Complete an official assessment of the effects of privatization on the
