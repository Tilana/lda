<p>The education system in Seychelles has followed an exemplary path for a small 
island developing State of limited means. Policy measures and reforms have made it 
possible for Seychelles to meet the education-related Millennium Development Goals well 
before 2015. Seychelles must now continue to take measures to improve the quality of the 
education system, focusing on: improving the professional status of and social regard for 
the teaching profession; improving technical and vocational education and training; 
meeting social challenges, including promoting personal and social education in the face of 
social and behavioural problems among students; and intensifying normative action to 
respond to the imperatives of improving quality. Finally, as Seychelles continues to enjoy 
rapid economic development, its education system will need to adapt to ensure students are 
graduating with the necessary skills to meaningfully participate in a modernizing economy, 
and respond to the requirements of the &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221;.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, carried out an 
official visit to Seychelles from 15 to 22 October 2013, at the invitation of the Government.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur wishes to extend his deep gratitude to President James 
Michel and the Vice-President Danny Faure, for taking the time to meet with him and 
engage in a dialogue on the right to education. 
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with: Jean-Paul Adam, Minister for 
Foreign Affairs; Pierre Laporte, Minister of Finance, Trade and Investment; Idith 
Alexander, Minister for Employment and Human Resources Development; Vincent 
Meriton, Designated Minister for Community Development, Social Affairs and Sports; 
Rolph Payet, Minister of Environment and Energy; and senior officials at the Ministry of 
Education and the Ministry of Health. He also met with parliamentarians, the Ombudsman 
and the Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit a number of public and private 
educational institutions, including pre-primary, primary and secondary schools, as well as a 
technical post-secondary education institutions and the University of Seychelles. He also 
discussed questions related to education with the administration, management, teachers and 
students of these institutions on Mah&#233; Island. He met with several representatives from the 
international community and civil society, including from the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), a student council and numerous civil society organizations.  
5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government of Seychelles for 
its invitation and the full cooperation throughout his mission. He also extends his thanks to 
UNDP in Seychelles and all those who took time to meet with him and share their 
experiences in the field of education.  
</p>
<p><b>  General overview 
</b></p>
<p>6. Seychelles is a small island developing State, situated in the western Indian Ocean, 
consisting of a number of island groups. The three largest islands &#8212;&#8212; Mah&#233;, Praslin and 
La Digue &#8212;&#8212; are all connected by air and a rapid ferry service. Seychelles has a very 
small population of 90,9451 mostly concentrated on Mah&#233;, where 88 per cent of the 
population lives. Another 10 per cent lives on Praslin and La Digue, while the remaining 2 
per cent is scattered over the other islands. On Mah&#233;, 40 per cent of the population is 
located between Victoria, the capital and Seychelles International Airport, a belt of 7 square 
kilometres. This is the area in which most of the administrative and industrial activities take 
place. 
</p>
<p>7. A remarkable fact about Seychelles as a country with a multi-ethnic population is 
that it is multilingual: almost everyone speaks French and English. The population of 
Seychelles also speaks a local form of Creole, which is one of the official languages, along 
with French and English. Creole is the predominant mother tongue.

<p>8. According to the UNDP Human Development Index, Seychelles ranks forty-sixth 
worldwide for human development, with a rating of 0.806 (2013) &#8212;&#8212; the highest in 
Africa.<footnote name="2">2

</p>
<p>9. Before analysing the education system and the legal framework for the right to 
education, it is important to highlight international human rights standards and the 
importance Seychelles attaches to international legal obligations for the right to education. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p>10. Seychelles is party to many international human rights instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (both containing comprehensive provisions on the right to education). 
These instruments place an obligation on the State to take all the necessary steps to protect, 
promote and fulfil the right to education for all persons in its territory, without 
discrimination. At the regional level, Seychelles has ratified the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights, but has not yet ratified the protocol thereto which establishes the 
African Court of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>11. It is commendable that international human rights law occupies an eminent place in 
Seychelles. Article 48 of the Constitution of Seychelles (1993) provides that the 
Constitution shall be interpreted in accordance with its international obligations and directs 
the courts to take judicial note of: 
 (a) The international instruments containing these obligations; 
 (b) The reports and expression of views of bodies administering or enforcing 
these instruments; 
</p>
<p> (c) The reports, decisions or opinions of international and regional institutions 
administering or enforcing Conventions on human rights and freedoms; and 
</p>
<p> (d) The constitutions of other democratic States or nations and decisions of the 
courts of the States or nations in respect of their constitutions.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework for the right to education 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Constitution of Seychelles contains elaborate provisions on the right to 
education. Article 33 of the Constitution establishes the right of every citizen to education. 
With a view to ensuring the effective realization of this right, the State has undertaken: 
</p>
<p> (a) To provide compulsory education, which shall be free in State schools, for 
such minimum period, which shall not be less than 10 years, as may be prescribed by law; 
</p>
<p> (b) To ensure that the educational programmes in all schools are aimed at the 
complete development of the person; 
</p>
<p> (c) To afford, on the basis of intellectual capability, every citizen equal access to 
educational opportunities and facilities beyond the period of compulsory education; 
</p>
<p> (d) To allow, subject to such reasonable restrictions, supervision and conditions 
as are necessary in a democratic society, any person, organization or institution to establish 
and maintain a private school; and

</b></p>
<p> (e) To respect the right of parents to choose whether to send their children to a 
State or private school. 
</p>
<p>13. In addition, article 35 of the Constitution lays down the obligation to promote 
technical and vocational education and training.  
</p>
<p>14. The national legal framework on the right to education in Seychelles is 
comprehensive in covering education at all levels. The Education Act of 2004 provides for 
10 years of compulsory primary and secondary education. Subsection (2) of the Act 
provides for:  
</p>
<p> (a) The establishment of a comprehensive system of education and training 
reflecting universal and national values which promote the complete development of the 
person and equip the person to participate fully in social and economic development;  
</p>
<p> (b) The establishment of institutions for achieving the goals referred to in 
subparagraph (a); and  
 (c) The execution of the education policy of Seychelles.  
15. Article 40 of the Education Act provides that &#8220;all persons are entitled to receive an 
educational programme appropriate to their needs in accordance with the Act and 
regulations made thereunder. 
</p>
<p>16. The Tertiary Education Act of 20113 provides for two types of tertiary education: the 
university and &#8220;professional centres&#8221; that provide technical and vocational education and 
training. It also provides a legal framework for the establishment of the University of 
Seychelles. The Act describes the governance of both structures and aims to promote 
increased collaboration between private industry and professional training centres. In 
accordance with the right to education, the Act obliges learners to adhere to their rights, 
duties and responsibilities and places an obligation on the Government to improve access to 
tertiary education. It establishes the Tertiary Education Commission to advise the Minister 
for Education and coordinate the sustainable development of tertiary education at the 
national level.  
</p>
<p>17. The Seychelles Framework for Early Childhood Care and Education4 is a policy 
document that regulates the provision of three years of free, non-mandatory pre-primary 
care (cr&#232;che education). Although not mandatory, most parents take advantage of the cr&#232;che 
system. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur is appreciative that the legal framework contained in the 
Constitution and the education laws provides a solid foundation which ensures not just 10 
years of free and compulsory primary and secondary education, but also merit-based 
opportunities for further education, regardless of race, gender or social class. It is indeed 
encouraging that the Constitution also reflects the values enshrined in article 26 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including through the requirement that education 
policy be &#8220;aimed at the complete development of the person&#8221; (art. 33 (b) of the 
Constitution).

</p>
<p><b> IV. The education system in Seychelles 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Profile of the education system 
</b></p>
<p>19. Public education in Seychelles is comprehensive in terms of an entitlement for all 
children, without selection either owing to financial consideration or attainment. It is open 
to all students, regardless of their social or economic status or background. It is also 
integrated and inclusive, taking students of all religions and backgrounds, and 
accommodates children with disabilities. Finally, it is co-educational, with boys and girls 
studying together in schools.  
</p>
<p>20. The 2004 Education Act creates six stages of education: non-formal early childhood 
care (day care); formal early childhood education (also referred as cr&#232;che); primary 
education; secondary education; post-secondary or non-university tertiary education and 
training; and tertiary education. As mentioned above, the first 10 years of primary and 
secondary education are compulsory, with the final year of secondary open to academically 
qualified students.  
</p>
<p>21. The public school system covers all five stages of education. It consists of 34 pre-
primary facilities (cr&#232;ches), 29 primary schools and 12 secondary schools.5 The schools are 
on the islands of Mah&#233;, Praslin, La Digue and Silhouette. There are three full-time private 
schools: L&#8217;&#233;cole Fran&#231;aise, the International School and the Independent School.6 All the 
private schools are on Mah&#233;, although the International School also has a branch on Praslin. 
The majority of the student population is concentrated on Mah&#233; (88 per cent) with 8 per 
cent on Praslin and 4 per cent on La Digue. Secondary schools exist on Mah&#233;, Praslin and 
La Digue. However, tertiary education opportunities are only available on Mah&#233;.  
</p>
<p>22. A system of further and higher education is available free of charge to all Seychellois 
students who meet merit-based selection criteria required by the particular course of study 
or training for which the student applies. The introduction of a technical and vocational 
education and training programme into secondary schools, complemented by post-
secondary technical post-secondary institutions, is an important programmatic step. Full-
time post-secondary education institutions include the Seychelles Institute of Technology, 
the Seychelles Agricultural and Horticultural Training Centre, the Maritime Training 
Centre, the Seychelles Tourism Academy, the National Institute of Health and Social 
Studies, the School of Visual Arts, the School of Business Studies and the Seychelles 
Institute of Teacher Education.  
</p>
<p>23. The University of Seychelles, established in 2009, provides degree-level 
programmes in cooperation with the University of London in the fields of the sciences, arts 
and humanities and the social sciences. In addition, approximately 100 students annually 
receive scholarships based on academic merit to study at universities abroad. The creation 
of the University of Seychelles within the framework of the Constitutional provisions on 
higher education and the Tertiary Education Act of 2011 endows it with a firm legal 
foundation. The Constitution recognizes that every citizen must be afforded access with 
equal opportunities to post-secondary education, based on intellectual ability.  
</p>
<p>24. The overall school education profile depicted in the latest official data shows the 
need for expansion of the technical post-secondary schools system. In 2013, there were

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
  In addition to the three full-time private schools, there are number of privately owned and operated 
</p>
<p>schools covering certain stages of education. In 2013, nine such institutions were registered with 
Ministry of Education, operating either on a full-time or part-time basis. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>2,883 pre-school pupils, 8,652 primary school students, and 6,627 secondary school 
students.7 Technical post-secondary schools enrolled an additional 1,652 students, a decline 
compared to previous years owing to the merger of the business and education schools into 
the University of Seychelles. 
</p>
<p>25. A notable feature of the education system in Seychelles is that it is very heavily 
staffed by women. Teachers, school administrators and staff at the Ministry of Education 
are for the most part women.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Recent education reforms  
</b></p>
<p>26. In 1984, an education policy was designed to address the inequalities of the past, 
including limited access to education by girls and impoverished families, by providing 
educational opportunities for all children through the development of a comprehensive 
education system (CEDAW/C/SYC/1-5, para. 307). In 2000, the policy was revised to 
promote inclusiveness and equity, which it defined as: (a) equality of access to compulsory 
education; (b) equitable sharing of resources; (c) creating equal opportunities based on 
ability; (d) equality between sexes; and (e) assisting special needs learners (ibid., paras. 
307&#8211;<footnote name="3">3
 Seychelles, &#8220;The National Curriculum Framework&#8221;, p. 22. </footnote>08). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Education Reform Action Plan 2009&#8211;2010  
</b></p>
<p>27. Following a national economic crisis in 2007 and 2008, the Education Reform 
Action Plan 2009&#8211;2010 was launched to address concerns related to the administration of 
education, including staffing issues. This reform sought to further professionalize the 
administration of education. Its notable feature was a new wage bill, which increased 
teachers&#8217; salaries by 29 per cent in 2011, in response to high inflation rates in preceding 
years.8 Inflation has since been brought under control, but the purchasing power of teachers 
remains reduced, as the single increase of 29 per cent did not address ongoing price 
increases. 
</p>
<p>28. The Plan was developed to address some key priority concerns for education 
development. The aim was that it achieve five goals: 
</p>
<p> (a) Provide for the diversity of educational needs and national development;  
 (b) Guarantee quality education in schools; 
 (c) Enhance the quality of teaching; 
 (d) Improve the governance of educational institutions; and 
 (e) Create better possibilities for students to be empowered, with a sense of 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>29. The Plan included a number of practical measures to implement those goals. They 
included the introduction of a network of psychosocial support for children who were 
experiencing difficulties in adapting to school life owing to difficult situations at home or in 
the immediate neighbourhood, such as parental drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, 
or child abuse and neglect.9 The Plan also increased the number of assistant teachers in

<p>classrooms to improve numeracy and literacy from early childhood (cr&#232;che to second 
grade). In order to cater to students in need, it introduced measures to give greater attention 
to both students who do well academically and those who have learning problems and to 
create an environment where both types of students can progress.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Education Sector Medium Term Strategy 2013&#8211;2017  
</b></p>
<p>30. In the course of dialogue with the Special Rapporteur, the authorities informed him 
of the latest education reform plan, launched in 2013, the Education Sector Medium Term 
Strategy (MTS) 2013&#8211;2017. This is an ambitious, multi-stakeholder approach to education 
reform. Overseen by the national ministerial cabinet and the Ministry of Education and 
supported by the Ministry of Finance, the Strategy is marked by the engagement of many 
education stakeholders, including international partner organizations, related government 
ministries, as well as parents and the community to collectively develop an action plan to 
progressively improve the delivery of education. The Special Rapporteur deems it important 
for all voices to be encouraged and heard in order to ensure that this democratic approach 
builds upon available experience in a future-oriented spirit. He encourages both political 
and educational leaders to promote more inclusive and decentralized decision-making to 
ensure that practitioners, whether teachers, school administrators or staff in the Ministry of 
Education are actively encouraged to share their views and experiences to give future 
reform efforts the greatest chances of success.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights in education 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Government has recently taken measures to better integrate its international 
human rights obligations into its domestic legal order and policymaking. In October 2012, 
the Government established the Seychelles Human Rights Treaty Committee, co-chaired by 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General, and composed of government 
representatives and civil society. The primary task of the Committee is to develop the 
national human rights action plan, which will incorporate the country&#8217;s obligations under 
international human rights treaties to which Seychelles is a State party into national law and 
policy. The Special Rapporteur is supportive of those efforts to mainstream human rights in 
government ministries and policymaking. In addition to strengthening the application of the 
right to education in national policies and institutions, that approach will also reinforce 
human rights for women, children and people in vulnerable situations. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Financing education 
</b></p>
<p>32. Investment in education is an obligation of States under human rights law, and the 
resources allocated to the education sector on an enduring basis bear witness to the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to the development of education in Seychelles. Education-
related spending has averaged around 20 per cent of the national budget since 1998 
(CEDAW/C/SYC/1-5, table 8),) normally more than 4 per cent of gross domestic product. 
Spending on education was around 19 per cent in 2010,10 and such a consistent level of 
spending provides the predictable support needed to enable continuous planning and 
improvement.

<p><b> V. Achievements  
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the progress he observed in Seychelles in 
implementing the right to education throughout the country. He would like to mention some 
notable features. 
</p>
<p>34. In 2009, the Government introduced a Dedicated Fund in line with economic 
reforms. Money from the Fund is allocated to all public schools to ensure that no child is 
deprived of necessities that would affect them attending school, such as school uniforms, 
bus passes, day school meals, etc. An inexpensive and affordable school meals programme 
providing midday meals for students has been introduced.11  
</p>
<p>35. Tuition and school books are free for pre-primary, primary and secondary education 
in Seychelles. Parents are required to purchase uniforms for primary and secondary schools, 
though this was not considered as a serious financial burden; uniforms are paid through the 
Dedicated Fund for students with meagre means. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
emphasize the importance of such targeted support for disadvantaged students. 
</p>
<p>36. Such social services are important in contributing to better student learning 
achievements. School-based counsellors are provided for psychosocial support,12 although it 
was noted during the visit that not all schools appeared to have qualified psychologists as 
counsellors. A school health programme provides immunization and medical services, 
including in some cases dental services.13 Youth workers conduct after-school programmes 
for children related to sports. Finally, the Pastoral Care Programme has been implemented 
to address behavioural problems. The Special Rapporteur, however, notes that it is difficult 
to establish the effectiveness of these programmes, as monitoring tools and metrics were not 
readily available to school administrators.  
</p>
<p>37. The provision of free, compulsory education without discrimination, coupled with 
targeted financial support and reasonable social support in schools have contributed to 
Seychelles having achieved its education-related Millennium Development Goals before the 
2015 target date. Primary school enrolment has averaged 99 per cent from 1991 to 2012, 
and graduation averages are also very high.14 Male and female literacy rates average 95 per 
cent, with girls staying in school longer, and achieving higher grades and graduation levels, 
than boys.15<b>  
</b></p>
<p>38. The education system in Seychelles has followed an exemplary path for a small 
island developing State of limited means. Policy measures and reforms have made it 
possible for Seychelles to meet the education-related Millennium Development Goals well 
before 2015.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur was informed that girls are performing increasingly better in 
national examinations as compared to boys. An African Development Bank report in 2009 
noted that girls outperform boys in all subjects across the curriculum.16 The gap is wider in 
languages, such as English, French and Creole, but it is also apparent in subjects like 
mathematics and sciences, which were traditionally male-dominated subjects. Boys make

activities.  
</p>
<p>40. The inauguration in late 2010 of the University of Seychelles is a landmark as 
regards the provision of tertiary education. In 2012, the university had about 300 students in 
12 degree programmes, and the desire is to make it an educational hub for the region.17 The 
Government has planned to have at least one university graduate per household.18 Nearly 95 
per cent of students pursuing higher studies at the university benefit from government 
scholarships. Moreover, the university itself has a scholarship scheme that is funded by 
donations from individuals and the private sector. That is a commendable example of 
Seychelles fulfilling its obligation under article 13, paragraph 2 (c), of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provides that &#8220;higher education 
shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, 
and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>41. The University of Seychelles operates in collaboration with the University of 
London International Programmes, and degrees are awarded from both universities. The 
University has also formalized partnerships with other universities, including Universit&#233; de 
Paris 1 Panth&#233;on-Sorbonne in France, the Edith Cowan University in Australia, the TERI 
University in India and the Ocean University of China<i>.</i>19  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur hopes that Seychelles will continue to build on such 
achievements, placing education high on the national development agenda, as both the 
President and the Vice-President of Seychelles have previously been Ministers of 
Education, and their political commitment is an asset for raising the profile of the right to 
education. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Key challenges 
</b></p>
<p>43. A number of concerns were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur during 
his visit. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges facing the teaching profession 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the state of the teaching 
profession in Seychelles. There is a growing shortage of Seychellois teachers, particularly 
highly educated ones. That is related to the decline in the reputation and status of the 
profession, as well as difficult working conditions for teachers and limited career prospects.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. The retention of teachers 
</b></p>
<p>45. The retention of teachers, particularly new teachers and those with a university 
degree, is an issue which also deserves attention. During a visit to a primary school, several 
male teachers with whom the Special Rapporteur spoke expressed their dissatisfaction, and

<p>even their intention to leave the profession once their mandatory teaching period expires.20 
The economy of Seychelles has diversified in recent decades, and it offers secondary school 
leavers and university graduates an ever increasing number of jobs which pay more and 
offer less challenging working conditions than teaching. The Special Rapporteur learned 
that well-performing students aspire to &#8220;white collar&#8221; positions or more lucrative positions 
within the private sector and the dominant tourism industry. Dedicated teachers are also 
increasingly faced with disciplinary problems among students and must cope with growing 
administrative workloads. The recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession 
are a matter of immediate concern. The number of teachers is declining, particularly those 
who are new and highly educated, and replacement expatriate teachers are often more costly 
and at times less effective owing to limited local language skills, including Creole skills.  
</p>
<p>46. The lack of students interested in pursuing a teaching career is the result of a decline 
in the reputation and attraction of the profession. The rise of disruptive children and the 
increase in households experiencing social ills suggests that teaching conditions will 
continue to become more difficult. The persistence of inadequate remuneration and working 
conditions may lead to the deterioration of teaching profession. The profession must be 
made more attractive to ensure a sufficient number of quality graduates seek to pursue the 
profession. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Teacher qualifications and working conditions 
</b></p>
<p>47. According to the Government, in 2009, approximately 90 per cent of teachers had 
teacher training qualifications, and 28 per cent were trained to degree level and above 
(CEDAW/C/SYC/1-5, para. 341). The majority of the untrained teachers were working at 
the pre-primary and primary level. There has been an acute shortage of teachers at the 
secondary level, where approximately 25 per cent of staff is composed of expatriate 
teachers.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the establishment of the University of 
Seychelles was intended to be a cost-effective way to train more degree-level teachers 
without incurring the high costs of university education abroad. Locally educated students 
are also less likely to seek postgraduate employment overseas. However, with fewer than 10 
students enrolled in the bachelor of education programme at the time of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, it appears that many academically qualified students do not wish to 
pursue such a degree. It is hoped that the Seychelles Institute of Teacher Education, 
established in January 2014, will assist in addressing those challenges. 
</p>
<p>49. Teachers also face problems related to a lack of discipline and respect among 
students. Efforts to engage parents through School Councils -have only been partially 
effective; in the worst cases, parents blame the teachers for the problems, rather than resolve 
them. The lack of a specific mentorship programme for male teachers to help them cope 
when first joining the profession is also a drawback. The Special Rapporteur supports the 
idea of such a programme, extended to all new teachers, as the challenges of controlling a 
classroom are not easily taught in an academic setting. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Teaching salaries 
</b></p>
<p>50. Teacher remuneration remains a contentious issue in Seychelles. Teachers are 
relatively poorly paid compared to other positions requiring some level of post-secondary 
education. That makes it particularly difficult to attract and retain well-educated teachers. It

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20
 Teachers who receive government scholarships to study at university, in Seychelles or abroad, are 
</p>
<p>required to teach in Seychelles for a period of time, or must repay the financial assistance they 
received. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>was also reported that teachers with academic degrees do not receive additional 
compensation for their qualifications. In a meeting with male primary school teachers, the 
Special Rapporteur was made party to the feelings of dissatisfaction within the teaching 
profession. Whereas pay levels for the teaching profession were low, more lucrative jobs 
could be sought in working in industry and for enterprises. In particular, the salary structure 
of teachers should provide for additional pay for additional education qualifications, ideally 
at levels comparable to other degree-level graduates in the public sector. If the standard of 
teachers is to be raised, the incentives to improve their qualifications must also be raised, 
while improving social regard for the teaching profession.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Temporary and contract teachers 
</b></p>
<p>51. The acute shortage of Seychellois, qualified teachers has prompted the Government 
to fill the gap by recruiting non-national teachers. The Special Rapporteur suggests that this 
measure should only be used as an emergency one, as it creates a number of concerns. Some 
of those were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur by education professionals 
and related to the language skills and cultural sensitivities of internationally recruited 
teachers. Such teachers were reported to have difficulty speaking or understanding Creole, 
particularly in primary schools, where Creole is still the first language of most students and 
English is just being introduced. Even when English is the language of instruction, students 
have difficulty understanding on account of teachers&#8217; accents. At a minimum, better 
language skills should be required during the recruitment process. In addition to impairing 
learning in the classroom, the lack of Creole-language skills is said to contribute to 
discipline problems with some students, not having adequate English language skills. 
</p>
<p>52. Internationally recruited teachers receive additional financial incentives to teach that 
are not offered to local teachers. That disparity further contributes to the erosion of 
motivation within the profession, and was reported as a concern by a number of teachers 
during the visit.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur would like to warn against hiring teachers on a contractual 
basis and the reportedly growing use of short-term contracts for new teachers. Those 
practices undermine the profession by making it less stable and attractive. It makes the 
teaching profession precarious and saps teachers&#8217; morale, motivation and commitment.21 
The teaching profession should in fact be valued as a coveted career with due public regard 
to it as a form of public service of the utmost importance. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Imperatives of quality in education 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Education Sector Medium Term Strategy 2013&#8211;2017, mentioned above, seeks to 
improve collaboration between the Ministry of Education and key stakeholders to 
strengthen the quality of education in Seychelles. Although student-teacher ratios are 
relatively good, at around 13 pupils per teacher in primary education and 12 pupils per 
teacher in secondary education,22 quality imperatives require further attention for 
developing and applying necessary norms and standards. With nearly 80 per cent of 
education funds allocated to personnel emoluments, there are meagre resources available to 
upgrade school buildings and equipment. The public school infrastructure should be 
reviewed to ensure it meets national standards. In the education budget allocation, greater

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/27/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>consideration should be given to the provision of resources for quality education. Moreover, 
school administrators shared their concern with the Special Rapporteur that the lack of 
modern information and communication technology equipment, and of adequately trained 
staff, negatively affected their ability to effectively enhance the education system.  
</p>
<p>55. In response to the 2009&#8211;2010 Education Reform Action Plan and in a drive towards 
improving standards and quality, Seychelles developed in 2013 the National Assessment 
Framework to better assist teaching and learning. The aim of the framework is to &#8220;build a 
coherent and comprehensive system of quality education and training, reflecting shared 
universal and national values, which promote the integrated development of the person and 
empower him/her to participate fully in social and economic development&#8221;. With a view to 
fostering the holistic development of children to enable them to acquire the knowledge, 
skills, competence and attitude necessary in today&#8217;s world and with an emphasis on 
&#8220;acceptable professional standards&#8221; of quality,23 the Framework focuses on inclusion and 
equity, placing students at the centre, with the intention of promoting student-centred 
learning, self-esteem and learning to learn.  
</p>
<p>56. The Framework provides that, pursuant to the Education Act of 2004, &#8220;assessments 
shall be conducted in accordance with regulations at the end of each key stage of primary 
and secondary schooling to evaluate the performance of students in relation to the targets of 
the national curriculum&#8221; and makes provisions for national testing to take place at the end 
of each key stage.24 That is indeed commendable for maintaining enduring quality in 
learning. Accordingly, the national assessment provides a sense of students&#8217; achievements 
by identifying areas of strength and weaknesses: &#8220;what is assessed must be developmentally 
and educationally significant.&#8221;25  
</p>
<p>57. Similarly, in order to respond to imperatives of quality, the National Curriculum 
Framework, adopted in 2013, creates the &#8220;entitlement to high standards of education&#8221;,26 
placing emphasis on learning for every student in all schools that will enable them to 
succeed.27 It recognizes the importance of the diversity of educational needs and a student-
centred approach to learning and teaching at key stages &#8212;&#8212; early childhood, primary 
education, and secondary education, with foundations for lifelong learning &#8212; along with 
national development priorities. 
</p>
<p>58. In that respect, the Special Rapporteur also recognizes the importance of the 
Seychelles Qualifications Authority, established by the Seychelles Qualifications Act 
(2005). Its primary purpose is to develop and implement the National Qualifications 
Framework to provide nationally recognized standards. 
</p>
<p>59. In that context, it is important to mention developments with respect to performance 
monitoring.<b> </b>The Education Reform Action Plan (2009&#8211;2010&#8211;), already mentioned, laid the 
framework for the establishment of performance management systems to evaluate the 
quality of teaching, administration and the education curriculum. The plan also established 
monitoring and evaluation committees. However, a lack of performance management tools 
and in particular information technology systems, as well as personnel qualified in these 
areas, makes it difficult to evaluate the effect of changes made to the education system. The

</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur emphasizes that those areas must be strengthened so as to facilitate 
assessment of the impact of current and future reforms.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Reinvigorating the University of Seychelles 
</b></p>
<p>60. Until the establishment of the University of Seychelles in 2009, approximately 100 
students were annually sent to study at universities abroad through national scholarships. 
Partnerships were developed with universities in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland, France, Australia and elsewhere. However, the very high salary 
differential between jobs available in Seychelles and those available to international 
graduates abroad contributed to a high number of students opting to stay abroad at the end 
of their studies. 
</p>
<p>61. The University of Seychelles was established in 2009 to address, inter alia, that 
concern so that as a national university, it can provide degree-level teaching, and research 
programmes, and minimize the need for students to be sent abroad for studies. The 
university teaching degree programme was developed to improve the qualifications of 
teachers, particularly those with a two-year diploma or less, who are predominantly 
teaching at the primary-school level. 
</p>
<p>62. The creation of the university involved bringing teaching certificate and diploma 
programmes from the former School of Education, which was previously administered by 
the Ministry of Education, to the university in an effort to ensure that more teachers would 
graduate with a four year degree. However, very few students interested in teaching are 
academically qualified for the four-year degree programme, and those enrolled in the 
School of Education diploma programmes were forced to begin their studies again upon 
entering the university. The Special Rapporteur notes that the lack of students is not just a 
result of the difficult transition from the School of Education to the University of 
Seychelles, but that it also reflects the relatively low attraction of the teaching degree for 
qualified students. As a result, four years following the founding of the university, there are 
very few prospective graduates of any teaching programme. Replacing the old pattern of 
teacher education with a radically new system has created serious gaps that need to be 
bridged. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Establishing gender balance in education 
</b></p>
<p>63. Girls&#8217; performance in general education overshadows that of boys. According to 
available reports, girls outperform boys, in part because of parental and teacher attitudes 
that push girls to stay in school, while neglecting to attend equally to the performance 
concerns of boys.28 The performance disparity has recently become more pronounced at the 
university level. It has been suggested that the disparity is also the result of a number of 
social problems, including greater drug dependence, school behavioural problems and 
learning difficulties among young men.29 Boys also leave school earlier, often to enter the 
workforce.  
</p>
<p>64. In post-secondary programmes, including technical post-secondary institutions, men 
outnumber women overall, although the ratio is declining.30 Women also continue to be 
heavily underrepresented in technical and vocational post-secondary institutions, such as the

<p>Maritime Training Centre and the Seychelles Institute of Technology.31 The two institutes 
traditionally attracted the students with the lowest academic achievements, although that 
may be improving. Low female enrolment may also be related to low female employment 
rates in those fields, as some employers, such as construction or shipping companies, may 
be unwilling to accommodate female staff, for example, by providing separate toilet 
facilities.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Skills development: ascribing value to technical and vocational 
education and training  
</b></p>
<p>65. During his visit to primary and secondary schools, the Special Rapporteur was not 
surprised to learn that vocational training was seen as a career path for low-performing 
students and school dropouts. Following his visit to a technical college, he was informed 
that there were at times fewer applicants for some technical programmes than there were 
places available. Moreover, collaboration with industry was weak in areas outside of 
tourism, and many companies preferred to hire employees from abroad, justifying their 
choice by the lack of skilled local workers. 
</p>
<p>66. Increasing the attraction of technical and vocational training and education within 
Seychelles must begin in the school system. Under the present system, top students are 
encouraged to take the International General Certificate of Secondary Education in the final 
two years of secondary school. That approach streams students into academic careers, with 
only those who do not succeed turned towards vocational options. The perception of 
technical and vocational education and training as a career path of last resort must be 
transformed; technical and vocational education and training should be made more 
attractive and esteemed as a system that produces the skilled workers that the economy of 
the Seychelles requires. Further, the transformative role of technical and vocational 
education and training calls for ameliorating the quality of technical and vocational 
education and training programmes and institutions. A project memorandum approved by 
the Government in 2009 and implemented since 2011 seeks to address those issues, but 
much work remains to be done in that area. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur observed with concern that professional post-secondary 
institutions reportedly received inadequate funding to maintain their buildings and operate 
their classes with adequate raw materials. The  UNESCO Revised Recommendation 
concerning Technical and Vocational Education states: &#8220;Government and the private sector 
should recognize that technical and vocational education is an investment, not a cost, with 
significant returns&#8221;.32 It should be ensured that the quality of technical education is 
sufficiently high and respectable to allow graduates to be attractive to potential employers, 
without excessive additional training requirements. That is all the more necessary as the 
national technical and vocational education and training curriculum reflects the learning 
areas and acquisition of &#8220;practical skills and attitudes, understanding and knowledge 
relating to occupations in various sectors of economic and social life,&#8221; recognizing the 
importance of applying knowledge and skills to design and creative processes and &#8220;develop 
an enterprising ethos&#8221; with sustainable opportunities.33 
</p>
<p>68. With more than 12,000 foreign skilled workers on its territory, Seychelles is 
dependent upon expatriates. The shortage of skilled tradespersons leaves serious gaps. The

</p>
<p>Government must develop innovative approaches to ensure that national human resource 
policies and the education system reduce that dependence on foreign workers by developing 
a competent and skilled national workforce. The human resources development strategy 
needs to harmonize with the immigration policy geared towards increasing the number of 
trained workers. Developing a competent and skilled national workforce for is indispensable 
for reducing dependence on expatriates. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Emerging challenges to skills requirements emanating  
from the &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>69. As an indispensable component of the drive towards quality education, skills 
development through technical and vocational education and training is particularly 
necessary to meet the critical challenges of an increasingly globalized economy, and the 
rising aspiration of youth. However, technical and vocational education and training should 
be an integral part of secondary education, with pathways for the pursuit of higher 
education. It is encouraging that Seychelles recognizes the need for imparting skills that are 
conducive to fostering sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur would like to particularly emphasize the importance of the 
emerging concept of the &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221;, emanating from the vision of sustainable 
development to which the Government of Seychelles attaches great importance. The 
concept of the &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221; seeks to diversify economic development with a focus on 
maritime economic opportunities. Those range from tourism-related activities, including the 
development of sailing, diving and cruise-ship-related activities, to shipping and port 
facilities; international maritime trade and navigation; and the development of maritime 
resources, including fishing, aquaculture and underwater resource extraction. These 
emerging industries will require a technically skilled workforce. 
</p>
<p>71. Operationalizing a policy framework for developing the &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221; should be 
premised upon its various educational dimensions, with the focus on skills development in 
key areas. The concept of the &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221; encompasses several potential areas of 
importance, including shipping and port facilities, fisheries, tourism, aquaculture, energy, 
biotechnology and submarine mining.34 It also requires an integrated and holistic approach 
to the conservation of biodiversity. It is important to ensure that durable international 
cooperation underpins all of its aspects, including research as a key component. The 
university consortium of small island developing States administered by the University of 
West Indies in Jamaica, which groups six universities of small island developing States, 
offers considerable potential, particularly regarding its mission to enhance graduate 
education institutions in such States by facilitating capacity development.35 Studies and 
research on sustainable development on which the Consortium is working, including a joint 
master&#8217;s degree, are important to consider, all the more so as the Seychelles Sustainable 
Development Strategy 2011&#8211;2020 recognizes the importance of education for sustainability. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Challenges of societal dimensions of education: personal and social 
education  
</b></p>
<p>72. In recognition of the many social challenges faced by some students at home and in 
their communities, a salient feature of the education curriculum is inclusion of a personal, 
social and citizenship education programme for teaching civics, religion and social arts

<p>programmes aimed at educating children in a holistic fashion. The unique programme has 
the advantage of being designed to meet the current social concerns of the Seychellois, and 
is an important measure to assist in the full development of the child.  
</p>
<p>73. The provision of personal and social development is at the core of the personal, 
social and citizenship education, and the national curriculum as a whole. Organized around 
four major strands &#8212; the family, health and well-being; moral and spiritual education; 
citizenship education; and careers education &#8212; personal, social and citizenship education 
encompasses some of the essential skills, knowledge and understanding, attitudes and 
values to help children and young people make sense of their life experience. It thus 
supports the &#8220;holistic development of students&#8221;36 which is an important part of the right to 
education. A noteworthy feature of such education is that it places emphasis on the 
development of an awareness of personal values, rights and responsibilities, and the values

<p>74. However, during his visit, the Special Rapporteur was concerned to hear that the 
personal, social and citizenship education programmes are not evaluated through testing as 
such subjects as mathematics, science or language classes are, and that the programme is 
not yet regarded by many teachers and students as a rigorous academic course, particularly 
in contrast to classes related to the International General Certificate of Secondary 
Education. The Special Rapporteur considers it important for the Government to develop a 
robust evaluation system to counter those issues if personal, social and citizenship education 
is to have a meaningful role in the education of children and their development. This can 
dissuade students ignoring coursework if it has no impact on their academic standing; and it 
can also engage teachers to take more responsibly in teaching personal, social and 
citizenship education. When social values are deemed an important part of citizenship, the 
programme should be treated as seriously as any other. That will also require engagement 
with parents and teachers, to ensure the all stakeholders understand and support the purpose 
of the programme. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Social Renaissance Programme 
</b></p>
<p>75. In an effort to address increasing social issues in the home, President Michel 
launched the Social Renaissance Programme in 2011. The programme is highly significant 
in embodying the concept of &#8220;humane development&#8221;, which is enshrined in the Constitution 
of Seychelles.  
</p>
<p>76. The programme includes the National Plan of Action for Social Renaissance, 
developed through extensive consultation with citizens and civil society. It raises some of 
the most serious social concerns for national discussion. Under the action plan, the 
challenges faced by youth today must be voiced through public debate, in which all 
stakeholders in education have an important role to play. Social and disciplinary problems 
in schools in Seychelles continue to be major issues in the school environment.38 Moreover, 
domestic violence is a phenomenon which cannot be neglected, especially given its 
repercussions on the nation&#8217;s youth. 
</p>
<p>77. The Social Renaissance Programme and its plan of action seek to create a multi-
ministerial framework to address social issues of national concern, and that in collaboration

<p>with civil society and religious organizations. The national-level endeavour by the 
Government to grapple with the societal dimensions of education is evidenced by the 
subcommittees created in six areas: (a) drugs and crime, (b) education, (c) employment, (d) 
health and high-risk behaviour, (e) community relationships and (f) personal responsibility.  
78. The plan of action envisages a number of individual projects, supervised by 
appropriate government ministries, in an effort to raise awareness of the issues plaguing 
society, and attempting to engage with parents, civil society and government agencies to 
identify solutions. The Special Rapporteur is very supportive of that approach, and 
encourages the Government to provide sufficient resources and staffing to ensure that 
projects are measured for effectiveness, and that evidence-based policy recommendations 
can emerge from this project of high national importance. 
79. The Special Rapporteur shares the concerns of many teachers, administrators and 
government ministers regarding the increasing incidents of disruptive behaviour and social 
problems affecting schools of all levels. He is appreciative of the &#8220;whole-of-government&#8221; 
approach being championed by way of the Social Renaissance Programme through the 
inclusion of multiple government ministries to address these problems.  
</p>
<p>80. The Social Renaissance Programme is well conceived in the context of the 50th 
Anniversary of the Solemn Declaration of the Organization of African Unity and the 
African Union embracing the concept of African Renaissance and setting the pan-African 
priorities of vision 2060 extending over next 50 years. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b>81. <b>The education system in Seychelles has followed an exemplary path for a small 
island developing State of limited means. The Constitution and education laws 
incorporate the country&#8217;s international obligations under the right to education. Policy 
measures and reforms have made it possible for Seychelles to meet the education-
related Millennium Development Goals well before 2015. The emphasis on equality in 
education has significantly addressed differences in achievements based on gender and 
race, creating a system which provides equal opportunity for all based on ability. 
Public spending on education, at over 4 per cent of gross domestic product, is 
commendable and the establishment of the University of Seychelles in 2009 is a 
milestone achievement. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the commitment the Government of 
Seychelles has shown towards implementing the right to education. The Government 
continues to engage actively with international organizations, as well as bilaterally 
with partner nations and educational institutions, to improve its education system. 
Seychelles has achieved universal access to basic education and must now continue to 
take measures to improve the quality of the education system, with the focus on key 
challenges, such as improving professional status of and social regard for the teaching 
profession; improving technical and vocational education and training; meeting social 
challenges and promoting social and personal education in face of social and 
behavioural problems among students, which are becoming an ever more serious 
impediment to learning in classrooms; and intensifying normative action for 
responding to imperatives of quality, including investment in infrastructure and 
equipment. All of those issues need to be addressed in an endeavour to improve the 
education system.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221;, emanating from the vision of sustainable development to 
which the Government of Seychelles attaches great importance, is an area of great 
potential &#8212; nationally, regionally and internationally. The concept seeks to create a </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework aimed at improving human well-being and social equity in an 
environmentally sustainable way. It presents a great opportunity for a collaborative 
approach among the small island developing States. Such a human-centred approach 
to development, which seeks to meet some of today&#8217;s greatest environmental 
challenges, can be a valuable source of contribution in the context of current 
discussions on post-2015 development agenda. The Government should accord high 
priority to ensure that skills development remains central in national, regional and 
international initiatives, which are giving shape to the concept of the &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221;.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Taking into consideration the above and his findings during the mission, the 
Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following recommendations with a view 
towards contributing to the improvement of the education system in Seychelles. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Improving teachers&#8217; professional standing and social regard for the 
teaching profession 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>A review should be conducted on alternative financial and non-financial 
incentives that can be used to attract and retain teachers. Teachers, particularly the 
newly recruited, should be provided with additional training on how to effectively 
control and discipline their classes in a child-friendly approach. The development of a 
new teacher mentorship programme may be one option. The teachers&#8217; Scheme of 
Service, which provides the terms and conditions of employment for teachers, 
including salaries, should be further reviewed to identify cost-effective means of 
improving the conditions of service.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Ministry of Education and school administrators should consider how they 
can more effectively maintain student discipline within public schools. Efforts to 
engage with parents and the community through the Social Renaissance Programme, 
as well as at the local level through school councils-, should be strengthened to ensure 
troubled young persons are able to receive the needed early assistance, and proper 
guidance for the pursuit of their studies. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The recruitment of highly qualified teachers and administrators from the 
Ministry of Education to other positions within the Government should be 
discouraged, and the incentives behind such moves should be addressed. In particular, 
any disparities in salaries and working conditions for equally qualified workers should 
be removed as matter of priority. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The recruitment of teachers internationally should be used sparingly and the 
Government should mobilize additional resources for increasing the enrolment of 
teachers in post-secondary education institutions and their in-service training. Where 
teachers are hired, care should be taken to find ones who speak or learn CreoleC, and 
they should be provided with pedagogic support and training to assist them in better 
relating to their students. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Government should minimize the use of temporary contracts for teacher 
recruitment, as it negatively affects their motivation and commitment to the 
profession. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Upgrading standards and quality in education 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Within the framework of the Education Sector Medium Term Strategy 2013&#8211;
2017, the Government should develop and implement the necessary quality norms and 
standards. In keeping with the National Assessment Framework developed in 2013, 
Seychelles should embrace a &#8220;comprehensive system of quality education and 
learning&#8221; based on a holistic concept, which goes beyond the instrumental role of 
education in mathematical literacy and numeracy, and places a premium on the 
humanistic mission of education.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The quality imperatives should be a determinant factor in investing in 
education as against recurring expenditure so as provide necessary financial resource 
base for giving effect to quality standards. Enhancing national investment for 
fostering quality as a public policy concern deserves much more consideration. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Government should take the necessary measures pursuant to the National 
Curriculum Framework, adopted in 2013, which creates the &#8220;entitlement to high 
standards of education,&#8221;</b> <b>placing emphasis on learning for every student in all schools 
that will enable them to succeed.</b> <b>In order to develop in children a love for learning, 
well-trained and motivated teachers are needed to speak to their minds but also to 
their hearts. That calls for new pedagogical approaches which are child-friendly, 
inspiring and motivating, and replace any remaining instances of rote learning. 
Quality education also necessitates that teachers should be capable of developing 
critical thinking skills in children and adults, and nurture in them moral values.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Strengthening technical and vocational education and training 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Government should review the secondary school curriculum with a view to 
creating a viable, attractive technical and vocational education and training 
programme, which will provide qualified, capable graduates into professional post-
secondary institutes. The review should seek to address the barriers preventing 
women from entering technical fields and the workforce. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Government should also consider how to address the stereotypes and 
misinformation about technical and vocational education and training programmes 
among teachers, students and technical institutions and in the workplace. The 
Government should take steps to develop an institutionalized framework of 
collaboration with industry for promoting technical and vocational education and 
training and developing necessary skills. Schools should partner industry to address 
the stigma associated with vocational careers. In-school vocational training fairs, on-
site school visits, and similar initiatives may help students better appreciate the career 
possibilities associated with non-academic career options.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Teachers must also be trained to enable them better to guide students towards 
non-academic career options in a positive light. That requires far-reaching reforms of 
the technical and vocational education and training sector to include the development 
of much closer collaboration between industry and professional centres. Examples 
may include the sponsorship of particular programmes needed by the particular 
industries; work placement programmes; and employees of those businesses could be 
encouraged to act as practitioner instructors, student mentors or industry 
representatives in secondary schools to improve the quality of the education and 
training being provided.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Technical and vocational education and training should be ascribed value as a 
professional career path, with a campaign for raising social regard for it. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22 
</b></p>
<p><b>Policymakers, educators and teachers must help spread the message that competencies 
and skills that respond to the rising aspirations of youth in today&#8217;s globalized economy 
provide leverage in economic development and social progress. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Government should review its post-secondary educational investment 
priorities. Funding for technical and vocational education and training programmes 
and institutions should be increased to better compare it to investments made for 
university education, and to ensure that all students receive a high-quality education. 
National investment in technical and vocational education and training, including 
post-secondary institutions and higher technical education, should be enhanced to 
ensure that this sector of strategic importance receives necessary support as a 
development priority.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Government should explore the diverse range of funding mechanisms and 
resources for technical and vocational education and training. For example, as part of 
the preview of the Corporate Social Responsibility Tax, enterprises can be encouraged 
to invest in such education in recognition of its key importance for industrial 
development and economic growth. A fund could even be envisaged to leverage 
existing resources for national programmes for such education and training, in 
particular for technical equipment and facilities. The Government should consider 
sharing to the maximum extent possible funding for technical and vocational 
education and training with industry and the private sector, with appropriate 
incentives to this end.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Meeting social challenges 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Seychelles should intensify its national endeavour to respond to the social 
challenges facing its youth, with the Social Renaissance Programme and related 
Action Plan as a springboard. That would require reinforcing school-centred 
resources, including improvements in pedagogy and the delivery of the Personal, 
Social and Citizenship Education curriculum, school-based health and psychological 
support, and the Pastoral Care Programme, among others. All such programmes 
should be carefully coordinated with adequate support and proper evaluation to 
ensure that they are effective in building the movement for social transformation 
through education.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The implementation of the Social Renaissance Programme should be linked to 
the National Curriculum Framework, adopted in 2013, which recognizes the need for 
ethical standards, such as zero tolerance for cheating or plagiarism. The Personal, 
Social and Citizenship Education curriculum should be strengthened to address the 
social issues affecting schools. In particular, the curriculum should be made more 
rigorous, including examinations and evaluations that will encourage secondary school 
students to perform better in these exams. The curriculum should also be tied into 
complementary efforts, including parent-teacher councils, in an effort to involve them 
actively in bringing about social transformation.  
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Envisaging the phased development of University of Seychelles  
with a master plan strengthening technical and vocational  
education and training</b> 
</p>
<p>101. <b>The manner in which the University of Seychelles is taking shape and its modus 
vivendi calls for careful review. The university must emerge as a seat of learning, with 
the pursuit of excellence in chosen areas of national priority. The efforts to nurture the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>23</b> 
</p>
<p><b>university require much more focus on an approach underpinned by the thrust for 
&#8220;institution-building&#8221;. The deployment of teachers on a contractual basis should have 
no place in an incipient institution, which needs full commitment, above all by the 
teaching community, including long-term research, along with professional dedication 
to teaching and excellence. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The university should be geared in a sustainable manner towards developing 
certain well-defined disciplines, achieving long-term objectives progressively. It would 
be ideal if an innovative approach for developing disciplines in response to the 
emerging concept of &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221; is launched. The university can thus advance 
towards specializing in one or two well-defined areas of key importance for Seychelles, 
with the aspiration of emerging as a world-class research and learning centre, and 
acquire world fame in those areas of specialization. International collaboration should 
be strengthened and diversified.  
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Placing skills development programmes as central to the &#8220;Blue 
Economy&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The &#8220;Blue Economy&#8221;, emanating from the vision of sustainable development to 
which the Government of Seychelles attaches great importance, is an area of great 
potential &#8212; nationally, regionally and internationally. The concept is aimed at 
creating a framework aimed at improving human well-being and social equality and 
presents a great opportunity for a collaborative approach among the small island 
developing States. Such an approach to development, which seeks to meet some of 
today&#8217;s environmental challenges, can be a valuable contribution to current 
discussions on post-2015 development agenda. The Government should accord high 
priority to ensure that skills development remains central in initiatives in giving shape 
to the concept of the &#8220;Blue Economy.&#8221;
