the people of Haiti affected by the devastating earthquake of 12 January 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its previous outcomes on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti, in 
particular Presidential Statements PRST/9/1 and PRST/6/1, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> by the dire human and material losses and suffering sustained as a result 
of the earthquake, as well as of its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights in the 
affected country, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> also that the effects of the earthquake further exacerbated existing 
challenges to the full enjoyment of all human rights in Haiti and expressing concern over 
the medium and long-term consequences of the disaster, including its social, economic and 
development aspects,

</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> that the promotion and protection of all human rights &#8211; economic, civil, 
social, political and cultural rights, including the right to development &#8211; are indispensable 
elements for peace, stability and development, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the extraordinary situation in Haiti, particularly in Port au Prince, 
L&#233;ogane and Jacmel, which requires an equally extraordinary response led by the 
government of Haiti, in collaboration with the international community, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> its appreciation for the prompt response, solidarity and assistance 
provided by the U.N. system, through U.N. agencies, programs and funds, and the United 
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), as well as by the U.N. Member 
States, the international community, civil society, the private sector and individuals, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> the need for the United Nations system to respond swiftly to requests for 
assistance by the affected country and to ensure that the assistance provided is timely,

<p><i>Underscoring</i> the need for long-term and sustainable support of the international 
community for the government of Haiti to promote the respect for human rights, the rule of 
law and good governance, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the primary responsibility and competence of the Haitian government to 
promoting and protecting all human rights in the country, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing</i> in mind that the tragedy has obliterated the ongoing efforts of the Haitian 
government to prepare the national report to be presented in May, 2010, at the eighth 
session of the Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR),  
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of UN General Assembly Resolution A/64/250, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to continue to ensure adequate and 
coordinated support to the government and the people of Haiti in their efforts to overcome 
the challenges arising from the earthquake, keeping in mind the importance of integrating a

process; 
</p>

address the existing and the additional challenges to promote and protect all human rights 
in Haiti, and further encourages the government of Haiti to continue its efforts to promote 
and protect all human rights in the country; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Expresses</i> its concern about the present human rights situation in Haiti, in 
particular the vulnerable situation of children, women, internally displaced persons, the 
elderly, persons with disabilities and wounded; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Underlines</i> the need to address the additional obstacles arising from the 
devastation in such areas as access to food, adequate housing, health care, water and 
sanitation, education, work and the civil registry; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Emphasizes</i>, in this context, the importance of reconstructing national 
institutions and of providing cooperation, capacity-building and technical assistance to the 
government and the people of Haiti, in accordance with the needs and the requests made by 
the concerned country; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-13/L.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes and further encourages</i> the responses provided by the U.N. system 
and by the international community at large to assist the government of Haiti to promote 
and protect all human rights in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake, such as, inter alia, 
those resources aiming at providing cash and food for work, as well as those aiming at 
securing the full protection of the rights of all those in vulnerable situations, especially 
children and women; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of protecting children from any violence, injury or 
abuse, mal-treatment or exploitation, and of ensuring that separated or unaccompanied 
children do re-unite with their families and those left orphaned receive immediate attention 
and necessary protection, and, in this context, underscores the need of cooperation and 
assistance to the government of Haiti from all U.N. members and relevant organs and 
bodies of the U.N. systems, in particular UNICEF; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need to apply a gender based approach in the recovery 
process; 
</p>

Periodic Review within the Human Rights Council to a date no later than December 2011; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Welcomes</i> the initiative to establish a joint protection team with the 
participation of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Invites</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to identify, 
in collaboration with the Haitian government, areas for cooperation and technical assistance 
with Haiti, on the basis of the expertise and the presence of the U.N. system on the ground, 
in particular the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in collaboration with 
special procedures, a view to present suggestions in this regard to the Human Rights 
Council in its 14th Regular Session.
