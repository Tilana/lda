<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/226, in 
which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit an interim report to the 
Human Rights Council at its sixteenth session. The report reflects the patterns and trends in 
the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran and provides information on the 
progress made in the implementation of resolution 65/226, including recommendations to 
improve its implementation. The report also draws upon observations made by treaty 
monitoring bodies and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council.1  
</p>
<p>2. Since the previous report of the Secretary-General (A/65/370), the human rights 
situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran has been marked by a crackdown on human rights 
defenders, women&#8217;s rights activists, journalists and Government opponents. Concerns about 
torture, arbitrary detentions and unfair trials continue to be raised by United Nations human 
rights mechanisms. There was a noticeable increase in application of the death penalty, 
including in cases of political prisoners, since the beginning of 2011. Discrimination 
persisted against minority groups, in some cases amounting to persecution. Against this 
backdrop, there were, however, some positive developments, including the State&#8217;s signing 
of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict, in September 2010, its examination before the Committee for 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in August 2010, and the conduct of a judicial 
colloquium together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR), in December 2010. 
</p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General met with the Senior Adviser to the Head of the Judiciary and 
Secretary-General of the High Council for Human Rights of Iran, Mohammad Javad 
Ardeshir Larijani, on 19 November 2010, in New York. The Secretary-General raised 
several human rights issues, such as constraints on human rights advocates, capital 
punishment, juvenile execution and concerns relating to minority rights. Mr. Larijani 
replied that the Islamic Republic of Iran appreciated the general cooperation with the 
United Nations on human rights with both the Secretary-General and the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. He insisted, however, that his country strongly 
rejected the recent General Assembly resolution on human rights in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran.    
</p>
<p><b> II. Thematic issues  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
including flogging and amputation 
</b></p>
<p>4. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the 
Islamic Republic of Iran is a State party, prohibits the use of torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. The State&#8217;s Constitution forbids the use of all forms of 
torture for the purpose of extracting confessions or acquiring information, and articles of 
the Penal Code and code on citizen&#8217;s rights provide for acts of torture to be punished. 
Reports continue to be received, however, about torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment taking place in various detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Since the previous report of the Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly, a number of 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders have reported on their communications with the Government on 
cases of concern. These are flagged in relevant sections of the report (see also annex). </p>


<p>5. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment 
or punishment sent a number of individual communications to the Iranian authorities 
concerning allegations of torture.2 The Special Rapporteur was joined in some 
communications by other special procedures, including the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>6. In recent months, there has been a number of reports in the Iranian media regarding 
the application of amputation and flogging. On 1 December 2010, Iranian authorities 
amputated the hand of man accused of theft in the central prison of Kermanshah; the 
sentence was reportedly carried out in the presence of local judiciary officials and 
prisoners.3 On 22 November 2010, after amputating the hand of a thief, the Public 
Prosecutor of Mashhad stressed that the judiciary would show no mercy to those who 
disturb public order and security, particularly thieves.4 On 26 October 2010, in connection 
with the amputation of the limb of a thief in Yazd, the First Deputy to the Head of Judiciary 
stated that the execution of such punishment was in compliance with the law, a source of 
pride and would be repeated in the future.5 On 22 July 2010, following the amputation of 
the hands of five robbers in Hamedan prison, the Prosecutor of Hamedan stressed that, 
&#8220;when a hand is used to steal and causes harassment to people, it should be cut off&#8221;.6  
</p>
<p>7. An Iranian news agency reported that, on 18 December 2010, a man accused of 
drinking alcohol was publicly punished with 80 lashes in the city of Ramshir.7 On 5 January 
2011, the judiciary in Tehran convicted a woman, a Ms Saeeda, also known as Kimya, to 
100 lashes for adultery.8 On 31 January 2011, three people accused of illicit sexual relations 
were subjected to 99 lashes in public in Qaimshehr.9 Punishments have been reported in the 
context of retribution or &#8220;an eye for an eye&#8221;. According to Iranian press reports, on 28 
December 2010, a court in Tehran ruled that a man named Hamid had to lose his eye and 
part of an ear after he blinded and burned the ear of another man in an acid attack.10 During 
the preparation of the present report, the Iranian authorities confirmed amputation and 
flogging sentences were carried out in Ramshir and other locations in conformity with the 
Penal Code.   
</p>
<p>8. The Penal Code allows amputation and flogging for a range of crimes, including 
theft, enmity against God (<i>Mohareb</i>) and certain sexual acts. The Iranian authorities argue 
that punishments of this kind are prescribed by Islamic law and are not considered to be 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. They argue that the application of 
sentences of this kind are effective in deterring crime and offer an alternative to 
incarceration. The Committee against Torture and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have consistently held that the 
imposition of corporal punishment by judicial and administrative authorities, including, in 
particular, flogging and the amputation of limbs, is contrary to the prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Human Rights Committee, 
which monitors implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
held a similar view in its general comment No. 20 (1992). 
</p>
<p>  
 2 The Special Rapporteur reported to the Human Rights Council in February 2010 on past 
</p>
<p>communications (see annex).

<p><b> B. The death penalty, including public executions 
</b></p>
<p>9. A dramatic surge in the number of executions has been recorded since the beginning 
of 2011. According to Iranian press reports, at least 66 people were executed in January, 
with some sources indicating the figure to be as high as 83,11 Most executions were 
reportedly carried out in relation to drug offences, but at least three political prisoners were 
among those hanged. The Iranian authorities assert that the executions were carried out 
after a fair trial and review by a higher court. On 2 February 2011, the High Commissioner 
publicly expressed alarm at the dramatic increase in executions since the beginning of 
2011, and called upon the country to institute a moratorium on executions with a view to 
abolishing the death penalty. The High Commissioner also expressed concern that a large 
number of people reportedly remain on death row, including political prisoners, drug 
offenders and even juvenile offenders, and encouraged the country to respect international 
standards guaranteeing due process and the protection of the rights of those facing the death 
penalty, to progressively restrict its use and reduce the number of offences for which it may 
be imposed. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
also warned in a public statement of a dramatic surge in death sentences, carried out in the 
absence of internationally recognized safeguards, despite numerous calls by the United 
Nations to halt executions immediately. The experts pointed out that, under international 
law, the death penalty is regarded as an extreme form of punishment which, if it is used at 
all, should only be imposed for the most serious crimes after a fair trial has been granted to 
the accused.  
</p>
<p>10. Special procedures mandate holders continued to receive many reports from various 
sources concerning individuals who had allegedly been executed for drug-related offences 
and drug trafficking. Several cases involved foreign citizens or persons with dual 
nationality.12 Despite growing acknowledgment by some Iranian authorities that the death 
penalty may not be an effective deterrent to drug crime, the judiciary has continued to stress 
in public the need for tough punishment.   
</p>
<p>11. A new anti-narcotics law was passed in December 2010 and came into force on 4 
January 2011. Article 18 provides for the death penalty for drug traffickers and major 
traders, and also foresees punishment such as a travel ban ranging from one to 15 years for 
carrying or smuggling any quantity of drugs.13 The new law classes drug-addicted persons 
as criminals unless they are in possession of a certificate of treatment. On 27 December 
2010, the Deputy Prosecutor General for Legal Affairs warned of a stricter approach in 
dealing with drug trafficking, and stressed that drug traffickers and major drug traders 
would face execution under the new law.14 The judiciary has also pledged to use the death 
penalty in a crackdown on other serious crimes. On 8 December 2010, the head of the 
Iranian judiciary, Ayatollah Sadiq Larijani, announced that armed robbers would still be 
</p>
<p>  
 11 According to Amnesty International, at least 71 people mostly linked to drug trafficking were 
</p>
<p>executed between 1 and 24 January 2011. 
 12 According to numerous reports, foreign citizens, including from Nigeria and Afghanistan, were 
</p>
<p>among those executed for drug-related charges. Zahra Bahrami, an Iranian-Dutch dual citizen was 
executed on 29 January 2011 on charges of drug trafficking. The Iranian authorities note that the 
country&#8217;s laws do not distinguish between Iranian and non-Iranian nationals who commit a crime on 
Iranian territory. 
</p>
<p> 13 The penalty for trafficking and trading 30 gm of crystal meth, just like other psychedelic substances 
such as crack and heroin, are punishable by imprisonment, whereas more than 30 gm is punishable by 
death.See www.isna.ir/ISNA/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1687435&amp;Lang=P.

<p>executed by hanging, even if they stole nothing.15 Police Commander Sardar Doctor Ismael 
Ahmadi stressed that such measures would undoubtedly be most effective in combating 
crime.16  
</p>
<p>12. In July 2010, a large number of prisoners were reportedly executed at one time in 
Mashhad prison. When OHCHR staff sought further information from Iranian counterparts 
during a visit to Tehran in December 2010, the latter confirmed that 60 people had been 
executed in Mashhad in pending cases mostly linked to drug trafficking. On 3 January 
2011, seven people convicted of drug trafficking were hanged in the western city of 
Kermanshah.17 On 19 January 2011, 10 people were executed in Rajai Shahr prison for 
drug trafficking.18 On 24 January 2011, three people charged with rape were executed in 
Evin prison.19  
</p>
<p>13. A worrying trend is the increasing number of cases in which political prisoners are 
accused of <i>Mohareb</i> (see paragraph 8 above), which carry the death penalty. In Iranian law, 
<i>Mohareb</i> relates to the use of armed violence; however, special procedures mandate holders 
and other independent experts have questioned the problematic and arbitrary nature of such 
charges. At least 22 people charged with <i>Mohareb</i> have been executed since January 2010. 
On 20 December 2010, 11 men accused of being linked to a bomb attack on 15 December 
in Chabahar were hanged in Zahedan prison after being convicted and sentenced to death 
for &#8220;corruption on earth, <i>Mohareb</i> and countering the sacred system of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran&#8221;.20 On 28 December 2010, authorities executed Ali Saremi and Ali Akbar Siadat at 
Evin Prison in Tehran. Ali Saremi was charged with <i>Mohareb</i> for having links with a 
banned opposition group, the Mujahidin e Khalq Organization,  while Ali Akbar Siadat was 
convicted of espionage for foreign intelligence services.21 On 24 January 2011, Jafar 
Kazemi and Mohammad Ali Haj Aghaei were executed after having been accused of 
<i>Mohareb</i> for their alleged participation in post-election unrest and contacts with the 
People&#8217;s Mujahidin Organization of Iran.22 The High Commissioner had previously 
expressed concern to the Iranian authorities over the fair trial and sentencing to death of 
people for <i>Mohareb</i> offences.23  
</p>
<p>14. According to the Secretary-General of the High Council for Human Rights in Iran, 
over 50 per cent of death penalty cases involve retribution (<i>qisas</i>)<i>.</i> The Iranian authorities 
exclude the State&#8217;s responsibility in such cases on the grounds that sharia jurisprudence 
considers <i>qisas</i> a private right of the victim&#8217;s family that cannot be overruled by the 
judiciary. The judiciary makes considerable efforts to mediate between the victim&#8217;s family 
and the perpetrator to promote a <i>diyah</i> settlement, in which the victim&#8217;s family forgoes this 
right, sometimes following a monetary settlement. However, when the power of pardon is 
not viewed as lying with the State, this does not fulfil the defendants&#8217; rights to appeal for 
pardon or a commuted sentence under international law. In one such case, Shahla Jahed, 
who had contracted a temporary marriage with Nasser Mohammad-Khani, a former player 
for the Iranian national football team, was executed on 1 December 2010. Shahla Jahed was 
convicted of stabbing her husband&#8217;s permanent wife to death.

 23 See A/65/370. </p>


<p>15. Iranian law also criminalizes all sexually oriented relations outside valid marriage; 
individuals convicted of engaging in illicit sexual relations can face severe punishment, 
including the death penalty. Under the Islamic Penal Code, among other <i>hudud</i> crimes, 
certain sexual conduct, including adultery, incest, rape, fornication for the fourth time by an 
unmarried person, sodomy, lesbianism for the fourth time, sexual conduct between men 
without penetration for the fourth time, and fornication by a non-Muslim man with a 
Muslim woman are punishable by capital punishment. The High Commissioner wrote to the 
Iranian authorities to express concern about two such cases, committed by persons under 
the age of 18 (see also paragraphs 17-19 below). In June 2010, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions also reported to the Human Rights Council 
on communications to the Government concerning the application of the death penalty in 
cases of sodomy, including some involving juveniles (see annex). The Human Rights 
Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of death sentences for offences that do 
not result in the loss of life, and termed them incompatible with the provisions of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>16. A number of public executions were reported during the period under review, 
suggesting that the circular banning public executions issued in January 2008 by the former 
head of the judiciary, Ayatollah Shahroudi, has not been effectively enforced. At least two 
public executions were carried out in January 2011. According to Iranian media, a 32-year-
old man identified as Yaqoub was publicly hanged on 5 January 2011 for stabbing another 
man to death.24 The public hanging, which took place at Sadat Abad Square in Tehran, was 
reportedly attended by the victim&#8217;s family and large crowds. On 24 January 2011, Omaid 
Berg, who was convicted of killing 10 women, was publicly executed in Qadus Square, 
Karaj City. The execution was attended by officials from the judiciary, military and 
residents of the area.25 In her public statement of 2 February 2011, the High Commissioner 
condemned the recurrence of public executions. International human rights mechanisms 
have stated that executions in public add to the already cruel, inhuman and degrading nature 
of the death penalty and can only have a dehumanizing effect on the victim and a 
brutalizing effect on those who witness the execution. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Executions of juvenile offenders 
</b></p>
<p>17. Execution of juvenile offenders remains an ongoing concern, as highlighted in 
previous reports of the Secretary-General.26  The age for criminal liability still remains at 8 
years and 9 months for girls and 14 years and 7 months for boys, which is not only 
discriminatory but also low by international standards. The Iranian authorities point out, 
however, that priority is given to the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders and the return of 
children to normalcy and society. Although fewer juvenile offenders were executed in 2010 
than in previous years, death sentences against juvenile offenders continue to be reported.27 
In June 2010, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
noted with concern the cases of at least nine juvenile offenders who were at risk of 
imminent execution for crimes committed when they were minors. The Convention on the 
Rights of Child28 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,29 to both of 
</p>

</p>
<p>www.irna.ir/newsshow.aspx?nid=30170347.  
 25 www.isna.ir/isna/newsview.aspx?id=news-1701748&amp;lang=p. 
 26 A/63/459, A/64/357 and A/65/370. 
 27 The Special Rapporteur noted that there was no other country in the world relating to which he 
</p>
<p>regularly received allegations of this type (A/HRC/4/20). 
 28 Art. 37 (a). 
 29 Art. 6, para. 5 </p>


<p>which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a State party, prohibit the imposition of the death 
penalty on those who are under the age of 18 at the time of their crime.  
</p>
<p>18. The judiciary decreed a non-binding moratorium on juvenile execution in 2005 and 
has often taken active steps to mediate between the families in such cases, even assisting 
the convicted person to pay the <i>diyah</i> settlement. When cases involving juvenile offenders 
are prolonged until the accused reaches 18 years, however, the risk of execution becomes 
higher.  
</p>
<p>19. In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council in June 2010,30 the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions reported on several past 
communications with the Iranian authorities (see annex). The High Commissioner also 
continued to intervene on individual cases through public statements and private 
representations with the Iranian authorities: for instance, in a letter addressed to the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and dated 13 January 2011, the High 
Commissioner expressed grave concerns about the death sentence handed down to Ehsan 
Rangraz Tabatabaaie and Ebrahim Hamidi, both minors, following conviction on charges of 
<i>lavat</i> (sodomy). Both defendants were convicted for crimes committed when they were 
minors.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Stoning as a method of execution 
</b></p>
<p>20. The application of stoning as a method of execution was again a focus of concern 
during the period under review. Under the existing Islamic Penal Code, adultery when one 
is married is punishable by stoning. Despite a moratorium on stoning declared by the Head 
of Judiciary in 2002, the judiciary continues to sentence both men and women to execution 
by stoning. The instruction serves as guidance for individual judges, but lacks binding legal 
effect.  
</p>
<p>21. The Human Rights Committee holds the view that stoning to death for adultery is a 
punishment that is grossly disproportionate to the nature of the crime.31 Likewise, 
according to the Special Rapporteur on torture, States cannot invoke provisions of domestic 
law to justify the violation of human rights obligations under international law, including 
the prohibition of corporal punishment.32 The Islamic Republic of Iran, however, maintains 
that the punishment of stoning for married persons who commit adultery serves as a 
deterrent, helping to maintain the strength of the family and society, and that such charges 
are, by design, very difficult to prove. At a judicial colloquium, held in December 2010 (see 
also paragraphs 49-51 below), Dr. Mohamad Javad Larijani argued that stoning should not 
be categorized as a &#8220;method of execution&#8221;, but rather as a method of punishment that is 
actually more lenient, because 50 per cent of those condemned survive. Nevertheless, the 
authorities have indicated that Parliament is currently reviewing the punishment of death by 
stoning.  
</p>
<p>22. The case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who was sentenced to death by stoning 
in 2006, received considerable international attention. Ms. Ashtiani was convicted for her 
husband&#8217;s murder, but was also charged with adultery while being married and sentenced to 
death by stoning. She has already spent five years in prison and received 99 lashes. 
Following an international outcry, the authorities confirmed, most recently on 17 January 
2011, that the stoning of Ms. Ashtiani had been suspended since her husband&#8217;s family &#8220;had

<p>forgiven her&#8221;, but she was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.33 On 9 February 2011, 
the Prosecutor General announced that the sentence of Ms. Ashtiani had not been 
revoked.34 During the trial proceedings, however, the authorities arrested Javid Houtan 
Kiyan, her defence attorney, and Sajjad Qaderzadeh, her son, and also aired her confessions 
on television, which raised serious concerns about the fairness of the trial proceedings. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Women&#8217;s rights

<p>23. In previous reports submitted to the General Assembly, the Secretary-General has 
reported in detail on concerns relating to the protection of women&#8217;s rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. In particular, he has expressed concern at the oppression of women&#8217;s 
rights activists and female journalists, many of whom have faced intimidation and 
harassment and, in some cases, detention or travel bans. In her report submitted to the 
Human Rights Council in June 2010, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences reported on several past communications with the Iranian 
authorities (see annex), particularly in relation to arrested members of a campaign for 
equality known as the One Million Signatures campaign.35 The Iranian authorities contest 
that there is a wide spectrum of women&#8217;s rights activists in the country, but that some 
individuals have failed to gain permission for their non-governmental organizations or have 
engaged in illegal activities and disturbed public order. Other women&#8217;s rights-related cases 
are dealt with elsewhere in the present report, including with respect to stoning and freedom 
of association, opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Rights of minorities 
</b></p>
<p>24. Concerns continued with respect to the treatment of the Baha&#8217;i community and other 
minorities in the country, situations that have been highlighted in previous reports of the 
Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly. Special procedures mandate holders 
continued to raise cases involving members of the Baha&#8217;i community with the Iranian 
authorities. The authorities note that, while Baha&#8217;i is not recognized as an official religion, 
its followers enjoy equal social, civil and citizen&#8217;s rights; they claim, however, that the 
Baha&#8217;i community has recruited members by irregular means or has acted against national 
security. On 13 August 2010, a number of special procedures mandate holders36 drew the 
attention of authorities to the cases of at least six members of the Baha&#8217;i community &#8211; 
Ghavamoddin Sabetian, Hedayatollah Rezaie, Houman Hourbod, Noura Nabilzadeh, Sara 
Mahboubi and Moshtagh Samandari &#8211; who were arrested by officials from the Ministry of 
Intelligence in the months of June and July 2010. Concerns were expressed that, in most 
cases, the agents searched their homes and confiscated materials related to their religion.  
</p>
<p>25. In August 2010, seven Baha&#8217;i community leaders &#8211; Fariba Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin 
Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, Saied Rezaie, Behrouz Tavakkoli, Vahid Tizfahm and Mahvash 
Sabet &#8211; were sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment; their sentences were subsequently 
reduced to 10 years. The seven had been detained since 14 May 2008, although only 
appeared for trial on 12 January 2010. The High Commissioner has raised their case several 
times in letters addressed to and meetings with the Iranian authorities, expressing her deep

<p>concern that these trials did not meet due process and fair trial requirements. She requested 
the opportunity for independent observers to monitor this and other high-profile grounds, a 
request rejected by the Iranian authorities. Although the seven were charged with acting 
against national security, espionage and spreading corruption, the High Commissioner 
expressed concern that the charges brought against them appeared to constitute a violation 
of the State&#8217;s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in 
particular freedom of religion and belief, and freedom of expression and association. 
Reports also continued to be received about Christians, in particular converts, being 
subjected to arbitrary arrest and harassment. 
</p>
<p>26. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, after considering the 
eighteenth and nineteenth periodic reports of the Islamic Republic of Iran37 in August 2010,  
expressed concern at the limited enjoyment of political, economic, social and cultural rights 
by, inter alia, Arabs, Azeri, Baloch, Kurdish communities and some communities of non- 
citizens, in particular with regard to housing, education, freedom of expression and religion, 
and health and employment, despite the economic growth in the country. The Committee 
drew particular attention to reports regarding the application of the &#8220;gozinesh&#8221; criterion, a 
selection procedure that requires prospective State officials and employees to demonstrate 
their allegiance to the Islamic Republic of Iran and the State religion, and expressed 
concern that it may limit employment opportunities and political participation for members 
of the Arab, Azeri, Baloch, Jewish, Armenian and Kurdish communities.  
</p>
<p>27. Members of the Kurdish community have continued to be executed on various 
national security-related charges, including <i>Mohareb</i>. At least nine Kurdish political 
prisoners, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Ali Haj Aghaie and Ali Saremi, have been 
executed since January 2010, and several others remain at risk of execution. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of opinion 
and expression 
</b></p>
<p>28. In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council in June 2010,38 the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression drew attention to a large number of communications he had sent to the Iranian 
authorities concerning serious allegations of restrictions imposed on the rights to freedom 
of opinion and expression (see annex). Between January 2009 and February 2010, the 
Special Rapporteur sent 22 joint communications and one individually. Serious concerns 
were expressed regarding the situation of journalists, bloggers, human rights defenders and 
persons who express views critical of the Government. The Special Rapporteur noted with 
concern that the continued detention of individuals might be related to their work as human 
rights defenders and for exercising their right to freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>29. Persistent reports of curbs on the media, which has affected print media, weblogs 
and websites, were received during the period under review. Journalists, bloggers, human 
rights defenders and lawyers continue to be arrested or subjected to travel bans, and reports 
continued to be received of restrictions on media weblogs and websites. For instance, on 22 
November 2010, Iranian media sources reported that <i>Chelcheragh</i>, a reformist weekly, had 
been allegedly banned for publishing articles contradictory to public morals.39 In an 
addendum to his report submitted to the Human Right Council in June 2010,40 the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, noted that more than 10 national dailies, including <i>Kalamah Sabz</i>, <i>Etemad-e 
</i></p>

<p><i>Melli</i>, <i>Hayat No</i> and <i>Sarmayeh</i>, had been closed down after publishing articles not in line 
with official policies. The Iranian authorities argue that the press is free to publish articles 
other than those that upset Islamic principles or public or private rights. They claim that no 
writer or journalist has been prosecuted for what he or she has written and that the judiciary 
has shown leniency when dealing with press offences.  
</p>
<p>30. According to numerous reports, in September 2010, Hussein Derakhshan, a 
journalist, was given a long prison sentence for charges including espionage, propaganda 
against the regime, insulting Islamic sanctities and country leaders, and setting up and 
managing vulgar and obscene websites. The authorities reported that Mr. Derakhshan was 
sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison and also prohibited from involvement in the 
media (print and cyberspace) and activities in political parties. The sentence could be 
appealed. Several other journalists received similarly heavy sentences. For instance, in 
September 2010, Emadeddin Baghi, a journalist and founder of the Centre for the Defence 
of Prisoners&#8217; Rights, was reportedly sentenced to six years of imprisonment and five years 
of deprivation of civil activities. Mr. Baghi was already serving a one-year prison sentence 
passed against him in July 2010, on charges of &#8220;waging propaganda against the Islamic 
Republic of Iran by propagating lies to disturb the public mind&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression reported 
that he and other special procedures mandate holders41 had raised the case of Maziar 
Bahari, a leading Canadian-Iranian editor, playwright, film maker and journalist arrested in 
June 2009, reportedly held incommunicado without charge at Evin prison, where he had no 
access to legal representation or his family, apart from two short phone calls to his mother.  
</p>
<p>31. Restrictions have reportedly had an adverse impact on the publishing industry and 
writers, and resulted in a number of writers postponing publication of books. For instance, 
according to numerous reports, Iranian authorities have banned the books of well-known 
Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, who had been published in the country since 1998.  
</p>
<p>32. Recent months have been marked by a mounting crackdown on human rights 
activists and lawyers. Several prominent human rights defenders have been charged with 
national security offences and convicted to disproportionately heavy sentences and travel 
bans. Others, including their family members, have faced intimidation and harassment. The 
judiciary has criticized lawyers for violating their code of conduct and professional ethics 
by talking to the press. The head of the Iranian judiciary has, on several occasions, deplored 
lawyers&#8217; interviews with the media and stressed that some lawyers were seeking to 
undermine the State with their interviews. Iranian lawyers contest that such public 
advocacy on behalf of their clients has become more necessary in the face of arbitrary 
judicial proceedings.  
</p>
<p>33. Of particular concern recently has been the case of Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent 
human rights lawyer involved in defending many high-profile cases. Her case is 
emblematic of the much broader crackdown on human rights defenders in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and has received significant international attention. Ms. Sotoudeh was 
arrested on 4 September 2010 and charged with &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;, not 
wearing a <i>hejab</i> (Islamic dress) during a videotaped message, &#8220;propaganda against the 
regime&#8221; and for being a member of the Centre for Human Rights Defenders. The case 
against her is widely believed to be linked to her work as a human rights defender. On 8 
January 2011, she was sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment and a 20-year prohibition 
from practicing law and leaving the country. Ms. Sotoudeh has mostly been held in solitary 
confinement in Evin prison since her arrest. During her detention, she went on a hunger 
strike for several weeks to protest against her prolonged detention without trial and the 
</p>
<p>  
 41 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  </p>


<p>detention conditions of other prisoners. When confirming Ms. Sotoudeh&#8217;s sentence, the 
authorities noted that the judgement was not final and was subject to appeal.   
</p>
<p>34. On 16 January 2011, Ms. Sotoudeh&#8217;s husband, Reza Khandan, who had publicly 
campaigned for fair treatment of his wife, was summoned for questioning by the authorities 
and charged with spreading lies and disturbing public opinion. Mr. Khandan was released 
after paying $50,000 bail, but remains at risk of further sanctions by the authorities.  
</p>
<p>35. In a public statement made on 23 November 2010, the High Commissioner 
expressed serious concern at the fate of human rights defenders in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, particularly Ms. Sotoudeh, and urged the Iranian authorities to review her case 
urgently and expedite her release. The High Commissioner noted that many of those 
currently detained were associated with the Centre for Human Rights Defenders, founded 
by the Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi. Mohamad Saifzadeh, a lawyer and co-founder of the 
Centre, was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment and a 10-year ban on practicing law 
for &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221; and &#8220;forming an association whose aim is to harm 
national security&#8221;. Other members of the Centre are being prosecuted on similar charges or 
have been detained for shorter periods and prevented from travelling abroad. Several other 
human rights defenders and lawyers associated with human rights organizations or 
representing clients in sensitive cases were also prosecuted, arrested or put under a travel 
ban in recent months. The High Commissioner urged the Iranian authorities to review also 
the cases of other organizations whose members had been arrested or convicted in recent 
months, including the Committee for the Defence of Political Prisoners in Iran and the 
Committee of Human Rights Reporters, as well as individual lawyers representing clients in 
sensitive cases, together with student activists and leaders. The authorities reported that Mr. 
Seifzadeh had appealed against the sentence, and was subsequently released on bail. 
</p>
<p>36. The Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, in the absence of the High 
Commissioner, wrote to the Government on 22 December 2010 to highlight concerns about 
the case of Ms. Sotoudeh and also cases of other prosecuted or convicted human rights 
activists. She expressed her concern that Mohammad Oliyaeifard, a lawyer and board 
member of the Committee for the Defence of Political Prisoners in Iran, was serving a one-
year prison sentence for allegedly speaking out against the execution of his clients during 
an interview with media. She also pointed out that Javid Houtan Kiyan, who had defended 
Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, was arrested on 10 October 2010 and was still under 
investigation for links to anti-revolutionary groups abroad. The Deputy High Commissioner 
encouraged the Government to guarantee freedom of expression and assembly fully and to 
open up greater space for human rights lawyers and activists who play a pivotal and 
constructive role in protecting human rights in all societies.  
</p>
<p>37. Reports have been received about continued curbs on members of opposition 
groups. A number of opposition parties have had their licenses suspended, and some leaders 
have reportedly been barred from travelling outside the country. Security officials have 
allegedly periodically prevented visitors from visiting opposition leaders and their premises 
have come under sporadic attacks by unknown assailants. The press was reportedly directed 
not to publish items about opposition leaders, whose requests to hold rallies were frequently 
turned down. These measures will adversely affect the environment for conducting the 
parliamentary elections in 2011.  
</p>
<p>38. Opposition activists arrested in the wake of post-election unrest continue to receive 
heavy sentences. According to the Iranian press, in January 2011, the Appeal Court in 
Tehran upheld a sentence of 10 years of imprisonment and another 10-year ban from 
political activities and membership in parties for Emad Bahavar, head of the youth branch 
of the reformist Freedom Movement party. Mr. Bahavar, who was arrested in December 
2009, was charged with being a member of Freedom Movement, collusion and assembly, 
and propaganda against the regime. The internationally acclaimed film maker Jafar Panahi, 
whose case attracted considerable international attention, was also sentenced to six years of 
imprisonment, coupled with a 20-year ban on film making, film writing, travelling abroad </p>


<p>and giving interviews to domestic and international media. Mr. Panahi was arrested in 
March 2010 and charged with collusion and propaganda against the system.42 
</p>
<p><b> H. Lack of right to due process  
</b></p>
<p>39. The right to a fair trial is a key element of human rights protection and serves as a 
procedural means to safeguard the rule of law. The International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, of which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party, stipulates under article 14 
a series of due process and fair trial guarantees, including the right of all persons to a fair 
and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. 
Many fair trial safeguards are provided for in the Constitution and the country&#8217;s legal 
framework. Concerns were raised throughout the year by the High Commissioner and 
special procedures mandate holders about the procedural guarantees being observed in 
relation to trials of Government opponents. The formation of a special court inside Evin 
prison for political and security cases has increased concerns about due process rights for 
detainees. For instance, during preliminary investigations, judges only receive information 
from intelligence officers; suspects&#8217; lawyers are not entitled to meet with their clients, and 
judges have to work in an environment that is under the oversight of the Ministry of 
Intelligence.   
</p>
<p>40. Special procedures mandate holders issued several communications to the Iranian 
authorities in a variety of cases that suggested widespread lack of the right to due process 
and the failure to respect the rights of detainees. Particular concerns were expressed at 
routine practice of incommunicado detention, use of torture and ill-treatment in detention, 
use of solitary confinement and detention of individuals without charge. Concerns were 
also expressed in public about the fact that people sentenced to death often do not have 
access to legal representation and their families and lawyers are not even informed of the 
execution. Although article 35 of the Constitution requires all courts to hold hearings and 
sessions in the presence of defence counsel and considers judgements issued without the 
presence of a defence attorney null and void, in practice many defendants are denied this 
core right. Article 128 of the code of criminal procedures narrows down this constitutional 
guarantee by giving judges the discretionary authority to exclude counsel from hearings on 
sentencing in sensitive cases, or to allow counsel to be present but not to speak until the end 
of proceedings. Reports received further suggest the use of confession extracted through 
coercive methods being admitted in court proceedings and the setting of disproportionately 
high bail payments for the release of detainees.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Cooperation with international human rights mechanisms 
and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p>41. The Islamic Republic of Iran was considered under the universal periodic review 
process on 15 February 2010, and the final review outcome (A/HRC/14/12) was adopted by 
the Human Rights Council on 10 June 2010.43 A total of 188 recommendations were made, 
of which the State fully accepted 123, partly accepted 3, rejected 46 and took note of the 
</p>
<p>  
 42 See www.isna.ir/isna/newsview.aspx?id=news-1691741&amp;lang=p and

 43 Human Rights Council decision 14/111. </p>


<p>remaining 16. Seven of the rejected recommendations related to the visit of specific special 
procedures,44 although the State did accept recommendations about general cooperation 
with the special procedures.45 Other recommendations that enjoyed the State&#8217;s support 
included promoting economic, social and cultural rights and establishing national human 
rights institutions in conformity with the Paris Principles. The Islamic Republic of Iran also 
agreed to consider the abolition of executions of juvenile offenders and guaranteeing free 
and unrestricted access to the Internet.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with the United Nations human rights treaty system  
</b></p>
<p>42. In addition to the ratification of five major United Nations human rights treaties,46 
on 21 September 2010, the Islamic Republic of Iran signed the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>43. On 4 and 5 August 2010, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination considered the eighteenth and nineteenth periodic reports of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran,47 which were due in 2006. The Committee noted various positive 
developments in the State, including the approval of the Law on Citizenry Rights in 2005, 
the amendment of the Fourth Development Plan, which allows budget allocations and a 
percentage of oil and gas revenues for the development of less developed provinces, 
particularly inhabited by disadvantaged ethnic groups, and the country&#8217;s active engagement 
with the international community on human rights issues, such as its initiative on promoting 
dialogue among civilizations. The Committee expressed concerns, however, at reports of 
racial discrimination in everyday life and statements of racial discrimination and incitement 
to hatred by Government officials. It noted that women of minority origin may be at risk of 
facing double discrimination. The Committee noted that the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination had never been invoked by domestic 
courts, and expressed its concern at reports of discriminatory treatment of foreign nationals 
in the Iranian justice system. The Committee encouraged the State to consider ratifying 
those international human rights treaties that it had not yet ratified. In 2009, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran submitted for examination its third periodic report on the implementation 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the Human Rights Committee 
and its second periodic report concerning the implementation of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. They were the first reports submitted by the State 
to the committees in more than a decade, and are expected to be considered in October 
2011 and 2012, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with United Nations special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>44. The Islamic Republic of Iran issued a standing invitation to all thematic special 
procedure mandate holders in June 2002. In 2003 and 2005, six mandate holders visited the 
country, but there have been no visits by any special procedures since 2005.  
</p>
<p>  
 44 Recommendations 5 to 11 call for the facilitation of visits by special procedures mandate holders, 
</p>
<p>including the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Working 
Group on arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p> 45 Recommendations 24 to 28. 
 46 The Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p> 47 CERD/C/IRN/CO/18-19. </p>


<p>45. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has agreed in principle to a number 
of visits by special procedures, including the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances,48 the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions49 and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.50 To date, 
however, the visits have not been scheduled.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur on torture first requested an invitation in 2005, and yearly 
reminders have been sent ever since, most recently in December 2010. Requests for visits 
were also made by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, in 
February 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, in 2006 
(reiterated in her communication reports of both 2009 and 2010), and the Independent 
Expert on minority issues, in 2008 (who sent a reminder in October 2010). A reminder was 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in 2008. 
All the requests remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p>47. Special procedures mandate holders sent a total of 38 communications to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in 2010, of which 36 were urgent appeals; two were allegation letters. The 
Iranian authorities responded to six communications in 2010, although several replies have 
been received since. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>48. On 24 February 2010, the Islamic Republic of Iran officially invited the High 
Commissioner to visit the country, which the High Commissioner accepted for 2011, but 
requested that a working-level mission be allowed to visit the country to prepare for her 
visit . On 24 January 2011, the Secretary-General of the High Council for Human Rights, 
Dr. Larijani, wrote to the High Commissioner to invite such an advance mission. 
</p>
<p>49. On 1 and 2 December 2010, OHCHR and the judiciary of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran conducted a judicial colloquium in Tehran. The event developed out of ongoing 
contacts between OHCHR and the judiciary since 2007. The High Council for Human 
Rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran co-chaired the event, and officials from the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran were also present. 
</p>
<p>50. The colloquium was attended by three international experts &#8211; Dr Kamal Hossain of 
Bangladesh, Professor Walter Kaelin of Switzerland and Judge Aisha Shujune Muhammad 
of Maldives &#8211; together with OHCHR staff. OHCHR encouraged the participation of 35 
judges and prosecutors on the Iranian side, including judges of the Supreme Court, the 
Court of Appeals and the Revolutionary Courts, as well as officials from the prison system 
and correctional institutions. Regrettably, however, a large number of Iranian judges could 
not participate and benefit from the experience of the international experts. The authorities 
explained that a number of invitees could not participate owing to a holiday declared on 
account of smog pollution, but added that the judges who attended the event had organized 
in-house seminars to share their experiences with their colleagues.<b>  </b> 
</p>
<p>51. The topics of discussion at the colloquium were human rights issues related to the 
administration of justice, in particular safeguards for persons upon arrest and in pretrial 
detention, fair trial and due process rights during the trial phase, and conditions of 
</p>
<p>  
 48 A visit was agreed to for July 2004, but was postponed. Follow-up reminders for setting dates were 
</p>
<p>sent in 2008, 2009 and August 2010.  
 49 Initial request sent in November 2004;follow-up requests were sent in February 2005, October 2005, 
</p>
<p>November 2006, December 2008 and September 2010. 
 50 Visits were agreed to in principle in November 2003. Several follow-up requests and reminders were

<p>imprisonment post-conviction, including the prevention of torture. Meeting participants 
also reviewed relevant experiences and resources with regard to training and professional 
development of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>52. The discussions among the participants addressed a wide range of issues, with 
considerable attention paid to various elements of fair trial procedure in the light of the 
main element of general comment No. 32 of the Human Rights Committee on article 14 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The discussion also touched on 
pretrial investigation, arrest procedure, issuance of warrants, judicial review and 
supervision of investigation, time limits for temporary detention, notification and 
communication with families, access to lawyers, the role of prosecutors vis-&#224;-vis judges, 
the right not to be coerced into making self-incriminatory statements and confessions, the 
supervision of places of detention and separation of pretrial detainees from convicted 
prisoners, prison conditions, the protection needs of women prisoners, and children with 
women in detention, as well as judicial training and in-service professional development. 
The experts noted the safeguards provided in the State&#8217;s Constitution as well as the 
executive directives since passed as law, but also the considerable ambiguity and lack of 
clarity in their implementation. There was no official outcome or communiqu&#233; from the 
meeting.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> The present report highlights many areas of continuing concern for human 
rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Secretary-General has been deeply 
troubled by reports of increasing cases of executions, amputations, arbitrary arrest 
and detention, unfair trials and the possible torture and ill-treatment of human rights 
activists, lawyers, journalists and opposition activists.  
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> The Secretary-General encourages the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to address the concerns highlighted in the report and the specific calls to action 
found in previous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and in the universal 
periodic review process. The Secretary-General notes the important and constructive 
role that human rights lawyers and activists play in protecting human rights, and 
encourages the Government to guarantee freedom of expression and assembly fully 
and to open up greater space for human rights lawyers and activists.  
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> With regard to other concerns identified in the report, the Secretary-General 
notes that the authorities have taken some positive steps, for instance, to prevent 
stoning as a method of execution or to limit the application of the death penalty to 
juvenile offenders. The Secretary-General expresses concern, however, that these 
measures have not been systematically enforced and cases of this nature continue to 
arise. He encourages the Government to revise national laws, particularly the Penal 
Code and juvenile justice laws, to ensure compliance with international human rights 
standards and to prevent these applications of the death penalty and other 
punishments, which are prohibited under international law.  
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The Secretary-General welcomes the recent signing of the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict, and calls upon the Government to also ratify other international human 
rights treaties, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and to withdraw the reservations it 
made upon the signature and ratification of various human rights treaties, as 
recommended by the respective treaty bodies.

<p>57.<b> The Secretary-General welcomes the State&#8217;s recent efforts to update its 
periodic reporting to human rights treaty bodies. He encourages it to act upon the </b></p>


<p><b>concluding observations made in August 2010 by the Committee for the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination with respect to discriminatory practices against women, 
ethnic and religious minorities and other minority groups.

<p>58.<b> Although the Government issued a standing invitation to special procedures 
mandate holders of the Human Rights Council in 2002, the Secretary-General regrets 
the fact that no visit has taken place since 2005, and encourages the Government to 
facilitate their requested visits to the country as a matter of priority in order that they 
might conduct more comprehensive assessments. The Secretary-General is also 
concerned about the low rate of reply to the large number of communications sent by 
the special procedures alleging very serious human rights violations, and calls upon 
the Government to strengthen its collaboration with the Council in this particular 
area. The Secretary-General underscores the valuable contribution that special 
procedures mandates can make to monitoring and reporting on the human rights 
situation in the country, as well as in facilitating technical assistance in relevant areas. </b></p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p>This annex includes cases raised in communications with the Iranian authorities by Special 
Procedures mandate-holders but only reported publicly to the Human Rights Council during 
the period under review.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 12 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment jointly with the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of Judges and Lawyers, expressed 
concerns over the detention of Mr Arash Alaei and Mr Kamiar Alaei in section 209 of Evin 
Prison, where detainees are reportedly routinely subjected to prolonged interrogation while 
blindfolded, to solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, threats, beatings and stress 
positions. Concerns were also expressed over the lack of fair trial procedure, where during 
the criminal process that led to the trial of Mr Alaei and Mr Kamiar before Tehran&#8217;s 
Revolutionary Court on 31 December 2008, neither the defendant&#8217;s lawyer was informed of 
all charges against them, nor had they been allowed to review all the evidence in the case. 
The Iranian authorities stated that Mr Alaei and Mr Kamiar were arrested on charges of 
acting against national security and collaborating with belligerent states and were sentenced 
to 6 years and 3 years in prison respectively. The ruling was upheld by the appellate court.  
</p>
<p>2. On 4 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment or punishment drew the attention of authorities to the case of Mr 
Arzhang Davoudi, who was arrested on 9 November 2003 without a warrant and taken to 
section 2A of Evin Prison, where he was held in a solitary cell. Mr Davoudi was allegedly 
beaten, insulted, tortured and interrogated from midnight to morning. After a trial which 
took place behind close doors and lasted less then an hour and without the presence of a 
lawyer, Mr. Davoudi was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. On 14 January 2009, Mr 
Davoudi who resisted security officers from chaining him during his transfer to 15th 
Revolutionary Court was punched by the guards and also handcuffed with one arm over his 
shoulder. He was kept in a single cell with two other prisoners, who were accused of 
murder.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Death penalty   
</b></p>
<p>3. On 22 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions drew the attention of the Government to the cases of several men 
including juveniles sentenced to death on charges of sodomy. According to the information, 
Nemat Safavi was arrested on charges of <i>lavat</i> in June 2006, when he was 16. In 2008, the 
Criminal Court of Ardabil found him guilty and sentenced him to death. In November 
2009, the Supreme Court quashed the sentence and sent the case back to a different section 
of the Criminal Court of Ardabil. On 31 May 2007, Ghaseem Bashkool, a university 
student and another man were arrested on charges of <i>lavat</i> and sentenced them to death. In 
July 2008, the Criminal Court of Tabriz found Mahdi Pooran aged 16, Ebrahim Hamidi, 
Hamid Taghi, and Mehdi Rezai guilty of <i>lavat</i> and sentenced them to death. Furthermore, 
the Criminal Court of Shiraz found Mohsen Ghabraji guilty of <i>lavat</i> and sentenced him to 
death. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court. In February 2008, 
Hamze Chavoshi and Loghman Hemzepour were arrested on charges of <i>lavat</i>.    </p>


<p><b> C. Executions of juvenile offenders  
</b></p>
<p>4. On 22 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions drew the attention of the Government regarding the sentencing of 
juveniles Nemat Safavi and Mahdi Pooran to death on charges of homosexuality. Both 
defendants charged with <i>lavat</i> were sentenced to death for acts committed when they were 
under 18 years. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern over the sentence and stated any 
judgments imposing the death sentence and executions of juvenile offenders would be 
incompatible with the international obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under 
various international human rights instruments including International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and Convention on Child Rights.  
</p>
<p>5. On 31 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions expressed concern regarding Mr. Abu Moslem Sohrabi, a man sentenced to 
death as <i>qesas</i> (retribution) for a killing committed in 2001, when he was aged 17. 
According to information, the death sentence was being affirmed by the Court during the 
review ordered by the Supreme Court in July 2008.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Women&#8217;s rights  
</b></p>
<p>6. On 28 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences jointly with the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent an allegation letter 
regarding the arrest and detention of several members of the One Million Signature 
Campaign, particularly Ms Somayeh Rashidi, who was notably supporting the campaign. 
According to information, on 14 December 2009, security officials went to Ms Rashidi&#8217;s 
house and seized her belongings after searching her house. Five days later, Ms Rashidi was 
summoned to the Revolutionary Court, where she was allegedly interrogated, charged, 
detained and transferred to Evin Prison. It was alleged that several other members of the 
campaign were also previously arrested and detained in April 2009, and more than eleven 
members were allegedly summoned to the Revolutionary Courts for questioning. Concerns 
were expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms Rashidi could be directly related to her 
work in defense of human rights.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of opinion 
and expression  
</b></p>
<p>7. On 19 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, together with the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers sent a 
joint communication regarding Mr. Payam Jahangiry, a student of political science at 
Shiraz University and a supporter of the opposition movement, who was arrested on 5 
December 2009 at his home in Shiraz. The arresting officers who at first identified 
themselves as workers from an electricity provider and forced their way in as Mr. Jahangiry 
opened the door, searched his home and confiscated various personal belongings, including 
four computers and various documents and photographs. Concerns were expressed that the 
arrest and detention of Mr. Jahangiry had been carried out solely in connection with his 
reportedly peaceful and legitimate exercise of his rights to freedom of opinion and 
expression, assembly and association.
