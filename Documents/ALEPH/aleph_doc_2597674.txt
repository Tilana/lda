1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX. 
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report 
either a corporate governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website 
where such a statement is located. The corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has 
followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has 
not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate governance statement must separately 
identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not following the 
recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that 
period. 
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its 
annual report, it must lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX. The corporate governance statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement 
for the purposes of rule 4.10.3. 
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 
which discloses the extent to  which an  entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance 
Council during a particular reporting period. 
3 Mark whichever option is correct and  then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web 
page, where the entity’s corporate governance statement can be found.
