<p><b>PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE MISSION TO CANADA 
 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission to 
Canada from 9 to 22 October 2007 to examine the status of realization of the right to 
adequate housing, particularly for the most vulnerable parts of the population. The visit 
focused on homelessness, women and their right to adequate housing, Aboriginal 
populations&#8217; adequate housing and the possible impact of the 2010 Olympic Games on the 
right to adequate housing in Vancouver.  
 
</p>
<p>2. During the course of the mission, the Special Rapporteur visited urban and rural areas, 
including Montr&#233;al, Kahnawake territories, Edmonton, Little Buffalo and Lubicon, 
Vancouver, Musqueam territories, Toronto and Ottawa. The Special Rapporteur met with 
high-ranking officials, representatives of Government agencies, civil society organizations, 
community-based housing and homelessness service providers and representatives of 
Aboriginal peoples.   
 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government of Canada 
for the invitation and the support it provided during the mission. He regrets that, due to 
various problems, he was not able to finalize his mission report for the 7th session of the 
Human Rights Council. He appreciates the detailed comments and suggestions provided by 
the Government, with little notice, on this preliminary note and will consider them carefully 
in the preparation of the more detailed mission report which he undertakes to complete 
promptly and share with the Government for its review. 
 
</p>
<p><b>I. GOOD PRACTICES 
 
</b></p>
<p>4. Canada has a long and proud history of housing successes, and has been known 
around the world for its innovative housing solutions. The Special Rapporteur visited and 
received information about programmes, laws and policies that represent good practices. It 
included centers and shelters accommodating homeless people, women fleeing from violence, 
Aboriginal women, persons living with HIV-AIDS, children with disabilities, and those 
suffering from drug addictions fully or partially funded by State programmes. Canada can 
also rely on a tremendous range of academic and civil society resources. 
 
</p>
<p><b>II. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
 
</b></p>
<p>5. Canada has a large number of programs relating to housing that are funded by the 
authorities at federal and State level. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met and 
received numerous testimonies from homeless people and those in inadequate and insecure 
housing conditions. This situation was also largely documented by a variety of sources 
including academics, service providers and non-governmental organizations. The prevalence 
of these conditions in one of the richest countries in the world makes them all the more 
striking.  
 
</p>

<p>

<p> </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/16/Add.4

</p>
<p>6. Canada has ratified numerous international human rights instruments that recognize 
the right to housing, creating obligations to take steps for the progressive realization of these 
rights. In its most recent review of Canada&#8217;s periodic report, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, referred to homelessness and inadequate housing as a &#8220;national 
emergency&#8221;.  
 
</p>
<p>7. There has been a significant erosion of housing rights over the past two decades. 
Canada&#8217;s successful social housing programme, which created more than half a million 
homes starting in 1973, has been discontinued. The three remaining national housing and 
homelessness initiatives will expire in the coming months. 
 
</p>
<p><b>III. HOMELESSNESS 
</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the significant number of homeless 
in all part of the country. He was disappointed that the Government could not provide reliable 
statistics on the number of homeless. The National Homelessness Secretariat has estimated 
that there might be 150,000 homeless people, but experts have suggested that the actual 
number may be at least twice as large. 
 
</p>
<p>9. Considering that Canada is a highly developed and wealthy country, the number of 
people living in poverty is striking. Studies indicate that a significant number of people that 
cannot afford housing is growing, resulting in an increasing number of homeless.<b>1</b> Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation notes that 1.5 million Canadian households are classified 
as in &#8220;housing core need&#8221;<b>2</b>, which qualifies them as inadequately housed and may put them at 
risk of homelessness.  
 
</p>
<p><b>III. AFFORDABILITY 
 
</b></p>
<p>10. While the increase of housing prices and the lack of affordability particularly impacts 
the poor, it is progressively affecting other sectors of the population. The Special Rapporteur 
observed an apparent shortage of social housing stock. 
 
</p>
<p>11. Cuts in social spending have heavily impacted many of the lowest-income households 
leading to chronic poverty and inadequate housing, or forcing them to spend most of their 
revenue on housing, with little left for other needs such as food, energy, medicine or clothing.  
 
</p>
<p><b>IV. WOMEN'S RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING 
 
</b></p>
<p>12. The lack of adequate and secure housing particularly impacts women who are 
disproportionally affected by homelessness, affordability problems, violence and 
discrimination in the private rental market. The Special Rapporteur heard many testimonies 
of women, including about insufficient social assistance entitlements that do not match the 
cost of housing and other living expenses or about children being taken away from their

<p>mothers because they were in inadequate housing, an issue that particularly affects 
Aboriginal women.  
 
</p>
<p>13. Studies show that Aboriginal women endure a three time higher rate of spousal 
violence than non-Aboriginal ones. In this context, the lack of protective legislation for 
women living on a reserve constitutes an important barrier to the enjoyment of the right to 
housing and to a life free of violence. Major issues affecting Aboriginal women include 
family and matrimonial real property laws on reserves, overcrowding, violence and 
homelessness. 
 
</p>
<p><b>V. ABORIGINAL PEOPLES RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING 
 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur was disturbed by the impact of an approach that appears 
unduly paternalistic and seems to mark federal and provincial government, legislations, 
policies and budgetary allocation for Aboriginal people on and off reserve. These policies 
compromise the right to self determination and have deeply affected housing and living 
conditions. 
  
</p>
<p>15. Overcrowded and inadequate housing conditions, as well as difficulties to access 
basic services, including water and sanitation, are major problems for Aboriginal peoples. 
The Special Rapporteur witnessed how some Aboriginal families still live without access to 
potable water and sanitation and in clearly inadequate living conditions. He also noted the 
negative impact of oil extraction and other industrial activities, such as in the Lubicon area, 
which continues to lead to the loss of lands and the destruction of livelihoods and traditional 
practices. 
 
</p>
<p><b>VI. PREPARATION OF THE OLYMPICS IN VANCOUVER 
 
</b></p>
<p>16. In Vancouver, the Special Rapporteur looked into the potential impact of the 2010 
Olympic Games on the right to housing, especially of low income groups. Vancouver has 
been an innovative city, incorporating in its bid the Inner-City Inclusive Commitment 
Statement, developed by inner-city community organizations and Government agencies, 
which seeks to address issues related to housing, civil liberties and public safety, health and 
social services, environment and transportation, to ensure accessible and affordable Games. 
The Special Rapporteur met with the CEO of VANOC<b>3</b> who expressed his commitment to 
ensure that the Games would contribute to improve the housing conditions of the poor as a 
positive legacy. 
 
</p>
<p><b>VII. PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
</b></p>
<p>17. At this stage, the Special Rapporteur would like to make these preliminary 
recommendations:

</p>

</p>
<p>18. In order to comply with human rights standards and to efficiently address adequate 
housing for its population, Canada needs to base its policies and programs on the human 
rights framework and fully recognize the right to adequate housing.  
 
</p>
<p>19. Canada needs to commit stable and long-term funding to a comprehensive national 
housing strategy, and to co-ordinate action among the provinces and territories. Canada needs 
to embark again on large scale building of social housing. It should also consider providing 
subsidies including housing allowances or access to other cost-effective ways in order for 
low-income households to meet their housing needs. 
 
</p>
<p>20. The Federal Government should immediately extend and enhance the national 
homelessness programme and the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Programme. 
 
</p>
<p>21. To address effectively the more critical obstacles to enjoyment of the right to 
adequate housing, Canada needs a comprehensive and properly-funded poverty reduction 
strategy respectful of its human rights obligations. 
 
</p>
<p>22. The Federal Government needs to work with the provinces and territories to create a 
consistent framework of tenant protection and rent regulation laws that meet the standards set 
in international housing rights law.  
 
</p>
<p>23. Specific funding should be directed to groups particularly vulnerable to discrimination 
including women, Aboriginal people, the elderly, youth and migrants. The housing 
continuum concept and a plan to make available various forms of housing including 
transitional and supportive housing should be nationally adopted.  
</p><p>24. The Federal Government should commit the funding and resources to ensure access to 
potable water and proper sanitation. 
 
</p>
<p>25. In reserves, there is a need to commit funding and resources to a targeted Aboriginal 
housing strategy that ensures Aboriginal housing and services under Aboriginal control. 
Authorities should genuinely engage with Aboriginal communities to resolve land claims 
such as in the Lubicon region. 
 
</p>
<p>26. Vancouver Olympic officials, and other authorities, need to implement specific 
strategies on housing and homelessness, and to commit funding and resources to support its 
targets, including 3,200 affordable homes. The social development plan should be designed 
and implemented with public participation, so progress can be monitored.
