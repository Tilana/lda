<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report presents a general overview of the situation of the rights of indigenous 
peoples in Asia, based on the information gathered by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people from various sources during 
recent activities in the region, including activities organized by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in Cambodia and Nepal, a follow-up visit to the 
Philippines, and the First Asian Regional Consultation with the Special Rapporteur, held in 
Phnom Penh in February 2007. 
</p>
<p> Indigenous peoples in Asian countries face similar patterns of discrimination and human 
rights violations as in other parts of the world. Drawing from specific examples in various Asian 
countries, the report focuses on issues of particular concern in the region, including the steady 
loss of indigenous lands, territories and natural resources; situations of internal conflict, violence 
and repression faced by these peoples; the implementation of peace accords and autonomy 
regimes; and the special abuses faced by indigenous women. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people was established in 2001 and renewed by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 6/12. According to his mandate, the Special Rapporteur is expected to 
&#8220;gather, request, receive and exchange information from all relevant sources &#8230; on alleged 
violations of [indigenous peoples&#8217;] human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221;, and to &#8220;formulate 
recommendations and proposals on appropriate measures and activities to prevent&#8221; these 
violations. 
</p>
<p>2. The situation of the human rights of indigenous peoples in Asia raises concerns at different 
levels. They are discriminated against and victimized for their origin and identities, especially in 
the case of women. They are excluded from full participation in the political life in the countries 
in which they live. They remain at the margin of national development efforts, and they score 
low in all indicators in relation to their enjoyment of basic rights such as education and health. 
They are impoverished as a result of the loss of their traditional lands, territories and lifestyles. 
They suffer from violence as a result of the defence of their human rights, often by the 
authorities of their own countries. While these processes are experienced by most indigenous 
peoples around the world, the situation of indigenous peoples in Asia presents a number of 
specificities. 
</p>
<p>3. These initial considerations on the human rights of indigenous people in Asia do not 
attempt to provide a full picture of the situation. Rather, they purport to serve as a first input to 
ongoing discussions at the national and international levels in order to improve the protection of 
the rights of indigenous peoples in different countries of the region, taking into account 
similarities in historical, political, legal and social characteristics. Such a regional approach to 
indigenous issues has actively contributed to promoting a wider understanding of these issues, 
particularly in the context of the inter-American or the African human rights system. However, 
such regional perspective is still lacking in the Asian context,<b>1</b> partly due to the absence of a 
regional human rights mechanism. 
</p>
<p>4. The information for this report was gathered through a number of activities in which the 
Special Rapporteur has recently participated. These activities include the follow-up visit by the 
Special Rapporteur organized by local indigenous organizations and NGOs, which took place in 
Quezon City, the Philippines, on 2 and 3 February 2007; the Seminar on Indigenous Peoples and 
Access to Land in Cambodia, organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR), the International Labour Office (ILO), and the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP); and the NGO Forum on Cambodia, and the First Asian 
Regional Consultation with the Special Rapporteur, organized by Tebtebba and the 
Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact Foundation, which took place in Phonm Penh on 7-8 and 
9-11 February 2007, respectively; and the various meetings and on-site visits to communities

</p>
<p>organized by OHCHR in Nepal, on 23-27 April 2007. A summary of the main ideas included in 
this report were presented at the sixth session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues, on the occasion of its half-day discussion on Asia.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN ASIA 
</b></p>
<p>5. Indigenous peoples in Asia are among the most discriminated against, socially and 
economically marginalized, and politically subordinated parts of the society in the countries 
where they live. Time and again disregarded in State&#8217;s law and policy, they number an estimated 
100 million people distributed in virtually all Asian countries, often across State borders. Their 
traditional territories are frequently found in remote areas where they have historically resisted 
the drive of colonization and nation-building, including some of the most bio-diverse areas of the 
world. The push of globalization and State development policies in recent decades have, 
however,  endangered the continuation of their traditional lifestyles, and they are victims of 
serious human rights violations as a consequence of the dispossession of their lands and natural 
resources, widespread violence and repression, and assimilation. 
</p>
<p>6. Asian States differ in the legal recognition and status that they grant to indigenous peoples 
in their own countries, and also in the terminology applied to refer to these different groups in 
their domestic policies and legislation. Thus, depending on the country, they are sometimes 
referred as &#8220;tribals&#8221; or &#8220;tribal people&#8221;, &#8220;hill tribes&#8221;, &#8220;scheduled tribes&#8221;, &#8220;natives&#8221;, &#8220;ethnic 
minorities&#8221;, &#8220;minority nationalities&#8221; and other similar denominations. Specific terms are also 
used in national languages, such as Adivasis (original inhabitants) in India and Bangladesh, 
Orang Asli (original peoples) in Malaysia, or <i>Janajata</i> in Nepal. 
7. In colonial times, some indigenous peoples were given special legal status, as in 
Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. After independence, however, many 
Asian countries asserted the principle of &#8220;national unity&#8221; to suppress any specific recognition of 
indigenous peoples as such, but this approach has begun to change in recent years. In a number 
of countries, indigenous peoples are granted constitutional recognition or are the object of 
special laws, as in the Constitution of India (1950) (referring to indigenous peoples or adivasis as 
&#8220;scheduled tribes&#8221;); the Constitution of Malaysia (1957) (including special provisions in relation 
to the &#8220;natives&#8221; of Sabah and Sarawak); the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights Act (IPRA) of the 
Philippines (1997); and the Cambodian Land Law (2001). Nepal passed in 2002 the National 
Foundation for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities Act (NFDIN Act), and indigenous 
peoples are recognized in the 2006 interim Constitution. The Constitution of Pakistan (1973) 
recognizes federally and provincially administered Tribal Areas, and involves tribal authorities 
in decision-making in these areas. In other countries, indigenous peoples are referred to as ethnic 
minorities and given a legal treatment similar to that of other minority groups, as in the cases of 
China, Viet Nam, or the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic. In other countries, while not 
explicitly recognized as different collectivities, indigenous peoples may have a distinct legal 
status. In Indonesia, most peoples who fall under customary law (<i>Adat</i>) self-identify as 
indigenous peoples. In Japan, the Ainu are not officially considered as indigenous peoples in 
the 1997 Ainu Cultural Promotion Law, but a number of court decisions have affirmed their 
rights based on international indigenous rights standards. This is also the case of Malaysia, 
where the courts have affirmed the aboriginal title of the Orang Asli over their traditional lands. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>8. In addition to the recognition in domestic legislation, three Asian countries, India, 
Bangladesh and Pakistan, are parties of the 1957 International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Populations in Independent Countries (No. 107), and they 
report regularly on the implementation of the convention to the ILO Committee of Experts. 
Nepal has recently ratified the successor instrument, the 1989 ILO Convention on Indigenous 
and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (No. 169), and will thus become the first Asian 
country to have ratified this important instrument. Moreover, the situation of indigenous peoples 
in Asian countries is now routinely examined by United Nations treaty bodies in relation to the 
implementation of the State&#8217;s general international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>9. Despite these varied denominations and legal treatment, some States still oppose the 
relevance of the discussion on the rights of indigenous peoples in the Asian context. Regardless 
of the controversy around issues of definition, there is an overarching consensus among Asian 
legal and political actors on the need to address the human rights issues faced by these groups as 
a result of their distinct identities, lifestyles, and histories. These issues are very similar to those 
faced by indigenous peoples in other parts of the world, and fall entirely within the sphere of the 
current international concern on the rights of these peoples, as reflected in, inter alia, the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. As pointed out by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the Governments concerned 
should provide for the protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights as recognized by international 
law, &#8220;regardless of the name given to such groups in domestic law&#8221; (CERD/C/LAO/CO/15, 
para. 17). From this perspective, this report will analyse the main trends regarding the situation 
of the rights of indigenous peoples of Asia, putting a special emphasis on the issues of most 
immediate concern. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ISSUES OF SPECIAL CONCERN REGARDING THE RIGHTS OF 
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN ASIA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The loss of indigenous peoples&#8217; lands and territories 
</b></p>
<p>10. Some of the most serious forms of human rights violations that indigenous peoples&#8217; 
experience all over Asia are directly related to the rapid loss of indigenous lands and territories, a 
process that, while affecting indigenous peoples all over the world, is particularly marked in the 
Asian context. Development projects, plantation leases, logging concessions, and the 
establishment of protected areas have been major forces in the increasing loss of indigenous 
lands, leading to the massive displacement of indigenous peoples from their traditional 
territories, the degradation of their traditional environment, and rising poverty and migration. 
This trend is fostered by the absence in many Asian countries of precise legal regulations 
affirming indigenous peoples&#8217; customary rights over their traditional lands, territories and 
resources, as well as by the lack of adequate consultation procedures in relation to development 
projects taking place in indigenous territories. 
</p><p>11. In Thailand, despite the recognition of customary natural resource management by local 
communities, legal instruments adopted in recent years, such as the Land Act, the National 
Reserve Forests Act or the National Parks Act, have failed to recognize indigenous and tribal 
peoples&#8217; traditional land tenure and use patterns. The enforcement of these laws has resulted in 
the expulsion of many indigenous and tribal peoples, considered to be illegal encroachers on </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>their ancestral lands, as well as in a number of unresolved disputes between State lands 
(including national parks, watershed areas and forestry preservation areas) and community lands. 
Corruption by law enforcement officers related to the forest industry is said to be rampant. 
</p>
<p>12. The development of single-crop, export-oriented plantations has involved the destruction 
of the natural habitat in both highlands and lowlands where indigenous peoples live, severely 
limiting the amount of land available for their livelihood and depleting water sources. In 
Sarawak, Malaysia, alone, an estimated 2.4 million hectares has been given under plantation 
licences for the monoculture of palm oil and pulp. Many of these concessions are given for 
indigenous traditional lands declared &#8220;development areas&#8221; and leased for prolonged periods. 
Indonesia has announced its intention to become the world&#8217;s largest producer of palm oil, seen as 
a growing alternative source of energy; the official target is to plant 4.6 million hectares 
throughout the archipelago. This has justified the transformation of the remaining forest areas 
into large plantations, with devastating effects on the local indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>13. Land-grabbing in Cambodia has become a dramatic example of a trend that is also 
discernible in other Asian countries. Even though the 2001 Land Law incorporates a number 
of advanced provisions concerning indigenous communal lands, indigenous communities are 
losing their lands at an alarming rate as a result of economic concessions, illegal land transfer, 
and widespread Government corruption. This dynamic is mounting in the densely 
indigenous-populated provinces of Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri, where the dispossession of 
indigenous lands has resulted in increased rates of poverty and forced migration. In the last 
decade alone, an estimated 6.5 million hectares of forest have been expropriated through 
concessions to timber companies, and another 3.3 million hectares were declared protected areas 
(see the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous report, A/HRC/4/32, para. 15). This critical situation is 
fostered by the insufficient legal development of the indigenous land provisions of the Land 
Law, including the lack of a procedural framework for land demarcation and titling; many 
observers claim that there will be little land left to title by the time the sub-decree on titling is 
really implemented. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for human rights in 
Cambodia has repeatedly called attention to the seriousness of the situation, and has 
recommended that, until the adoption of the sub-decree on collective ownership of indigenous 
lands, a moratorium on land sales affecting indigenous peoples should be considered by relevant 
authorities (E/CN.4/2006/110, para. 31). 
</p>
<p>14. In the Philippines, the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (1997), recognizes indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights over their ancestral lands and territories, and incorporates a process of 
demarcation and titling through the granting of Certificates of Ancestral Domain Titles (CADT). 
In the last six years, more than 670 CADT applications have been submitted. With an average 
of 4.5 titles issued per year, it has been estimated that the National Commission on Indigenous 
Peoples will take almost 25 years to issue titles in response to existing applications. Among the 
reasons of the slowness of the titling process, the existence of overlap between ancestral domain 
areas and existing leases for mining, agro-forest, logging activities and pasture lands has been 
noted. 
</p>
<p>15. The loss of access to natural resources is similarly experienced by coastal peoples. For 
instance, the Palawan and the Molbog tribes in Bugsuk, Southern Palawan, are still struggling to 
regain access to their ancestral marine territory after a pearl farm was established. Fishermen 
who are caught in the perimeter of the farm complain about harassment, ill-treatment and illegal </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>detention by company guards. Confronted with these vested interests, the National Commission 
has been accused of a weak commitment towards fully implementing its mandate. In the report 
on his visit to Japan, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism described how the 
Ainu are still greatly limited in their capacity to fish salmon, their traditional food. This situation 
is &#8220;humiliating, since it puts them in a position of dependence on the public authorities in the 
access to their ancestral alimentary resources&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.2, para. 45).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  The situation of forest peoples 
</b></p>
<p>16. Commercial logging, both illegal and Government-sponsored, is a major source of 
indigenous land loss in practically all countries of the region. For instance, in Bangladesh, India, 
Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, forests are considered State-owned lands, and 
indigenous communities lack any legal venue to counter government policies in these areas or 
seek compensation in cases in which their traditional lands are lost. 
</p>
<p>17. The Andhra Pradesh Community Forest Management Project (APCFMP), launched 
in 2002 in India with the support of the World Bank, has been opposed by Adivasi organizations, 
who claim that the procedural safeguards incorporated by the World Bank (including the 
establishment of forest protection committees or Vana Samrakshana Samithi) have not been 
adequately implemented. 
</p>
<p>18. In Malaysia, indigenous communities have denounced that the national forestry 
certification system run by the Malaysian Timber Certification Council (MTCC) fails to 
recognize and protect indigenous customary rights over the forest they have traditionally 
occupied or used for their subsistence. Several cases have been brought to the national courts 
as a result of the granting of timber certification to private companies operating in communal 
lands, without prior consultation of the communities concerned and with no compensation paid 
to the people. In some cases, indigenous communities have mobilized against logging in their 
ancestral territories, like the Dusun community of Terian, Sabah, which recently stopped an 
illegal logging road that threatened its traditional forest near Crocker Range National Park. 
Similarly, the Penan people in the Middle Baram region of Sarawak have led several peaceful 
blockades and have endured violence by loggers and security forces. 
</p>
<p>19. As in other parts of the world, indigenous peoples in Asia have suffered the direct 
consequences of the establishment of national parks. This is for instance the case of the 
Modhupur National Park Development, in Modhupur, Tangail District of Bangladesh. The 
Eco-Park project, initiated in 1999, involved the erection of walls that cut across the Modhupur 
forest, ancestral land of the Garo and Koch peoples, without previously consulting them. 
Suspended in 2004, the Eco-Park project was resumed after the declaration of the state of 
emergency in January 2007, and there have been serious allegations of the detention of 
indigenous leaders, torture and even killings. 
</p>
<p>20. Despite international praise for its international conservation efforts, Nepal&#8217;s community 
forests have forced many indigenous communities, like the Chepangs and the Rautes, from 
their traditional lands. In Sri Lanka, the Wanniyala-Aetto indigenous people were evicted 
in 1983 from the lands which they have occupied for centuries to give way to the Maduru Ova 
National Park; since then, their numbers have fallen to just 2,500 members, half of the original 
population, and they are on the verge of extinction. More than 1,000 Adivasis have been </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>expelled from the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary in Wayanad, State of Kerala, India. In 
Indonesia, the Moronene people of Southeast Sulawesi have been evicted several times since 
their traditional territory was declared a conservation forest in 1997. A similar case is that of the 
Wana people after the Government announced the creation of the Morowali conservation area in 
their traditional territory. The Semi tribe in Malaysia is opposing the establishment of a National 
Botanical Garden in the Perak State, a project that aims at becoming a major tourist attraction but 
that would expel the community from the ancient rainforest in which they lived for generations, 
and over which they do not possess a formal title. 
</p>
<p>21. In recent years, a number of countries have started to address the legal vacuum concerning 
indigenous peoples&#8217; communal land rights with the adoption of new legislation. Following the 
example of countries like Cambodia or the Philippines, the 2003 Land Law in Viet Nam includes 
the category of &#8220;communal land&#8221;, which has opened the possibility for indigenous people to 
apply for titles over their ancestral land and forest rights; some difficulties still need to be 
clarified concerning the interpretation of various provisions of the law. In 2006, after many 
massive protests by Adivasis and forest dwellers, India adopted the Scheduled Tribes and other 
Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill. The Bill grants extensive 
rights to indigenous forest dwellers, including the right to possess forest land for habitation and 
self-cultivation purposes, as well as the right of access to forest resources and to participate in 
conservation efforts. The Bill further incorporates a special procedure for the establishment of 
&#8220;critical wildlife areas&#8221;, as well as for the informed relocation and rehabilitation of the affected 
communities. 
</p>
<p>22. In the absence of specific legislation, national courts have played a major role in 
affirming indigenous peoples&#8217; rights over their traditional forest. For instance, in Malaysia, a 
number of decisions by the Supreme Court, including the path-breaking <i>Sagong</i> <i>Tasi v. Negeri 
Kerajaan Selangor</i> (2002), have recognized the existence of the Orang Asli native title over their 
traditional lands, even in the absence of a formal title deed, despite the lack of statutory 
recognition of their rights in Malaysian law. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Forced relocation and international resettlement 
</b></p>
<p>23. One of the most serious threats to indigenous peoples&#8217; survival in Asia relates to the 
construction of megaprojects and other forms of forced relocation or resettlement in the name of 
&#8220;national development&#8221;, which take place in several Asian countries at a particularly alarming 
rate. The Special Rapporteur has expressed his concern in relation to some of these projects.  
</p><p>24. In India, according to the Five-Year Plan (2002-2007) of the National Commission on 
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, 8.54 million tribals have been displaced from their 
traditional lands as a result of development projects in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, 
Gujarat, Maharastra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Orissa, of which less than a quarter have 
been resettled. According to the Commission, this massive displacement has led to &#8220;loss of 
assets, unemployment, debt bondage and destitution&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur, as well as other 
human rights mechanisms, have repeatedly expressed their major concern about the Sardar 
Sarovar Dam and Power Project, a multi-year, multipurpose project affecting areas in the States 
of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and involving the relocation of 
320,000 people and affecting the livelihood of thousands of others. There is concern about the 
lack of adequate compensation or resettlement schemes of the tribal communities affected. In </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>addition, 168 new dams are scheduled for construction in north-eastern India, without 
meaningful participation by or the consent of the Bodos, Hmars, Nagas and other indigenous 
communities that have traditionally owned the land. These dams, it is argued, that will provide 
electric power to other parts of India, will create irreparable harm to indigenous peoples&#8217; 
traditional subsistence communities. Concern has also been expressed that these proposed dams 
are located in a highly seismic area. 
</p>
<p>25. Similar large-scale displacement has resulted from mining. The Government of 
Jharkhand has opened lands to 41 steel and mining companies for large-scale resource 
extraction, which will result in the destruction of 57,000 hectares of forest and the displacement 
of 9,615 families, 80 per cent of whom belong to scheduled tribes. Similarly, State-sponsored 
mining projects in Orissa have resulted since 2004 in the displacement of hundreds of Jarene 
families, and 300 other families are still under threat as a result of new projects. The Khasi 
people of Eastern Meghalaya now face the proposed resumption of uranium mining in its 
traditional territory, involving the displacement of an estimate of 30,000 people, the massive 
influx of non-indigenous settlers, and possible health risks. 
</p>
<p>26. The 13-dam cascade project on the Chinese portion of the Nu river would have a 
considerable effect on the Nu, Lissu, Yi, Pumi and other ethnic minorities in the area, and 
its impact on the richly biodiverse Three Parallel Rivers World Heritage Site has raised the 
concern of UNESCO&#8217;s World Heritage Committee. Viet Nam is currently embarked on the 
construction of the Son Lam Dam, the largest such project in the region, involving the 
submersion of 24,000 hectares of land and the forced removal of 100,000 people, mostly ethnic 
minorities. The Bakun Dam in Malaysia is reported to cause the forced displacement of 5,000 to 
8,000 indigenous persons from 15 communities by clear-cutting 80,000 hectares of rainforest. In 
the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, the construction of the Nam Theun 2 dam, in 
Khammouane province, involves the displacement of as many as 6,200 indigenous people. The 
Special Rapporteur, along with other special procedures, is currently engaged in a constructive 
dialogue with the Government of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, the World Bank and 
other donors, promoting the effective implementation of the relocation and compensation 
programme. 
</p>
<p>27. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and Thailand have undertaken the resettlement of 
many tribal people as part of their programme of eradication of drug plantations. The 
Government of Thailand launched in 2003 a master plan for community development, 
environment, and narcotic plant control on the highland, leading to the displacement of 
indigenous communities. Due to the relocation schemes, many of these communities have 
broken up, and they often lack alternative ways to provide for their subsistence. The Lao 
Government&#8217;s campaign of eradication of the opium poppy has been internationally praised as 
a success, but it has led the displacement of an estimated 65,000 hill tribe people into new 
villages where they are said to experience severe food shortages, disease, and mortality rates as 
high as 4 per cent.  
</p>
<p>28. The Government of Viet Nam has adopted a &#8220;fixed field/fixed residence&#8221; policy that 
involves the resettlement of ethnic minorities, including many indigenous and tribal 
communities, from remote areas into other more easily accessible locations. The purpose of this 
resettlement is to make social services more easily available to these communities, but also to 
replace their traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, viewed as inefficient by the Government, by </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>other methods of sedentary agriculture. The resettlement has generated the social and cultural 
disintegration of many of these communities, as well as increased ethnic tension as a result of a 
state-sponsored migration programme to bring non-indigenous settlers into the indigenous 
highlands. A similar stand has been taken in the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, where 
numerous Hmong communities have been forcibly relocated by the Government from their 
traditional lands in the highlands and resettled in so-called &#8220;focal sites&#8221;, together with other 
ethnic minority groups or Hmong from different clans. Reports indicate that these resettlement 
sites are often not arable lands, and that their traditional life has been eroded. In its last 
concluding observations on Laos, CERD recommended that the Government avoid displacement 
and, if necessary, &#8220;ensure that the persons concerned are made fully aware of the reasons for and 
modalities of their displacement and of the measures taken for compensation and resettlement&#8221; 
(CERD/C/LAO/CO/15, para. 18). 
</p>
<p>29. The Dukha (Tsaatan) people, a reindeer-herder community living in Mongolia&#8217;s Darhat 
Valley, endured similar attempts of forceful relocation during the 1950s. Now they are striving 
to retain their traditional culture against the depletion of their herds and the loss of their 
traditional lands. The establishment of the Lake Baikal and Sayan Mountains Peace Park, in the 
border between the Russian Federation and Mongolia, home of the Dukha and other peoples 
such as the Soyot and Buryat, or the 2002 adoption of the Charter Agreement on the Protection 
of the Transboundary Reindeer Herding Cultures of the Russian Federation and Mongolia, 
constitute important initiatives to promote the respect for indigenous peoples&#8217; semi-nomadic 
lifestyles with the protection of the environment in their traditional territories. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Conflict and repression  
</b></p>
<p>30. Historically, the denial of equal enjoyment of political and other rights has led to an 
increase in violence that, in many cases, has involved indigenous peoples directly. Internal 
conflict has posed an enormous burden on indigenous communities and other parties involved, 
and has sometimes led to massive human rights violations. Countless cases are also reported 
concerning abuses suffered by indigenous peoples by military and paramilitary forces in the 
name of public security, anti-insurgency, and counter-terrorism. Examples of these dynamics in 
the past decades include the armed insurgencies in north-eastern India, in Aceh and West Papua, 
in Indonesia, and in Mindanao, in the Philippines, as well as the protracted conflicts in 
Myanmar and Nepal. In the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, some indigenous 
peoples still face retaliation for their involvement in armed conflicts during the war with the 
United States of America a generation ago, and they are reportedly denied full citizen rights and 
persecuted as criminals.  
</p>
<p>31. Indigenous peoples (or &#8220;ethnic minorities&#8221;) in Myanmar, like the Kachin, Karen, Karenni, 
Mon, or Shan, represent one third of the country&#8217;s total population. They have endured the worst 
consequences of the civil war that has stricken the country for half a century, and which involved 
indigenous groups fighting against the military government. They experience all sorts of human 
rights violations in the context of counter-insurgency operations against indigenous groups, 
including extrajudicial killings, massacres, torture and sexual violence, and large movements of 
refugees and internally displaced persons as a result. The ILO has also denounced the practice of 
forced labour, particularly in indigenous areas. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>32. Different sources have documented the countless deaths of civilians, including children 
and elders, as a result of the continuous struggle of the Hmong with the Lao Government since 
</p><p>1975. It has been estimated that 20 rebel groups are surrounded by the Lao military and reduced 
to starvation and disease in the forest where they have sought refuge. Many of them have fled to 
Cambodia and Thailand, where there have been reports of hundreds of deportations. Following 
the upsurge of military activity reported in recent years, several hundred Hmong have reportedly 
&#8220;surrendered&#8221; to Lao authorities, and episodes of human rights abuses have been reported, like 
the killing and gang rape of five girls by armed forces in 2004 (CERD/C/LAO/CO/15, para. 22). 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur has received reports documenting hundreds of human rights 
violations of individual &#8220;Degar&#8221; or &#8220;Montagnard&#8221; people in Viet Nam. These allegations refer to 
cases of arbitrary arrest, ill-treatment, torture and extrajudicial killing by security forces. In 
addition, it has been alleged that 350 Degar prisoners remain in Vietnamese prisons for human 
rights activism, for spreading Christianity or for attempting to flee to neighbouring countries. 
Following the February 2001 and April 2004 protests in the Central Highlands region of 
Viet Nam, when numerous killings and other human rights abuses by security forces were 
reported, many hundreds of indigenous asylum-seekers fled the country into neighbouring 
Cambodia in fear of government repression. 
</p>
<p>34. The massive scale of political killing of indigenous leaders and human rights defenders in 
the Philippines has been the object of increased international concern in recent years. Leaders 
and members of indigenous organizations are tagged as &#8220;legal fronts&#8221; of the Communists 
because of their human rights-related activities, and also because of their opposition to mining 
operations and other megaprojects that threaten indigenous communities. The Melo 
Commission, established in 2006 by the Parliament to investigate the situation, concluded that 
the majority of the killings could be attributed to members of the Philippine military. According 
to a report of Indigenous Peoples Watch-Philippines, 119 such killings took place in the period 
from April 2001 to January 2007. Recent examples of such acts are the killing of Rafael Markus 
Nagit, in June 2006, and the attempted assassination of Dr. Constancio &#8220;Chandu&#8221; Claver in 
July 2006, leading to his wife&#8217;s death. The situation has been reported on by the Special 
Rapporteur during his official visit to the country in 2002 (see E/CN.4/2003/90/Add.3, para. 46); 
since his visit, the murder of another 84 indigenous leaders has been reported.   
</p>
<p>35. Indigenous peoples of north-eastern India have repeatedly denounced the human rights 
violations committed by security forces under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) 
(1958), adopted in the context of an armed conflict in Assam, Nagaland, and Manipur. After 
a 1997 decision of the Indian Supreme Court that questioned the constitutionality of several of 
the AFSPA provisions, a review committee appointed by the Government in 2004 proposed the 
amendment of the Act, but its recommendations were never publicly released, and violations of 
human rights continue unabated. Following the declaration of the state of emergency by the 
President of Bangladesh in January 2007, the Special Rapporteur received many allegations of 
suppressive actions against indigenous leaders and organizations that would have involved 
the Joint Forces, consisting of the military, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), the Bangladesh 
Rifles (BDR), and the police and intelligence servicemen, which were given special powers to 
control corruption. Among the alleged abuses, there are reported cases of arbitrary arrest, 
detention and torture of members of Jumma leaders in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and other 
regions. Decades of conflict in Nepal and in several Indonesian provinces, including Aceh </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>(Nanggr&#246;e Aceh Darussalam) and West Papua (Irian Jaya), have left behind a tragic record of 
killings, forced displacement and other serious human rights abuses among local indigenous 
groups. Indigenous peoples now demand full participation in the post-conflict political 
arrangements, and plead for transitional justice schemes to repair past human rights violations. 
</p><p>36. Local conflicts resulting from the lack of recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples to 
their communal lands is another permanent source of repression and abuse and often leads to 
violations of human rights violations of indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur has received 
many reports from countries such as India, Indonesia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, 
Malaysia and Thailand, of arbitrary arrest or fake criminal charges made against members of 
indigenous and tribal peoples, as well as other forms of threats and intimidations, as a result of 
their mobilization to defend their rights against State authorities. Cases of ill-treatment and 
torture during detention, as well as extrajudicial killings have also been widely reported. In India, 
for instance, 15 Adivasis were killed in 2003 as a result of the use of excessive police force in 
the demonstrations to protest against the establishment of the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary. In 
Laos, 10 Degar people were killed as a result of the 2004 protests in the Central Highlands. In 
the Philippines, the lethal conjunction of militarization and large-scale mining and dam projects 
have led indigenous peoples to coin the expression &#8220;development aggression&#8221;, which is to blame 
for a wide range of human rights violations, including murders, massacres, and illegal detention. 
The critical situation faced by the various Lumad in Mindanao or the Tumandok on Panay Island 
are cases in point. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Citizenship rights, refugees and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>37. The lack of citizen rights has been a long-standing cause of human rights violations 
against members of the hill tribes in Thailand since the enactment of the Citizenship/Nationality 
Act in 1965. According to 2004 estimates, 90,700 original hill people were not given Thai 
citizenship nor do any enjoy other legal status, remaining stateless in their own countries. The 
lack of access to citizenship rights make them subject to many abuses, like charges of illegal 
entrance in the country and denial of freedom of movement, threats, intimidation, and bribery. 
They are also denied access to basic social services, including health care and education as well 
as income-generating activities. A mix of discriminatory laws and procedures, deeply-rooted 
prejudices, and corruption are among the main causes of this situation, which has been 
repeatedly denounced by human rights bodies, including the Committee of the Rights of the 
Child (CRC/C/THA/CO/2, para. 24), the Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination 
Against Women (CEDAW/C/THA/CO/5, para. 37), and the Human Rights Committee 
(CCPR/CO/84/THA, paras. 22-24). 
</p>
<p>38. Indigenous and tribal peoples in Myanmar face the worst consequences of the civil war 
that has stricken the country for decades. For instance, as a result of the large-scale offensive that 
took place in Karen State during 2006, 27,000 civilians were displaced, and some 232 villages 
destroyed. According to one independent source, between 2004 and 2006, some 470,000 Mon, 
Karen, Shan and Karenni were internally displaced as a consequence of violence, military 
operations and human rights abuses. Others have been able to flee the country, and survive in 
extremely difficult conditions in formal or informal refugee camps in neighbouring countries. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>39. Special mention must be made of the plight of the Khmer Krom people in southern 
Viet Nam who complain about serious human rights violations, especially concerning 
citizenship, religious freedom, land rights and gender issues, as a result of complex historical and 
geopolitical factors. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Autonomy rights and implementation of peace accords 
</b></p>
<p>40. In a number of Asian countries, constructive arrangements, including autonomy regimes, 
have sought to accommodate the ethnic diversity of some regions, or to put an end to decades of 
armed conflict. Inasmuch as many of these arrangements provide for limited autonomy in local 
affairs, political participation, and land and cultural protection, they represent positive steps 
towards the promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples. However, comparative experience 
suggests that these arrangements have a mixed record in terms of implementation, and that much 
remains to be done by the Governments concerned, and by the international actors committed to 
the monitoring of these arrangements, to ensure that indigenous communities are actively 
involved and their human rights concerns taken into account.  
</p>
<p>41. Similar dynamics are found in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), in Bangladesh, where an 
autonomy regime was instituted in 1997 following the Peace Accord between the Government 
and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti, a party representing 11 different indigenous 
communities of the Jumma people. Indigenous people claim that many vital provisions of the 
Accord have not yet been put in place, including the setting up of a functioning Land 
Commission (constituted in 1999 but still not fully operative), the rehabilitation of Jumma 
refugees and internally displaced persons, and the formation of a CHT-based police force. The 
policy of Government-sponsored transmigration has dramatically changed the ethnic 
composition of the region, and Bengalese settlers represent now more than 60 per cent of the 
region&#8217;s population, compared to only 2 per cent in 1947. This influx has facilitated cultural 
assimilation, while creating increased ethnic animosity over diminishing land and resources. 
Instead of demilitarizing the area, it has been claimed that the Government has continued 
sending armed forces to the region under the umbrella of the Uttoran (&#8220;uplift&#8221;) and Shantakaran 
(&#8220;pacification&#8221;) programmes, allowing for military intervention in civilian administration and in 
the establishment of settler villages.  
</p>
<p>42. In 2001, Indonesia adopted the Special Autonomy Law No. 21, aiming at finding a 
solution to West Papua&#8217;s political status and to bring peace to the province. Similarly, a 
Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh 
Movement was signed in 2005, providing for a limited autonomy to Aceh within basic sectors of 
public affairs, as well as for the right to consultation concerning international agreements for 
special interest to Aceh. While constructive arrangements have been seen as positive steps, the 
experience of West Papua after more than five years of the entry into force of the autonomy 
regime is disquieting. The Government has continued promoting the massive arrival of settlers 
on the island, the region is still heavily militarized, and episodes of repression and abuse in 
Puncak Jaya and other parts of the highlands have recently been reported. 
</p>
<p>43. Since a ceasefire was reached in Nagaland in 1997, the Government of India and several 
Naga insurgent groups are involved in a peace process seeking to find the political 
accommodation of the Naga people under the Indian Constitution. The peace process, which 
follows decades of violent insurgency in various north-eastern states, is subject to ongoing </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>tensions due to the resumption of violence, internal rivalries among the Nagas and the animosity 
of neighbouring communities and state governments at the attempt to extend the ceasefire 
agreement to areas beyond Nagaland. Despite the many difficulties, the Nagas favour a peaceful 
settlement of the conflict and demand full implementation of the 1997 agreement as a 
precondition to achieve this goal. 
</p>
<p>44. A deeply entrenched system of ethnic and caste-based hierarchy, along with decades of 
internal conflict, has led to a disproportionate part of indigenous peoples among Nepal&#8217;s poor. 
Nepal&#8217;s indigenous peoples, who represent 37 per cent of the national population, have 
denounced that the recently endorsed Interim Constitution fails to provide them with an equal 
representation in the Constituent Assembly, and they are now demanding a federal republic 
based on ethnic and regional autonomy. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  The rights of indigenous women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>45. Gender-based violence has been recurrently used in the armed conflict in Myanmar, where 
numerous cases of gang-rape, sexual enslavement and killing of tribal women by members of the 
military have been reported. Although some of these cases have been well documented, the 
military has routinely failed to investigate these abuses. In the CHT in Bangladesh, many cases 
of rape of Jumma girls and women by settlers backed by the military have been denounced, but 
in many cases the investigation of these cases is hampered by inaction on the part of the military 
and even of health professionals. In the Philippines, the militarization of many indigenous areas 
has also resulted in the sexual abuse of women of local indigenous communities. In India, the 
AFSFA has justified impunity of sexual violence by members of the military against tribal 
women, sometimes with the argument that they support insurgent groups. 
</p>
<p>46. The increasing numbers of indigenous women who have become victims of sexual 
trafficking and prostitution is of special concern. While systematic data is still lacking, in 
countries such as Mongolia, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, 
Cambodia and Viet Nam, indigenous women and girls are prime targets for trafficking and 
exploitation as beggars, sex workers, domestic workers, and even child soldiers. In areas such as 
Chiang Mai, Thailand, where there are thousands of indigenous women working as sex workers, 
70-80 per cent of these women are reportedly HIV-positive. In other cases, such as in Nepal, 
Indonesia, Bangladesh or the Philippines, indigenous women and girls are forced to leave their 
communities and search for jobs in other countries. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>In recent years the plight of indigenous peoples in Asia has started to become a 
specific issue of concern in the international human rights agenda, as well as in domestic 
legislation and policies. Indigenous issues are increasingly the object of specific attention by 
several Asian States in key areas such as land rights, cultural protection, autonomy and 
self-government and development policies, thus signalling an important change of 
mentality regarding the recognition of cultural difference and its human rights 
implications. However, there is still an important implementation gap with regard to 
existing constitutional and legal provisions, and much remains to be done in order to 
mainstream indigenous rights in policies and the institutional machinery at the national </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/6/15/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p><b>level. These developments are overshadowed by the human rights violations still suffered 
by indigenous peoples in some countries of the region as a result of internal conflicts and 
insensitive official policies.</b> 
</p>
<p>48. <b>Indigenous peoples in Asian countries face patterns of discrimination and human 
right abuses similar to indigenous peoples in other parts of the world. Some of the most 
serious violations are related to the lack of effective protection in domestic laws and 
policies regarding indigenous rights over their traditional territories, lands and natural 
resources, as well as to their right to participate in decisions affecting these lands and 
resources. This has led to widespread violations in practically all countries of the region as 
a result of land-grabbing and corruption, forced displacement associated with the 
extension of plantation economies, the construction of megaprojects, and particularly dam 
construction and mining, and other State development policies.</b> 
</p>
<p>49. <b>Forest peoples are particularly affected by these dynamics of dispossession and 
removal, as the forests are quickly disappearing as a result of Government-promoted and 
illegal logging and other State policies, often with disastrous environmental effects. 
Pastoralist communities similarly confront the loss of their distinct livelihoods and 
cultures, essential to nomadic herding, which is frequently deemed &#8220;backward&#8221; and 
&#8220;unecological&#8221; in official discourse and policy.</b> 
</p>
<p>50. <b>While militarization and State repression are frequently the source of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; human rights violations in many parts of the world, the recurrent and widespread 
character of these abuses in Asian countries gives rise to special concern. Decades-long civil 
conflicts, insurgency movements, political crimes, and other abuses committed in the name 
of the struggle against terrorism or secessionism have taken a deadly toll in indigenous and 
tribal communities. Massacres, killings of social activists and human rights defenders, 
torture, sexual violence, and displacement are still daily realities for many such 
communities. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the complexity of the various 
contexts in which these violations occur, the seriousness of these violations leads to the 
conclusion that the indigenous peoples are widely regarded in many countries as 
&#8220;backward&#8221;, second class citizens. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>A number of constructive arrangements have been put in place in order to 
accommodate ethnic diversity or to find a peaceful solution to conflicts which have lasted 
for decades. While these initiatives provide important examples of ways in which the 
principles of State integrity and autonomy can be combined in the Asian context, a 
common denominator of ongoing experiences is the lack of implementation of existing legal 
and political arrangements. Militarization, induced migration, unequal development 
policies, and resulting human rights abuses are questioning the spirit of such 
arrangements, while fuelling the conflicts they seek to prevent. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>As elsewhere in the world, the indigenous women of Asia experience accumulated 
layers of discrimination and marginalization. They are subject to human rights violations 
as a result of longstanding conflicts and the impoverishment of their communities. Sexual 
violence, trafficking and labour exploitation are daily realities for many Asian indigenous 
women, a problem that is just beginning to be fully understood.</b>  </p>

</p>
<p><b>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The protection of the rights of indigenous peoples is a human rights imperative that 
cannot be subordinated to, nor is it contradictory with, the objectives of national unity or 
development. The Special Rapporteur calls upon Asian States to give priority attention to 
indigenous issues, regardless of the constitutional and legal status afforded to these groups 
in their domestic systems, taking into consideration international norms as well as the 
positive examples found in comparative legislation in Asia and other parts of the world.</b>  
</p>
<p>54. <b>Asian States should continue their efforts to enter into dialogue with indigenous 
peoples in order to work out constructive legal and political arrangements, within a spirit 
of mutual respect, autonomy and self-determination. These demands should not be 
repressed or criminalized, and their basic human rights should be fully respected at all 
times, including in situations of conflict.</b>   
</p>
<p>55. <b>National legislation in Asian countries should incorporate indigenous peoples&#8217; 
property and use rights over communal lands, forest areas, pastures, and other natural 
resources, with due regard to indigenous customary laws, traditional lifestyles, and 
cultural values. Where such legislation exists, renewed efforts should be made in order to 
make indigenous rights effective, and special emphasis should be put on the demarcation 
and titling of indigenous lands. The systematic removal of indigenous peoples from their 
traditional lands as a public policy should be halted, and such removal of indigenous 
peoples from their traditional lands should be regarded as a last alternative and in cases of 
utmost necessity, and under condition that they be fully compensated.</b> 
</p>
<p>56. <b>Indigenous peoples should be involved in decision-making at all levels in the countries 
in which they live. They should participate in the design and implementation of all policies 
that may affect them directly, particularly with regard to development projects taking 
place in their lands and territories.</b> 
</p>
<p>57. <b>Asian countries should actively promote the implementation of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Following the example of Nepal, 
consideration should be given to the prompt ratification of ILO Convention No. 169 on 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, particularly by those States that are already parties to the 
previous ILO Convention, No. 107.</b> 
</p>
<p>58. <b>International organizations and agencies, as well as international financial 
institutions, should mainstream indigenous rights into their programmes and activities in 
Asian countries, on the basis of international norms and their own policy guidelines in this 
area, irrespective of the level of recognition of these rights in domestic legislation and 
policies. OHCHR country and regional offices in Asia should further strengthen in their 
programmes of work the rights of indigenous peoples, particularly of indigenous women. 
UNDP and ILO should continue their efforts to promote their policies on indigenous 
peoples. The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and bilateral donors should ensure 
that their safeguards and guidelines in relation to indigenous peoples are fully respected in 
their Asian projects.</b>
