<p><i>Summary</i> 
 The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief on his visit to the Republic of Sierra Leone, 
which took place from 30 June to 5 July 2013. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the admirable culture of inter- and intra-
religious open-heartedness cherished in families, neighbourhoods, schools and public life in 
Sierra Leone. People from the country&#8217;s two main religions &#8212; Islam and Christianity &#8212; 
live together in peace and harmony and this tolerant attitude generally extends to adherents 
of traditional African spirituality. The same amicable spirit guides the relationships 
between different branches within Islam &#8212; Sunnis, Shias, Ahmadis &#8212; as well as the 
different denominations within Christianity &#8212; Anglicans, Catholics, Evangelicals and 
others. Interreligious marriages and conversions in various directions are widespread and 
generally receive approval from families and communities. The Inter-Religious Council of 
Sierra Leone has played a pivotal role in the ongoing process of rebuilding the nation after 
a civil war in which atrocities beyond human imagination were committed.

<p>The Special Rapporteur also identifies a number of serious challenges, including 
harassment and persecution of persons suspected of &#8220;witchcraft&#8221;, and harmful practices 
such as female genital mutilation that are inflicted in the name of &#8220;tradition&#8221;, &#8220;custom&#8221;, 
&#8220;culture&#8221; and sometimes &#8220;religion&#8221;. He emphasizes the fact that such harmful practices can 
never be justified by invoking freedom of religion or belief, and he calls upon religious 
leaders to speak out publicly against these practices. 
</p>
<p> In his conclusions, the Special Rapporteur draws on the recommendations made by 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Sierra Leone, many of which still need to be 
fully implemented. He also recommends that States, religious leaders and the international 
community pay more attention to Sierra Leone and its culture of inter- and intra-religious 
open-heartedness.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 30 June to 5 July 2013, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
undertook a country visit to Sierra Leone. The general purpose of such country visits is to 
receive first-hand information concerning the situation of freedom of religion or belief in a 
particular country and to identify good practices as well as existing or emerging challenges 
to the enjoyment of this specific human right.  
</p><p>2. Above all, the Special Rapporteur would like to thank all those who contributed to 
making the visit possible and very fruitful. He expresses his profound gratitude to the 
Government of Sierra Leone for the cordial invitation transmitted through its Permanent 
Mission in Geneva. He is indebted to many interlocutors from all branches of the State, 
diverse religious communities as well as various civil society organizations. The State 
representatives with whom the Special Rapporteur communicated included the Vice-
President, the Minister of Social Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs, the Minister of 
Education, Science and Technology, the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the 
Minister of Information and Communications, the Minister of Tourism and Cultural 
Affairs, the Minister of Political and Public Affairs, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the 
Deputy Minister of Justice, other representatives of the Administration, Members of 
Parliament, the Chair of the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, the Chief Justice and 
other high-ranking members of the judiciary, the Chair of the Human Rights Commission, 
the Chair of the Law Reform Commission, the Ombudsman and his team, Paramount 
Chiefs and members of the Administration in the Moyamba district. The Special 
Rapporteur also met with representatives of various religious communities. He participated 
in meetings of the Council of Churches, the United Council of Imams and the Inter-
Religious Council of Sierra Leone. He had an opportunity to attend a gathering of the 
Union of Traditional Healers. Furthermore, throughout the visit he had substantive 
exchanges with different civil society organizations, both faith-based and secular, that 
specialize in human rights issues in the country. When visiting elementary schools, he 
talked to teachers and students, and during and after the press conference he communicated 
with journalists working for different national and local media.  
3. The Special Rapporteur benefited enormously from the many discussions in 
Freetown and Moyamba, all of which took place in an open atmosphere. The visit would 
not have been possible without the valuable support of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva and of the United Nations 
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL).  
</p>
<p><b> II. The legal situation concerning freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International and regional provisions  
</b></p>
<p>4. The Republic of Sierra Leone has ratified, or acceded to, the majority of existing 
international human rights instruments. This includes the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights which, in article 18, protects everyone&#8217;s right to freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion or belief. While articles 2 and 26 of the Covenant provide protection 
against discrimination on several grounds including religion or belief, article 27 provides 
that persons belonging to minorities, including religious minorities, &#8220;shall not be denied the 
right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to 
profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language&#8221;. Provisions protecting 
freedom of religion or belief can also be found in other international instruments that are </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>binding on Sierra Leone, for instance, in article 14 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child.  
</p>
<p>5. Furthermore, Sierra Leone is a State party to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights, which protects freedom of religion in its article 8.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional provisions  
</b></p>
<p>6. The 1991 Constitution of Sierra Leone has a number of human rights provisions that 
include freedom of religion or belief. Section 24, subsection 1, of the Constitution states 
that: &#8220;Except with his own consent, no person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of his 
freedom of conscience and for the purpose of this section the said freedom includes 
freedom of thought and of religion, freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom 
either alone or in community with others and both in public and in private to manifest and 
propagate his religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice and observance.&#8221; While this 
formulation bears an obvious resemblance to the wording used in article 18 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the subsequent subsections of 
section 24 add more details.  
</p>
<p>7. Section 24, subsection 2, relates to educational institutions and protects students 
from possible pressure to attend religious instruction or ceremonies against their will or that 
of their parents: &#8220;Except with his own consent (or if he is a minor the consent of his parent 
or guardian) no person attending any place of education shall be required to receive 
religious instruction or to take part in or to attend any religious ceremony or observance if 
that instruction, ceremony or observance relates to a religion other than his own.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>8. The community aspect of manifesting a religious conviction in teaching, as already 
guaranteed in subsection 1, is spelled out in more detail in subsection 3 of section 24: &#8220;No 
religious community or denomination shall be prevented from providing religious 
instruction for persons of that community or denomination in the course of any education 
provided by that community or denomination.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>9. Subsection 4 of section 24 specifies an important aspect of the &#8220;negative&#8221; freedom 
of religion or belief by declaring: &#8220;No person shall be compelled to take any oath which is 
contrary to his religion or belief or to take any oath in a manner which is contrary to his 
religion or belief.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>10. Subsection 5 of section 24 deals with possible limitations on freedom of religion or 
belief which must meet certain criteria to be legitimate, thus serving a function similar to 
the provision contained in article 18, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. The constitutional provision reads as follows: &#8220;Nothing contained in 
or done under the authority of any law shall be held to be inconsistent with or in 
contravention of this section to the extent that the law in question makes a provision which 
is reasonably required (a) in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public 
morality or public health; or (b) for the purpose of protecting the rights and freedoms of 
other persons including the right to observe and practice any religion without the 
unsolicited intervention of the members of any other religion; and except in so far as that 
provision or, as the case may be, the thing done under the authority thereof, is shown not to 
be reasonably justifiable in a democratic society.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b> C. Other legal provisions 
</b></p>
<p>11. The law books of Sierra Leone also include provisions aimed at ensuring religious 
pluralism in the composition of important public institutions. For instance, the Child Rights </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>Act of 2007 requires that that the members of village welfare committees come from 
different religions (section 47.2 (g)), thus preventing religious monopolies. 
</p>
<p><b> III. General findings  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. An atmosphere of religious open-heartedness 
</b></p>
<p>12. Before visiting Sierra Leone, the Special Rapporteur had anticipated that the country 
would be characterized by a high degree of religious tolerance. What he experienced during 
his visit by far exceeded this expectation. All interlocutors, without exception, agreed that 
religious communities, in particular Muslims and Christians, live peacefully and 
harmoniously side by side. It was frequently contended that this harmony has existed &#8220;since 
time immemorial&#8221;, thus predating the establishment of a modern legal infrastructure. 
Moreover, most of the discussants he met presented their own family situation as an 
illustration of amicable religious diversity. Many of them are in interreligious marriages, in 
which the husband is Muslim and the wife is Christian, or vice versa, and everyone seems 
to have close relatives who confess and practise a religion different than their own.  
</p>
<p>13. Interlocutors also referred to their school days, when they had experienced religious 
diversity on a daily basis and mostly in a quite relaxed manner. Muslims recounted fond 
memories of their education in Anglican, Methodist, Catholic or other Christian schools, 
and Christians likewise provided positive accounts of their education and training in 
schools run by Sunnis or Ahmadis. When visiting elementary schools managed by different 
denominations, the Special Rapporteur had a chance to talk to teachers and students who 
come from different religious backgrounds, but work and learn together in a spirit of mutual 
respect.  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur visited mosques and churches located in close proximity to 
each other, some of them within the same compounds, and heard numerous stories about 
people attending weddings, funerals and other ceremonies across denominational 
differences. A Christian person remarked that when the church is overcrowded, he might 
well decide to go to a mosque to pray. Such a statement, which in many countries would be 
fairly unusual or even unthinkable, seems rather indicative of the tolerant situation in Sierra 
Leone. Likewise, Muslims said that they have no difficulty praying in a Christian church. 
People generally expressed an interest in religious festivities across denominational lines. 
While many Christians reportedly join Muslims in celebrating the end of Ramadan, 
Muslims join Christians, for instance, in Christmas celebrations without blurring the 
differences between religions. The Special Rapporteur was told that radio stations run by a 
particular religious community at times broadcast prayers from a different religion. For 
instance, &#8220;Radio Maria&#8221; which, as its name suggests, is run by a Christian community, 
reportedly airs Koranic suras on Fridays.  
</p>
<p>15. While Muslims and Christians jointly constitute the large majority of the population, 
the country also includes small numbers of Baha&#8217;is, Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists, Mormons, 
Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses and other minority communities. The Special Rapporteur saw their 
houses of worship, which are quite visible both in the capital and in the countryside.  
</p>
<p>16. Religious diversity is not only a reality in Sierra Leone; it is widely regarded and 
cherished as an asset on which to build community life from the local to the national levels. 
As one interlocutor put it, &#8220;religious tolerance is the cornerstone of our peace&#8221;. Indeed, the 
tangible climate of religious tolerance in Sierra Leone is all the more astounding against the 
background of the country&#8217;s tragic history of civil war, which tore the nation apart. 
According to the 2004 final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the 
various parties involved in the conflict committed grave human rights violations, including </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>atrocities beyond human imagination. While ethnic, regional and other differences &#8212; 
whether real or merely imagined &#8212; became factors of political fragmentation and violent 
escalation, religion was never drawn into the conflict. This remarkable observation of the 
TRC was unanimously confirmed in all discussions the Special Rapporteur held on this 
issue. The amicable relations between religious communities thus play a crucial role in the 
ongoing process of rebuilding the nation.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Inter- and intra-religious tolerance  
</b></p>
<p>17. Religious tolerance comprises both inter-religious and intra-religious relations. 
While most interlocutors emphasized the amicable coexistence of the Muslim majority 
(according to some estimates, 60 to 70 per cent of the population) and the Christian 
minority (estimated at 20 to 30 percent of the population), there is also a remarkably 
positive and relaxed attitude towards intra-religious diversity.  
</p>
<p>18. The Muslim population is composed of Sunnis, who constitute a clear majority, 
Shias and Ahmadis. Manifestations of mutual hostility between these different branches of 
Islam are unheard of in Sierra Leone. The Special Rapporteur visited the United Council of 
Imams, in which representatives of the various branches of Islam &#8212; Sunnis, Shias and 
Ahmadis &#8212; meet and cooperate on a regular basis. When attending a gathering of the Inter-
Religious Council, he witnessed the spirit of cooperation between and within religions. On 
that occasion, the representative of the Ahmadiyyah community said a short prayer to 
which his neighbour, a high-ranking Sunni, added the concluding &#8220;amen&#8221;. The current 
Chief Justice of Sierra Leone, who comes from the Sunni branch of Islam, introduced the 
Special Rapporteur to another member of her court who stemmed from the Ahmadiyya 
community. Such amicable cooperation also seems to be a widespread reality on the 
ground, for instance, in schools. The Special Rapporteur visited an elementary school in 
Freetown run by Ahmadis, which is open to students from other Islamic branches as well as 
Christian students. Schools organized by the Ahmadiyyah community have existed in 
Sierra Leone since the early twentieth century and generally seem to enjoy a good 
reputation.  
</p>
<p>19. Christianity displays an even broader diversity in Sierra Leone, including Anglicans, 
Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Reformed Protestants, Methodists, New Apostolic Church, 
Seventh Day Adventists, Baptists and charismatic groups. The Special Rapporteur attended 
a meeting of the Council of Churches in Freetown. The Council brings together some 15 
denominations, most of which see themselves in Protestant traditions. They closely 
cooperate with the Roman Catholic Church, which has not formally joined the Council of 
Churches. While the relations between different Christian denominations are generally 
harmonious, the Special Rapporteur also heard some sceptical comments on allegedly less 
tolerant attitudes displayed by some of the &#8220;charismatic&#8221; Christian denominations, which 
seem to be gaining more influence in Sierra Leone of late.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Social acceptance of conversions  
</b></p>
<p>20. Section 24, subsection 1, of the Constitution explicitly guarantees the right to change 
one&#8217;s religion or belief. In Sierra Leone, this is not an empty promise. People can and do 
freely change their religious affiliation. Conversions are a common phenomenon. Indeed, 
the Special Rapporteur was amazed by the high number of converts he met during his visit. 
He heard stories of people who had grown up in a Muslim family and later converted to 
Christianity, often with the unreserved blessing of their parents. He spoke to one Christian 
convert whose father, while remaining a Sunni Muslim, had actively participated in his 
son&#8217;s Christian baptism. The Special Rapporteur met a woman from a Muslim family who </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>became a Reverend in the Methodist church. Likewise, others told him they were from 
Christian families and had later turned to Islam, again typically with the full approval of 
their families. Some converts keep their original first names, with the result that a person 
who has a typically Muslim first name may nonetheless be Christian or vice versa. For 
instance, one man who had been called Muhammad at birth adopted the name Francis after 
converting to Catholicism, but also kept his original name, thus calling himself Francis 
Muhammad. 
</p>
<p>21. Whereas in many countries, conversion de facto implies breaking away from one&#8217;s 
family background, the situation in Sierra Leone is markedly different in that conversion is 
not merely a formally guaranteed right, but also a widely accepted practice, mostly 
endorsed by families, communities and religious leaders of different denominations. This 
makes religious pluralism in Sierra Leone a dynamic pluralism in the sense that religious 
communities can grow and develop. Moreover, people do not generally encounter problems 
when bearing witness to their faith in private or in public and they can also freely invite 
others to join their community.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Attitudes towards traditional African religion 
</b></p>
<p>22. Traditional African religion constitutes a part of the country&#8217;s rich cultural heritage 
and is largely appreciated as such. While some healing rituals and other traditional 
ceremonies continue to be practised widely, frequently under the auspices of Islam or 
Christianity, the Special Rapporteur also noticed more ambivalent or sceptical attitudes 
expressed by some discussants towards traditional African religion.  
</p>
<p>23. In a gathering that took place in the district of Moyamba, one of the speakers who 
came from a traditional background conjectured that 85 per cent of Muslims and Christians 
also feel attached to African spirituality. He furthermore contended that traditional African 
spirituality constitutes the common denominator between different religious denominations 
and thus contributes to the amicable relations between Muslims and Christians in Sierra 
Leone. Similar views were also expressed at a meeting of the Union of Traditional Healers 
in Freetown that the Special Rapporteur attended. The chairperson of the Union of 
Traditional Healers saw the spiritual unity of humankind evidenced in the common colour 
of human blood. While people may display different colours on the surface of their skin, 
deep down, he said, &#8220;we all share the same colour and hence the same spirit&#8221;. Such 
positions seem to be widely shared in Sierra Leone.  
</p>
<p>24. Many Muslims and Christians in turn respect traditional African religion based on 
the assumption or ascription that it represents just another form of monotheistic spirituality. 
As one interlocutor expressed it, &#8220;when worshiping a mountain or a big tree, people 
ultimately worship the one supreme power which we call God&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur 
heard repeated opinions and assessments to this effect. At the same time, he also came 
across more reluctant attitudes towards traditional African religion, which some speakers 
mainly associated with superstitious practices and a widespread belief in witchcraft. On a 
number of occasions, people even questioned whether traditional African spirituality, while 
certainly representing cultural &#8220;practice&#8221;, could actually be called a genuine &#8220;religion&#8221; or 
&#8220;belief&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>25. Whereas information about Islam and Christianity forms part of the curriculum in 
elementary schools, traditional African religion is not generally taught in schools. The 
Special Rapporteur heard that elements of traditional spirituality might nonetheless become 
the subject of teaching, for instance, through the learning of traditional languages. 
Organizations representing traditional African religions or beliefs are not members of the 
Inter-Religious Council.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Isolating the few radical voices  
</b></p>
<p>26. Religious communities in Sierra Leone have largely managed to prevent radical 
voices from gaining influence in society; during the civil war they even succeeded in 
keeping religion out of the hostilities. However, some interlocutors mentioned the case of a 
Christian woman who claimed to have had a dream in which she had seen Muammar 
Gaddafi suffering in hell. From this alleged vision, the woman inferred that a particular 
mosque in Sierra Leone, which had been sponsored by Gaddafi, should be destroyed and 
replaced with a church. This strange incident, which attracted some publicity in the country, 
was generally recounted as a success story because the Christian churches in Sierra Leone 
had reacted rapidly in rejecting the woman&#8217;s antagonistic message, thereby defending their 
good relations with Muslims and the country&#8217;s religious harmony. The United Council of 
Imams explicitly praised the Christian churches for their quick and clear response.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur also heard about a few incidents in which tensions between 
local Christian and Muslim communities had arisen over practical issues, such as property 
conflicts or loud church bells or prayer calls. Reportedly, the issues were all settled and the 
tensions did not spill over into the larger communities. During the meeting of the Inter-
Religious Council, one participant said: &#8220;Our religious tolerance is not without challenges, 
but we share the willingness to overcome them.&#8221; At the same time, some discussants 
expressed concerns that religious extremism, which unfortunately exists in some 
neighbouring countries, might in the long run become more influential in Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p><b> F. The role of different institutions  
</b></p>
<p>28. The high degree of religious tolerance which Sierra Leoneans enjoy should not be 
taken for granted. In the face of religious mistrust, hostility and hatred in many parts of the 
world, it is obvious that the atmosphere of cross-religious and cross-denominational open-
heartedness in Sierra Leone requires broad commitment and active investments. It is a 
precious accomplishment that deserves to be cherished and further developed. Obviously, 
societal and State institutions play an indispensable role in this ongoing endeavour.  
</p>
<p>29. The first institution in life that facilitates the experience of religious diversity is the 
family. Interreligious marriages do not only occur in urban areas, but are a widespread 
phenomenon across the country, albeit with regional differences. By experiencing religious 
diversity as a perfectly natural feature of families and neighbourhoods, children can 
develop an attitude of interreligious openness from early on. They typically grow up in an 
atmosphere in which people have different religious names, perform different prayers and 
celebrate different holidays while living together closely in families and neighbourhoods. 
As one minister remarked, religious tolerance is a &#8220;deep-seated practice in Sierra Leone&#8221;, 
starting with the family. Another person said: &#8220;Religious tolerance starts when we are born. 
Whether Muslims or Christians, we are always together, we study, work and live together.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>30. Unsurprisingly, many interlocutors emphasized the significant role of school 
education. In the earlier history of the country, schools run by Christian missionaries had a 
strong impact on the development of the society. By admitting Muslim students, religious 
diversity became a general feature of school life. Later on, the increasing number of 
Muslim schools run by Ahmadis, Sunnis or Shias likewise included Christian children 
among their students. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to see 
several schools in which both students and teachers came from different religious 
backgrounds. Irrespective of their various religious orientations, schools nowadays 
generally follow the curriculum provided by the Ministry of Education. The curriculum for 
elementary schools also covers Religious and Moral Education (RME), a subject that is 
based on the tenets of Islamic and Christian teachings taken in conjunction.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>31. According to information received, the media also contribute to the tangible 
atmosphere of religious tolerance. Given the persistently high illiteracy rate, radio networks 
are particularly important. The Special Rapporteur was told that community-based radio 
stations sometimes broadcast religious prayers and ceremonies across denominational lines. 
One example is &#8220;Radio Maria&#8221; which, while mainly catering for a Christian audience, also 
airs Islamic prayers. Reportedly, the Independent Media Commission also plays a positive 
role in promoting ethical journalism. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 
the members of the Commission are all appointed by the President of the Republic, which 
raises questions about the independence of the Commission.  
</p>
<p>32. The Inter-Religious Council has a very good reputation in Sierra Leone. Operating 
as a non-governmental organization and comprising different religious communities &#8212; 
Muslim, Christian and others &#8212; the Council has played a pivotal role in the reconciliation 
process after the civil war. It has therefore implemented one of the main recommendations 
of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which in its final report of 2004 called upon 
religious communities to use their potential in a joint effort to rebuild national consensus, 
including by helping to reintegrate ex-combatants and child soldiers. Interlocutors 
repeatedly mentioned the active contribution of the Inter-Religious Council in the peaceful 
handling of the Presidential elections in 2012, during which religious community leaders 
made joint statements, speaking out against violence. The Special Rapporteur had a chance 
to speak to members of the Inter-Religious Council not only in Freetown but also in 
Moyamba. The fact that the Council has branches in all districts obviously adds to its 
impact throughout the country. Nonetheless, members of the Inter-Religious Council 
complained about insufficient resources and a lack of infrastructure &#8212; a situation that may 
hamper its effective functioning. They also expressed the awareness that the harmonious 
interreligious climate could be threatened in the long run, once radical voices, which have 
not have much influence to date, become more influential. 
</p>
<p>33. Within the State apparatus, the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s 
Affairs is charged with handling religious affairs and pursues a proactive policy on 
community outreach. The Ministry is also responsible for the registration of religious 
communities, which must be renewed annually. The Special Rapporteur learned that the 
process is relatively easy. Failure to register does not lead to any sanctions, and 
unregistered religious communities can function fully and freely. Unlike registered 
communities, however, they do not benefit from tax advantages, for instance when 
importing certain goods, such as religious books, videos or other material. The Union of 
Traditional Healers expressed interest in strengthening communication with the Ministry of 
Social Welfare in order to address controversial issues, such as the proliferation of 
traditional medicine. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Vitality of public religious life  
</b></p>
<p>34. Clearly, religion is a vital factor in private and public life in Sierra Leone. Numerous 
mosques and churches of different denominations have their doors open and advertise their 
services publicly, both visibly and audibly. Religious ceremonies play a crucial role in 
families and communities. Religious symbols are omnipresent in the streets, in 
administrative offices and in private homes. Many vehicles, particularly trucks and 
caravans, have religious messages (&#8220;God is great&#8221;, &#8220;God&#8217;s mercy for everyone&#8221;, &#8220;Praise to 
the Lord&#8221;) displayed on their hoods. People generally express a strong interest in and 
commitment to religious issues. By attending some religious services and ceremonies of 
different denominations, the Special Rapporteur could directly experience the vitality of 
religious practices and the enthusiasm that people showed when manifesting their faith.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>35. For many Sierra Leoneans, religious commitment and religious tolerance go hand in 
hand. As a high-ranking Muslim representative put it during a meeting of the United 
Council of Imams, &#8220;religious tolerance is a divine gift bestowed on our nation&#8221;. Christian 
representatives also expressed similar sentiments. Such expressions may serve as an 
interesting testimony against the widespread assumption that religious tolerance develops 
best in a religiously dispassionate atmosphere, perhaps even in a climate of general 
religious scepticism. Concomitantly, it is sometimes assumed that strong religious 
enthusiasm necessarily breeds narrow-mindedness and often leads to fanaticism. The 
situation in Sierra Leone, however, demonstrates that there is no inherent contradiction 
between passionate religious commitment and religious open-mindedness, which in this 
country are generally appreciated as two sides of one and the same coin.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Remaining challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Positive and negative freedom of religion or belief  
</b></p>
<p>36. The open atmosphere in Sierra Leone generally provides fertile ground for the 
enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief as guaranteed, inter alia, in section 24 of the 
Constitution and article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which Sierra Leone is a party. Neither the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone nor 
the Ombudsman and his staff remembered any complaints being submitted within recent 
years about violations of freedom of religion or belief. Occasional conflicts between local 
communities, for instance over property issues, remained isolated incidents and never 
spilled over into the broader religious communities. Members of various non-governmental 
organizations who work on human rights issues in Sierra Leone confirmed this positive 
assessment from their own viewpoints.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur was frequently told that what unites people in Sierra Leone 
is the belief in one Supreme Being to which everyone owes their existence and bears moral 
accountability. Religious differences, while obviously remaining relevant for people&#8217;s self-
understanding and practices, appear to be placed on a secondary level when compared with 
the broadly shared general monotheistic conviction. Traditional African spirituality also 
seems to be appreciated on the premise that it generally fits into this pattern of worshiping 
one divine power. While facilitating positive interaction between different religious 
communities, the assumption that everyone ultimately shares the belief in one God also 
introduces the risk that people could be urged to participate in religious ceremonies against 
their will. In other words, while the &#8220;positive&#8221; freedom of religion or belief can and does 
flourish in Sierra Leone, this may be less the case with regard to its &#8220;negative&#8221; corollary, 
that is, the freedom not to believe, not to pray, not to participate in religious ceremonies and 
so forth. However, the positive and the negative aspects of freedom of religion or belief 
closely belong together as complementary manifestations of everyone&#8217;s right to freedom in 
the broad area of religion and belief.  
</p>
<p>38. One example is the collective performance of prayers and other religious ceremonies 
in schools. Based on the widely shared expectation that all students will finally benefit from 
participating in such practices, the possibility of receiving a low-threshold exemption is not 
generally provided. A representative of a Christian church explained that in schools run by 
her denomination, all students are expected to attend Christian prayers and devotions, 
regardless of their diverse religious backgrounds. While not all schools hold public 
devotions during the school hours, the practice seems to be widespread. From the 
perspective of freedom of religion or belief, it is important to ensure that such collective 
manifestations remain voluntary, particularly in schools where children are exposed to the 
authority of their teachers and possibly also to pressure from their peers. Those not wishing </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>to participate in religious ceremonies should have the option to receive a low-threshold 
exemption.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur did not hear of any complaints ever being submitted in this 
regard, and when discussing the issue, he was told that it would certainly be possible to find 
solutions if such requests were made. Nevertheless, clearly formulated exit provisions 
concerning school prayers remain an important issue in order to make sure that 
participation in religious prayers and ceremonies is always in conformity with the 
convictions of the child and his or her parents or guardians. This would also help to bring 
the existing practice into line with section 24, subsection 2, of the Constitution of Sierra 
Leone, which provides that &#8220;no person attending any place of education shall be required to 
receive religious instruction or to take part in or to attend any religious ceremony or 
observance if that instruction, ceremony or observance relates to a religion other than his 
own&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Harmful traditional practices  
</b></p>
<p>40. Many Sierra Leoneans, including Muslims and Christians, seem to believe in 
witchcraft. The Special Rapporteur heard many gruesome stories about people allegedly 
using &#8220;witch guns&#8221; in order to inflict serious injury and even kill fellow humans. He met 
with individuals who claimed they could detect &#8220;witches&#8221; and other &#8220;evil persons&#8221; by using 
their own spiritual intuition or by employing magical instruments. Some told him they had 
handed over &#8220;witches&#8221; to local courts, which had subsequently locked them up. In a 
number of cases, persons accused of witchcraft have been chained indefinitely to a specific 
place in their villages. The Special Rapporteur also heard about incidents of lynching of 
alleged &#8220;witches&#8221;. While the &#8220;punishment&#8221; of people accused of witchcraft appears to be 
mainly practised by local communities outside of the formal judicial system, the formal 
criminal code still contains provisions against the exercise of magical powers.  
</p>
<p>41. The fact that people are deprived of their personal liberty based on accusations of 
witchcraft raises major human rights issues. This assessment was clearly shared by the 
Human Rights Commission, the Law Reform Commission and other institutions dealing 
with judicial affairs. The empirical &#8220;evidence&#8221; presented against &#8220;witches&#8221; remains more 
than dubious, and the &#8220;culprits&#8221; de facto do not enjoy the minimum guarantees of due 
process and habeas corpus, in spite of the existing constitutional provisions. A member of 
the Government pointed out that most people who are accused of witchcraft stem from the 
poorest strata of society. In many cases, they are helpless and lack any support from 
families or neighbours, which renders them vulnerable to negative projections. For 
example, elderly women who have remained childless easily become victims of witchcraft 
allegations, and the same can happen to persons with intellectual or psychosocial 
disabilities or persons who are described as somehow &#8220;strange&#8221; in their behaviour.  
</p>
<p>42. Whether the widespread &#8220;belief&#8221; in witches could qualify as belonging to a religion 
or belief in the understanding of article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights remains a somewhat academic question. In any case, the serious harm 
inflicted on persons accused of witchcraft can never be justified. Naturally, a human right 
can never serve as carte blanche for legitimizing obvious violations of other human rights. 
Consequently, if someone were to invoke the right to freedom of religion or belief in order 
to support harmful practices, such as the persecution and punishment of alleged witches, 
this would be a clear case for limiting the application of freedom of religion or belief, in 
accordance with the criteria laid down in article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant. 
Section 24, subsection 5, of the Constitution of Sierra Leone has a similar limitation clause 
which would have to be applied in such a case.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>43. Some harmful traditional practices particularly affect women and girls. Teenage 
pregnancies and early marriages are major problems, as they de facto deprive girls and 
young women of their right to education. The Government has taken initiatives in this 
regard, and high-ranking politicians repeatedly emphasized the fact that they would prefer 
to see girls carrying schoolbooks rather than babies. Another widespread practice is female 
genital mutilation (FGM), which is typically inflicted on girls as an initiation ritual once 
they reach puberty. One woman who had herself suffered from FGM broke down in tears 
when recounting that her two nieces, whom she wanted to save from this traumatic 
experience, recently underwent FGM. Whether such harmful practices have any religious 
rationale remains more than dubious. Be that as it may, freedom of religion or belief can 
never be legitimately invoked to justify the infliction of grave and often traumatic 
violations of a person&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity.  
</p>
<p>44. Non-governmental organizations working in this field in Sierra Leone gave an 
account of the enormous difficulties they face when trying to overcome traditional harmful 
practices such as FGM. Not only are such practices deeply rooted in people&#8217;s traditional 
life, they are also defended by the women who make a living by performing the rituals. 
This calls for a complex strategy. Members of various non-governmental organizations 
with whom the Special Rapporteur discussed this issue all agreed that religious 
communities should play an active role in putting a stop to the practice. Some cooperation 
already exists and is based on the understanding that human rights standards and religious 
values overlap in many important areas. While the Special Rapporteur heard a number of 
success stories, NGO representatives also pointed to difficult areas, particularly in the 
context of violence against women. For instance, whereas religious communities broadly 
support policies to overcome child marriages, not all of them have been willing to speak out 
openly against FGM, maybe for fear that this might alienate some of their followers. At the 
same time, there seems to be general agreement that education, including educational 
programmes specifically catering for women and girls, is the key factor in all attempts to 
overcome existing gender-related discrimination and harmful practices.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Fragility of public institutions 
</b></p>
<p>45. In its final report of 2004, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) gives a 
detailed and precise account of the root causes of the violent conflict that had torn the 
country apart for more than a decade between 1991 and 2002. When reading the report, the 
Special Rapporteur was very impressed by the degree of precision and honesty 
accomplished so shortly after the end of the hostilities.  
</p>
<p>46. Among the main root causes of the conflict the TRC report identifies is the absence 
of an appropriate and effective State infrastructure. According to the findings, the general 
fragility of State institutions in conjunction with bad governance and endemic corruption 
had led to a gradual breakdown of trust in the fair functioning of State institutions in 
general. This started the vicious cycle of fragmentation, lawlessness and paranoia that 
culminated in atrocities beyond human imagination that were perpetrated, albeit to different 
degrees, by all parties in the civil war.  
</p>
<p>47. In the decade following the war, Sierra Leone has seen important political, economic 
and educational progress. Democratic elections have been peaceful, the economy is 
growing and the illiteracy rate has dropped significantly. Nevertheless, some interlocutors 
expressed concerns about the ongoing fragility of State institutions, which need further 
strengthening in order to prevent the risks of renewed fragmentation and to ensure the 
thorough implementation of human rights. Given the scarcity of financial resources, this 
will not be an easy task. At the same time, it is clear that without trust in the effectiveness 
and fairness of public institutions, the current tranquillity remains precarious.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>48. In discussions with the Chief Justice, the Human Rights Commission and the Law 
Reform Commission, the Special Rapporteur heard about the complicated process of 
implementing the 2011 Local Courts Act, which aims at streamlining the country&#8217;s 
fragmented court system. While in theory all courts now operate under the authority of the 
High Court and the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone, the bifurcation of courts functioning 
under formal statutes and customary laws, respectively, still persists in practice. This leads 
to enormous problems in the safeguarding of habeas corpus rights and human rights in 
general.  
</p>
<p>49. Moreover, some TRC recommendations concerning the disadvantaged position of 
women and girls still need to be fully implemented. Again, this has to do with the weakness 
of existing implementation mechanisms. Although the Government has taken initiatives to 
prevent child pregnancy and early marriage, the illiteracy rate for women and girls 
continues to be considerably higher than that of men and boys. Many women continue to 
marry at a very young age, thereby losing educational opportunities.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Rebuilding the nation 
</b></p>
<p>50. The huge political challenges that Sierra Leoneans face are obvious. Despite 
impressive economic growth, the country remains one of the economically poorest in the 
world and still has a high illiteracy rate. This hampers the development of an efficient State 
infrastructure, which in turn would be a precondition for investing trust in public 
institutions and overcoming the danger of renewed fragmentation along regional or ethnic 
lines. In the ongoing process of rebuilding the nation, religious communities play a crucial 
role.  
</p>
<p>51. The TRC report already points to the surprising fact that religious communities 
succeeded in keeping out of the vicious dynamic of the civil war. Whereas in many other 
countries, religious difference has become an aggravating factor of fragmentation and 
conflict escalation, in Sierra Leone religion has helped to unite &#8212; or rather reunite &#8212; the 
nation. As explained above, religious diversity and unity are widely perceived as 
constituting two sides of the same coin. The TRC final report thus recommends that 
religious communities take a lead in reintegrating ex-combatants, including child soldiers. 
While Christian and Islamic communities have used education and religious and moral 
edification to serve this purpose, representatives of traditional African religion have also 
resorted to cleansing rituals, such as the burning of old clothes, to mark symbolically a 
person&#8217;s new beginning.  
</p>
<p>52. The TRC repeatedly points to the significant contribution of the Inter-Religious 
Council, including its regional branches in all districts of the country. While the Inter-
Religious Council had already existed before the civil war, its authoritative role became 
more pronounced during the process of reconciliation after 2002. The leading figures of the 
Council see themselves as &#8220;moral guardians&#8221; of society, tasked with keeping the country 
together. While generally showing optimism concerning the peaceful future of the country, 
they also expressed an awareness that the amicable relations between religious communities 
need further cherishing, not least in the face of growing religious extremism in 
neighbouring countries and the general weakness of public institutions.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>53. <b>In various gatherings which the Special Rapporteur attended in Freetown and 
Moyamba, participants from government institutions, religious communities and civil 
society organizations over and over again expressed their conviction that Sierra Leone </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b>is a &#8220;blessed nation&#8221;, as evidenced in the remarkable atmosphere of inter- and intra-
religious tolerance that characterizes the country. Given the recent tragic history of 
civil war with massive and grave human rights violations, this collective self-
understanding may come as a surprise. However, the Special Rapporteur found the 
enthusiasm that people displayed on this issue quite infectious. Having been able to 
witness how religious passion and interreligious open-heartedness can go hand in 
hand in Sierra Leone is a privilege for which he is grateful. Moreover, the way people 
live together in peace across religious differences sets an example from which other 
countries as well as religious and political leaders worldwide can learn.  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>No less remarkable than interreligious tolerance, as epitomized inter alia by the 
Inter-Religious Council of Sierra Leone, is the daily practice of intra-religious 
cooperation between different denominations. This includes the amicable relations 
between Sunnis and Ahmadis and their cooperation within the United Council of 
Imams, in which Shias also participate. Likewise, various Christian denominations 
have organized their cooperation within the Council of Churches.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Furthermore, religious diversity remains dynamic in the sense that 
communities can grow and develop. Individuals and communities do not encounter 
difficulties when bearing public witness to their faith and trying to attract new 
followers. Freedom to change one&#8217;s religion is not only a constitutionally and 
internationally guaranteed right, but also a socially accepted reality in Sierra Leone. 
Indeed, conversion in all directions &#8212; in particular from Islam to Christianity and 
vice versa &#8212; is a widespread phenomenon and typically receives the approval of 
families and communities.  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Frequent interreligious marriages and the resulting religiously diverse families 
facilitate an atmosphere of religious open-heartedness not only in urban areas but 
throughout the country, albeit with regional differences. The educational system in 
which students and teachers across denominations learn and work together further 
strengthens this generally amicable atmosphere. Radio networks, although run by 
specific denominations, sometimes air prayers of a different religion than their own. 
Finally, umbrella institutions, such as the Inter-Religious Council have played a key 
role in uniting &#8212; or rather reuniting &#8212; the country.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Although clearly deeply rooted in the everyday culture of Sierra Leone, the 
climate of religious open-heartedness should not be taken for granted. As emphasized 
by many interlocutors from diverse backgrounds, the high degree of inter- and intra-
religious tolerance needs constant cherishing and should be further developed based 
on constitutional and international guarantees of freedom of religion or belief. 
Therefore, the Special Rapporteur would like to present a number of 
recommendations addressed to different stakeholders. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Recommendations mainly addressed to the State: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) In all efforts to further develop the country, State agencies should be 
guided by the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) 
of Sierra Leone, published in its final report of 2004. The TRC recommendations 
reflect an intensive consultation process with broad participation of all parts of the 
population. They show an admirable degree of precision and honesty and furthermore 
display a clear human rights basis. The Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone 
has a particular mandate to implement the recommendations, a task which, despite 
progress in many areas, remains unfinished to date. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The State should continue to play an active role in cherishing and 
promoting the culture of inter- and intra-religious tolerance. Any existing and future 
activities to this effect should be systematically based on freedom of religion or belief, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b>as enshrined in section 24 of the Constitution and in the international instruments to 
which Sierra Leone is a party. In this context, more attention should also be given to 
the &#8220;negative&#8221; aspect of freedom of religion or belief. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) One example in this regard is the need to provide for low-threshold 
exemptions from participation in collective religious ceremonies in schools. Collective 
religious practices in schools should always be voluntary. To ensure everyone&#8217;s 
freedom to participate or not to participate, in accordance with their convictions, 
exemptions should be easily available and should not have a de facto punitive effect. 
Paying more attention to this issue would bring the existing practice more into line 
with the provision of section 24, subsection 2, of the Constitution of Sierra Leone. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Harmful traditional practices can never be justified by invoking freedom 
of religion or belief, which as a human right must always be seen in conjunction with 
other human rights. Concerning female genital mutilation (FGM), the Special 
Rapporteur refers to the TRC recommendations which call for joint efforts to put a 
stop this cruel practice. He also refers to his 2013 interim report to the General 
Assembly in which he systematically analyses the relationship between freedom of 
religion or belief and equality between men and women (A/68/290). 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Likewise, the harassment or even persecution of persons accused of 
witchcraft can never be justified as a legitimate manifestation of anyone&#8217;s freedom of 
religion or belief. Streamlining the traditionally fragmented court system by 
implementing the Local Courts Act of 2011 is one precondition to stopping human 
rights violations being inflicted on persons suspected of practising witchcraft. Equally 
important are ongoing investments in education. In order to enhance credibility, the 
State should also repeal the existing criminal law provision against magical practices 
(<i>fungay</i>). 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Measures taken against traditional harmful practices, including public 
criticism of gender-related violence or witch-hunting, should always be combined with 
respect for persons who adhere to traditional African spirituality. Freedom of religion 
or belief, while allowing for legally defined limitations if needed to protect the rights 
and freedoms of others (in accordance with the criteria in article 18, paragraph 3, of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) must be broadly understood. 
It clearly includes traditional African religion and its various manifestations.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The Government should continue to support the admirable work of the 
Inter-Religious Council while fully respecting its independence. </b> 
</p>
<p>59. <b>Recommendations mainly addressed to religious communities: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Religious communities are encouraged to continue to cooperate in the 
spirit of open-heartedness which is so tangible in Sierra Leone. Through inter- and 
intra-religious cooperation they also fulfil a major requirement of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Religious communities and their umbrella organizations should speak 
out publicly against harmful practices, which are sometimes broadly associated with 
&#8220;tradition&#8221;, &#8220;culture&#8221; or &#8220;religion&#8221;. A clear public stance articulated by religious 
communities against gender-related violence, particularly FGM, would contribute to 
overcoming such cruel practices. In this context, the Special Rapporteur once more 
refers to the TRC final report. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Religious communities and their umbrella organizations are encouraged 
to continue to exercise vigilance against the possible spread of religious extremism, 
which so far has had no influence in Sierra Leone. The deeply rooted culture of 
tolerance has proved to be the best antidote against religious extremism. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) When broadcasting on radio networks, religious communities are 
encouraged to cross over denominational differences, for instance by sometimes 
airing prayers from a different religion. This good practice already exists and 
deserves to be further developed.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Recommendations addressed to the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The international community is encouraged to pay more attention to 
Sierra Leone. While remaining one of the economically poorest countries, Sierra 
Leone has developed a rich culture of inter- and intra-religious open-heartedness 
which can serve as an example of best practice in many regards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Persons interested in interreligious communication are encouraged to 
gain first-hand information on the situation in Sierra Leone, where religious 
communities cooperate in an admirable way in the ongoing process of rebuilding the 
nation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The international community, including public and private donors, 
should support the infrastructure of inter- and intra-religious cooperation in Sierra 
Leone. Such support, including financial subsidies, would also contribute to the 
ongoing reconciliation process, in keeping with the recommendations of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission of Sierra Leone.</b>
