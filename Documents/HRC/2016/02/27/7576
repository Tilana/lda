</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The document presents an overview of the activities of the Special Rapporteur on 
extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, during the term of her 
mandate 2008-2014. This is an addendum to her final report to the Human Rights Council. 
She hopes this summary will be useful for States and civil society organizations and will 
also serve to inform her successor about her activities, strategic goals, approach and valued 
partners.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur is very grateful for the support provided by the staff at the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). She would 
also like to thank the various States, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, civil 
society organizations, grass root movements, universities and individuals that have 
cooperated with her over the past six years.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur has consulted with and worked in collaboration with various 
non-governmental organizations throughout her mandate, in order to seek input for her 
reports, collaborate on advocacy and awareness-raising measures and to promote progress 
and standard-setting with regards to the rights of people living in poverty. It is not possible 
to mention every organization by name, but she would like to particularly thank the 
following organizations for their unrelenting support and very valuable collaboration 
throughout her whole term as mandate-holder: the International Movement ATD Fourth 
World, the Center for Economic and Social Rights, the Center for Women&#8217;s Global 
Leadership at Rutgers University and ESCR-Net.  
</p>
<p>4. Most of all, she would like to extend her sincere gratitude to all the people she has 
met with during her time as Special Rapporteur, who have shared with her their personal 
stories of struggling to overcome poverty, social exclusion, discrimination and 
disadvantage. 
</p>
<p>5. Of course, this summary cannot list every activity the Special Rapporteur undertook 
in six years,1 rather, it serves to provide a broad overview of her activities, strategy and 
thematic foci. Similarly, while it is not possible to provide a fully comprehensive 
assessment of the work of the mandate in the last 6 years in this annex, it does give some 
select concrete examples of the various impacts of the mandate&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Country visits and reports 
</b>6. The Special Rapporteur has undertaken 12 country visits: to Ecuador 
(A/HRC/11/9/Add.1), Zambia (A/HRC/14/31/Add.1), Bangladesh (joint mission with the 
Special Rapporteur on water and sanitation, A/HRC/15/55), Viet Nam 
(A/HRC/17/34/Add.1), Ireland (A/HRC/17/34/Add.2), Timor-Leste (A/HRC/20/25/Add.1), 
Paraguay (A/HRC/20/25/Add.2), Namibia (A/HRC/23/36/Add.1), Mongolia 
(A/HRC/23/36/Add.2), Mozambique (A/HRC/26/28/Add.1), the Republic of Moldova 
(A/HRC/26/28/Add.2) and Guinea-Bissau (A/HRC/26/28/Add.3).  These visits 
encompassed low-income, middle-income and high-income countries, as poverty and social 
exclusion exist in every country of the world.2  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 A list of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities is available here: 
</p>
<p>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Poverty/Pages/LatestActivities.aspx 
 
</p>
<p>2
 The Special Rapporteur has always worked on the premise that measures of poverty based solely on 
</p>
<p>income do not capture the full, lived experience of poverty, which is a multidimensional phenomenon 
 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>7. During these visits, she has met with government ministers, civil society 
organizations, grass roots organizations and most importantly, with people living in poverty 
themselves. The Special Rapporteur has been able to engage in constructive dialogues with 
all the States concerned and she thanks them for their fruitful cooperation and engagement 
before, during and after her visits.  
</p>
<p>8. In 2012, the Special Rapporteur conducted an assessment of the impact of her 
country visit recommendations until that point, on the basis of information provided by 
States and other stakeholders (see report A/HRC/20/25). This exercise found that, despite 
challenges, several of her recommendations have been followed.  
</p>
<p>9. The mandate&#8217;s recommendations on the importance of a human rights approach to 
social protection have been well received by many developing countries and in some cases 
have translated into improvements in social protection programs in terms of design, 
implementation or budgetary allocation. For example, since her visit to <b>Zambia</b> in 2009 
(see report A/HRC/14/31/Add.1) the Government adopted the Sixth National Development 
Plan (SNDP), which proposed a significant scaling-up of the country&#8217;s social protection 
programs in the period 2011-2015, including the expansion of the social cash transfer 
schemes. This was one of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main recommendations during and after 
her visit. 
</p>
<p>10. In <b>Timor-Leste</b>, which she visited in November 2011 (see report 
A/HRC/20/25/Add.1), the end-of-mission statement received national media attention and 
was debated in the national parliament, particularly in the context of the 2012 state budget.3 
The Special Rapporteur had called for increased public expenditure on social services, 
citing concern about the steady decrease in the percentage of public expenditures to social 
services, such as education and health, as well as agriculture. At the time of the statement, 
the projected 2012 state budget of $1.8 million had 6.3 percent going to education, less than 
3 percent to health and about 1 percent to agriculture (compared to nearly 50 percent to 
infrastructure). Eventually, the 2012 budget was adopted with the final result as follows: 
health (46.9 percent), education (35.1 percent) and agriculture and fisheries (20.7 percent). 
While this dramatic shift of course cannot be attributed solely to her mission and 
recommendations, the UN Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) noted positively that the 
mission contributed to this end.  
</p>
<p>11. The establishment of an income tax was one of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main 
recommendations during her visit to <b>Paraguay </b>in December 2011. She called for the entry 
into force of the income tax law, as well as for greater solidarity on the part of the 
population in moving towards a more equal society (see report A/HRC/20/25/Add.2). In 
July 2012, the income tax law was signed into law and it entered into force in August 
2012.4 During the interactive dialogue with States at the 21st session of the Human Rights 
Council (September 2012), Paraguay publicly acknowledged that the adoption of the 
income tax law was an implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation.5  
</p>
<p>12. During country visits, the Special Rapporteur called on States to ratify or accede to 
specific international human rights instruments relating to the protection of persons in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>characterized by the sustained or chronic deprivation of resources, capabilities, choices, security and 
power.

</b></p>
<p>situations of extreme poverty. In several cases, States later complied with her call. For 
example, <b>Zambia</b> ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 
2010, while <b>Ecuador </b>(2010)<b> </b>acceded and <b>Ireland </b>(2012) signed the Optional Protocol to 
the ICESCR. Some countries also adopted specific laws that were recommended in country 
reports and in other cases the country visit sparked a debate about their adoption.  
</p>
<p>13. In her 2012 report, the Special Rapporteur also conducted a more general analysis of 
the challenges of following up on special procedures&#8217; country mission recommendations, 
given that there is no institutionalized mechanism at the international level through which 
the recommendations can be followed up, measured and assessed. Meanwhile, financial and 
human resource constraints prevent most mandate holders from engaging in repeat visits to 
States, or conducting systematic follow-up themselves. In her report, the Special 
Rapporteur made various recommendations for how follow up could be improved across 
the special procedures system, including the establishment of an institutionalized follow-up 
procedure by the Human Rights Council, and the establishment of national mechanisms by 
States to review progress, with the active engagement of NHRIs, UN agencies and civil 
society.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Thematic reports 
</b></p>
<p>14. Following her initial report presenting a conceptual framework for her work 
(A/63/274), the Special Rapporteur prepared nine thematic reports on a range of issues.6 
The Special Rapporteur has chosen the topics for her thematic reports in close consultation 
with other stakeholders, including civil society, and based on her observations and 
conversations with people living in poverty during her country visits. Through her reports 
and related advocacy, she hopes that she has been able to bring renewed clarity and focus 
on some issues, and push other issues forward for more mainstream consideration by States, 
UN agencies and civil society. Above all, her aim was to use her platform to shine a light 
on the experiences and challenges of people living in poverty - so often neglected in policy-
making at all levels - and to advocate for laws, policies and practices that can better realize 
their human rights. In particular, she sought to include careful consideration of gender 
issues in all her reports, given that women are particularly vulnerable to poverty and 
experience particular challenges to escaping poverty. All of her reports were developed 
through rigorous research and consultation, including questionnaires directed to States and 
civil society organizations, responses to which can be found on the mandate&#8217;s website.  
</p>
<p>15. Below, the main themes that she has worked on are summarized, alongside some of 
the key recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur. The final report, on the theme 
of fiscal and tax policies, is the one this text is added to and therefore not included in the 
summary below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Social protection 
</b></p>
<p>16. Through consultations at the beginning of her mandate in 2008, it became clear that 
there existed a pressing need for an analysis of the human rights implications of, and 
approach to, social protection (social security) programs.7 Therefore, the Special 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 Not including the above-mentioned report assessing the impact of her country visits (A/HRC/20/25), 
</p>
<p>or reports submitted in furtherance of the Guiding Principles on extreme poverty and human rights 
(A/HRC/21/39 and A/HRC/15/41) 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 The ILO and other United Nations bodies use the term social security and social protection 
</p>
<p>interchangeably to refer to the benefits in cash or in kind to secure protection in case of social risks 
 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>Rapporteur concentrated much of her efforts in the first few years of her mandate to 
elaborating and advocating a human rights approach to social protection.  
</p>
<p>17. Although social security systems have played an integral role in many States for 
decades, over recent years an increasing amount of money has been allocated by States, 
donor agencies, International Financial Institutions and even NGOs to the establishment 
and expansion of social protection systems around the world. For example, from 2000-2010 
the World Bank lent USD 11.5 billion to scale up and start social protection schemes - in 
particular conditional cash transfer programs - around the world.  
</p>
<p>18. Social programs have been expanded in all regions, in particular in Latin America, 
South East Asia and Sub-Saharan African countries.8 In some regions, the coverage of these 
programs is very significant: according to the Economic Commission for Latin America 
and the Caribbean (ECLAC), there are 25 million families in the region that receive cash 
transfers, benefiting more than 113 million people, representing 19 percent of the region&#8217;s 
whole population. Many of these programs have proven benefits and have been quite 
effective in tackling poverty, improving access to essential services and even diminishing 
income inequality. Yet when the Special Rapporteur began her mandate in 2008, these 
programs had seldom been discussed or analyzed from a human rights perspective.  
</p>
<p>19. Certainly, social protection programs can assist States in fulfilling their obligations 
under international human rights law.  In particular, they have the potential to ensure the 
enjoyment of minimum essential levels of economic, social and cultural rights such as the 
right to an adequate standard of living including food, clothing and housing, the right to 
education, the right to the highest attainable standard of health and the right to social 
security. However, the Special Rapporteur and other actors were concerned that if human 
rights norms and principles are not taken into account in the design, implementation and 
monitoring of these programs, they are rendered not only weak and unsustainable but they 
might ultimately undermine or even violate individuals&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>20. Accordingly, in the first few years of her mandate the Special Rapporteur presented 
four reports dealing with different elements of social protection. In 2009, she analyzed cash 
transfer programmes from a human rights perspective (A/HRC/11/9); while her report to 
the General Assembly (A/64/279) focused on social protection systems in the context of the 
global financial crisis. In 2010, she presented a report to the Human Rights Council on 
social pensions (A/HRC/14/31) and a report to the General Assembly on the importance of 
gender-sensitive social protection measures in achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals (A/65/259).  
21. In 2012, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work on social protection was collected and 
synthesized in a publication by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, <i>A Human Rights 
Approach to Social Protection</i>.9 Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s other thematic reports, 
as well as all her country reports, have also included consideration of social protection&#8217;s 
crucial role in reducing poverty. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations have 
emphasized, <i>inter alia</i>, the need for social protection programs to include strong and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>and needs. In General Comment No. 19, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
specified that the right to social security encompasses social insurance (contributory) and social 
assistance (non-contributory schemes).  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 Social protection measures include cash transfer schemes, public work programs, school stipends, 
</p>
<p>unemployment or disability benefits, social pensions, food vouchers and food transfers, user fee 
exemptions for health care or education and subsidised services.

<p>accessible complaint and accountability mechanisms, prioritization of the participation of 
people living in poverty in the design and implementation of the programs, and ensuring 
that they contribute towards substantive equality and do not directly or indirectly 
discriminate against any individuals or group. She has been a strong advocate of the need 
for gender-sensitive social protection systems. In this regard, she has raised concerns about 
the human rights implications of certain eligibility criteria and targeting mechanisms 
commonly used in social protection programs. She has raised awareness about the gender 
implications of conditional cash transfer programmes, as conditionalities tend to increase 
the amount of unpaid care work that women have to undertake, and reinforce maternalistic 
stereotypes about women&#8217;s domestic role. She has also urged States and donors to 
coordinate their various social protection programs, avoid fragmentation and move towards 
comprehensive social protection systems, including by complementing them with other 
poverty reduction measures and improved access to essential services.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur has continued to provide specific advice to governments on 
how to improve their social protection programmes and align them with human rights 
obligations through her country mission reports and subsequent dialogues. She has strived 
to influence States as well as some key organizations towards a rights-based approach to 
social protection. Particularly relevant in this regard has been her work with the Economic 
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the World Bank and the 
International Labour Organization (ILO). 
</p><p>23. The work with ECLAC has proved to be very fruitful. ECLAC&#8217;s position has 
evolved throughout their engagement with the Special Rapporteur and now incorporates the 
human rights approach to social protection more consistently. For example, in 2011 the 
sixth seminar on cash transfer programs, convened by ECLAC together with FAO and 
OHCHR, brought together policy makers from all over the region to discuss &#8220;Cash 
Transfers Programs from a Human Rights Perspective.&#8221;10 Most recently, the Special 
Rapporteur presented the human rights perspective on social protection at the international 
seminar on &#8216;Public policies for equality: towards universal social protection systems,&#8217; 
convened by ECLAC and the Uruguayan Ministry of Social Development in Montevideo. 
She has also authored a report published in 2014 by ECLAC and the Norwegian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, assessing Latin American social protection policies from a human rights 
perspective.11  
</p>
<p>24. The most successful results of her dialogue with the World Bank - undertaken in 
conjunction with several other human rights actors- has been the incorporation of principles 
of transparency and accountability and a rights-based perspective in the Bank&#8217;s social 
protection work.12 Her engagement with the International Labour Organization has enabled 
her to feed into and influence the development of policy around the Social Protection Floor 
Initiative (SPF-I). For example, in coordination with a coalition of NGOs, her call13 to 
States and other members of the ILO for an improved rights-based approach in the 2012

</p>
<p>Recommendation on a Social Protection Floor was in most part incorporated in the text of 
the Recommendation, adopted in 2012 (Recommendation 202).14 
</p><p>25. In 2012, together with the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, the Special 
Rapporteur put forward a proposal for the establishment of a Global Fund for Social 
Protection, with the goal of overcoming financial obstacles and building international 
solidarity in order to fulfil the right to food and the right to social protection in developing 
countries, particularly those where the risks of drought and food price volatility are high.15  
The initiative was presented at the 39th plenary session of the Committee for World Food 
Security in October 2012 and at the Social Protection Inter-Agency Cooperation Board 
(SPIAC-B), as well as in various other fora. The proposal, supported by the European 
Parliament,16 was among the key recommendations that emerged from global consultations 
led by the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda,17 
and was included in the UN system&#8217;s Technical Support Team issues brief on social 
protection in the SDGs.18 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic crisis and austerity 
</b></p>
<p>26. At the 17th session of the Human Rights Council (June 2011), the Special 
Rapporteur submitted a report that set out the parameters of a human rights-based approach 
to recovery from the global economic and financial crises, with a particular focus on the 
most vulnerable and marginalized groups. The report urged States to see recovery from the 
crises as an opportunity for change, a chance to rectify deeply ingrained poverty and social 
exclusion, restore social cohesion and lay the foundations for more equitable, sustainable 
societies. It identified the human rights framework that States must comply with when 
designing recovery measures, analyzed a number of recovery measures from a human rights 
perspective and then recommended measures that States should consider taking to facilitate 
a human rights-based recovery from the crises. The recommendations included putting in 
place social protection floors for all, implementing socially responsible taxation policies, 
conducting human rights impact assessments, and increasing participation in policy-making 
and budgeting. 
</p>
<p>27. Given the on-going relevance of the issue after the submission of the report, the 
Special Rapporteur continued to monitor the impact of State responses to the economic 
crisis - particularly &#8216;austerity&#8217; measures - on the human rights of the poorest and most 
vulnerable people. Austerity measures, which have become an increasingly dominant 
approach in response to the crises, are affecting the enjoyment of a broad spectrum of 
human rights. At a practical level, in many countries across the developing and developed 
world, changes to budgets, legal frameworks and social protection systems in the aftermath 
of the global financial and economic crises are threatening States&#8217; human rights obligations 
and are undermining the human rights of persons living in poverty.

<p>28. The Special Rapporteur has participated in several events and activities focused on 
the human rights impact of austerity, in order to highlight the need for alternative human 
rights-based approaches to recovery. These activities include speaking at public events and 
at consultations organized by OHCHR in Geneva and Tunisia. The Special Rapporteur has 
also developed communications (some of which are now publicly available) to various 
States on the subject of austerity measures after receiving relevant information through the 
channels used by the Human Rights Council special procedures.19  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work on austerity measures was also referenced in the 
Resolution on &quot;the impact of the financial and economic crisis on human rights&#8221; (March 
2013) of the European Parliament.20 
</p>
<p><b> C. Penalization of poverty 
</b></p>
<p>30. At the 66th session of the General Assembly, in October 2011, the Special 
Rapporteur submitted a report concerning the penalization of people living in poverty 
(A/66/265). The report analyzed laws, regulations and practices that punish, segregate, 
control or undermine the autonomy of persons living in poverty, for example by prohibiting 
homeless persons from sleeping or eating in public spaces, by subjecting welfare recipients 
to surveillance or unnecessary conditionalities, or through excessive reliance on pre-trial 
detention.  These practices have a grave impact on people living in poverty and are often 
explicitly discriminatory &#8211; criminalizing their livelihoods, interfering in their privacy and 
family life and threatening their liberty and personal security. Unfortunately, such measures 
have been adopted with increasing frequency over the past three decades, intensifying in 
recent years due to the economic and financial crises and now represent a serious threat to 
the enjoyment of human rights by persons living in poverty in many regions of the world. 
</p><p>31. The overall objective of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work in this area has been to 
influence the agendas of intergovernmental bodies, especially those in the UN system, as 
well as States and civil society in general, in order to secure recognition of and response to 
the wide range of human rights concerns around the penalization of poverty. The report 
contains strong recommendations to States to end and prevent this practice, including 
reviewing requirements and conditionalities on welfare benefits to ensure that they do not 
violate human rights obligations, enacting comprehensive legislation to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of socio-economic status, repealing laws that specifically target 
the particular behaviors and actions of people living in poverty and reviewing bail, 
detention and incarceration policies to ensure they do not disproportionately disadvantage 
people living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>32. The mandate has worked on raising awareness though press releases21 and public 
statements22 about the human rights impacts of penalization of poverty and has sent official 
communications to States when instances of penalization are alleged in order to modify 
States&#8217; responses and encourage public awareness about the penalization of poverty.23 The

</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur has spoken in various forums about the penalization of poverty, 
including at universities, public events and at the UN. In February 2013, she spoke about 
the issue to a high-level conference on poverty, inequality and human rights organized by 
the Council of Europe, in partnership with the European Commission.24  
</p>
<p>33. The work so far has resulted in greater media coverage and public awareness of the 
penalization of poverty and its consequences in specific countries (e.g. Hungary, the United 
States of America and Australia). This work has also been crucial to promote the 
indivisibility of all human rights, and not to &#8216;ghettoize&#8217; poverty issues as solely concerned 
with economic and social rights.  
</p>
<p>34. The work of the Special Rapporteur, partners and other advocates &#8211; in particular the 
National Law Center on Homeless and Poverty - contributed to the recognition by the US 
Department of Justice and Interagency Council on Homelessness that the criminalization of 
homelessness may violate international human rights law, including the ICCPR and the 
CAT.25 In the recent review of the United States of America by the Human Rights 
Committee, the Committee explicitly noted that the criminalization of homelessness raises 
concerns of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.26 
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to justice 
</b>35. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the 67th session of the General Assembly 
(A/67/278 - presented in November 2012) focused on access to justice. The exclusion of 
people living in poverty from the protection provided by the law denies them the 
opportunity to claim their rights and lift themselves out of poverty, trapping them in a 
vicious circle of impunity, poverty, powerlessness and injustice. The report analyzed the 
multitude of obstacles that persons living in poverty face in accessing justice, including fees 
and costs, limited access to information, lack of civil registration, geographical distance 
from police stations and courthouses, corruption, and excessive reliance on pre-trial 
detention. Considering that women are overrepresented among the poor and that States 
have agreed that access to justice by women is central to accelerate progress in the 
achievement of the MDGs in particular MDG 3, the report also highlighted the particular 
problems faced by women in seeking formal redress, including inadequate legal 
frameworks for dealing with gender-based crimes and social and cultural constraints which 
may prevent them from speaking out against abuses or seeking justice.27  
36. The report aimed to influence the way States approach, design, implement, evaluate 
and monitor justice intervention and poverty reduction programmes, stressing the 
importance of solving the structural problems that prevent the most marginalized and 
vulnerable sectors of society from accessing justice or seeking remedy for the crimes, 
abuses and human rights violations they suffer. The report details several specific steps 
States can undertake to improve access to justice by people living in poverty, such as 
undertaking civil registration drives, expanding the geographical reach of the justice 
system, sensitization and training for justice providers and ensuring that free legal aid is

<p>provided in both civil and criminal cases where the rights and interests of persons living in 
poverty are at stake.  
</p>
<p>37. Since the publication of the report, the Special Rapporteur has worked with partners 
to ensure wide dissemination of the report amongst government agencies, development 
actors, UN bodies and NGOs, in order to raise awareness of the importance of solving these 
structural problems to ensure access to justice and remedies for the most marginalized and 
vulnerable sectors of society. In particular, she worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of Finland to publish <i>Access to justice for people living in poverty: a human rights 
approach</i>.28  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur spoke at CEDAW&#8217;s day of general discussion on their 
forthcoming general recommendation on women&#8217;s access to justice.29 She also worked with 
the &#8216;Panel on Human Dignity&#8217; (part of the &#8216;Swiss Initiative&#8217; to mark the 60th anniversary of 
the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) in order to cement the place of access to 
justice for people living in poverty on their agenda, as a fundamental tool for human rights 
fulfillment and poverty reduction. She wrote two reports for the Panel, building on and 
expanding her General Assembly report.  
</p>
<p>39. In the approach to the 2015 deadline for the Millennium Development Goals, the 
Special Rapporteur built on this work by arguing for a specific goal, target and indicators 
on access to justice as part of the post-2015 sustainable development goals, in collaboration 
with NGOs including the Open Society Justice Initiative, the International Development 
Law Organization, and Namati.30 
</p>
<p><b> E. Participation 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report (A/HRC/23/36) to the 23rd session of the Human 
Rights Council (June 2013) analysed the barriers that people living in poverty face to 
effective participation in public and political life, and proposed a human rights-based policy 
framework for more effective and meaningful inclusion.  
</p>
<p>41. Lack of power is a universal characteristic of poverty that manifests itself in many 
ways, at its core being the inability to participate in or influence decisions that profoundly 
affect one&#8217;s life.  Participation has been prominent in the development and poverty 
reduction discourse for some time, yet often participatory processes put in place by States, 
donors, international financial institutions, UN agencies or even NGOs are tokenistic, 
cursory consultations, conducted to give a veneer of legitimacy to an already-decided 
policy. People living in poverty face serious constraints in accessing decision-making 
forums or mechanisms, and exerting real influence through them, due to, <i>inter alia</i>, 
practical and financial impediments, stigma and discrimination, lack of information and 
hierarchies of power. This results in many decisions that are extremely pertinent for their 
lives being taken without their input &#8211; for example decisions about welfare benefits,

</p>
<p>community water management, and local or national budgets&#8211;. This not only denies their 
dignity, agency and right to participate, but can also result in decisions and policies being 
less effective and responsive.  
</p>
<p>42. Thus, the Special Rapporteur sought to clarify how participation should be 
understood and realized from a human rights perspective. The report examined the key 
human rights principles and standards that determine the content of the right to participation 
and presented concrete recommendations to States and other key actors on how to 
operationalize this to ensure meaningful and empowering participation by the poorest and 
most marginalized members of society. For example, in order to comply with the principles 
of equality and non-discrimination, those designing and implementing participatory 
mechanisms must take into account the power dynamics at the societal and community 
level, and put in place strategies to ensure that those who are marginalized or discriminated 
against are enabled to participate meaningfully. To ensure that women living in poverty can 
actively participate, for example, in some circumstances it may be necessary to provide 
onsite childcare or create women-only spaces. The report recommended concrete measures 
States could take, such as providing funding for capacity-building in disadvantaged 
communities, undertaking an audit of barriers to participation, proactively making relevant 
data and information available in accessible formats, and involving people living in poverty 
in setting the agenda and goals for participatory and decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p>43. The report was developed in collaboration with ATD Fourth World, an organization 
with a long track record of working with people living in poverty, to respond to the lack of 
concrete guidance on how to facilitate meaningful participation of people living in poverty. 
Since publication of the report, its framework and recommendations for participation have 
been used in various local and national advocacy efforts, and the Special Rapporteur has 
presented its findings at several events and meetings. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Unpaid care work 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the 68th session of the General Assembly 
(A/68/293), in 2013, examined the links between unpaid care work, poverty and women&#8217;s 
rights enjoyment. The report outlined the impact of the gendered distribution of unpaid care 
work on women&#8217;s poverty and human rights and clarified States&#8217; human rights obligations 
in this regard. Drawing from these obligations, the Special Rapporteur made 
recommendations for how States can recognize, value, reduce and redistribute unpaid care 
work through policies guided by human rights, including in the areas of labor legislation, 
social protection, public services, care services and infrastructure. In particular, the Special 
Rapporteur suggested three steps for State action, in order to ensure women&#8217;s better 
enjoyment of human rights and tackle their vulnerability to poverty. Firstly, States should 
recognize and count women&#8217;s unpaid care work and take it into account in policy-making, 
with time-use surveys a crucial tool in this regard. Secondly, States should invest greater 
resources in gender-sensitive public services and infrastructure, especially in disadvantaged 
areas, and examine how these could better support and redistribute care. Thirdly, States 
must adopt a &#8216;care lens&#8217; in policy-making, to ensure social and economic policies across all 
areas are promoting the better sharing of care between women and men, in the short, 
medium and long-term.  Tax codes, family leave legislation and social protection policies 
are all crucial levers in this regard &#8211; but currently, rather than incentivizing men&#8217;s 
caregiving and women&#8217;s paid work, they tend to reinforce gender stereotypes around 
women as caregivers and men as breadwinners.   
</p>
<p>45. The report has attracted much attention and support from women&#8217;s rights advocates 
and development practitioners. The Special Rapporteur worked closely with UN Women in 
developing and disseminating the report, as well as with women&#8217;s rights advocates and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>development practitioners including ActionAid International, the Institute of Development 
Studies, and Oxfam GB. Several outreach activities were undertaken to disseminate the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, including blogs,31 media coverage,32 op-eds33 and video 
materials.34 In addition, an e-discussion on &#8220;Unequal unpaid care work keeps rural women 
poor and violates their rights: how do we respond?&#8221; was held in October 2013, in 
partnership with UN Women&#8217;s &#8220;Knowledge Gateway.&#8221;35  
</p>
<p>46. The report has also been the basis for a strong and renewed effort to include the 
issue of unpaid care work in the post-2015 agenda / sustainable development goals (SDGs). 
Specifically, the Special Rapporteur has been arguing for a target and indicators on unpaid 
care work as part of a stand-alone goal on gender equality and women&#8217;s rights, in 
coordination with organizations such as UN Women, ActionAid International and the 
Institute of Development Studies (IDS). She was invited by UN Women to speak about 
unpaid care work at a side-event on inequalities at the Eighth Session of the Open Working 
Group on the SDGs. At the 58th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in 
March 2014, the Special Rapporteur took part in many events focused on the issue, whose 
organizers and sponsors included the World Bank, UN Women, States, and civil society 
organizations. While at the CSW, the Special Rapporteur advocated for the inclusion in the 
SDGs of a target on recognizing, reducing and redistributing unpaid care work, as well as 
the inclusion of such issues in the CSW Agreed Conclusions.36 Ultimately, the Agreed 
Conclusions did include unequivocal support for a stand-alone SDG on gender, 
incorporated important recognition of the impact of unpaid care work on development, 
women&#8217;s rights and gender inequality and proposed policy measures in line with those 
recommended in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report.37 This important recognition is indicative 
of increased attention to, and momentum around, unpaid care work as a women&#8217;s rights 
issue, in part due to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report and advocacy.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Post-2015 development goals 
</b></p>
<p>47. Given the special relevance of the post-2015 development agenda to the human 
rights of persons living in extreme poverty, the Special Rapporteur has been urging States 
to ensure that the final framework is founded on and substantively informed by human 
rights law and principles.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur has conducted advocacy through a variety of channels for 
the meaningful inclusion of human rights in the post-2015 sustainable development goals 
(SDGs), working with various civil society partners. The Special Rapporteur also joined 
with other special procedures mandate holders in public statements on the topic of the post-
2015 agenda. In May 2013, the Special Rapporteur together with 16 other mandates called 
on States to ground development priorities in human rights and focus on eliminating

<p>inequalities, improving social protection, and ensuring accountability.38 In September 2013, 
she issued a statement jointly with another 16 other mandate holders, which addressed the 
General Assembly&#8217;s Special Event on the Achievement of MDGs and the Post-2015 
Development Agenda.39  
</p>
<p>49. As well as promoting the general need for the goals to be founded on human rights 
obligations and focused on the rights and needs of the poorest and most disadvantaged 
people, she has concentrated her advocacy around three issues: social protection,40 access to 
justice,41 and unpaid care work (further details on these efforts are included above in the 
relevant thematic sections).42  The mandate has facilitated and catalyzed collaboration 
among several intergovernmental and civil society organizations to promote the inclusion 
of these specific topics in the SDGs and developed and disseminated briefing papers 
explaining the importance of including each of these issues in the SDGs and suggesting 
relevant targets and indicators. The briefing papers have been disseminated widely through 
the OHCHR website, direct letters to member States as well as media outreach.43  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur also undertook bilateral meetings with key actors and spoke 
at high-level public events and meetings on the post-2015 agenda. These events include 
side-events at the Open Working Group meetings in New York, and the Human Rights 
Council in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>51. The final formulation of the SDGs will not be clear until 2015, but the Special 
Rapporteur feels that her efforts and those of other human rights advocates have had an 
important impact so far, in highlighting the need for certain issues to be included and the 
need for a strategic shift from the content and approach of the MDGs. At the General 
Assembly in 2013, UN Member States recognized that human rights must be at the core of 
the global development agenda. Many of the key messages advanced in the work of the 
Special Rapporteur regarding human rights accountability, inequality, access to justice and 
social protection were reflected in the Secretary General&#8217;s report and recommendations to 
the GA, as well as in the subsequent outcomes of the Open Working Group sessions. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Examination of specific allegations of human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>52. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s term, the mandate on extreme poverty and human 
rights began receiving and responding to information concerning specific cases of alleged 
human rights violations.44 Within the resources that are available to her, the Special 
Rapporteur has endeavoured to act on all submissions by sending communications (urgent 
appeals and letters of allegations) when receiving well-documented information on alleged 
violations of the rights of people living in poverty. In most cases, she has acted jointly with 
other mandate holders whose mandates are relevant to the cases concerned.

<p>53. Full copies of letters sent and replies received are contained in the Joint 
Communications Report of Special Procedures mandate holders submitted periodically to 
the Human Rights Council.45 The Special Rapporteur has also compiled the cases acted 
upon by her mandate in a document publicly available on the mandate&#8217;s website.46 From 
2011 to November 2013, the Special Rapporteur dealt with a total of 28 cases in the 
following countries (in alphabetical order): Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, 
Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Nepal, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Republic of 
Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United 
States of America.47 In some urgent cases where it was felt that media attention could aid in 
making progress towards resolution, prevention or redress (and the State concerned had 
already had an opportunity to respond to the allegations), the Special Rapporteur has issued 
press releases jointly with other mandate holders regarding these situations.  
</p><p>54. 61 percent of these allegation letters have received responses from States. The 
communications sent have in many cases resulted in constructive dialogue, and have also 
provided a basis for renewed advocacy and awareness-raising at the national level.48 
However, the Special Rapporteur would like to note her concern that some States 
frequently or habitually do not respond to her communications or those from other special 
procedures. Constructive dialogue between States and special procedures and full 
clarification of the facts is in the interests of all parties concerned.  
</p>
<p>55. In cases where the alleged violation involves a business enterprise, letters have been 
sent not only to the State where the alleged violation(s) have taken place, but also to the 
State where the business enterprise is domiciled, as well as to the business enterprise itself. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Clarification of international standards: the Guiding 
Principles on extreme poverty and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>56. In 2009, the Special Rapporteur was requested by the Human Rights Council to 
assist in concluding the drafting process of the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, which had been initiated by States in 2001.49 After a 
broad consultation process with States, academic experts, NGOs and human rights and 
development practitioners, in September 2012 she presented a final draft of the Guiding 
Principles, which were subsequently adopted by the HRC by consensus in resolution 21/11, 
of 27 September 2012. On 20 December 2012, the UN General Assembly adopted a 
resolution on human rights and extreme poverty where it &quot;Takes note with appreciation of 
the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, adopted by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 21/11 as a useful tool for States in the formulation and 
implementation of poverty reduction and eradication policies, as appropriate.&quot;

 For an overview of the history of the Guiding Principles, see A/HRC/21/39, Annex.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>57. The Guiding Principles provide State-adopted global policy guidelines applying 
States&#8217; human rights obligations to the specific situation of people living in poverty. The 
Principles respond to the significant social, cultural, economic and structural obstacles that 
people living in poverty face, which prevent them from enjoying their rights and put them 
at increased risk of discrimination, stigma, violence, ill health and lack of education, further 
entrenching and exacerbating the cycle of poverty through successive generations. Based 
on international human rights norms and standards, the Principles should serve as a 
practical tool for policy-makers to ensure that public policies (including poverty eradication 
efforts) serve the poorest members of society and respect and uphold all their rights. 
</p><p>58. The challenge since their adoption has been to ensure awareness and 
implementation. Since the Guiding Principles were adopted, the Special Rapporteur secured 
funds for the publication of more than 1,000 copies of the Guiding Principles in a more 
reader-friendly format in Arabic,50 English,51 French52 and Spanish.53 In addition, the report 
has been translated into a number of non-UN languages such as Italian, Polish and 
Portuguese.54 
</p>
<p>59. The Guiding Principles in various languages are now disseminated as a core 
&#8220;Reference Material&#8221; of the OHCHR and hard copy versions have been disseminated 
widely in several meetings around the world (from Montevideo, Uruguay to New York).55  
</p><p>60. The Special Rapporteur and her team have also disseminated them through the 
media, side-events, and targeted bilateral advocacy (for example with the World Bank and 
UNDP). She has written articles for several academic publications and engaged with 
UNDP, OHCHR and other relevant actors to ensure that the Guiding Principles are used as 
an important guide in the formulation of the SDGs, as they enshrine progressive language 
linking poverty eradication, development and human rights obligations. Gradually, the 
Guiding Principles are becoming more widely known.56 For example, they have been 
mentioned in the case law of the European Committee of Social Rights.57  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Cross-fertilization and advocacy with human rights 
mechanisms and intergovernmental bodies 
</b></p>
<p>61. First and foremost, the Special Rapporteur has maintained a close and mutually 
beneficial relationship with the <b>Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</b> 
(OHCHR), both in Geneva and at its various regional offices.  
62. The Special Rapporteur has endeavoured to ensure that the work of her mandate is 
coordinated with that of other special procedures and the UN treaty bodies. She has 
regularly worked in collaboration with other mandate holders, in elaborating

<p>communications, press releases, public statements and in making policy proposals. She has 
endeavoured to refer to and incorporate other mandate holders&#8217; work in her reports and 
other materials, and has sought their input wherever possible. She extends her sincere 
thanks to her fellow mandate holders for their collaboration and support, and for the 
opportunities they have given her to contribute to their work also.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur made a presentation at the CEDAW Committee&#8217;s day of 
general discussion on women&#8217;s access to justice and she has presented the Guiding 
Principles on extreme poverty and human rights to treaty bodies including the CESCR. She 
has endeavoured to ensure coordination and synergy between her mandate&#8217;s 
recommendations and findings and those of the treaty bodies, for example including their 
jurisprudence, general comments and conclusions in her reports. Through her country 
reports and related advocacy, she has consistently urged States to ratify all international 
human rights treaties and she has been particularly active in promoting ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the ICESCR, which finally came into force in May 2013. As she 
expressed in her report of 2012 analysing follow-up to country visits (A/HRC/20/25), the 
Special Rapporteur believes that increasing synergies between special procedures and treaty 
bodies is a crucial task, and requires strengthened collaboration and information-sharing 
within OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>64. As described above, the Special Rapporteur has developed a collaborative 
relationship with the<b> Economic</b> <b>Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean</b> 
(ECLAC) on issues of social protection, regularly participating in relevant meetings.  
65. Since the beginning of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur has striven to influence 
the work of the <b>World Bank,</b> pushing for a rights-based approach to social protection and 
access to justice, as noted above. She made annual visits to the World Bank offices in 
Washington D.C., meeting with various senior economists, the Nordic Trust Fund, and the 
Social Protection team. In October 2013 she met with several members of the World Bank 
board of directors to advocate for better inclusion and recognition of human rights norms 
and standards in World Bank programing and safeguards and has engaged in follow-up 
since that meeting to make specific recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Throughout her term as mandate holder, the Special Rapporteur has worked with 
<b>UN agencies</b> to ensure that the human rights approach to poverty reduction is kept on the 
agenda, particularly with respect to development and the post-2015 development 
framework. She has maintained regular contact with partners at <b>UNDP</b> and this 
collaboration has proved mutually beneficial on various topics, including social protection 
and access to justice. In order to build on and enhance the gender focus of the mandate, in 
recent years the Special Rapporteur engaged increasingly with <b>UN Women</b>. Most recently 
this collaboration has taken concrete shape on the issue of unpaid care work, as described 
above.  
</p>
<p>67. She has also engaged with the <b>European Union</b> institutions and the <b>Council of 
Europe</b>. She made a submission to the European Union Public Consultation on Social 
Protection in EU Development Cooperation and has held meetings with members of the 
European Parliament and some of its Sub- Committees, including discussing the Guiding 
Principles on extreme poverty and human rights, and the human rights impacts of austerity. 
As mentioned above, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work has been referenced in a resolution of 
the European Parliament.58 She was a keynote speaker at a conference on poverty and

</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion 
</b>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur has approached her mandate with the view that the 
most important part of her role is to advice the UN Human Rights Council and States, 
and to do so also by giving a voice to those who so often are ignored by governments 
and by the international community. By listening to and collaborating with people 
living in poverty, those campaigning in grassroots organizations, and other members 
of civil society, she hopes that she has been able to provide a platform for their 
experiences and concerns, and to publicize and clarify the obligations States have to 
respect, protect and fulfill their human rights.
