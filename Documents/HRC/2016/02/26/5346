</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted in June 1993 by the 
World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), the Beijing Declaration and Platform 
for Action, adopted in September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women 
(A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1, chap. I), and the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, 
adopted in September 2001 by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> the challenges still faced by all countries throughout the world to 
overcome inequality between men and women, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled 
&#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century&#8221;, the 
declaration adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-ninth session and the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/13 of 17 April 2000, 
2001/34 of 23 April 2001 and 2003/22 of 22 April 2003, as well as Council resolution 6/30 
of 14 December 2007 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United Nations 
system, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that international human rights treaties, including the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees to ensure equality of 
women and men, girls and boys, in the enjoyment of their civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that women face multiple forms of discrimination,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> the need to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination against 
women throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of life is essential 
for the full and complete economic and social development of a country, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/L.3/Rev.1 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful</i> of the fact that the elimination of discrimination against women requires the 
consideration of women&#8217;s specific socio-economic context, and recognizing that laws, policies, 
customs and traditions that restrict women&#8217;s equal access to participate fully in development 
processes and public and political life are discriminatory and may contribute to the feminization 
of poverty, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms</i> the obligation of States to take all appropriate measures to eliminate 
discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. Welcomes </i>the commitments made by the international community to fully implement 
the Millennium Development Goals and stressing, in that context, the resolve of Heads of State 
to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective ways to combat 
poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly sustainable; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes</i> the efforts made by States around the world to reform their legal 
systems in order to remove obstacles to women&#8217;s full and effective enjoyment of their human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the fact that, despite the pledge made at the Beijing World 
Conference on Women and the review by the General Assembly at its twenty-third special 
session to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate against women and girls, many of 
these laws are still in force and continue to be applied, thereby preventing women and girls from 
enjoying the full realization of their human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States to fulfil their international obligations and commitments to revoke 
any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the 
administration of justice, taking into account that those laws violate their human right to be 
protected against discrimination; 
</p>
<p> 6<i>. Recognizes</i> that women&#8217;s inequality before the law has resulted in the lack of equal 
opportunities for women in education, access to health, economic participation, access to labour 
and disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political participation, access to 
decision-making processes, inheritance, ownership of land, financial services, including loans, </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/L.3/Rev.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>and nationality and legal capacity, among others, as well as increased vulnerability to 
discrimination and violence, and that all countries face challenges in these areas; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Acknowledges </i>the work undertaken by the Commission on the Status of Women, the 
Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the special 
rapporteurs of the Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and 
trafficking of persons, including women and children, contemporary forms of slavery and other 
relevant United Nations bodies, agencies and mechanisms to eliminate discrimination in law and 
practice throughout the world; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Emphasizes</i> the significant role that women play in economic development and in the 
eradication of poverty, stresses the need to promote equal pay for equal work or work of equal 
value and for promoting the recognition of the value of women&#8217;s unremunerated work, as well as 
for developing and promoting policies that facilitate the reconciliation of employment and family 
responsibilities; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls on States to ensure</i> full representation and full equal participation of women in 
political, social and economic decision-making as an essential condition for gender equality and 
the empowerment of women and girls as a critical factor in the eradication of poverty; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Welcomes</i> particularly the work undertaken by the Committee on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women on women&#8217;s equality before the law; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> the important role played by the Council in addressing the issue of 
discrimination against women, in both law and practice; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Welcomes</i> the convening of a panel on equality before the law during the 
eleventh session of the Council; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Notes</i> that, although human rights treaty bodies and special procedures do, to some 
extent, address discrimination against women within their mandates, their attention to such 
discrimination is not systematic; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Notes</i> the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on the issue; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/L.3/Rev.1 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a thematic study on women&#8217;s equality 
before the law, including an assessment on how the issue is addressed throughout the 
United Nations human rights system, in consultation with States, relevant United Nations bodies 
and mechanisms and agencies, including the Committee on Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the agencies within the United Nations composite entity on 
gender equality and empowerment of women and all other relevant stakeholders, taking into 
account the efforts made in this regard, particularly by the Commission on the Status of Women, 
and to include recommendations on the ways and means the Council can engage with States in 
the fulfilment of their obligations and commitments to eliminate discriminatory laws against 
women; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Decides</i> to address the above-mentioned thematic study, including conclusions and 
recommendations, at its fourteenth session, and to hold a half-day discussion on the issue in 
order to consider taking further possible action on discrimination against women at that session.
