OVERVIEW OF FIRST HALF RESULTS
Iluka recorded a loss after tax for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 of $20.9 million, compared with a profit of
$20.4 million for the previous corresponding period. The key factors influencing the result included lower income
received from the Mining Area C iron ore royalty (MAC), down $18.2 million period-on-period, and higher first half
non-production cash costs associated with investment in trialling an innovative mineral sands mining technique.
Other factors influencing the result included lower USD prices (mainly zircon), lower ilmenite sales and sales mix
factors which were offset by: lower unit cost of goods sold; higher zircon, rutile and synthetic rutile (Z/R/SR)
volumes; and favourable exchange rate movements.
Iluka’s total higher value product sales of Z/R/SR represent a 14.7 per cent increase in volumes from the first half
of 2015 at 316.4 thousand tonnes (2015: 275.9 thousand tonnes). Z/R/SR revenue was $321.1 million, up 3.0 per
cent compared with the previous corresponding period (2015: $311.7 million) associated with higher sales
volumes and favourable exchange rate movements (weighted average spot rate 2016: 74.0 cents compared to
2015: 77.5 cents), although largely offset by lower received US dollar prices for zircon period-on-period and a
greater weighting in the sales mix to synthetic rutile.
Unit revenue per tonne of Z/R/SR was $1,015 (2015: $1,130). Ilmenite and other revenue was down 54.4 per
cent to $17.3 million (2015: $37.9 million) associated with lower ilmenite sales volumes reflecting the use of
internal ilmenite for upgrading to synthetic rutile and the phasing of planned ilmenite sales to the second half of
2016.
Total cash production costs, which include ilmenite concentrate and by-product costs, reduced by 19.8 per cent
from the previous corresponding period to $140.7 million (2015: $175.5 million). The reduction in cash costs of
production reflects the cessation of US mining and concentrating activities in December 2015 and the suspension
of mining and concentrating activities at Jacinth-Ambrosia in April 2016, partially offset by a full half of synthetic
rutile (SR2) kiln costs in Western Australia following the restart in March 2015.
On a unit basis, cash costs of production excluding ilmenite concentrate and by-products were $402 per tonne of
Z/R/SR (2015: $616 per tonne), a 34.7 per cent decrease compared with the previous corresponding period,
reflecting 20.8 per cent higher production of Z/R/SR combined with lower costs noted above.

Appendix 4D
30 June 2016
Restructure and idle capacity charges of $26.8 million were comparable with the previous corresponding period
(2015: $27.4 million), with the idling of the US operations in December 2015 resulting in an increase in US
restructure and idle costs (2016 H1: $14.0 million; 2015 H1: $5.5 million), which was offset by a reduction in
Australian idled costs (2016 H1 $12.8 million; 2015 H1: $21.9 million), following the restart of SR2 in the South
West. The US restructure and idle costs partly reflect the feasibility costs for re-treatment and potential recovery
of zircon in concentrate from tailings stocks.
Resource development expenditure increased $23.9 million to $47.1 million (2015: $23.2 million) mainly
influenced by the expenditure previously referred to in relation to trialling an innovative mineral sands mining
technique.
Mineral sands EBITDA for the first half of 2016 was $43.6 million, a 61.9 per cent decrease compared with the
previous corresponding period reflecting lower US dollar zircon prices together with higher resource development
expenditure, partially offset by lower unit cost of goods sold. Mineral sands EBIT decreased by $31.3 million
(101.6 per cent) to a loss of $0.5 million (2015: profit of $30.8 million).
MAC earnings decreased by 46.7 per cent to $20.8 million (2015: $39.0 million). No capacity payments were
received in 2016 (2015: $3.0 million) and the previous corresponding period included a one-off receipt of US$8.0
million (A$10.4 million) following the modification to the royalty agreement with BHP Billiton and its joint venture
partners. Royalty receipts were also lower period-on-period associated with the reduction in iron ore prices.
Group EBIT was a loss of $5.7 million, a decrease of 113.1 per cent compared to a profit of $43.5 million in the
previous corresponding period.
Loss before tax was $18.5 million (2015: profit of $27.8 million). A net tax expense of $2.4 million (2015: $7.4
million) was recorded in respect of the loss for the period with no tax benefit recognised in respect of the US
operating loss ($17.5 million) nor for international exploration expenditure.
Loss per share for the period was 5.2 cents compared to an earnings per share of 4.9 cents in the previous
corresponding period. The number of shares on issue at 30 June 2016 of 418.7 million was unchanged during
the period.
Free cash outflow of $50.6 million compared to an inflow of $39.0 million in the previous corresponding period
predominantly reflects $106.8 million lower receipts due to the timing of sales combined with lower utilisation of
the trade receivables purchase facility (refer page 10).
Capital expenditure of $28.8 million related to major project expenditure including Balranald and Cataby,
combined with an increased investment, announced on 18 February 2016, in Metalysis Limited, a UK company
developing a new technology for titanium metal powder production.
Net debt at 30 June 2016 was $124.1 million, with a corresponding gearing ratio (net debt/net debt + equity) of
8.7 per cent. This compares with net cash at 31 December 2015 of $6.0 million. Undrawn facilities at 30 June
2016 were $827.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of $53.3 million. Net debt at 31 July 2016 was $147.1
million.
Other matters
On 1 August 2016, Iluka announced to the ASX that it had made an all-cash offer to acquire the entire issued
shares of Sierra Rutile Limited (SRL), being a rutile mining operation in Sierra Leone for a cost of approximately
£215 million (A$375 million). Iluka assumes SRL’s debt of approximately US$60 million (A$80 million).
The acquisition is conditional on approval of the statutory merger by a simple majority of SRL shareholders being
obtained at a duly convened meeting.
The Merger Circular was published in August 2016 and, subject to the satisfaction of all relevant conditions, the
merger will become effective and the acquisition completed in September 2016 or before 30 November 2016 (or
such other date as agreed between Iluka and SRL). The Company will keep shareholders informed as permitted
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Iluka Resources Limited
Appendix 4D
30 June 2016
Iluka has become aware that the Sierra Leone Government has written to SRL and outlined its concerns in
relation to the timing, liability for and payment of, any capital gains tax (CGT) that may be payable in Sierra
Leone by certain shareholders of SRL in connection with the proposed merger by Iluka with SRL (Merger). Iluka
has previously received advice to the effect that Sierra Leone CGT may apply to the Merger and, to the extent
that CGT is payable, it is a liability which rests personally with the relevant SRL shareholders. At this time, it is
not possible to confirm the extent to which these Sierra Leone Government concerns in relation to any CGT that
may be payable by certain shareholders of SRL may affect SRL, the proposed timetable for the Merger or the
likelihood of the Merger proceeding. Iluka will update the market in due course as appropriate.
On 24 March 2014 Iluka became aware that a litigation funder proposed to fund claims that current or former
shareholders may have against the Company in respect of continuous disclosure obligations in 2012. The
potential applicants sought an order for pre-action discovery which was dismissed in July 2015 and which was
subsequently appealed to the Full Federal Court. The Federal Court has not yet handed down its decision.
DIVIDEND
Directors have determined a fully franked interim dividend of 3 cents per share, payable on 6 October 2016 with a
record date of 9 September 2016.

Mineral sands sales volumes
Zircon sales volume for the half-year of 154.5 thousand tonnes was similar to the previous corresponding period
sales volume of 153.4 thousand tonnes.
Sales of high grade titanium dioxide products (rutile and synthetic rutile) for the half-year were 32.2 per cent
higher than the first half of 2015 at 161.9 thousand tonnes (2015: 122.5 thousand tonnes). The first half saw
encouraging trends in terms of demand for high grade feedstock, including several customers bringing forward
contracted volume. Rutile sales volumes were in line with 2015, reflecting Iluka’s approach to allocating volumes
to maximise the net present value (NPV) of the limited material the Company has available from concentrate and
finished goods inventory, following cessation of mining at Woornack, Rownack, Pirro (WRP) in Victoria in the first
quarter of 2015. Lower ilmenite sales volumes reflect the use of internal ilmenite for upgrading to synthetic rutile
and the phasing of planned ilmenite sales to the second half of 2016.
Refer page 8 for details of the main product prices received.
Mineral sands production
Total Z/R/SR production for the half was 334.4 thousand tonnes, a 20.8 per cent increase from the previous
corresponding period (2015: 276.9 thousand tonnes).
Synthetic rutile volumes increased by 78 per cent reflecting a full half of synthetic rutile production following the
restart of the synthetic rutile SR2 kiln in March 2015. Production of rutile has been moderated in light of Iluka’s
approach to allocating volumes of this product, given the progressive draw down of rutile-rich heavy mineral
concentrate (HMC) in the Murray Basin ahead of the next planned mine development, Balranald.
Higher zircon production in the first half of 2016 compared with 2015 reflects mineral separation plant (MSP)
campaign timing which meant higher operational run rate for MSPs in the first half of 2016, compared with the
first half of 2015. Both the Hamilton and Narngulu MSPs are running at ~50 to ~60 per cent of capacity.
As announced on 16 February 2016, mining and concentrating activities at Jacinth-Ambrosia were suspended on
15 April 2016 to allow the progressive draw down of HMC stockpiles held at site. Iluka expects the period of
mining and concentrating suspension to be for 18 to 24 months from April 2016, dependent on market demand.

Commentary in respect of the income statement analysis is provided below.
Mineral sands revenue
Mineral sands sales revenue for the half-year was $338.4 million, a decrease of 3.2 per cent compared with the
previous corresponding period (2015: $349.6 million), largely associated with lower ilmenite sales.
5
Iluka Resources Limited
Appendix 4D
30 June 2016
Revenue derived from Z/R/SR sales was 3.0 per cent higher at $321.1 million based on a 14.7 per cent increase
in sales volumes offset by lower received US dollar prices for zircon period-on-period and a greater weighting in
the sales mix to the lower priced synthetic rutile. Ilmenite and by-product revenue was down 54.4 per cent to
$17.3 million given the greater use of internal ilmenite for upgrading to synthetic rutile and the phasing of planned
ilmenite sales to the second half of 2016.
Cash costs of production
Cash costs of production were down $34.8 million from the previous corresponding period to $140.7 million
(2015: $175.5 million). Cash costs of production include $6.2 million of costs in relation to ilmenite concentrate
and by-products (2015: $5.0 million). The reduction in cash costs of production is driven by a number of factors
including:
•
$31 million reduction in cash production costs in the US operations following the cessation of mining and
concentrating activities in December 2015;
the suspension of mining and concentrating activities at Jacinth-Ambrosia from 15 April 2016;
the cessation of mining and concentrating activities in the Murray Basin in March 2015 following the depletion
of the Woornack, Rownack, Pirro deposit; partially offset by
a full half of synthetic rutile operations in 2016 following the restart of SR2 in March 2015.
•
•
•
On a unit basis, cash costs of production, excluding ilmenite concentrate and by-products, were $402 per tonne
of Z/R/SR produced, a 34.7 per cent decrease compared with the previous corresponding period.
Inventory movement
Work-in-progress inventory decreased by $43.6 million to $357.6 million as HMC processed of 497 thousand
tonnes exceeded HMC production of 244 thousand tonnes. This draw down in HMC inventory is consistent with
Iluka’s reduced production settings and demand-following approach, which are likely to see HMC and finished
goods inventories return to pre-2012 levels within the next two years. Finished product inventory has decreased
by $13.3 million to $363.8 million.
Restructure and idle capacity charges
Idle capacity charges are costs incurred during periods of no or restricted production. Restructure and idle
capacity costs of $26.8 million were comparable with the previous corresponding period (2015: $27.4 million).
The costs in 2016 include the idling of US operations, the suspension of mining and concentrating activities at
Jacinth-Ambrosia and the Narngulu mineral separation plant being idled for one month in January 2016.
Rehabilitation and holding costs for closed sites
Rehabilitation and holding costs incurred in the first half of 2016 relate mainly to ongoing maintenance work at
closed sites. There were no charges arising from the reassessment of rehabilitation provisions for closed sites.
Government royalties
Government royalties were higher than the previous corresponding period reflecting an increase in the royalty
rate applied to production from the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine in South Australia after an initial period of lower royalty
rate arrangements. The Jacinth-Ambrosia mine was granted ‘new mine’ status from the State Government which
included a reduced royalty rate of 1.5 per cent for the first five years. This rate increased to 5 per cent in the first
quarter of 2015 and will remain at that level for the remainder of the mine life.
Marketing and selling costs
Marketing and selling costs were comparable with the previous corresponding period at $18.4 million (2015:
$17.2 million).
Resource development
Resource development costs were $23.9 million higher than the previous corresponding period predominantly
reflecting increased investment in trialling an innovative mineral sands mining technique. Resource development
costs also include exploration and various other research and development expenditures, with first half
expenditure higher, in line with guidance provided by the Company in its Key Physical and Financial Parameters
ASX Release of 19 February 2016.
6
Iluka Resources Limited
Appendix 4D
30 June 2016
Depreciation and amortisation
The decrease of $39.5 million compared to the previous corresponding period reflects no deprecation at WRP
following cessation of mining in the first quarter of 2015. Depreciation has recommenced on mine specific
equipment and mine reserves associated with the restart of mining operations at Tutunup South and the restart of
the SR2 kiln in Western Australia during the first half of 2015. Depreciation has been suspended for mine specific
equipment at Jacinth-Ambrosia following the suspension of mining and concentrating activities in April 2016.
Mining Area C
Iron ore sales volumes decreased 7.6 per cent to 25.4 million dry metric tonnes (DMT). The average AUD
realised price upon which the royalty is payable decreased by 10.2 per cent from the previous corresponding
period. The EBIT contribution of $20.8 million includes no annual capacity payments for production increases in
the year to 30 June (2015: $3.0 million).
Corporate and other
Corporate costs were $1.9 million higher than the previous corresponding period, associated with redundancy
costs and Managing Director transition, partially offset by lower costs associated with the evaluation of the
potential acquisition of Kenmare Resources Plc.
Foreign exchange
Net foreign exchange translation gains were $0.9 million, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million in the previous
corresponding period.
Net Interest and bank charges
Net interest and bank charges are comparable to the previous corresponding period. Net debt at 31 December
2014 was $59.0 million increasing to $80.2 million at 30 June 2015. As at 31 December 2015, Iluka had a net
cash position of $6.0 million; as at 30 June 2016 net debt was $124.1 million.
Tax expense
The income tax expense of $2.4 million on an operating loss before tax of $18.5 million reflects no tax benefit
recognised in respect of the US operating loss and international exploration expenditure, partially offset by the
benefit of research and development tax offsets.

MOVEMENT IN NPAT
Iluka Resources Limited
Appendix 4D
30 June 2016
Commentary in respect of the NPAT waterfall above is provided below:
Z/R/SR sales price (-ve $44 million)
Lower average USD sales prices, predominantly for zircon, compared to the previous corresponding period.
Average zircon prices were US$787 per tonne in 2016, a reduction of 21 per cent from the average achieved in
the first half of 2015 (2015: US$1,000/t). Zircon prices reflect the weighted average price for zircon premium,
zircon standard/universal, zircon in concentrate and zircon tailings. The prices for each product vary
considerably, as does the mix of such products sold period to period. The sales mix in the first half was
approximately 47 per cent premium product, 40 per cent standard/universal grade with the remainder of zircon
sold contained in concentrate. This reflects a higher level of standard/universal grade product than in the first half
of 2015, reflecting demand characteristics in various end sectors, as well as introduction of new zircon products.
Rutile prices averaged US$712 per tonne, 5 per cent
lower period-on-period (2015: US$748/t). Weighted
average prices are influenced by product mix with a higher proportion of the lower titanium dioxide product, HyTi,
being sold in 2016 compared to 2015. Iluka’s synthetic rutile sales are, in large part, underpinned by commercial
off-take arrangements. The terms of these arrangements, including the pricing arrangements, are commercial in
confidence and as such not disclosed by Iluka.
Z/R/SR sales volumes (+ve $12 million)
The amount reflects the impact of higher Z/R/SR sales volumes, up 14.7 per cent on the previous corresponding
period, using the average margin achieved for Z/R/SR product sales in the current period.
Z/R/SR sales mix (-ve $2 million)
Z/R/SR sales volumes for the period include a lower proportion of higher priced zircon and a higher proportion of
lower priced high grade titanium dioxide products than in the previous corresponding period.
8
Iluka Resources Limited
Appendix 4D
30 June 2016
Z/R/SR foreign exchange (+ve $18 million)
The impact of a lower weighted average spot exchange rate of 74.0 cents applicable to Z/R/SR revenue
compared with the rate in the previous corresponding period of 77.5 cents. Foreign exchange impacts on
operating costs, mainly those relating to the US operations, are included in the overall movement in unit cost of
sales. The variance also includes a foreign exchange translation gain of $0.9 million as opposed to a translation
loss of $2.7 million in 2015.
Ilmenite and other revenue (-ve $22 million)
Decreased volume of ilmenite sales and lower average realised prices as a result of changes in the ilmenite
product mix.
Z/R/SR unit cost of sales (+ve $38 million)
Lower unit cost of sales for Z/R/SR sold during the period reflects reducing unit cash costs of production
combined with a change in sales mix to include lower cost material.
Restructure and idle capacity (+ve $1 million)
The composition of these costs has changed with an increase in US idle costs following the cessation of mining
and concentrating in December 2015 offset by a reduction in Western Australia following the recommencement of
both mining and synthetic rutile production in March 2015.
Mineral sands other costs (-ve $29 million)
The higher costs were due mainly to increased expenditure trialling innovative mineral sands mining techniques.
MAC (-ve $18 million)
Underlying iron ore royalties decreased compared to the previous corresponding period due to a 7.6 per cent
decrease in sales volumes, combined with a 10.2 per cent decrease in realised AUD iron ore prices. No MAC
annual capacity payments were received in 2016 (2015: $3.0 million). Royalty and capacity payments are
payable on dry metric tonnes. The previous corresponding period also included a one-off receipt of US$8.0
million (A$10.4 million) as referenced previously.
Corporate costs (-ve $2 million)
The higher corporate costs were due to increased costs related to redundancy costs and Managing Director
transition, partially offset by lower costs associated with the evaluation of the potential acquisition of Kenmare
Resources Plc.
Metalysis associate (-ve $1 million)
Iluka’s increased investment in Metalysis on 18 February 2016 has resulted in Iluka equity accounting from this
date. Iluka has recognised its share of Metalysis losses for the period of $1.4 million.
Interest ($nil)
Interest costs are in line with the previous corresponding period.
Rehabilitation unwind and other finance charges (+ve $3 million)
The reduction in rehabilitation unwind costs from the previous corresponding period reflects the reduction in the
risk free discount rate used in the calculation of the net present value of the rehabilitation provisions from 4.7 per
cent in the first half of 2015 to 3.0 per cent in the first half of 2016.
Tax (+ve $5 million)
The variance reflects a decreased tax expense as a result of lower earnings and the benefit of higher research
and development tax offsets compared to the previous corresponding period.

Receivables have increased $69.8 million from 31 December 2015 influenced by both the timing of sales late in
the period, the reduced use of the trade receivables purchase facility and amendments to customers' credit terms
(as detailed in Note 7). Iluka has access to a trade receivables purchase facility which enabled the earlier
collection of $45.1 million of receivables at 30 June 2016 (31 December 2015: $75.0 million).
Inventories decreased by $56.6 million to $755.2 million. Lower inventories reflect the drawdown of $43.6 million
in work in progress product (HMC) to $357.6 million (December 2015: $401.2 million) and a $13.3 million
decrease in finished product stocks to $363.8 million. During the half, Iluka produced 244 thousand tonnes of
HMC and processed 497 thousand tonnes. The draw down in HMC inventory is consistent with Iluka’s production
settings and demand-following approach, which are likely to see HMC and finished goods inventories reduce
materially within the next two years. Inventories include $312.6 million of predominantly HMC material classified
as non-current (2015: $317.9 million) and also $33.8 million of consumable stores (December 2015: $33.6
million).
Lower property, plant and equipment values reflect mainly the depreciation charge for the period of $44.1 million
being higher than capital expenditure of $16.7 million.
During the period Iluka further increased its equity stake in Metalysis Limited to 26.0 per cent with a $12.1 million
investment in February 2016. Metalysis Limited is a private UK based entity that is developing a new technology
for titanium metal powder production. The investment has resulted in Metalysis becoming an associate and Iluka
has commenced equity accounting from 18 February 2016. During the period, Iluka’s share of the Metalysis
earnings was a loss of $1.4 million and Iluka expects Metalysis to report losses during the development phase of
the technology. As announced to the ASX on 18 February 2016, Iluka committed a further £4 million (A$6.9
million) investment which was made on 13 July 2016.
Net debt increased from December 2015 by $130.1 million due to free cash outflow for the period of $50.6 million
and the payment of $79.5 million in respect of the 19 cent final dividend for 2015 in April 2016. Undrawn facilities
at 30 June 2016 were $827.6 million (December 2015: $955.1 million) and cash and cash equivalents were $53.3
million (December 2015: $55.0 million).

During the period, operating cash flow was an outflow of $15.5 million compared to an inflow of $92.1 million in
the previous corresponding period reflecting the timing of cash collections with receipts from customers down
$106.8 million due to an increase of $102.9 million in trade receivables from 30 June 2015.
MAC royalty cash flows in the first half of 2016 were lower than the previous corresponding period reflecting
lower iron ore prices and sales volumes.
Iluka continued monthly tax instalments in Australia during the period. Iluka’s tax expense in the period was $2.4
million in comparison to net tax payments of $10.3 million, reflecting final Australian tax payments for the prior
period and US tax refunds received.
Capital expenditure of $16.7 million in the half-year related to major projects,
including Cataby (Western
Australia) and Balranald (New South Wales). In addition, Iluka increased its equity interest in Metalysis Limited
for a cost of $12.1 million in the period taking the equity holding to 26.0 per cent.
A 2015 final dividend of 19 cents per share was paid in April 2016. The prior period cash flows included a 13
cents per share 2014 final dividend, paid in March 2015 and a 6 cents per share 2015 interim dividend, paid in
October 2015.
The exchange revaluation of USD net debt in the period predominantly reflects the re-translation of US dollar
denominated debt from an exchange rate of 72.8 cents at 31 December 2015 to 74.5 cents at 30 June 2016.

* Calculated as cash costs of production, including by-product costs divided by Z/R/SR production.
Total Z/R/SR production increased 28.6 per cent from the previous corresponding period reflecting a full half of
synthetic rutile production, following the restart of SR2 kiln in Western Australia in March 2015.
Mineral sands revenue is marginally lower than the previous corresponding period at $329.4 million (2015:
$335.3 million). The reduction predominantly reflects lower average received US dollar prices for zircon
period-on-period, partially offset by higher sales volumes, especially for synthetic rutile with 104.5 thousand
tonnes in 2016 compared to 63.4 thousand tonnes in the previous corresponding period.
Cash costs of production were $3.8 million lower than the previous corresponding period. The change reflects a
combination of factors including lower mining and concentrating costs due to the cessation of mining operations
at WRP in the Murray Basin in March 2015;
the suspension of mining and concentrating activities at
Jacinth-Ambrosia in April 2016; partially offset by the re-start of mining at Tutunup South in Western Australia
and increased synthetic rutile costs on reactivation of SR2 kiln in March 2015, with 2016 reflecting a full half of
costs.
Unit cash costs of production per tonne Z/R/SR declined due to the increase in production and lower cash
production costs associated with the reduction in mining and concentrating activities.
The inventory movement reflects a draw down of both HMC and finished goods stocks.
Restructure and idle capacity charges have decreased from the previous corresponding period due to the restart
of mining and synthetic rutile operations in Western Australia in March 2015 no longer incurring idle capacity
charges in 2016, partially offset by charges associated with the suspension of mining and concentrating at
Jacinth-Ambrosia in April 2016.
The reduction in depreciation charges reflects no deprecation at WRP following cessation of mining in the first
quarter of 2015 and the suspension of depreciation for mining and concentrating equipment at Jacinth-Ambrosia
associated with idling of mining and concentrating activities in April 2016. This is partially offset by a full half of
depreciation on mine specific equipment and mine reserves associated with the restart of mining operations at
Tutunup South and the restart of the SR2 kiln in March 2015.

* Calculated as cash costs of production, including by-product costs divided by zircon and ilmenite production.
Zircon and ilmenite production ceased in December 2015 following the completion of mining at Brink and
Concord deposits in the US.
Lower sales revenue was largely due to decreased sales volumes.
Cash costs of production largely reflect activities associated with finished goods transport as all mining and
concentrating activities ceased in December 2015.
The inventory movement reflects the draw down in finished goods through sales and write-downs of certain
inventory lines to their net realisable value.
Restructure and idle capacity charges reflect regional management, administration and holding costs, regional
asset care and maintenance costs plus feasibility costs associated with planned re-treatment and recovery of
zircon in concentrate from tailings stocks pre rehabilitation.

Iluka Resources Limited
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
1 Basis of Preparation
This general purpose financial report for the interim half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2016 has been
prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations
Act 2001.
This interim financial report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial
report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December
2015 and any public announcements made by Iluka Resources Limited during the interim reporting period in
accordance with the continuous disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.
Where applicable, certain comparatives have been adjusted to conform with current year presentation.
The same accounting policies and methods of computation have been applied by each entity in the consolidated
Group and are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the most recent annual financial report.
(a) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future in applying its accounting policies. The
resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period
in which the estimates are revised and future periods affected.
(i)
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy non-current assets are assessed for impairment when there is
an indication that
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount of each Cash
Generating Unit (CGU) is determined as the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal estimated
on the basis of discounted present value of the future cash flows (a level 3 fair value estimation method).
The estimates of future cash flows for each CGU are based on significant assumptions including:
•
Impairment of assets
•
•
•
estimates of the quantities of mineral reserves and ore resources for which there is a high degree of
confidence of economic extraction and the timing of access to these reserves and ore resources;
future production levels and the ability to sell that production;
future product prices based on the Group’s assessment of short and long term prices for each of the key
products;
future exchange rates for the Australian dollar compared to the US dollar using external
recognised economic forecasters;
successful development and operation of new mines in Australia, consistent with latest forecasts;
future cash costs of production, sustaining capital expenditure, rehabilitation and mine closure; and
the asset specific discount rate applicable to the CGU.
•
•
•
Given the nature of the Group’s mining activities, future changes in assumptions upon which these estimates are
based may give rise to material adjustments to the current or prior years. This could lead to a reversal of part, or
all, of impairment charges recorded in the current or prior years, or the recognition of new impairment charges in
the future.
(ii) Rehabilitation and mine closure provisions
These provisions represent the discounted value of the present obligation to restore, dismantle and rehabilitate
certain items of property, plant and equipment. The discounted value reflects a combination of management’s
assessment of the nature and extent of the work required, the future cost of performing the work required, the
timing of the cash flows and the discount rate. Changes to one or more of these assumptions is likely to result in
a change to the carrying value of the provision and the related asset or a charge to profit or loss in accordance
with the Group's accounting policy.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
1 Basis of Preparation (continued)
The total rehabilitation and mine closure provision of $459.1 million (31 December 2015: $487.0 million) includes
$343.9 million (31 December 2015: $373.4 million) for assets no longer in use or for obligations arising from
production process outputs. Changes to the provisions for assets or operations no longer in use are charged to
profit or loss and are reported within rehabilitation and holding costs for closed sites in note 5.
(iii) Net realisable value and classification of inventory
The Group’s assessment of the net realisable value and classification of its inventory holdings requires the use of
estimates, including the estimation of the relevant future product price and the likely timing of the sale of the
inventory.
Total inventory at 30 June 2016 was $755.2 million (31 December 2015: $811.8 million). Inventory of $312.6
million (31 December 2015: $317.9 million) was classified as non-current as it is not expected to be sold within 12
months of the balance sheet date.
2 Segment information
(a) Description of segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
Managing Director. Cash, debt and tax balances are managed at a Group level and, together with resource
development and other corporate activities, are not allocated to segments. The segments are unchanged from
those reported at 31 December 2015.
Australia (AUS) comprises the integrated mineral sands mining and processing operations in Victoria, Western
Australia and South Australia. Material
is mined from various deposits in the South West and Mid West of
Western Australia (Perth Basin), together with the Jacinth-Ambrosia deposit in South Australia (Eucla Basin) and
several deposits in Victoria (Murray Basin). The mined material is processed predominantly at Mineral Separation
Plants in Western Australia and the Murray Basin to produce saleable products. The processing activities in
Western Australia also include the Group’s synthetic rutile kilns.
Mining and processing activities in the South West of Western Australia, mining activities in the Mid West of
Western Australia and the Group's synthetic rutile operations were idled during 2013. Mining and processing
activities combined with synthetic rutile operations in the South West of Western Australia were re-started during
the first half of 2015. Mining and concentrating activities were completed at the Woornack, Rownack, Pirro
deposit in Murray Basin in March 2015. Mining of new deposits in Murray Basin are yet to restart. Mining and
concentrating activities at Jacinth-Ambrosia were suspended in April 2016 for a period of 18 to 24 months.
United States (US) comprises the integrated mineral sands mining and processing operations in Virginia and
rehabilitation obligations in Florida. Mining and processing activities were idled in Virginia in December 2015.
Mining Area C (MAC) comprises a deferred consideration iron ore royalty interest over certain mining tenements
in Australia operated by BHP Billiton Iron Ore.
Where finished product capable of sale to a third party is transferred between operating segments, the transfers
are made at arm's length prices. Any transfers of intermediate products between operating segments are made at
cost. During the first half of 2016, no finished product was transferred from the US to Australia (2015: Nil).

Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 45 days of the invoice being issued.
(a) Trade receivables purchase facilities
Iluka has a trade receivables purchase facility (31 December 2015: two facilities) for the sale of eligible trade
receivables. Under the agreement Iluka transfers the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership, including
both the credit risk (subject to a maximum loss) and late payment risk.
25
Iluka Resources Limited
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
(a) Trade receivables purchase facilities (continued)
Iluka maintains an insurance policy to assist in managing the credit risk of its customers. The credit insurance
policy is a separate instrument to the receivables and reduces the exposure to credit risk. The trade receivables
balance of $147.0 million excludes $45.1 million (31 December 2015: excludes $75.0 million) of receivables sold
under the trade receivables purchase facility. Iluka has assigned a portion of the insurance policy to the supplier
of the trade receivables purchase facility but retains credit risk up to a maximum loss of $7.9 million (31
December 2015: $3.3 million). An asset for the loss amount has been recognised within other receivables offset
by a corresponding continuing involvement liability for the same amount in other payables.
(b) Credit risk
Of the total trade receivables balance of $147.0 million, $95.9 million is covered by an insurance policy and $21.5
million by letters of credit.
The Group has a total uninsured exposure of $29.6 million as at 30 June 2016 (31 December 2015: $nil). The
uninsured exposure is due to sales made in excess of some customers’ individual credit insurance limit set within
Iluka’s trade credit insurance policy. This has arisen due to amendments in the customer’s shipping schedule and
credit terms. This exposure has reduced to $10.8 million at the date of signing this report.
8 Investments in associates
The Company's increased investment in Metalysis Limited on 18 February 2016 has resulted in Iluka equity

12 Events occurring after the reporting period
On 1 August 2016, Iluka announced to the ASX that it had made an all-cash offer to acquire the entire issued
shares of Sierra Rutile Limited, being a rutile mining operation in Sierra Leone for a cost of approximately £215
million (A$375 million). Iluka assumes SRL’s debt of approximately US$60 million (A$80 million).
The acquisition is conditional on approval of the statutory merger by a simple majority of SRL shareholders being
obtained at a duly convened meeting.
The Merger Circular was published in August 2016 and, subject to the satisfaction of all relevant conditions, the
merger will become effective and the acquisition completed in September 2016 or before 30 November 2016 (or
such other date as agreed between Iluka and SRL). The Company will keep shareholders informed as permitted
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Iluka has become aware that the Sierra Leone Government has written to SRL and outlined its concerns in
relation to the timing, liability for and payment of, any capital gains tax (CGT) that may be payable in Sierra
Leone by certain shareholders of SRL in connection with the proposed merger by Iluka with SRL (Merger). Iluka
has previously received advice to the effect that Sierra Leone CGT may apply to the Merger and, to the extent
that CGT is payable, it is a liability which rests personally with the relevant SRL shareholders. At this time, it is
not possible to confirm the extent to which these Sierra Leone Government concerns in relation to any CGT that
may be payable by certain shareholders of SRL may affect SRL, the proposed timetable for the Merger or the
likelihood of the Merger proceeding. Iluka will update the market in due course as appropriate.

Report on the Half-Year Financial Report

We have reviewed the accompanying half-year ﬁnancial report of Iluka Resources Limited (the
company), which comprises the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated
statement of proﬁt or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity
and consolidated statement of cash ﬂows for the half-year ended on that date, selected explanatory notes
and the directors' declaration for the Iluka Resources Limited Group (the consolidated entity), The
consolidated entity comprises the company and the entities it controlled during that half-years
Directors’ responsibility for the half-year ﬁnancial report

The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year ﬁnancial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year ﬁnancial report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error,
Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half»year ﬁnancial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Australian Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE
2410 Review of a Financial Report Perfumed by the IndependentAuditar of the Entity, in order to
state whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes
us believe that the half-year ﬁnancial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001
including giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entitys ﬁnancial position as at 30 June 2016 and
its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Iluka Resources
Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the
annual ﬁnancial report

A review of a half-year ﬁnancial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
ﬁnancial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all signiﬁcant
matters that might be identiﬁed in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001.
