C.      
THE LAW AND ANALYSIS

15.     
The Plaintiff has mad e this application for leave to amend their statement of claim in terms of Order 20 rule 5(1) of the Hough Court Rules of 1988. It states as follows:

"Subject to Order 15, rules 6, 8 and 9 and the following provisions of this rule, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow the Plaintiff to amend his writ, or any party to amend his pleading on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct."

16.     
In the case of G.L. Baker Ltd- v- Medway Building & Supplies Ltd (1958) 1W.L.R. 121per Jenkins L.J. held that is a guiding principle of cardinal importance on the question of amend that generally speaking, all such amendments ought to be made" for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedings or of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings"

17.     
In this action the Plaintiff has discontinued the claim against 2nd Defendant after the revelations in pre trial conference and it is obvious that the claim should be amended accordingly. The amended statement of claim is filed.

18.     
It is noted that in the case of Clarapede v Commercial Union Association (1883) 32 W.R 262 where per Brett MR has reasoned that "However negligent or careless may have been the first omission, and however late the proposed amendment, the amendment should be allowed if it can be compensated by costs. There is not injustice if the other side can be compensated by costs"

19.     
In the circumstances the amendment should be allowed. Any delay can be compensated by cost. The 1st Defendant seeks indemnity cost. But considering the circumstances I do not think that this is a proper instance to grant indemnity cost. So I assess the cost summarily at $1,000.00. The cost to be paid to the Defendant within 14 days.
