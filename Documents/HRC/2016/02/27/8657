<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Armenia was held at the 8th meeting, on 6 May 2010. The delegation was 
headed by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arman Kirakossian. At its 12th 
meeting, held on 10 May 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on Armenia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Armenia: Slovakia, France and Bahrain.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Armenia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/ARM/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/ARM/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/ARM/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, Azerbaijan, the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, 
Switzerland and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to 
Armenia through the troika. Those questions and written answers provided by Armenia are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5.  In his introductory statement, the head of delegation indicated that the national 
report had been discussed in a round table with non-governmental organizations. Armenia 
had completed its reporting obligations towards United Nations treaty bodies, submitting all 
overdue reports at the end of 2009 and early in 2010, in the form of joint periodic reports. 
Since becoming a member of the United Nations in 1992, Armenia has actively cooperated 
with various United Nations bodies and agencies with the purpose of protecting and 
promoting human rights. In April 2006, Armenia extended a standing invitation to all 
special procedures.  
</p>
<p>6. Armenia has acceded to more than 50 human rights international treaties and has 
signed the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance, and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which are currently in various stages of the 
ratification process.  
</p>
<p>7. The law on human rights defenders was adopted in 2003. In addition, the 
Ombudsman is recognized as the national preventive mechanism, pursuant to OPCAT. The 
amendment of the Constitution on 27 November 2005 had introduced substantial 
improvements in, inter alia, the provisions concerning fundamental rights and freedoms, </p>


<p>thus making them more compliant with the requirements of international human rights 
covenants.  
</p>
<p>8. Efforts aimed at recognition of the Armenian genocide by the international 
community, not only to establish the supremacy of international law and justice, but also to 
prevent the recurrence of such crimes in the future by ruling out impunity, had been 
pursued by Armenia. In that regard, it had been active in the United Nations, initiating 
resolutions on the prevention of the crime of genocide. Most recently, in March 2008, the 
Human Rights Council had unanimously adopted the resolution entitled &#8220;Prevention of 
Genocide,&#8221; submitted by Armenia and co-sponsored by 62 countries.  
</p>
<p>9. Armenia regards the right of peoples to self-determination as a fundamental and 
indispensable human right and takes consistent steps towards its realization. Armenia is 
guided by the fact that the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination is currently 
a binding and universally recognized fundamental norm of international and national law 
for all States, without exception. Armenia is firmly committed to the exercise of the right of 
the people of Nagorny Karabakh to self-determination and assists, also as a result of its 
international obligations, in promoting all the fundamental rights of the people of Nagorny 
Karabakh in every possible way. The policy of economic blockade against Armenia and 
Nagorny Karabakh is a serious impediment to the full exercise of the right to development 
and many other rights, including, first and foremost, political, civil and socio-economic 
rights. 
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution provides for the right to life and also sets out the right to non-
conviction to or no exercise of the death penalty. In 2003, Armenia ratified Protocol No. 6, 
on the Elimination of the Death Penalty, to the Council of Europe Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and has signed Protocol No. 13. 
The death penalty has been removed from the new Criminal Code. Since its independence, 
Armenia has not carried out the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>11. Extensive legislative and institutional efforts have been made to eliminate torture 
and other cruel and degrading treatment or punishment. Armenia has ratified all United 
Nations and Council of Europe treaties related to the issue. The implemented legislative 
reforms have created substantial preconditions for the establishment of a system for 
independent monitoring of the places of custody. Despite the provisions set forth through 
legislative reforms, there are still issues requiring attention and additional improvement at 
the implementation level.  
</p>
<p>12. Freedom of thought, conscience and religion is enshrined in the Constitution. The 
law on &#8220;freedom of conscience and religious organizations&#8221; is the main law regulating the 
activities of religious organizations. The law on &#8220;alternative service&#8221; was adopted in 2003. 
During the years following its independence, Armenia took serious steps to ensure religious 
diversity in the country, and in 2009 there were 66 registered religious organizations.  
</p>
<p>13. The Constitution guarantees everyone&#8217;s right to freedom of expression. Freedom of 
the mass media and other means of mass information is also guaranteed. The Constitution 
guarantees the right to freedom of peaceful and unarmed assembly. Specific procedures for 
the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly are established in the law on &#8220;meetings, 
assemblies, rallies and demonstrations&#8221; (2004).  
</p>
<p>14. Ensuring increased access to and affordability of health-care services and continuous 
improvement in the quality of health-care services remain priorities of State policy. The 
right to education is fully guaranteed in Armenia for everyone, irrespective of ethnicity, 
race, sex, language, religion and political or other views. Basic general education is 
compulsory, and secondary education at State educational institutions is free of charge. 
There is an opportunity for free education at technical and vocational secondary educational 
institutions, as well as at higher levels.  </p>


<p>15. In 2010 and 2011, Armenia will chair the United Nations Commission on the Status 
of Women. In February 2010, the Government approved the gender policy concept of 
Armenia, which was drafted with the direct participation of non-governmental 
organizations. The draft law on &#8220;ensuring equal rights and equal opportunities for men and 
women&#8221; is in the process of being formulated.   
</p>
<p>16. Combating the trafficking in human beings is recognized as one of the priorities of 
the Government of Armenia. In 2008, a national referral procedure for persons subjected to 
human trafficking was adopted. Currently, the formulation of the third national programme 
on combating human trafficking, for 2010-2012, is under way. In Armenia, non-
governmental organizations play an invaluable role in combating the trafficking in human 
beings by, inter alia, providing support for the victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>17. Provisions condemning violence against women are included in the Criminal Code 
and the Family Code of Armenia. A draft law on domestic violence has been formulated  
and is currently being finalized for submission to the National Assembly. In March 2010, 
by the decision of the Prime Minister, an Inter-agency Commission on Combating Gender 
Violence was established.  
</p>
<p>18. Armenia has ratified the most important international instruments relating to 
children&#8217;s rights. A major legislative body exists in Armenia for the provision and 
protection of children&#8217;s rights. In 2003, the 2004-2015 National Plan on the Protection of 
the Rights of the Child was approved. In 2006, a three-tiered system was introduced at the 
national, regional and community levels with a view to ensuring the uniform and 
coordinated protection of the rights and interests of children.   
</p>
<p>19. A relevant legislative framework has been established in Armenia for ensuring all 
the rights and freedoms of the minorities living in its territory. Armenia actively cooperates 
with the Council of Europe on issues related to national minorities. The establishment of 
the Coordinating Council for National Minorities was an important step aimed at ensuring 
the protection of the national minorities, promoting their inter-community relations and 
improving the effectiveness of State efforts related to specific educational, cultural, legal 
and other issues.   
</p>
<p>20. The Armenian authorities also attach great importance to combating all forms of 
racial discrimination at both the national and international levels. Armenian legal reforms 
and practical measures are guided by the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. In 
recent years, incitement to hatred towards Armenians and Armenia, as well as apparent war 
propaganda by Azerbaijan, has become a source of major concern. Manifestations of 
intolerance and the dissemination of xenophobia towards Armenians not only are gross 
violations of human rights, but also raise concerns with regard to ensuring peace, security 
and stability in the region. A number of well-known independent monitoring bodies 
expressed their deep concern about such behaviour. Armenia has repeatedly called upon the 
international community, particularly the Human Rights Council, to take measures aimed at 
halting and preventing such manifestations.  
</p>
<p>21. Armenia has taken all possible measures to ensure the protection of the human rights 
of persons seeking asylum and recognized as refugees in Armenia. Despite the efforts made 
for years to resolve the problems of more than 400,000 refugees exiled from Azerbaijan, 
Armenia has yet to fully resolve their housing problem. Continuous assistance from the 
international community would be indispensable in that regard.    
</p>
<p>22. Armenia will continue to cooperate with all international bodies and special 
procedures at both the regional and international levels, while also expanding its 
cooperation with the Human Rights Council, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General for the Prevention of 
Genocide.  </p>


<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>23. During the interactive dialogue, 47 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations expressed appreciation for Armenia&#8217;s national report and for the comprehensive 
presentation made by the delegation. A number of delegations also thanked Armenia for the 
written answers to their advance questions. Recommendations made during the dialogue are 
found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>24. Azerbaijan inquired about measures to investigate the violations following the 
presidential elections and attacks against human rights defenders. Azerbaijan noted that the 
national report reflects incorrect remarks and referred to the letter of the President of the 
Council quoting that &#8220;The Human Rights Council, as a subsidiary body of the General 
Assembly, shall adhere to the official United Nations position as reflected in relevant 
General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. The Council therefore respects the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally recognized 
borders&#8221;. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Lebanon made reference to the brotherly relations that link Lebanese people to 
Armenian people. Lebanon noted that Armenia had acceded to more than 50 human rights 
treaties, cooperated closely with human rights bodies and included human rights principles 
in the Constitution and in laws. The delegation commended Armenia on efforts made to 
protect freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as opinion and expression; to 
improve access education and health; and to promote the rights of women and children. 
Lebanon made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>26. Egypt commended the great attention paid to human rights education as well as the 
activities undertaken by the National Commission for the Protection of Children. It 
welcomed the adoption of the Concept Paper on Gender Equality for 2010-2014 and 
considered very important the development of a national referral mechanism for victims of 
trafficking.  Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Algeria welcomed progress made in the field of health care and highlighted the 
significant reduction in child mortality rates in 2009. It also welcomed efforts aimed at, 
inter alia, combating poverty and ensuring decent living conditions for the population. It 
asked about the national human rights programme as well as programmes for combating the 
trafficking in persons. It made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>28. The Russian Federation stated that Armenia shared many centuries of close ties with 
it and commended progress achieved in implementing international commitments in the 
sphere of human rights, including accession to international human rights instruments, 
reforms of national legislation and the judicial and law enforcement systems, and work 
carried out to improve living standards and the quality of life. The Russian Federation made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>29. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya asked whether there was a specific strategy concerning 
family allocations, pensions and improving care for persons with disabilities. It also asked 
how children were cared for, other than in orphanages or through foster care. Recalling that 
the national report indicated that primary education was compulsory except under certain 
circumstances provided for by law, the delegation asked what those circumstances were. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. The Holy See asked about Armenia&#8217;s experiences with the Human Rights Defender.    
It congratulated the country on a considerable reduction in infant mortality and noted 
improvements with regard to street children. It expressed concern about the high maternal 
mortality rate and asked about initiatives to combat human trafficking.  The Holy See made 
recommendations.  </p>


<p>31. Cuba highlighted the priority placed on improving access to sanitation and quality 
health care and the resulting increases in the annual number of visits to outpatient clinics. It 
added that other indicators, such as child mortality, had also improved and that the primary 
school enrolment and literacy rates were both high. Cuba made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>32. Turkey underlined that the Convention on Genocide clearly defines the act of 
genocide in legal terms, stating that this concept should only be utilized in its legal context. 
Otherwise, there was a risk of striking a blow at the supremacy of law, undermining the 
integrity of the Convention. On Nagorny Karabakh conflict, Turkey supported a peaceful 
resolution through negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan under the Minsk Group&#8217;s 
auspices.  Turkey stressed that attaining peaceful resolution of the conflict and ending 
occupation of Azerbaijani territories are essential requirements for setting the human rights 
record of Armenia straight. Turkey made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>33. India stressed Armenia&#8217;s reforms in the health and education sectors and noted the 
measures taken to achieve gender equality. It appreciated the importance attached to the 
rights of national minorities and requested clarification as to whether the Human Rights 
Defender had a role and responsibilities like those of a national human rights institution.  
India did not make recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Spain expressed satisfaction at the possibility that Armenia might soon ratify, inter 
alia, the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
the Convention for the Protection for All Persons from Forced Disappearance. Spain 
congratulated Armenia on the decision to extend an open invitation to all special procedures 
and welcomed the abolition of the death penalty. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. The United States of America noted steps taken to improve Armenia&#8217;s human rights 
record.  While praising the June 2009 amnesty, which had resulted in the release of 30 
individuals detained for political reasons, it expressed concern about a number of others 
still being detained. It looked forward to seeing independent media and welcomed the 
decriminalization of libel.  The United States made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>36. Indonesia commended Armenia for the national plan for improving the situation of 
women and the draft law ensuring equal rights and opportunities for men and women. 
However, it noted enduring patriarchal attitudes, discrimination and stereotypes concerning 
women&#8217;s role in society, and asked Armenia what measures had been taken to address that 
issue. It made a recommendation.

praised Armenia's outstanding records in the areas of health care and social welfare. It 
noted measures for women, children and persons with disabilities. It asked about measures 
taken to improve the situation of 3,500 to 4,000 refugee families lacking permanent shelter.  
China made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>38. Mexico noted with appreciation Armenia&#8217;s commitment to international human 
rights instruments, as reflected by its ratification of international treaties and its cooperation 
with the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>

Millennium Development Goals. It took note of amendments to the Labor Code that, inter 
alia, guaranteed equal rights and prohibited forced labour. It also noted the adoption of a 
series of national plans and programmes to combat human trafficking, poverty and 
HIV/AIDS. Iran made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Slovenia welcomed Armenia&#8217;s ratification of the Optional Protocol to CAT. 
However, it expressed concern about the designation of the National Preventive 
Mechanism, which had been carried out against the recommendations of local civil society </p>


<p>and international experts. It was also concerned at the reports of torture and ill treatment in 
prison facilities and police stations. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Ireland welcomed efforts to drop some of the most restrictive amendments to the law 
on meetings, rallies and demonstrations. It expressed concern at the fact that some 
legislative provisions placing restrictions on freedom of assembly remained. Ireland also 
noted a lack of comprehensive legal provisions prohibiting discrimination against women. 
It welcomed the strengthening of the judiciary and domestic legislation prohibiting torture, 
but expressed concern about allegations of physical and psychological pressure exerted by 
police during arrests and interrogations. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. The Netherlands commended Armenia for being a party to the majority of the core 
human rights instruments and for having extended a standing invitation to United Nations

limited. Austria asked about measures to address the situation of internally displaced 
persons. It made recommendations.

recommendations.   
</p>
<p>56. Cyprus was pleased to note that Armenia had signed the Rome Statute of the ICC

educational and cultural life of the country. Cyprus made recommendations.

well as their contribution to the creation of equal opportunity for men and women. Kuwait 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>66. Switzerland welcomed the integration of human rights education into school 
curriculums. It added that, since the arrest and ill treatment of opposition members 
following the 2008 elections, the actions of the opposition appeared to have been

reportedly widespread. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>

investigative service had conducted an inquiry into the excessive use of force against 
civilians and that two criminal cases had been brought against four police officers in 
connection with the 2008 March events on the basis of video materials obtained from 
independent expert groups and the ad-hoc parliamentary commission, as well as video 
materials received from private individuals. The police officers had been found guilty by 
the court and sentenced accordingly. 
</p>
<p>72. Concerning the allegations of the incommunicado detention of persons arrested by 
the police, Armenia clarified that there had been no such cases. 
</p>
<p>73. Five criminal cases were investigated on alleged police beatings and ill or cruel 
treatment. Proper investigations had been undertaken and none of the alleged facts of ill-
treatment were proven. Moreover, all complaints and witness testimonies had been 
withdrawn.  
</p>
<p>74. Those detained in connection with the March 2008 events were not being detained 
for political reasons, but rather for specific offences, including the illegal storage of 
weapons and ammunition. Several of the individuals claiming that they had been detained 
for political reasons, had been convicted before the March 2008 events for crimes such as 
involvement in prostitution, illegal procurement of weapons and high treason. 
</p>
<p>75. The independence of judges was guaranteed by the Constitution of Armenia and 
provided for by legislation. Guarantees for the functioning of judges and members of the 
Constitutional Court, as well as grounds and procedures for holding them liable, were 
defined in the Constitution and in law. 
</p>
<p>76. Judges and members of the Constitutional Court may not be detained or involved in 
cases as defendants, and no legal proceedings on imposing administrative liability on them 
may be instituted, without the consent of the Council of Justice or the Constitutional Court, 
respectively. Judges and members of the Constitutional Court may not be arrested, except 
in cases in which the arrest had been made during or immediately after the commission of 
the criminal offence. In such cases, the President of the Republic of Armenia, as well as the 
President of the Court of Cassation or the President of the Constitutional Court, 
respectively, shall be promptly informed of the arrest. 
</p>
<p>77. Self-governance of the judiciary shall be implemented through self-government 
bodies established by the Judicial Code of Armenia, which was aimed at regulating all  
factors guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary, including the appointment and 
retirement of judges. The Council of Justice was entrusted with disciplinary responsibility 
with regard to judges and other important issues.  
</p>
<p>78. The training of judges was an ongoing process carried out in cooperation with 
various international organizations, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, 
the European Union and OSCE. Ongoing training was provided for them regarding juvenile 
justice, the European Convention on Human Rights and other important legal issues, with a 
view to enhancing their professional capacities.   </p>


<p>79. The Criminal Code needed to be amended to include the definition of torture, in 
accordance with international treaties. The amendment process was underway.    
</p>
<p>80. Significant work had been undertaken in the area of gender discrimination in the 
recent past. There was no differentiation with respect to gender in the application of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in Armenia. In that regard, Armenia referred to 
constitutional provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, as well as to legal 
acts, including the Criminal Code. A draft law had been formulated on equal rights and 
equal opportunities for men and women, which prohibited all forms of discrimination.  
Furthermore, the draft law contained a definition of gender-based discrimination and all 
other legal terms stipulated in different international agreements. 
</p>
<p>81. Concerning the monitoring of penitentiary institutions, public monitoring groups 
carrying out the monitoring of penitentiary establishments under the supervision of the 
Ministry of Justice, and of holding facilities under the police, had been functioning.  The 
groups were composed of representatives of non-governmental organizations authorized to 
have unimpeded access to police holding facilities and penitentiary institutions. 
</p>
<p>82. The police were taking measures to implement the recommendations of the 
parliamentary inquiry into the March 2008 events. A decree had been adopted on the use of 
special measures by the police and the police forces in 2009. Several measures had been 
included in the police reform programme adopted in 2010 in an effort to establish a 
legislative basis for ensuring public order and safety. It included training for police officers 
on the use of physical force and special measures for cases of unrest, as well as on work 
with journalists.  In 2008 and 2009, Armenia had organized seminars and workshops 
involving the mass media and police under an initiative of the Council of Europe. In 
addition, special instructions governing the relationship between police and journalists had 
been developed.  
</p>
<p>83. Armenia had taken measures to ensure training for police officers concerning public 
demonstrations and the use of police equipment. Internal investigations into the allegations 
of physical abuse and/or psychological pressure by police had been conducted. 
Accordingly, in 2008, 16 police officers had been disciplined for the ill treatment of 
detainees, and some of them had been dismissed from the police force. Awareness-raising 
campaigns, including hotlines, had been conducted with a view to improved 
communication between the general population and the police.  
</p>
<p>84. In order to ensure equal opportunities for persons with disabilities, Armenia was 
implementing a programme of inclusive education and training. There were also State 
employment compensation programmes for those who were uncompetitive in the labour 
market. In addition, the State provided support and subsidies to those registered as persons 
with disabilities who wished to set up their own enterprises. Armenia would soon establish 
special training centres for persons with disabilities. The Government initiated amendments 
in the employment legislation foreseeing work practice for those unemployed and persons 
with disabilities that had professional but no service record. It was also looking into 
improving working conditions as well as incentives for those who would employ them. 
According to the same draft amendments, the landowners in rural areas would receive 
special subsidies for vocational education. 
</p>
<p>85. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs operated eight children&#8217;s homes, seven  
boarding schools, and there were two centres for children in difficult situations. There was 
a foster care system financed by the State budget, and civil society organizations were 
working on such foster care with State support. A pension reform had been worked out that 
would enable pensioners to afford basic necessities.  
</p>
<p>86. Labour law prohibited any labour contract from being concluded with children under 
14 years of age.  Employment contracts for children under 14 to 16 years of age shall be </p>


<p>concluded with the consent of a parental guardian. Such children could be employed only if 
it was not to the detriment of their health, education or morals. The Labour Code included 
special provisions prohibiting children from working in hazardous and health-threatening 
situations.  
</p>
<p>87. Armenia had carried out wide-ranging reforms with respect to special schools for 
children. There were 49 inclusive schools in the country, 45 of which received State 
funding for inclusive education programmes. Armenia had organized teacher training and 
had created a general educational curriculum for national minorities, which provided 43 
lessons in native language and on literature. Yezidi experts were included in the National 
Institute of Education, which addressed education issues concerning the Yezidi and other 
national minorities. Various teacher training programmes on the Yezidi language had been 
organized by the National Institute of Education, and courses about Yezidi culture and 
history had been included in its programmes.  
</p>
<p>88. With the support of UNHCR, Armenia was building houses for refugees and 
adopting measures to meet their basic housing needs. The housing programme dealt with 
most vulnerable category of refugees and was being implemented through the issuance of 
certificates for all refugees who would buy flats. Armenia was looking further into the 
housing needs of those refugees living with relatives or renting flats. There were 1,500 
families living in such circumstances.  
</p>
<p>89. Armenia&#8217;s foremost concern regarding internally displaced persons was to ensure 
their safe return to their former places of residence, which required the peaceful settlement 
of conflict. At present, such individuals could return to their former places of residence, 
where there was only a minimum risk of armed conflict.   
</p>
<p>90. The Government reform in the area of reproductive health, implemented in 2008 and 
2009, had increased the State budget and funds for reproductive services for the entire 
population. As a result, every woman in Armenia now had the right to gain access to 
reproductive health services free of charge. With the assistance of the World Bank, the 
Government had implemented primary health-care programmes and health-care 
modernization programmes, through which Armenia had created the capacity necessary to 
ensure primary health-care services of good quality, including reproductive health-care 
services, in more than 130 rural and remote communities. The Government had continued 
the modernization of rural health-care centres, the training of staff, the establishment of 
mobile health-care groups and the reform of emergency health-care services, in order to 
provide health care in rural and remote areas. In 2008, the Government had decided to 
conduct in Armenian Schools a special training programme entitled &#8220;Healthy Behaviour&#8221;, 
which included issues related to reproductive health and HIV/AIDS.    
</p>
<p>91. Armenia had created a manual for law-enforcement officials on the trafficking in 
human beings, as a result of which educational programmes would be included in all 
training curriculums for law-enforcement officials, including the police, the judiciary and 
the prosecutor&#8217;s office. Armenia had also created a school curriculum for students in the 
higher grades, which would be implemented starting in September 2010. No children had 
been trafficked outside Armenia, and there had been only a handful of cases of child 
trafficking and beggary within the country. Extensive cooperation with non-governmental 
organizations was being carried out, including shelters run by the non-governmental 
organization community.  
</p>
<p>92. Armenia would examine all recommendations and implement them.  </p>
