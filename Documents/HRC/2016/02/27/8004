<p><b>A/HRC/22/15/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> GE.13-11289 
</p>
<p>1. In presenting the oral report of Peru to the United Nations Human Rights Council as 
part of the universal periodic review (UPR) process, which took place on 1 November 
2012, Peru wishes to reiterate its deep commitment to complying with international human 
rights standards. 
</p>
<p>2. It also recognizes the importance of this review as a mechanism to encourage 
national and inter-State dialogue, thus promoting the exchange of best practices in human 
rights worldwide. 
</p>
<p>3. Experience of the process during this second UPR cycle has enabled Peru to review 
public policies adopted on human rights, to monitor the progress made and the challenges 
remaining in order to implement the international treaties to which it is party and, in 
particular, to give careful consideration to the recommendations made during the first UPR 
cycle. 
</p>
<p>4. Peru has demonstrated a spirit of openness, transparency and respect for the 
international human rights system by undergoing a critical assessment by States parties. In 
this regard, it is noteworthy that, of the 129 recommendations made, 120 were accepted on 
the day of the State party&#8217;s presentation, leaving only 9 for subsequent consideration. 
</p>
<p>5. In this spirit, Peru has established an open dialogue with representatives of its 
various bodies to consider the recommendations still pending and also welcomes the 
interest of States parties in encouraging the country&#8217;s progress in human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. Peru has therefore carefully considered the nine outstanding recommendations and is 
pleased to share the following comments for inclusion in the final report: 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendation No. 119.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR-OP 2) (Spain); Formalise the political engagement with 
relation to the death penalty by signing and ratifying ICCPR-OP 2, aimed at 
abolishing the death penalty (Belgium); Abolish the death penalty completely and 
ratify the ICCPR-OP 2 (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland); 
Abolish the death penalty in all circumstances and ratify ICCPR-OP 2 (France); 
Abolish the death penalty for all crimes, and ratify ICCPR-OP 2 (Portugal); Abolish 
de jure the death penalty and ratify ICCPR-OP 2 (Costa Rica); Abolish the death 
penalty (Slovenia).&#8221; 
</b>7. The 1993 Constitution of Peru (art. 140) provides for the death penalty only for 
exceptional crimes (terrorism and treason), and only insofar as it is in accordance with the 
human rights laws and treaties to which Peru is a party. 
</p>
<p>8. With regard to the enforcement of the death penalty, it should be noted that the 
Peruvian Criminal Code does not provide for the death penalty. However, the Military and 
Police Criminal Code includes, in the section on Crimes against National Defence (art. 58), 
the offence of treason, stating that: &#8220;In the event of a foreign war, the death penalty may be 
imposed, in accordance with our legislation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>9. Notwithstanding the above, it should be noted that no death sentence has been 
carried out for several decades, nor have any death sentences been recorded since 1979. 
Thus, Peru has maintained a de facto moratorium on the enforcement of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>10. In this regard, Peru will promote dialogue and reflection on this issue in public 
forums and debates nationwide, involving both public officials and civil society. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/15/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-11289 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendation No. 119.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic Social and 
Cultural Rights (ICESCR-OP) (Spain).&#8221;</b> 
11. Peru agrees with the concept and importance of the enforceability of economic, 
social and cultural rights to ensure their full enjoyment and exercise, and has been taking 
steps to achieve that objective. These include the adoption of a resolution of the National 
Human Rights Council (CNDH), which expressed its support for the possible accession by 
Peru to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>12. Thus, Peru will promote dialogue and public debate on the adoption of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendation No. 119.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Amend article 140 of the Constitution and continue to protect the institution of the 
natural family (Holy See).&#8221; 
</b>13. With regard to the amendment of article 140 of the Constitution, Peru reiterates its 
comments on recommendation No. 119.1. It also partially accepts the second part of 
recommendation 119.3 and agrees on the importance of protecting the family, further 
recognizing, as required by the case law of the Constitutional Court, the need to protect 
other family models, including, for example, reconstituted families and single-parent 
families. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendation No. 119.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Prohibit child labour under the age of 15, and of those who have not yet completed 
compulsory education (Honduras).&#8221; 
</b>14. It is the policy of Peru is ensure that every child or adolescent has an education, in 
accordance with article 17 of the Peruvian Constitution. 
</p>
<p>15. The current Child and Adolescent Code (CNA), adopted under Act No. 27337, 
provides for different minimum ages for admission to employment, which are raised 
depending on the type of activity undertaken. It also stipulates a generic minimum age of 
14 years, applicable to all activities for which no specific higher minimum age has been 
fixed. Thus, the current minimum ages in force in Peru for admission to employment are: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 17 years: Specified minimum age for work in industrial fisheries; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 16 years: Specified minimum age for industrial, commercial or mining work; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 15 years: Specified minimum age for non-industrial agricultural labour; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 14 years: Specified minimum age for non-generic activities not referred to above. 
</p>
<p>16. It is important to emphasize that article 22 of the CNA allows for adolescents to 
work within the age ranges listed above as long as there is no economic exploitation and the 
activity poses no risk or danger, has no impact on their education and is not harmful to their 
health or their physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. 
</p>
<p>17. In line with the above, through the National Steering Committee on the Prevention 
and Elimination of Child Labour (CEPETI), Peru has been taking steps to reduce child 
labour nationwide, to which end, on 4 July 2012 the committee adopted the &#8220;National 
Strategy for the Prevention and Elimination of Child Labour 2012&#8211;2021&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/15/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.13-11289 
</p>
<p>18. Lastly, it should be noted that Peru is currently considering comprehensive 
amendments to the CNA, which include raising the generic minimum age for admission to 
employment to 15 years. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendation No. 119.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Repeal criminal defamation laws in order to combat reprisals against the journalists 
and human rights defenders (Netherlands).&#8221; 
</b>19. Peru underscores its respect for freedom of the press and for the activities of human 
rights defenders, which obviates the need for make reference to any form of reprisal against 
them. There is no systematic persecution of either journalists or human rights defenders. 
20. Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Peruvian Constitution recognizes freedom of 
information, opinion, expression and dissemination of ideas. The American Convention on 
Human Rights (art. 13), to which Peru is a party, continues in the same vein. 
21. Freedom of speech prevails in Peru and this is reflected daily in the headlines of 
newspapers, televised news, radio programmes, etc. Peru welcomes the work carried out by 
journalists and shares the idea that public officials should be subject to greater scrutiny by 
society, as this will strengthen the rule of law and the democratic system. 
</p>
<p>22. Peru has an effective institutional and legal framework (Public Prosecutor, Judiciary 
and Ombudsman) to ensure that journalists and human rights defenders are fully able to 
carry out their activities and duties. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations Nos. 119.6 and 119.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Guarantee the full recognition of sexual and reproductive rights (France).&#8221; 
&#8220;Ensure the promotion and protection of reproductive rights of women in agreement 
with international standards (Portugal).&#8221; 
</b>23. In recent years, Peru has made significant progress towards ensuring the enjoyment 
of sexual and reproductive rights. In this regard, it should be noted that the Ministry of 
Health, in the National Health Strategy on Sexual and Reproductive Health, has updated 
policy documents (Family Planning Technical Standard and Guidance/Counselling Manual 
on Sexual and Reproductive Health) to standardize processes and include the widest range 
of current contraceptives such as the female condom, implant and monthly injectable 
contraceptive. Furthermore, to ensure that this initiative is sustainable, these methods have 
been included in the programme cost structure for 2013. 
</p>
<p>24. With regard to the promotion of sexual and reproductive health education for 
adolescents, it is important to note that the National Curriculum Design for Regular Basic 
Education (DCN) has established &#8220;<i>the promotion of adolescent sexual and reproductive 
health</i>&#8221; as a core subject in the school curriculum. Similarly, the curriculum includes the 
subject in the &#8220;Individual, Family and Human Relations&#8221;, which is taught in each of the 
five grades at secondary education level. 
</p>
<p>25. Peru is making every effort to respect, guarantee and promote the sexual and 
reproductive rights of all. We therefore consider that steps taken by the Government are in 
line with these recommendations. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/15/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-11289 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendation No. 119.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Review its restrictive interpretation of therapeutic abortion and decriminalisation of 
abortion in cases of rape, as recommended by CEDAW (Slovenia).&#8221; 
</b>26. Regarding abortion, under the Peruvian Criminal Code abortion in general, with the 
exception of therapeutic abortion, is a punishable act, as was explained by the national 
delegation during the oral part of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>27. The practice of therapeutic abortion is generally carried out by a doctor, with the 
consent of the pregnant woman, &#8220;<i>(...) when it is the only way to save the latter&#8217;s life, or to 
avoid serious and permanent harm to her health.</i>&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendation No. 119.9 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Establish national protocols for abortion in accordance with the conclusion of the UN 
Human Rights Committee in 2005, as a measure to improve women&#8217;s sexual and 
reproductive rights (Norway).&#8221; 
</b>28. In Peru, there are guides for use at the local level that are being employed by certain 
hospitals in the country for cases of therapeutic abortion. A draft technical guide on 
comprehensive care for the termination of pregnancies up to 22 weeks gestation has also 
been drawn up, which is currently under consultation. 
</p>
<p>29. In this regard, Peru has been working towards the early adoption of this draft guide 
to protect the sexual and reproductive rights of women in Peru.
