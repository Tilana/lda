<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary

</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> Journalists, who play a crucial role in ensuring a society that takes informed 
decisions, are killed at an alarming rate by State and non-State actors. Others are 
intimidated into self-censorship. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions investigates the mechanisms that are in place 
to provide greater protection to the right to life of journalists. 
</p>
<p> The most immediate problem does not lie with gaps in the international legal 
framework. The challenge is rather to ensure that the established international framework is 
fully used, and that its norms are reflected in domestic laws and practices. 
</p>
<p> The approach should be to elevate the killing of journalists from the local level to 
the national and international levels. The Special Rapporteur proposes measures aimed at 
ensuring greater accountability and identifies underutilized entry points at all levels that can 
be used by journalists at risk.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Christof Heyns took up his functions as Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions on 1 August 2010. This is his second annual report to the 
Human Rights Council, submitted pursuant to Council resolution 17/5. In the report, an 
overview is given of the Special Rapporteur&#8216;s activities over the past year. The thematic 
part focuses on the protection of the right to life of journalists. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>2. The present report covers communications sent by the Special Rapporteur between 
16 March 2011 and 15 March 2012, and replies received between 1 May 2011 and 30 April 
</p><p>2012. The details of the communications and responses from Governments are included in 
the following communications reports of special procedures: A/HRC/18/51 and Corr.1; 
A/HRC/19/44 and A/HRC/20/30. 
</p>
<p>3. Observations on the communications sent and received in the reporting period are 
reflected in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/20/22/Add.5). During the period 
under review, the Special Rapporteur sent 112 communications to 52 countries (including 
65 urgent appeals and 47 allegation letters). The main issues covered in the 
communications were attacks or killings (48), the death penalty (20), excessive use of force 
(19), death threats (12), deaths in custody (5), impunity (4), armed conflict (2), and 
expulsion (2). The status of individuals who were the subject of concern with regard to 
requests for stays of execution is contained in an annex to A/HRC/20/22/Add.5. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Visits 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited India from 19 to 30 March 2012 at the invitation of 
the Government. A preliminary note on the mission (A/HRC/20/22/Add.4) will be 
submitted to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>5. The Governments of Mexico and Turkey have accepted the Special Rapporteur&#8216;s 
visit requests. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Governments who have responded 
positively to his requests, and encourages the Governments of Eritrea, Sri Lanka, Thailand 
and Uganda to accept his pending requests for a visit. 
</p>
<p>6. Follow-up reports on missions undertaken by the previous mandate holder to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Colombia and the United States of America are contained 
in documents A/HRC/20/22/Add.1, A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 and A/HRC/20/22/Add.3, 
respectively. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Press releases</b>1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>7. On 21 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur, along with several other mandate

<p>parliamentary elections in Egypt. On 15 April 2011 and on 5 August 2011, the Special 
Rapporteur jointly with other mandate holders urged the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic to immediately stop violence against civilians. Joint statements were delivered on 
behalf of all special procedure mandate holders at the seventeenth and eighteenth special 
sessions of the Human Rights Council on the human rights situations in the Syrian Arab 
Republic, on 22 August and 2 December 2011, respectively.2 
</p>
<p>8. A number of joint statements were issued on death penalty cases: on 22 September 
2011, to call for an immediate halt to the death penalty in the Islamic Republic of Iran,3 and 
on 1 July and 21 September 2011, to urge the Government of the United States of America 
to stop the executions of Humberto Leal Garc&#237;a and Troy Davis, respectively. 
</p>
<p>9. On 6 May 2011, the Special Rapporteur issued a joint statement with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism on the killing of Osama bin Laden, asking the Government of 
the United States to disclose the facts surrounding the operation. On 20 October 2011, the 
Special Rapporteur issued a statement denouncing targeted killing policies. 
</p>
<p>10. On 2 March 2012, a statement was sent jointly with other special rapporteurs calling 
on the Government of Pakistan to act decisively to end sectarian violence.4 
</p>
<p><b> D. International and national meetings 
</b></p>
<p>11. On 19 September 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in a panel discussion 
held as a side event during the eighteenth session of the Human Rights Council, entitled 
&#8213;Towards universal abolition of the death penalty: Sharing best practices on ratifying the 
</p>
<p>Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&#8214;. The 
event was organized by the Permanent Mission of Belgium in cooperation with the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and with the support of the 
World Coalition Against the Death Penalty. 
</p>
<p>12. On the occasion of the World Day against the Death Penalty on 10 October 2011, 
the Special Rapporteur took part in a panel discussion on the international jurisprudence 
regarding the death penalty and the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, organized in Geneva, Switzerland by the World Coalition Against the Death 
Penalty and facilitated by the Governments of Belgium and Chile. 
</p>
<p>13. At an expert consultation entitled &#8213;Safety of Journalists: Towards a More Effective 
International Protection Framework&#8214;, held by the Government of Austria in Vienna on 23 
November 2011, the Special Rapporteur delivered introductory remarks on protecting the 
right to life of journalists.  
</p>
<p>14. On 17 and 18 January 2012, the Special Rapporteur attended a consultation in Addis 
Ababa, entitled &#8213;Enhancing Cooperation between the African and the UN Special 
Procedures Mechanisms for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights&#8214;. Following the 
meeting, a working group was established and a road map was adopted on concrete means 
to strengthen the cooperation between those mechanisms. The Special Rapporteur was 
appointed Chair of the working group for a six-month term.

<p>15. The Special Rapporteur attended an expert meeting on the use of force in armed 
conflicts, held in Geneva on 26 January 2012. 
</p>
<p>16. From 26 to 28 January 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Wilton Park 
conference entitled &#8213;Peaceful Protest: A Cornerstone of Democracy&#8212;How to Address the 
Challenges?&#8214;, sponsored by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Swiss 
Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p>17. On 20 February 2012, the Special Rapporteur took part in a panel discussion at the 
Harvard International Law Journal Symposium on State ethics, held at Harvard Law 
School, where he gave a speech on extrajudicial executions and targeted killings. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur organized an expert meeting on the safety of journalists, 
held in Cambridge, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 1 and 2 
March 2012, with the support of the University of Cambridge Centre of Governance and 
Human Rights. The purpose of the meeting was to inform the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Intended future areas of research 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur notes the trail-breaking work carried out by his predecessor, 
Philip Alston, on the human rights and humanitarian law impacts of lethal robotic 
technologies (A/65/321). The Special Rapporteur shares his predecessor&#8216;s concern that 
these technologies are rapidly proliferating, with far too little analysis from a human rights 
perspective. Accordingly, he intends to deepen and expand work in this crucial area. The 
Special Rapporteur will undertake detailed research and consultations with legal, robotics, 
weapons, and ethics experts through 2012-2013, and will report his findings and 
recommendations to the Human Rights Council in 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Protection of the right to life of journalists 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context</b>5<b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. Because of the power of information, news and journalism is a heavily contested 
domain. Journalists are often in a vulnerable position, where their physical integrity and life 
may be at stake because of the actions of State or non-State actors. They may face attempts 
at influence or censorship, but also in some cases physical danger, ranging from getting 
caught in crossfire to threats, attempted or actual assaults, abductions, disappearances, and 
even death. If journalists are in danger, the media cannot be free. 
</p>
<p>21. The most extreme form of censorship is to kill a journalist. The killing not only 
silences the voice of the particular journalist, but also intimidates other journalists and the 
public in general. The free flow of ideas and information is replaced by the silent warning 
of the grave. 
</p>
<p>22. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur examines how legal and other 
protective measures may be used to protect the right to life of journalists, and those close to 
them, against actual deprivation of life and assaults on their physical integrity that may 
endanger life. 
</p>
<p>  
 5 The Special Rapporteur thanks the University of Cambridge Centre of Governance and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>for its valuable research support. </p>


<p>23. Freedom of expression, as the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression has noted, is also a collective right held 
by society as a whole (A/HRC/14/23, paras. 29 and 105). Freedom of expression and the 
concomitant right to receive information are &#8213;meta rights&#8214;&#8212;rights on which the realization 
of most of other rights depends. They are also the cornerstones of democracy, anti-
corruption measures, good governance and in general the ability of society to take informed 
decisions. 
</p>
<p>24. Journalists deserve special concern not primarily because they perform heroic acts in 
the face of danger&#8212;although that is often the case&#8212;but because the social role they play is 
so important. Just as the shooting of a police officer warrants messages of &#8213;calling all units, 
officer down&#8214; throughout the police force, an attack on a journalist represents an assault on 
the foundations of the human rights project and on informed society as a whole. Violence 
against a journalist is not only an attack on one particular victim, but on all members of the 
society. 
</p>
<p>25. Within the framework of the mandate, issues regarding assaults on the life of 
journalists have been addressed in a number of ways.6 Noteworthy is that the then Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted in her 2003 report that 
journalists are among the persons who receive the most death threats (E/CN.4/2003/3 and 
Corr.1, para. 54). Journalists have regularly been the subject of communications. Indeed, 
approximately 8 per cent of the communications sent under the mandate on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions between 2003 and 2011 concerned killings of journalists, 
or threats to their lives. 
</p>
<p>26. For the purposes of the present report, a functional approach will be taken in respect 
of the question of who is to be regarded as a journalist, and hence who deserves special 
attention. The following definition represents a fairly widely accepted understanding of 
what this concept entails: &#8213;The term &#8215;journalist&#8216; means any natural or legal person who is 
regularly or professionally engaged in the collection and dissemination of information to 
the public via any means of mass communication.&#8214;7 Reporters and photographers and those 
who directly support their work&#8212;stringers and drivers&#8212;are potentially vulnerable, and 
because they fulfil a crucial social function they are deserving of special protection. This 
includes the &#8213;new media&#8214; or &#8213;citizen and online journalists&#8214;.8 
</p>
<p>27. Not all journalists focus on human rights&#8212;they shine their light on a wide range of 
issues. Since some journalists are human rights defenders and some human rights defenders 
are journalists, these two categories are overlapping but not identical. 
</p>
<p>28. An alarming number of journalists are killed each year in the course of their duties, 
or are subjected to physical violence. Mere casualty figures do not fully convey the extent 
of the problem because in many cases journalists are prevented from doing their work 
following threats to their safety that may not be realized. Nevertheless, the available

<p>statistics on the killing of journalists, especially when measured over time, provide an 
important and compelling starting point from which to better understand the problem, and 
to identify ways to reduce the danger. 
</p>
<p>29. A number of civil society groups are doing the important work of tracking work-
related deaths of journalists around the world. The data differs according to what is being 
monitored. Some, like the International News Safety Institute (INSI)9 and the International 
Federation of Journalists (IFJ)10, keep track of all safety-related aspects, including vehicle 
accidents and illness, while others, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)11 and 
Reporters Without Borders (RWB),12 take a more narrow approach, focusing more on 
instances where journalists suffer violent deaths directly related to their profession. 
</p>
<p>30. According to CPJ, as at 28 March, 909 journalists had been killed since 1992. In 566 
of these cases there has been total impunity.13 
</p>
<p>31. The 20 deadliest places during that period, according to CPJ, were as follows: Iraq: 
151 killings; Philippines: 72; Algeria: 60; Russian Federation: 53; Colombia: 43; Pakistan: 
42; Somalia: 39; India: 28; Mexico: 27; Afghanistan: 24; Brazil: 21; Turkey: 20; Bosnia 
and Herzegovina: 19; Sri Lanka: 19; Rwanda: 17; Tajikistan: 17; Sierra Leone: 16; 
Bangladesh: 12; Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory: 10; and Nigeria: 10.14 
</p>
<p>32. The causal correlation between impunity and the killing of journalists is evident 
from the fact that the countries where the highest number of journalists are killed are also, 
almost without exception, those with the highest level of impunity.15 Impunity is a major, if 
not the main, cause of the high number of journalists killed every year. 
</p>
<p>33. Two thirds of these deaths occur outside armed conflict. About 40 per cent of the 
journalists killed covered politics; 34 per cent war; 21 per cent corruption; 15 per cent 
crime; and 15 per cent human rights.16 The overriding problem is murder, not accidents. 
Freelance journalists are at a much higher risk than those who work for news agencies. 
</p>
<p>34. It is clear from these statistics that the most common profile of a journalist who is 
killed is that of a local as opposed to foreign correspondent, who covers politics or 
corruption for a newspaper or a radio station. While the plight of the foreign war 
correspondent attracts the most attention, and is worthy of such concern, special attention 
should also be paid to the question of how to alter the fate of the local newspaper journalist 
who drives home after work and is intercepted by two people on a motorbike, one holding a 
gun. It is a threat to the human rights project as whole when a blogger is tracked and her 
head is found next to her keyboard with a threatening note. 
</p>
<p>35. While the practice of killing the messenger is not new, the nature of the threat 
changes when society changes. Increased fatalities among photojournalists are a worrying 
trend, indicating that the impact of visual imagery is considered to have become more 
threatening. Likewise there have been a number of high-profile killings of environmental

<p>journalists in recent years, whose stories often contain information about corruption 
involving multinationals.17 
</p>
<p>36. One of the main changes in the way in which the news is disseminated around the 
world in recent years has been the emergence of online journalists, both professionals as 
well as people who are untrained, who use social media. With the spread and increased 
availability of technology, the pool of who we now consider journalists has expanded 
rapidly, and so has the number of people who are potential targets of those who want to 
control the flow of information. In parts of Mexico, for example, the conventional media 
have for all practical purposes been replaced by new media&#8212;and assassins have likewise 
moved their sights. 
</p>
<p>37. More than 70 per cent of journalists murdered are reported to have received prior 
threats.18 This shows that there is significant room for preventative measures to be taken. In 
an interconnected world, raising the alarm publicly can have a restraining effect, and one of 
the challenges is to find ways in which this can be done more effectively. 
</p>
<p>38. Are all deaths of journalists captured in the aforementioned statistics preventable? 
Probably not. Those who get close to violence will always be at risk of being caught in the 
crossfire. If journalists become direct participants in the hostilities they cover, they are also 
not protected from being targeted. But even in such cases, the risks can be reduced if all 
parties to the conflict recognize the legitimacy of the presence of journalists, and if the 
journalists themselves are better prepared. The execution of journalists on account of their 
work can never be accepted. Journalists, like other people, are subject to the ordinary laws 
of the land, and as such are accountable. However, the appropriate reaction to their work 
when they challenge the status quo, and even in those cases where they fall foul of the law, 
can never be extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The protective framework 
</b></p>
<p>39. A variety of mechanisms exist to protect journalists from attack, and to ensure 
accountability where this fails. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. International human rights law and policy 
</b></p>
<p>40. There is no specific international treaty dedicated specifically to the protection of 
journalists from physical attacks. Various parts of the international system collectively play 
this role. 
</p>
<p>41. Most pertinently, the right to life is recognized as a rule of customary international 
law,19 and specifically in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 
6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is a right that may not be 
derogated from in times of emergency, such as war.20 A wider network of rights is also

</p>
<p> 19 Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (A/HRC/17/28), 
para. 43.  
</p>
<p> 20 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 4; see also the American Convention on 
Human Rights, art. 27; the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, art. 15; and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, art. 4, para. 2. </p>


<p>relevant to enhancing journalists&#8216; bodily security in exercising their profession, such as the 
rights to physical integrity, not to be tortured or arbitrarily detained, or to be disappeared, in 
addition to the rights to freedom of expression and to information. 
</p>
<p>42. International human rights law, at the global as well as the regional levels, requires 
States to respect and protect the lives of all within their respective jurisdiction from attacks 
and threats of attacks, and to provide an effective remedy where this has not been the case. 
The State and its agents are not only required to refrain from engaging in arbitrary killings, 
but also to protect people from such threats by non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>43. Impunity, as has been noted, is widely recognized as one of the main causes of the 
continued killing of journalists. One of the elements of the right to life is accountability 
where a breach has occurred. It is an inherent aspect of the State&#8216;s due-diligence obligation 
to prevent, punish, investigate and redress threats to and violations of the right to life.21 The 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions22 provide that investigations in instances of extrajudicial executions 
are to be &#8213;thorough, prompt and impartial&#8214; and conducted by independent bodies.23 
Prosecutors are also required to act independently, impartially and expeditiously.24 States 
are obliged to enable prosecutors to act independently and free from interference, including, 
where necessary, ensuring the safety of prosecutors.25 
</p>
<p>44. The European Court of Human Rights has determined that an investigation: should 
be initiated by the State of its own volition; should be independent, effective, sufficiently 
open to public scrutiny and reasonably prompt; and should involve the next of kin/family.26 
Additionally, &#8213;any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to identify 
the perpetrator or perpetrators will risk falling foul of this standard&#8214;.27 A parallel 
jurisprudence has been developed by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and in the

can also constitute a violation of the right to life.29 
</p>
<p>45. Binding treaties and customary law, as well as &#8213;soft law&#8214; instruments, such as 
declarations and significant public positions taken by office bearers of intergovernmental 
organizations (IGOs), will now be considered in an overview of the relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> (a) United Nations level 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Secretary-General has on various occasions condemned the killing of 
journalists.30  
</p>
<p>47. In resolutions adopted at its special sessions, the Human Rights Council has 
condemned the killing of journalists.31 The targeting of journalists in a number of countries, 
including Somalia, Colombia, Mexico, Honduras and the Philippines, has been addressed 
under the universal periodic review mechanism.32 
</p>
<p>48. Different special procedures have also dealt with the safety of journalists. The topic 
is central to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and he has submitted a comprehensive report to the General Assembly on the 
topic (A/65/284, in particular para. 20 ff).33 The Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders devoted a section of her 2012 annual report to the Human Rights 
Council on the action taken by her mandate regarding journalists as human rights defenders 
(A/HRC/19/55, paras. 29-59). 
</p>
<p>49. Special procedures have the ability to move fast, have the mandate to cover all 
countries (not only those that have ratified particular human rights treaties) and do not 
require the exhaustion of domestic remedies. They often send letters of allegation to States 
where journalists have been killed, in order to ensure accountability. Of particular 
importance to the issue of prevention, however, is the fact that they also have the power to 
send urgent appeals to States where journalists and others are under threat, to urge those 
States to protect the person in question. It is an important access point that should be used 
more often. It should be noted that the special procedures may not act merely on the basis 
of newspaper reports, but have to be approached by an individual, group, non-governmental 
organization, intergovernmental agency or Government, who must provide information

<p>regarding the incident, the victims of the incident, the alleged perpetrators and the source of 
the allegations.34 
</p>
<p>50. In a welcome development, several special procedures in the global and regional 
systems have recently made joint declarations condemning the killing of journalists.35 The 
special procedures of the United Nations and the African Union met in Addis Ababa in 
January 2012 to enhance collaboration between the global and the regional system, which 
could also lead to more cooperation in respect of journalists in Africa. 
</p>
<p>51. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported on attacks against 
journalists, for example in the context of the situations in Afghanistan and Colombia, 
among others.36 
</p>
<p>52. The Human Rights Committee has explicitly addressed the safety of journalists in 
general comment No. 34 (2011) on the freedoms of opinion and expression. In <i>Afuson 
Njaru v. Cameroon</i>, the Committee found that the State had violated article 9 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (right to security of the person) by 
failing to take measures against attacks on journalists.37 
</p>
<p>53. In recent years the Human Rights Committee, in its concluding observations, has 
expressed concern about intimidation, harassment and threats against journalists;38 the 
Committee against Torture has also expressed such concerns, including with respect to the 
killings of journalists.39 
</p>
<p>54. It should be noted, from the perspective of prevention, that the Human Rights 
Committee has the power to inform a State party that interim measures are &#8213;desirable to 
avoid irreparable damage&#8214; in respect of a pending complaint.40 Other treaty bodies with 
comparable competences in this context are the Committee against Torture, the Committee 
on Enforced Disappearances and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women. 
</p>
<p>55. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
has taken a lead role in the United Nations system in respect of freedom of expression, 
including the safety of journalists. For example, in 1997 UNESCO adopted resolution 29 
on the condemnation of violence against journalists. On a regular basis, UNESCO publicly 
condemns the killing of journalists41 and exercises &#8213;quiet diplomacy&#8214;, also in respect of

<p>threats. The Belgrade Declaration on Support to Media in Violent Conflict and Countries in 
Transition42 and the Medell&#237;n Declaration on Securing the Safety of Journalists and 
Combating Impunity43 inform the direction followed by UNESCO. The Organization was 
instrumental during 2011 in gaining agreement among various United Nations actors on a 
draft United Nations plan of action on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity.44 
</p>
<p>56. At its 26th session, in 2008, the Intergovernmental Council of the International 
Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) adopted its first Decision on 
the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity, in which member States were urged &#8213;to 
inform the Director-General of UNESCO, on a voluntary basis, of the actions taken to 
prevent the impunity of the perpetrators and to notify him of the status of the judicial 
inquiries conducted on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO&#8214;.45 There does not, 
however, appear to be much civil society engagement with this process. World Press 
Freedom Day proclaimed by the General Assembly at the initiative of UNESCO, provides a 
useful rallying point to emphasize the right to life of journalists. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>57. Under all three established regional human rights systems, individual cases may be 
brought to a regional court concerning the rights protected in those systems, which include 
the right to life and physical integrity. This means, on the accountability front, that cases 
may be brought against State parties when there is a failure to respect or to protect the life 
of a journalist, or when there is impunity when a journalist has been killed. The decisions of 
these courts are legally binding. 
</p>
<p>58. A number of decisions concerning the right to life of journalists have been handed 
down by the European Court of Human Rights.46 In<i> Dink v. Turkey</i>, the Court held that 
abandoning a charge against policemen for negligence in protecting journalist Hrant Dink 
was a failure by the State to protect the journalist.47 In October 2011, the Commissioner for 
Human Rights of the Council of Europe published a helpful report entitled &#8213;Protection of 
journalists from violence&#8214;.48 
</p>
<p>59. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has adopted various 
resolutions and recommendations on the issue.49 The Council and its structures have, in a 
variety of ways, endorsed the right of journalists not to disclose their sources, except under

<p>very narrowly defined circumstances.50 This also serves the purpose of ensuring that 
journalists are not targeted for elimination as potential witnesses.51 
</p>
<p>60. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights is currently considering a case 
concerning death threats as a potential violation of the right to life.52 The Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights has adopted resolutions on the issue53 and has established a 
Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression; for more than a decade, the protection of 
journalists has been highlighted in the annual reports under the mandate.54 
</p>
<p>61. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8216; Rights has condemned the 
practice in resolutions setting out the obligations of States also to ensure accountability.55 In 
2004, the Commission appointed the first Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression 
and Access to Information in Africa, and the mandate holders have done important work in 
respect of the safety of journalists on the continent. 
</p>
<p>62. All three regional human rights courts have the authority to issue interim or 
provisional or preventative measures&#8212;legally binding orders to refrain from infringing 
rights, or to protect them. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights as a quasi-
judicial body also has the power to order precautionary measures. It has done so with the 
specific aim of protecting the lives of journalists in respect of two matters during 2011,56 
and four matters during 2010,57 albeit with mixed success. In each of these instances the 
Commission specifically directed the relevant States to take measures to ensure the lives of 
the journalists named. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8216; Rights has similar 
powers, but has not been asked to use it to protect journalists. These interim measures are 
potential access points that should be used more often by journalists who are under threat. 
While the Inter-American system is the leader on this front, the fact that the system of 
precautionary measures has been the subject of controversy should be pointed out. 
</p>
<p>63. Other regional IGOs have also taken initiatives in respect of the protection of 
journalists. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, for example, has 
made the safety of journalists one of its priorities.58

that &#8213;war correspondents must be perceived as independent observers rather than as potential

<p>64. There are a number of emerging regional human rights systems in the world, for 
example the Intergovernmental Human Rights Commission of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations, and within the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab 
States. It will be important to place the protection of the right to life of journalists on their 
agendas from an early stage, and those working in this field, such as NGOs, should engage 
with the emerging bodies in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>65. During armed conflict, human rights law applies as the <i>lex generalis</i> and 
international humanitarian law applies as the <i>lex specialis</i>.59 In respect of the right to life, 
this entails that while both systems apply during armed conflict, the question as to whether 
a killing should be considered &#8213;arbitrary&#8214; or unlawful is in most cases determined by 
international humanitarian law.60 
</p>
<p>66. Journalists who are members of the armed forces are subject to targeting on the 
same basis as other soldiers or fighters. However, journalists who are not members of the 
armed forces are protected on the same basis as civilians and may not be deliberately 
targeted.61 War correspondents, like other journalists, are not members of the armed forces, 
and as such are protected against targeting, but they are accredited to the armed forces and 
as such qualify for prisoner of war status should they be captured.62 
</p>
<p>67. This protection that journalists and civilians enjoy is limited in a number of ways. 
Their proximity to military objectives entail that their deaths in an attack could potentially 
be considered collateral damage, provided the other conditions, such as proportionality, are 
met. Moreover, as is the case with civilians, the protection journalists enjoy ceases to apply 
when they directly engage in hostilities.63 &#8213;Direct participation&#8214; in hostilities entails &#8213;acts of 
war which by their nature or purpose are likely to cause actual harm to the personnel and 
equipment of the enemy armed forces&#8214;.64 Journalists using their radio transmitters to send 
military messages, for example, risk placing themselves in this category. The spreading of 
propaganda for the enemy in itself does not make a journalist a legitimate target, but 
incitement to commit grave breaches of international humanitarian law, acts of genocide or 
violence is prohibited, and journalists spreading such messages open themselves up to 
being legitimate targets.65 
</p>
<p>68. Embedded journalists tend to be equated with war correspondents as far as targeting 
is concerned.66

<p>69. In its resolution 1738 (2006), the Security Council condemned attacks against 
journalists in conflict situations, and requested the Secretary-General to address, as an item 
in his reports to the Council, the issue of the safety and security of journalists (para. 12). 
</p>
<p>70. International humanitarian law is enforced through international and domestic 
criminal law. An intentional attack against civilians, including journalists, amounts to a 
grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime under the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court.67 The primary duty, however, is on States to investigate and, 
if appropriate, prosecute offenders for war crimes that fall within the relevant State&#8216;s 
jurisdiction.68 If they are unable or unwilling to do so, the International Criminal Court has 
jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. National law 
</b></p>
<p>71. The right to life is recognized, and murder and physical assault are proscribed by the 
legal systems of States around the world. However, the effective implementation of the 
international norms at the national level is uneven. 
</p>
<p>72. Impunity was identified above as one of the main reasons for the high incidence of 
murders of journalists in some societies. With the narrow exception of international 
criminal prosecutions, prosecutions take place within States and it is at this level that the 
failure of the system is often located and has to be addressed. In this regard, the norms set 
out above concerning proper investigation and prosecution must be followed. 
</p>
<p>73. There are various reasons why those who kill journalists are not brought to justice in 
domestic legal systems. They include undue influence on the criminal justice system 
through corruption, intimidation and complicity of those who run the systems, such as the 
police, prosecutors and judges, and also on witnesses and civil complaints mechanisms. 
Undue influence may be exerted by politicians, bureaucrats, drug cartels or criminals. 
Impunity can result from the failure to investigate or to prosecute, the acquittal of a guilty 
person, or an early release of someone who has been convicted and sentenced. (See the 
international standards for accountability set out above.) 
</p>
<p>74. Undue influence is exerted more easily at the local level than at the national level, 
because of the close interaction between those who may want to manipulate the system and 
those whom they target, such as witnesses or officials. In a positive development, Mexico is 
now in the process of passing a constitutional amendment that will proscribe the killing of 
journalists at the federal level, rather than at the state level.69 
</p>
<p>75. Courts do in some cases provide space for an active civil society when it is not 
available in the political realm. According to CPJ, in 2011, there were political attempts in 
Nepal to have charges dismissed against ruling party cadres with respect to the abduction 
and murder of a journalist. The Supreme Court overruled this, after civil society took legal 
action.70

<p>76. Many national legal systems provide for some form of interim measures or 
restraining orders. In some cases it may be appropriate for journalists who feel threatened to 
apply for such interim measures. The fact that these orders are legally binding could have a 
restraining effect, and it also serves to raise public awareness of the plight of the person 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>77. Also, national human rights institutions (NHRIs) are well placed to pursue the 
protection of journalists from attack, inter alia by raising awareness and taking up matters 
with the Government. The principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles) provide that NHRIs may be 
authorized to receive and act upon individual complaints, and may in appropriate cases be 
in a position to assist a journalist under threat, or to address impunity. Public protectors or 
ombudspersons in some cases have the same function. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Additional mechanisms and methods 
</b></p>
<p>78. There are also avenues outside the realm of the legal and intergovernmental 
structures outlined above, and ways of engaging with them, that can serve to protect 
journalists. 
</p>
<p>79. As the overview above demonstrates, there are no obvious gaps in the international 
framework for the protection of journalists. The main problem lies with the implementation 
of these norms and the creation of appropriate structures at the national level. Failure of 
implementation can be attributed partially to ignorance, but also to a lack of political will, 
requiring awareness-raising on the problem and the applicable norms. The general principle 
is that the issue must be elevated from the local level to a higher level. 
</p>
<p>80. It is therefore important to ensure that governmental and civil society structures keep 
the issue on their agendas, and to focus attention on specific incidences of killings, to 
emphasize the human aspect of the problem. 
</p>
<p>81. There are a number of international NGOs worldwide that focus on the issue of 
protecting journalists and elevate it to a level where it attracts international attention. These 
include, inter alia, CPJ, IFJ, INSI, RWB and the Press Emblem Campaign71. Others have a 
broader focus, such as freedom of expression in general, but also include the safety of 
journalists in their work, for example Article 19.72 Similar work is done by local 
organizations, such as, for example in the Russian Federation, the Russian Union of 
Journalists,73 the Glasnost Defence Foundation74 and the Centre for Journalism in Extreme 
Situations.75 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Safety codes 
</b></p>
<p>82. A wide array of safety codes have been developed, which enable journalists to 
protect themselves. This includes the INSI safety code of 200776 and the RWB Charter for 
the Safety of Journalists Working in War Zones or Dangerous Areas of 2002.77

<p><b> (b) Training 
</b></p>
<p>83. Some news organizations and NGOs, for example IFJ, INSI and Article 19, provide 
journalists with safety training, which includes risk awareness and avoidance and first aid. 
The Rory Peck Trust funds such training. 
</p>
<p>84. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provides first-aid courses for 
journalists in cooperation with national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and also 
training on international humanitarian law. ICRC is currently developing a new tool on the 
training of journalists. Pilot courses are being implemented in Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>85. The &#8213;Green Book&#8214; issued by the Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom 
provides a positive example by providing clear instructions on how military staff must treat 
media workers in the field. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Diplomatic channels 
</b></p>
<p>86. Governments can use diplomatic channels and diplomatic protection to address the 
plight of their nationals in other countries. 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Emergency helplines and contacts 
</b></p>
<p>87. Both RWB and INSI have established 24-hour emergency contact points for 
journalists in trouble. ICRC provides a permanent hotline and e-mail contact to report a 
missing, wounded, or detained journalist and request assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Support for journalists at risk or in hiding 
</b></p>
<p>88. Colombia has initiated, with some success, a programme for the protection of those 
at risk, including journalists.78 The Government of Sweden, within the context of its Special 
Initiative for Democratization and Freedom of Expression, funded a safe house for 
journalists in Kalmar, Sweden. 
</p>
<p>89. One of the high-profile activities of CPJ is its support for journalists forced to go 
into hiding.79 
</p>
<p>90. ICRC plays an ongoing role, for example in tracking missing journalists and 
evacuating wounded journalists. 
</p>
<p>91. Further support that some journalists receive from NGOs, employers or others 
includes loans of equipment, evacuation, medical care, counselling and support for families. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Significant changes in the substantive legal provisions of international law 
related to the protection of journalists are not necessary; the challenge lies rather with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the implementation of the existing normative framework at the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>(including regional) and national levels. At this stage, there does not appear to be a 
</b></p>
<p><b>need for a new global treaty dealing specifically with the safety of journalists. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The issue of the safety of journalists must be elevated in the public 
consciousness. Wider attention must be drawn to the prevalence of attacks on 
</b></p>
<p>

 79 See http://cpj.org/campaigns/assistance/what-we-do.php.  </p>


<p><b>journalists and the corrosive effects that such attacks have on society. Greater 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness should also be raised about the international standards and available entry 
</b></p>
<p><b>points. Federal as opposed to state investigations and prosecutions may be required 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international, in addition to domestic, remedies must be used. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>There is considerable scope for those actors in countries that are part of 
regional human rights systems or mechanisms to take up the matter, for example 
</b></p>
<p><b>through their special procedures and, to some extent, through interim measures. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The primary objective should be prevention. Accountability, with its strong 
justice dimension, should not be regarded as standing in contrast to prevention</b>&#8212;
</p>
<p><b>accountability is also the key to preventing recurrence. Impunity is one of the main 
</b></p>
<p><b>causes, if not the main cause, of the killing of journalists. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The existing entry points in the international system at the United Nations and 
regional levels, especially special procedures and interim or protective measures, are 
</b></p>
<p><b>not currently used to their full capacity. The relevant actors should be made aware of 
</b></p>
<p><b>and encouraged to use these mechanisms. A one-page exposition of some of these entry 
</b></p>
<p><b>points, with contact numbers and e-mail addresses, called </b>&#8220;<b>Emergency contact details 
</b></p>
<p><b>for journalists at risk</b>&#8221;<b>, is available online.80  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>At the local level there are significant shortcomings in the implementation in 
domestic law of the international normative framework, especially in terms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability frameworks. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>It is not enough that Governments and others are told that journalists need 
protection. They have to understand why this is needed. Constant and effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>advocacy, backed up by statistics, is required. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The ability of the State to protect journalists largely depends on the extent to 
which there is general appreciation of the importance of free speech, enabling 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation is in place, the rule of law prevails, and the political will to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>journalists exists. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Violence against journalists thrives where the protection of free speech is 
absent. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>National human rights institutions (NHRIs) likewise have an important 
potential role. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Local journalists and foreign correspondents play complementary roles. While 
</b>journalists based in their home countries have local legitimacy and offer an insider&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>view, foreign correspondents are often well placed to attract international attention. 
</b></p>
<p><b>While the local journalists are often more vulnerable, foreign correspondents may 
</b></p>
<p><b>prove to be more difficult to silence, and can in some cases continue to spread the 
</b></p>
<p><b>message. There is, however, an underappreciation of the dangers faced by local 
</b></p>
<p><b>journalists, and the fact that they are most at risk. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Threats against journalists and physical assaults should be regarded as early 
warning signals that more drastic measures may follow. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The statistics on impunity concerning the killing of journalists will be more 
compelling if they are compared to statistics concerning the general level of 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability for killings in that particular population.

<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>All relevant actors should pay continued and increased attention to the safety of 
journalists and violations of their right to life, as well as those of their families, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen efforts to elevate this issue to the international agenda. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites all international and domestic human rights 
bodies to consider adopting declarations, resolutions or other similar instruments that 
</b></p>
<p><b>highlight the important role of journalists and draw attention to the need to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>them from attack. In particular, the United Nations should set the example in this 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard, possibly in the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Efforts by all parties</b>&#8212;<b>intergovernmental organizations, Governments and 
NGOs</b>&#8212;<b>should be supported and strengthened to gather further information and data 
</b></p>
<p><b>on these killings and threats and to analyse the trends and developments, including in 
</b></p>
<p><b>a gender-sensitive way. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>When information-gathering on human rights violations is carried out in 
countries where future criminal prosecutions may be at stake, particular care should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be taken to preserve documentation and other evidence which could be of future use 
</b></p>
<p><b>in respect of accountability for the killing of journalists. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to States 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Unequivocal legal and practical protection of the freedom of expression is a 
prerequisite for the protection of journalists. Clear and effective safeguards to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>physical threats against journalists and to ensure accountability should be established 
</b></p>
<p><b>and regarded as a priority in terms of focus and resources. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>A clear public stand should be taken at the highest level of Government to 
condemn extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions of journalists and threats to 
</b></p>
<p><b>their lives, and to re-emphasize the important role of journalists in society. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>States have the obligation to conduct prompt and exhaustive investigations into 
all suspected cases of violations of the right to life of journalists and to identify and 
</b></p>
<p><b>bring to justice those responsible, not only the actual perpetrators but also the 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;<b>masterminds</b>&#8221;<b> who initiate the attacks. The investigations and judicial proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be conducted impartially, in the absence of improper influences, pressures, 
</b></p>
<p><b>threats or interferences. Statutes of limitation should not allow prosecutions to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>blocked. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>States where there is a pattern of killing of journalists should take special 
measures to address this issue, and should be scrutinized in respect of those measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the relevant human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>In countries where high incidences of attacks against journalists are reported, 
the investigations should be carried out by special investigative units with sufficient 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources and appropriate training to operate efficiently and effectively. Where there 
</b></p>
<p><b>is a possibility of undue influence by local authorities or other government bodies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>such an investigation should be moved to a different authority outside of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdiction or sphere of influence (for example, in appropriate cases, to the federal as 
</b></p>
<p><b>opposed to the state level). Independent complaints mechanisms have an important 
</b></p>
<p><b>role to play. </b></p>


<p>114. <b>States should pay special attention to facilitating the work of civil society and 
media organizations that deal with freedom of expression and the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>journalists. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Investigations into high-scale attacks against journalists may be assigned to 
commissions of inquiry when appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Journalists and their families should be given the opportunity to benefit from 
protection programmes, including witness protection programmes, which operate 
</b></p>
<p><b>efficiently and on a rapid-response basis. In countries where high incidences of attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b>against journalists are reported, States should seriously consider establishing special 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection programmes in consultation with civil society, journalists and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Diplomatic channels should be used to their full potential where the life of 
journalists is at stake, when journalists from a particular country are in State custody 
</b></p>
<p><b>in a foreign country. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Law enforcement officials and the armed forces should receive training, as part 
of standard procedure, on the legitimacy of the presence of journalists during non-
</b></p>
<p><b>armed and armed conflict and the legal protection for their safety. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>States should implement the recommendations on the safety of journalists made 
under the universal periodic review mechanism by human rights treaty bodies, United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations special procedures, and regional human rights mechanisms. States are 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to share their good practices in protecting the safety of journalists in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>national reports submitted during the second cycle of the universal periodic review. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>States should sign and ratify the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>States should fully cooperate with UNESCO, in particular in the preparation of 
the <i>Report on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity</i>, which is published 
</b></p>
<p><b>every two years. The record so far leaves much room for improvement. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>States should further strengthen their cooperation with the special procedures 
of the Human Rights Council and regional human rights mechanisms, and respond 
</b></p>
<p><b>and react to their communications in a timely manner. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>NHRIs likewise have an important role in addressing the protection of 
journalists. In particular, NHRIs that are based in the countries where a high number 
</b></p>
<p><b>of journalists are killed should take on the issue of the safety of journalists as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>priority concern. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to United Nations bodies and agencies 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites States and relevant United Nations bodies and 
agencies, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, to explore the need for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific United Nations instrument, for example a declaration, on the safety of 
</b></p>
<p><b>journalists that would emphasize the recognized obligations of States with regard to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the protection of the right to life and safety of journalists. In this regard, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur draws attention to the UNESCO Medell&#237;n Declaration on Securing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Safety of Journalists and Combating Impunity, and the Declaration on the Right and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the activities undertaken by a number of 
United Nations bodies and agencies towards enhancing the safety of journalists, and </b></p>


<p><b>encourages all relevant United Nations actors to pay continued and increased 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to the safety of journalists and to seek the implementation of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards from States. Collaboration in this regard</b>&#8212;<b>also among the relevant United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations special procedures and between the United Nations and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures</b>&#8212;<b>is of particular importance. 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>The Inter-Agency Meeting on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of 
Impunity, organized by UNESCO, should be held on a regular basis in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>explore possible avenues for cooperation and enhance coordination between the 
</b></p>
<p><b>various United Nations </b>agencies to address the issue of journalists&#8217; safety and<b> combat 
</b></p>
<p><b>the impunity of perpetrators of crimes against them. Constant information-sharing 
</b></p>
<p><b>among all relevant United Nations bodies and agencies could constitute an early 
</b></p>
<p><b>warning system against dangers to the right to life and physical safety of journalists. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>The Human Rights Council should follow up on the recommendations 
formulated during the first cycle of the universal periodic review regarding the safety 
</b></p>
<p><b>of journalists, reiterate the recommendations that have not been implemented, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>formulate additional recommendations where appropriate. Violations of the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>life of journalists should be further addressed and given increased attention at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>regular and special sessions of the Human Rights Council.</b> 
</p>
<p>128. <b>The adoption of Security Council resolution 1738 (2006), in which the Council 
called on all parties to an armed conflict to fulfil their obligations towards journalists 
</b></p>
<p><b>under international law, is a positive step. More awareness should be raised around 
</b></p>
<p><b>this resolution, and the Secretary-General could make increased use of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunity the resolution offers to report on the deaths of journalists in armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict to the Security Council. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>United Nations field presences should strengthen activities of technical 
assistance for national Governments in implementing domestic protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms in consultation with all stakeholders, and disseminate good practices to 
</b></p>
<p><b>other States and field offices. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes and draws attention to regional human 
rights initiatives and in particular the work of various regional mechanisms in respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the protection of the right to life of journalists. In addition to the general 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribution they make to the protection of journalists, these bodies also offer specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>entry points which can and should be accessed by journalists who consider themselves 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be in immediate danger, in order to obtain protective measures. Some of these are 
</b></p>
<p><b>listed in the emergency contact details document mentioned in paragraph 96 above. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Inter-American system, although it faces challenges, is the leader in respect of 
</b></p>
<p><b>precautionary measures, and the other systems will do well to study that experience. 
</b></p>
<p>131. <b>The European Court of Human Rights is a leader in respect of the norms 
applicable to accountability and fair trial, and the other international bodies are 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to take heed of its jurisprudence. 
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>Regional human rights bodies are encouraged to put the issue of the safety of 
journalists on the agenda through resolutions, declarations or other similar 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruments; to bring the matter to the attention of the regional intergovernmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations of which they form a part; and to engage with it in their respective 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures, especially through interim or precautionary measures. </b></p>


<p>133. <b>Regional organizations should strengthen their cooperation with the United 
Nations with a view to putting an end to such violations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to the International Committee of the Red Cross 
</b></p>
<p>134. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the valuable and important role of 
ICRC in protecting the life of journalists, and encourages ICRC to further address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>issue and to keep the relevant actors, including the Special Rapporteur, informed of 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations of particular concern for the life of journalists. 
</b></p>
<p>135. <b>The Special Rapporteur further encourages ICRC to disseminate materials on 
the application of international humanitarian law to the protection of journalists, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including available tools, training programmes and other measures of assistance, such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as the ICRC permanent hotline and e-mail to report missing, wounded or detained 
</b></p>
<p><b>journalists in need of assistance. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to non-State actors engaged in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>136. <b>Non-State actors should respect the obligations they incur in terms of 
international humanitarian law during armed conflict, also towards journalists. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to civil society 
</b></p>
<p>137. <b>Civil society plays a key role in monitoring the prevalence of killings of 
journalists, in terms of statistics and in drawing attention to specific cases. This is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>cause worthy of donor support. 
</b></p>
<p>138. <b>Civil society organizations should continue to monitor the situation with regard 
to the protection of journalists, in particular combining their efforts in support of 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations into killings and attacks against journalists and raising their concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b>not only at the national level, but also at the bilateral, regional and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels, using new technology. They should also consider consolidating their 
</b></p>
<p><b>documentation, for example through a central website/portal, enabling the provision 
</b></p>
<p><b>of information at the national and international levels for the general public. Statistics 
</b></p>
<p><b>on impunity in respect of the killing of journalists should be provided together with 
</b></p>
<p><b>figures on impunity for killings in general in a particular society, to allow comparison. 
</b></p>
<p>139. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on civil society to actively use the international 
and regional human rights machinery to focus attention on killings of journalists and 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations of concern. For the second cycle of the universal periodic review, civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society should report on the implementation or lack of implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations on the safety of journalists, and suggest possible recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>when appropriate. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur encourages civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations to submit relevant facts to the attention of relevant special procedures, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including requests for urgent appeals, and to help threatened journalists gain access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the available interim measures. 
</b></p>
<p>140. <b>Impact litigation at the national and international, including regional, levels 
should be used to develop the jurisprudence. 
</b></p>
<p>141. <b>Civil society should follow up on each UNESCO <i>Report on the Safety of 
Journalists and the Issue of Impunity</i> and monitor the accuracy of the information 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided by States. </b></p>


<p>142. <b>Since only a few NGOs with a special focus on media issues are represented in 
Geneva, the NGOs represented there with a more general focus should, where 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible, also include the safety of journalists on their agenda. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to media agencies and journalists 
</b></p>
<p>143. <b>The Special Rapporteur pays tribute to those local and foreign journalists who 
often face grave danger in their pursuit of truth. 
</b></p>
<p>144. <b>While recognizing the often competitive nature of the relationships among 
media workers worldwide, it is important to set competition aside where issues of 
</b></p>
<p><b>safety are involved. 
</b></p>
<p>145. <b>Media agencies should provide appropriate basic and advanced security 
training for journalists and media personnel. As appropriate, such training should 
</b></p>
<p><b>include training on the increasing complexities of reporting in armed conflicts or 
</b></p>
<p><b>dangerous zones. They should also provide safety and self-protection guidance for 
</b></p>
<p><b>their employees, giving them security equipment as necessary and offering training to 
</b></p>
<p><b>both their permanent and freelance employees. Safety training for journalists who 
</b></p>
<p><b>may face high-risk situations should be continued and, where possible, expanded. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Journalists, including freelance journalists, are encouraged to seek out safety training 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to take adequate measures to protect themselves. Protective gear where there is 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence is essential. 
</b></p>
<p>146. <b>The safety of journalists and measures to protect them should be given a 
central position within efforts for media reform worldwide. 
</b></p>
<p>147. <b>Journalists and/or their families are encouraged to report threats and/or 
violations of their right to life and seek assistance to address them, including by using 
</b></p>
<p><b>the emergency contacts mentioned in paragraph 96 above. 
</b></p>
<p>148. <b>The fairness, objectivity and professionalism of the reporting done by 
journalists in exercising their role of informing the world remains the bedrock of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>profession. Various media initiatives to maintain this credibility are welcomed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to protect the safety of online journalists 
</b></p>
<p>149. <b>All relevant actors, including States and international and national firms 
hosting social networks and blogs have the responsibility to protect the right of online 
</b></p>
<p><b>journalists to seek, receive and impart information without fearing for their physical 
</b></p>
