</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United 
Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also</i> by article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according 
to which everyone has the right to a nationality and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his or her nationality, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its resolutions 7/10 of 27 March 2008, 10/13 of 26 March 2009, 13/2 of 
24 March 2010, 20/4 of 5 July 2012 and 20/5 of 16 July 2012, as well as all previous 
resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, on the issue of human rights and 
the arbitrary deprivation of nationality, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> its resolution 19/9 of 22 March 2012, in which it took into 
consideration the fact that persons without birth registration may be vulnerable to 
statelessness and associated lack of protection, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the authority of States to establish laws governing the acquisition, 
renunciation or loss of nationality in accordance with international law, and noting that the 
issue of statelessness is already under consideration by the General Assembly within the 
broad issue of State succession, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> articles 7 and 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which 
guarantee the right of the child to be registered immediately after birth and to acquire 
nationality, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the provisions of other international human rights instruments and 
international instruments on statelessness and nationality recognizing the right to acquire, 
change or retain nationality or prohibiting arbitrary deprivation of nationality, inter alia, 
article 5, paragraph (d) (iii), of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, article 24, paragraph 3 of the International Covenant on 
</p>

<p>Civil and Political Rights, articles 1 to 3 of the Convention on the Nationality of Married 
Women, article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, article 18 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the Convention relating to the Status of 
Stateless Persons, as well as relevant regional instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting also</i> general recommendation No. 30 (2004) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality are protected by 
international human rights and refugee law, as well as by instruments on statelessness, 
including, with respect to State parties, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless 
Persons and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair 
and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 68/141 of 18 December 2013, in which the 
Assembly, inter alia, urged the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees to continue its work with regard to identifying stateless persons, preventing and 
reducing statelessness and protecting stateless persons,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the intergovernmental event organized by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on 7 December 2011 marking the sixtieth 
anniversary of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and the fiftieth anniversary of the 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, which guarantees the right of the child to be 
registered immediately after birth and to acquire nationality, and welcoming the ongoing 
implementation of pledges made by States at the said event in the field of the reduction of 
statelessness, prevention of statelessness and protection of stateless persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the call of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to 
eradicate statelessness within 10 years, including by preventing new situations of arbitrary 
deprivation of nationality and resolving existing situations of statelessness, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 of 3 
December 1986, of the call upon all States to promote human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and to refrain from denying them to individuals in their populations because of 
nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or language, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions on the issue of the nationality of natural 
persons in relation to the succession of States, in particular resolutions 55/153 of 12 
December 2000, 59/34 of 2 December 2004, 63/118 of 11 December 2008 and 66/92 of 9 
December 2011, in which the Assembly invited States to take into account the provisions of 
the articles on nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States prepared 
by the International Law Commission in dealing with issues of nationality of natural 
persons in relation to the succession of States, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that arbitrary deprivation of nationality disproportionately affects 
persons belonging to minorities, and recalling the work done by the Special Rapporteur on 
minority issues on the subject of the right to nationality, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the arbitrary deprivation of persons or groups of 
persons of their nationality, especially on discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
other status, </p>


<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that incidents of discriminatory deprivation of nationality, including 
without clear legislative basis or for which a legislative basis was exceptionally created, 
have been a source of widespread suffering and statelessness in the past, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that some of the situations mentioned above remain unresolved to this day 
and have led to intergenerational statelessness, which affects the children and grandchildren 
of those originally deprived of their nationality, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that arbitrarily depriving a person of his or her nationality may lead to 
statelessness, and in this regard expressing concern at various forms of discrimination 
against stateless persons that may violate the obligations of States under international 
human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons whose 
nationality may be affected by State succession must be fully respected, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the right to a nationality of every human person is a 
fundamental human right enshrined in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reiterates</i> that arbitrary deprivation of nationality, especially on 
discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status is a violation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also reiterates</i> that the prevention and reduction of statelessness are primarily 
the responsibility of States, in appropriate cooperation with the international community; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to refrain from taking discriminatory measures and from 
enacting or maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their 
nationality on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, especially if such measures and 
legislation render a person stateless; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> all States to adopt and implement nationality legislation with a view to 
avoiding statelessness, consistent with the principles of international law, in particular by 
preventing arbitrary deprivation of nationality and statelessness as a result of State 
succession; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Notes</i> that the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of an individual might be impeded as a result of arbitrary deprivation of nationality, and 
that such individuals are placed in a situation of increased vulnerability to human rights 
violations; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality may be 
affected by poverty, social exclusion and limited legal capacity, which have an adverse 
impact on their enjoyment of relevant civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
in particular in the areas of education, housing, employment, health and social security; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reaffirms</i> that every child has the right to acquire a nationality, and 
recognizes the special needs of children for protection against arbitrary deprivation of 
nationality; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Stresses</i> that children deprived of nationality and stateless children are at 
greater risk of particular forms of human rights violations, such as trafficking and other 
forms of exploitation; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Urges</i> all States to prevent statelessness through legislative and other 
measures aimed at ensuring that all children are registered immediately after birth and have 
the right to acquire a nationality and that individuals do not become stateless thereafter; </p>


<p>11. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Secretary-General submitted in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 20/51 and the conclusions contained therein; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Calls upon</i> States to observe minimum procedural standards in order to 
ensure that decisions concerning the acquisition, deprivation or change of nationality do not 
contain any element of arbitrariness and are subject to review, in conformity with their 
international human rights obligations; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Emphasizes</i> that where States take any measure that would render individuals 
stateless by depriving them of nationality, they should endeavour to do so in a limited 
manner; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Urges</i> States in regulating loss and deprivation of nationality to ensure 
incorporation in their domestic law of safeguards to prevent statelessness; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that such safeguards are implemented and access 
of persons arbitrarily deprived of their nationality to effective remedies, including, but not 
limited to, restoration of nationality, is provided; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to consider whether loss or deprivation of nationality is 
proportionate to the interest to be protected by the loss or deprivation, including in the light 
of the severe impact of statelessness, and to consider alternative measures that could be 
adopted; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Urges</i> States to refrain from automatically extending the loss or deprivation 
of nationality to a person&#8217;s dependents; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Encourages</i> States to grant their nationality to persons who had habitual 
residence in their territory before it was affected by the succession of States, especially if 
those persons would otherwise become stateless; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Also</i> <i>encourages</i> States to consider acceding to the Convention relating to the 
Status of Stateless Persons and the Convention on the Reduction on Statelessness if they 
have not already done so; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Welcomes</i> the ongoing efforts made in the field of reduction of statelessness 
and combating arbitrary deprivation of nationality by different United Nations bodies and 
entities and human rights treaty bodies, and calls on them to follow in this work the 
guidance note of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;The United Nations and Statelessness&#8221; and 
the guidelines on statelessness issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Urges</i> relevant United Nations human rights mechanisms and appropriate 
treaty bodies and encourages the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees to continue to collect information on the issue of human rights and arbitrary 
deprivation of nationality from all relevant sources, and to take account of such 
information, together with any recommendations thereon, in their reports and activities 
conducted within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General, in consultation with States, United Nations 
agencies and other relevant stakeholders, to prepare a report on the impact that the arbitrary 
deprivation of nationality has on the enjoyment of the rights of children concerned, as well 
as on the existing laws and practices on accessibility for children to acquire nationality, 
inter alia, of the country in which they are born, if they otherwise would be stateless, and to 
present it to the Human Rights Council before its thirty-first session; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>23. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this issue in 2016 in accordance with its 
programme of work. 
</p>
<p><i>38th meeting 
26 June 2014
