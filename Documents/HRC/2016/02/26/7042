<p> The Human Rights Council, taking into account the report of the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism (E/CN.4/2006/98 and 
Add.1) and recalling the duty of all States to respect and comply with their obligations under 
international law, in particular human rights law and international humanitarian law, while 
countering terrorism, decides to urge all States to take all necessary steps to ensure that persons 
detained by them, regardless of the place of arrest or detention, benefit from the guarantees to 
which they are entitled under international law, including access to a judge, respect for fair trial 
principles and protection against torture and humiliating or degrading treatment.
