<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
</p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
practice visited China from 12 to 19 December 2013 at the invitation of the Government. 
The Chairperson-Rapporteur, Frances Raday, and Kamala Chandrakirana, participated in 
the visit.  
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with its mandate, as contained in Human Rights Council resolutions 
15/23 and 20/6, the objectives of the Group were to engage in dialogue with the 
Government and other stakeholders on the issue of eliminating discrimination against 
women in law and in practice; to identify good practices in the elimination of laws that 
discriminate against women or are discriminatory in terms of their implementation or 
impact; and to make recommendations on ways and means to advance women&#8217;s equality 
and empower them. It focused, in particular, on the issue of women&#8217;s economic and social 
life, which is the priority theme of the Working Group for 2013&#8211;2014.  
</p>
<p>3. The Group held consultations in Beijing, Shanghai and Xishuangbanna Dai 
Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan province,1 with Government officials, local authorities, 
national and local civil society organizations and academics, grass-roots women community 
leaders and representatives of the United Nations agencies. Due to the immensity of the 
country &#8211; in population size, geographic expanse and global significance &#8211; the Group 
regrets that it was given only eight working days to conduct its visit to China. It is 
encouraged, however, by the overall openness of China to the special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council, as illustrated by the invitation extended to the Group and the 
signalling of interest in receiving visits from three other mandate holders announced at the 
last universal periodic review of China in October 2013.  
</p>
<p>4. The Group expresses its sincere gratitude to the Government for its cooperation in 
ensuring the success of the visit. It is grateful to United Nations and other interlocutors for 
their support during the mission. It looks forward to continued engagement with the 
Government and other stakeholders on the issue of gender equality and women&#8217;s human 
rights and on the implementation of its recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b>5. China has a long and rich history of culture, language, art, political philosophy and 
experience of different phases of development. The 1949 revolution granted women equal 
rights to education and employment and a philosophy of equality was reflected in the 
concept that women hold up half of the sky. In the past 30 years, China has undergone 
impressive and successive cycles of reform, resulting in an exceptionally swift growth in 
GDP,2 an admirable reduction in the poverty rate between 1981 and 2009 and a notable rise 
in its human development index.3 China has made remarkable progress in achieving nearly

 The Working Group was also due to visit a domestic violence shelter and a project addressing 
</p>
<p>trafficking for labour exploitation in Kunming, Yunnan province; however, these visits were 
cancelled due to bad weather. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Although GDP has increased overall during the past three decades, it has been falling since 2010, see

</p>
<p>half of the Millennium Development Goals by the end of 20134 and has surpassed one 
target aimed at promoting gender equality, namely increasing the level of education for 
girls.5 Many predict a 75 per cent reduction in the maternal mortality rate before 2015.6  
</p>
<p>6. At the same time, China is facing the challenge of demographic change on an 
unprecedented scale, both in rapid rural-urban labour migration and in an increasingly 
ageing society. The gap between urban and rural Chinese is widening and urban incomes 
are now estimated to be more than three times higher than rural incomes.7 These trends are, 
undoubtedly, major features of the Chinese economy today and have distinct implications 
for women, who assume a major burden of care both for children and the elderly.  
</p><p>7. The visit of the Working Group coincided with a pivotal moment in the reform 
cycle, after the agenda for reform was announced at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in November 2013.  
</p>
<p>8. Key aspects of this reform include the establishment of a unified, open, competitive 
and ordered market system; building a service-orientated Government based upon the rule 
of law; and accelerating reform in sectors such as education, employment, income 
distribution, social security and public health.  
</p>
<p>9. Anticipating the intensification of the transition to a market economy, the Group 
considers that, along with the opportunities which may open up for women&#8217;s employment, 
there is an  inherent risk of a negative impact on women, as such transitions have generally 
involved privatization, a reduction in public service jobs and a reduction or privatization of  
public care services for dependent children and sick or disabled adults. These changes have 
a disparate impact on women who are the primary givers of unpaid care.. Hence, it 
particularly welcomes the intention, articulated in the reform agenda of 2013, to distribute 
the gains of the past 30 years equitably and increase the social protection floors for all and 
notes that this policy is of particular importance for the welfare and empowerment of 
women.  
</p>
<p>10. The Group also welcomes the loosening of the one-child policy which, although 
targeted at parents in general and not exclusively at mothers, has resulted in some serious 
violations of women&#8217;s reproductive health and physical integrity.  
</p>
<p>11. The Group notes that the reform agenda emphasizes elements of the General 
Programme of the Constitution, calling for ethnic harmonization and equality; however it 
lacks equal vigour with respect to gender. It draws attention to the need for the achievement 
of gender equality and the empowerment of women and points to risks arising from current 
demographic and economic trends.  
</p>
<p>12. Given the minimal  emphasis on gender at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th 
Central Committee, the framework for gender reform is based largely on existing policy 
frameworks which include goals and policies for  gender equality. Under section III of the 
National Human Rights Action Plan (2012&#8211;2015), the State guarantees protection of the 
rights and interests of ethnic minorities, women, children, the elderly and the disabled. It 
reaffirms its commitment to promoting gender equality, guaranteeing the lawful rights and 
interests of women through advancing the equal participation of women in the management

<p>of State and social affairs, eliminating gender discrimination in employment and realizing 
equal pay for equal work. This is reconfirmed in chapter 36 of the outline of the Twelfth 
Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development (2011&#8211;2015) which 
emphasizes the commitment of the Government to strengthening women&#8217;s labour 
protection, social welfare and poverty relief, and eliminating violence against women and 
the Chinese Women&#8217;s Development Programme (2011-2020), whose objective is to achieve 
gender equality in seven fields, including health, education and social security. 
</p>
<p>13. The Group notes that the Government is deeply aware that full achievement of the 
enjoyment of human rights is a work in progress and that the Government faces many 
challenges in this regard. The Government has indicated that it supports the view that 
genuine dialogue and a meaningful process of engagement in both international and 
national forums are key to addressing these challenges. The hosting by China of the Fourth 
World Conference on Women in Beijing nearly 20 years ago remains a historic milestone 
for the growth and development of women&#8217;s rights movements and organizations globally 
and in China.  
</p>
<p>14. The Group welcomes the growing openness of China to global engagement and its 
ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Equal Remuneration Convention 
No. 100 (1951), ILO Convention No. 111 (1958) concerning Discrimination in Respect of 
Employment and Occupation and ILO Convention No. 138 (1973) concerning the 
Minimum Age for Admission to Employment. This international legal framework provides 
a solid foundation for continued progress in achieving full enjoyment of women&#8217;s rights 
and gender equality in China.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework for equality and the human rights of 
women 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Achievements 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Working Group welcomes the guarantee of gender equality in the Constitution 
as enshrined in article 48, which establishes the principle of equality between women and 
men in the enjoyment of political, economic, social and cultural rights, including family 
life. It also welcomes the affirmation of this principle in a series of laws.  
</p>
<p>16. The Group commends the significant strides that have been made towards putting in 
place a framework of law and policies to eliminate discrimination against women and notes 
that its greatest progress in legislation is in the fields of employment, social security and 
matrimonial law. The Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women as 
amended in 2005, stipulates, inter alia, that the State has the responsibility to prevent all 
discrimination against women, to take measures to gradually improve the systems for 
protecting their rights and interests and to guarantee their enjoyment of equal rights with 
men to work and to social security, equal pay for equal work and equal welfare benefits. It 
also states that women have equal rights to inherit and own land.  
</p>
<p>17. The Labour Law of 1995 and the Law on the Promotion of Employment of 2007 
give workers the right to choose a job freely and provide that those seeking employment 
will not be subject to discrimination based on factors such as ethnicity, race, gender or 
religious belief. Furthermore, employers must not include any provision in an employment 
contract that discriminates against women on grounds of marriage or childbirth. The Labour 
Contract Law of 2008 stipulates that the formation of a labour contract must be based, inter </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>alia, on the principles of lawfulness, fairness and equality. The Marriage Law, as amended 
in 2001, states that marriage is to be based on equality between men and women and the 
freedom to choose a partner, and the rights and interests of women must be protected.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Provisions on the Labour Protection of Female Employees of 2012 
improve on the special measures for pregnancy and maternity rights. Those provisions 
impose, for the first time, an obligation on employers to prevent sexual harassment of 
female employees in the workplace.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Working Group notes that, despite an impressive existing framework of law and 
policies for the elimination of discrimination against women, gaps remain in de facto 
equality, as a result of persistent discriminatory practices and stereotypes. There is currently 
no definition of sex discrimination in employment and hence there is no legal prohibition in 
line with the definition of discrimination against women in article 1 of the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>20. . Furthermore, efforts to promote women&#8217;s equality have been largely protective, 
preserving minimum standards for women in employment conditions, maternity, 
matrimony and old age, with less focus on concrete measures or policies to empower 
women to participate in decision-making and leadership positions. </p>
<p>21. The Group notes that existing anti-discrimination legislation does not provide access 
to judicial or administrative agencies for its implementation. There are no provisions which 
facilitate action by victims of discrimination to enforce their rights under those laws, such 
as the possibility of class actions, the submission of claims by civil society organizations, 
shifting the burden of proof to the defendant, punitive compensation, or regulations to 
protect plaintiffs or witnesses against retaliation. This seriously impedes enforceability of 
the legislative anti-discrimination framework nationwide.  
</p>
<p>22. The Group was informed that the inadequate implementation of laws prohibiting 
discrimination against women is partly due to the fact that some of the national legal 
provisions are not considered sufficiently concrete to provide a cause of action, resulting in 
a lack of accountability.  </p>
<p>23. The Group was informed that the Government enacts anti-discrimination laws as 
guidelines, which will then be propagated as enforceable rights through the agency of the 
provinces, which can interpret, apply and render them enforceable.. The Group 
acknowledges the important role of the provincial level in spearheading changes in laws 
and regulations related to women&#8217;s rights. It notes that measures to promote equality have 
often originated in the provinces, or are transformed there from national guidelines to 
enforceable laws and regulations. However, the Group wishes to emphasize that the 
ultimate responsibility for the implementation of the human rights of women falls on the 
State itself, which has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, and the State must respect, protect and fulfil these rights 
throughout its entire territory. </p>
<p>24. The Group welcomes the fact that China is currently drafting a law against domestic 
violence and emphasizes the importance of bringing effective legislative measures into 
force to prevent, prosecute and punish perpetrators and protect victims as soon as possible, 
through the establishment of effective protection orders removing the perpetrator from the 
home and providing adequate shelters and redress for victims.  
</p>
<p>25. Beyond this, the Group observes the need for additional legislation to address 
violence against women and girls in all its forms and contexts. Although the Criminal Law, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>as amended in 1997, contains provisions prohibiting violence such as rape, there is a need 
for targeted measures to prevent, prosecute and punish perpetrators and to protect and 
provide redress for women and girls who are victims of violence in all contexts, including 
in schools, in the public arena and if perpetrated against individuals because of their sexual 
orientation. The Group stresses the importance of prohibiting sexual intercourse with girls 
under the age of 16, marital rape and female infanticide.  
</p>
<p>26. While the Group commends China on the comprehensive equality provisions in its 
Marriage Law, it is concerned that, in practice, women may lose property rights as a result 
of cultural practices which invest ownership of property in the husband. Furthermore, it 
notes an interpretation of the Marriage Law issued by the Supreme People&#8217;s Court in 
August 2011, which states that after divorce, marital property belongs solely to the person 
who took out a mortgage and registered that mortgage as the home owner. That appears on 
the surface to be a gender-neutral provision, introduced for the purpose of administrative 
efficiency but, in effect, it causes indirect discrimination, as it is usually husbands who are 
registered as owners.  
</p>
<p>27. The Group finds that mediation is the mechanism of choice to resolve conflicts in 
China, which is deeply rooted in Chinese social tradition. All stakeholders with whom the 
Group met during its visit, including most civil society organizations, regarded mediation 
as a useful and effective way of resolving disputes. It is viewed as having the advantage of 
speed, achieving agreement by both parties and hence enforceability. Various stakeholders 
explained that prevailing stigma against women who bring cases to court means that even 
when a woman employee wins her case, she may still lose in practice: in the workplace, she 
may have no choice but to quit if her employer opposes the judgement; in the context of 
disputes involving family property, she risks ostracism by her family.  
</p>
<p>28. The Group was informed that another reason for a lack of willingness to go to court 
was a perception in the legal community and in civil society organizations that potential 
plaintiffs are deterred by the lack of gender responsiveness of the judiciary, prosecution 
officials and lawyers. In view of such reservations regarding the judicial process, the Group 
sees an urgent need for an urgent need for capacity building and gender sensitivity 
programs for law enforcement officers, including judges, along with targeted legal 
education and empowerment programmes for women. 
</p>
<p>29. In view of the low level of access by women to judicial or administrative 
determination of discrimination cases, sees an urgent need to establish specialised 
administrative agencies to resolve complaints of discrimination on the basis of women&#8217;s 
right to equality established in the law.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30. The Group is cognizant of the fact that the Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China 
on Guarding State Secrets, as amended in 2010, and the regulations on the implementation 
of this law of 2014, restrict the publication of specific information on, inter alia, women&#8217;s 
work and family planning. The Group emphasizes the fact that this information should be 
publicly accessible in order to enable enforcement of the laws affecting gender equality, to 
carry out the policy of the Communist Party on the rule of law and to facilitate effective 
action by civil society organizations and individuals regarding the elimination of 
discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>31. The All-China Women&#8217;s Federation is a mass umbrella organization dedicated to the 
advancement of Chinese women, with a large national network at the provincial, township </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>and village levels. The Working Group appreciates the singular and important role of the 
Federation in society for addressing the special needs of women, e.g., establishing childcare 
service networks, training for employment and promoting women&#8217;s political participation. 
It also appreciates the efforts of the Federation, especially in collaboration with autonomous 
women&#8217;s rights organizations, to raise awareness of women&#8217;s legal rights through the media 
and provide legal assistance, such as that provided in conjunction with the Ministry of 
Justice to women at 61,000 clinics nationwide.  
</p>
<p>32. The National Working Committee on Children and Women is a State Council 
organization in charge of encouraging the relevant government departments to implement 
laws and regulations and policy-related measures concerning women and children, and 
coordinating those efforts.  
</p>
<p>33. The Group noted during its visit that there is no special mechanism consisting of 
independent experts, such as an equal opportunities commission (except in Hong Kong) or 
a national human rights institution, to monitor the gender impact of existing laws and 
policies, address individual complaints from women who experience discrimination, 
provide input into the drafting of new laws and policies or recommend an agenda for 
change. Such institutions are essential to promote and protect the human rights of women, 
which have been enshrined in the constitution, laws and policy frameworks of China.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Participation of women in economic and social life 
</b></p>
<p>34. The economic transformation of the past three decades has had a considerable 
impact on two central aspects of women&#8217;s lives: employment and care responsibilities.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>35. Under the centrally planned economy, the participation of women in the labour force 
became very high, giving them access to a wide range of social services and benefits, which 
enabled them to combine the double burden of paid work and unpaid care. Although that 
participation has declined from 73 per cent in 1990, it is still among the highest in the 
world, with 64 per cent of the female population aged over 15 participating in the labour 
force in 2010.8 Women have also moved into lower-paid and lower-skilled jobs or the 
informal sector.9 This decline in the level of women&#8217;s employment has occurred in the 
context of serious reductions in State provision of care services, making it difficult for 
women to reconcile paid work and unpaid care for children, the elderly and the sick which, 
in China, as elsewhere, is predominantly the responsibility of women. Furthermore, the 
Working Group was informed there has also been a re-emergence of traditional values, 
pressurizing women to withdraw from the labour market when they marry and have a child.  
</p>
<p>36. The Group appreciates the fact a comprehensive legislative framework to prevent 
discrimination against women in employment and create minimum employment standards 
has been established. It commends the Government for introducing a minimum wage,  
which varies according to the different costs of living in the provinces, municipalities or 
regions..

</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Maternity protection 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Working Group welcomes the Special Provisions on the Labour Protection of 
Female Employees of 2012, which increase the length of maternity leave from 90 to 98 
days, in line with the minimum required by ILO Convention No. 183 (2000) concerning the 
revision of the Maternity Protection Convention (Revised), 1952; require the payment of 
maternity allowance during maternity leave; impose stricter penalties for failure to pay 
maternity insurance contributions; and exempt female employees from working overtime or 
at night from the seventh month of pregnancy or if they are nursing. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Women executives and entrepreneurs 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Group notes the sharp rise in women holding senior management positions from 
25 per cent in 2012 to 51 per cent in 2013.10 However, it observes that this rapid rise, 
particularly of women chief executives, does not apply to State-owned companies and is of 
the opinion that the reason for this discrepancy should be researched and reviewed. It notes 
the commitment of the Communist Party under article 33 of the Constitution to the training 
of women cadres and cadres from ethnic minorities. It also acknowledges the work done in 
Shanghai by the women&#8217;s cadre school, which provides a platform to connect women 
entrepreneurs with each other and promote an exchange of knowledge on a range of issues 
linked to establishing and managing a business.  
</p>
<p><b>3. Discrimination in recruitment, wages and dismissals 
</b></p>
<p>39. However, the Group is concerned at information that it received during its visit 
regarding discrimination against women in terms of recruitment, wages and dismissals. It 
welcomes the statement made by the Government of China during the discussion under 
item 28 of the agenda on the advancement of women at the Third Committee of the sixty-
eighth session of the General Assembly that &#8220;Governments should take measures in legal, 
administrative, educational and social fields in an integrated manner to eliminate 
employment discrimination&#8230;and safeguard the rights and interests of women workers.&#8221;11  
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group noted evidence of sex-based discriminatory job advertisements 
in 13 per cent of employment advertisements examined.12 In a survey in 2011, 61.5 per cent 
of female students stated that they had experienced discrimination in the job-hunting 
process. Many reported that they did not know which authority to complain to, or believed 
that it was not worth filing a complaint when they experienced sex discrimination.13 
</p>
<p>41. The Group welcomes, however, the successful outcome in 2013 of what is believed 
to be the first anti-discrimination lawsuit in China, brought by a law professor on behalf of 
a female graduate who had been rejected by a private tutoring firm on the basis that it 
required a man for the post who could carry out physical tasks such as refilling the bottle on 
a water dispenser. A settlement was reached in favour of the female applicant and damages 
of 30,000 yuan were awarded. 
</p>
<p>42. The Group notes that the gender pay gap has been increasing during the past two 
decades,14 especially in rural areas and the private sector. It notes that  the wage gap has not

<p>increased in State-owned enterprises, which indicates that further privatization is likely to 
increase the gap overall. Furthermore, occupational gender-based segregation in the labour 
market, both horizontal and vertical, constitutes a major factor in the wage gap. Women are 
concentrated in the lower-paid professions and sectors.  
</p>
<p>43. The Group further notes that, although there is a legislative obligation on employers 
to provide equal pay for equal work, this does not include equal pay for work of equal value 
as required by ILO Convention No. 100. Equal pay for work of equal value is fundamental 
to tackling occupational gender-based segregation in the labour market, because it permits a 
comparison of the economic contribution of women and men and prevents discrimination 
against feminized sectors or occupations.  
</p>
<p>44. The Group is particularly concerned at the prevalence of discrimination on the 
grounds of maternity, with employers avoiding their obligation to pay maternity leave 
benefits by employing only women who already have children, not paying the statutory 98-
day maternity leave, or dismissing women during pregnancy or when they are breast-
feeding. It commends the intervention by the All-China Women&#8217;s Federation in supporting 
complaints from women employees threatened with discriminatory treatment of this kind 
and, where necessary, in referring cases to the labour inspectorate.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Mandatory retirement and pensions 
</b></p>
<p>45. As recognized in general recommendation No. 27 (2010) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women on older women and protection of their 
human rights, an additional obstacle to the equal participation of women in the workforce is 
their mandatory early retirement ages. The Group notes that the statutory retirement age is 
60 for men and 50 for women (55 for female civil servants). This restricts women&#8217;s wage-
earning years and opportunities for career betterment and promotion and increases their risk 
of poverty in old age. In the 50&#8211;54 age range, 75 per cent of men are working, compared to 
less than 45 per cent of women.15 In December 2013, the Ministry of Human Resources and 
Social Security announced plans to increase the retirement age for women and men 
progressively.  The Group welcomes ensuring women&#8217;s right to continue to work to the 
same age as men and notes that it is important to ensure that decent work is available for 
older women, or they have an option of early retirement,otherwise increasing their 
retirement age may increase their vulnerability to poverty.  
</p>
<p>46. The Working Group notes with appreciation the rural social pension scheme 
introduced in 2009, together with other pension schemes, providing 60 per cent of those 
aged over 60 with a monthly pension.16 In 2011, the urban social pension scheme was 
established, thus achieving universal coverage. However, as has been recognized by the 
Government, the level of pensions remains low and arguably inadequate as a minimum 
income for older age, and needs to be raised, particularly for rural women.17 Indeed, the 
pension benefit level relative to GDP per capita remains low in comparison to international 
standards.

<p><b> 5. Trade unions 
</b></p>
<p>47. Article 7 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women requires 
trade unions to strive to protect women&#8217;s rights and interests. The Working Group 
welcomes this provision in the law, but was informed that trade unions lack real 
independence and effectiveness.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Care economy 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Child care  
</b></p>
<p>48. China established a public childcare system under central planning, which 
contributed significantly to the high level of participation of women in the labour force. 
However, the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy has led to a decline 
in publicly funded childcare and rising childcare costs in private kindergartens. The 
Working Group notes that, as women bear the burden of childcare, this has a detrimental 
impact on women&#8217;s ability to engage in the labour force, particularly for low- and middle-
income families, except for those who have parents or grandparents available to take care of 
the children.  
</p>
<p>49. The Group commends the work carried out by the Shanghai chapter of the All-China 
Women&#8217;s Federation, which resulted in the establishment of a State-funded pilot project 
aimed at helping professional women gain access to affordable, quality childcare services 
for children aged 0-3 years.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Care of parents  
</b></p>
<p>50. Article 49 of the Constitution affirms that children have a duty to support and assist 
their parents. The requirement of care for the elderly in an increasingly ageing population 
presents a serious barrier to women&#8217;s equal access to economic opportunities, as women are 
the primary caregivers for the elderly, both parents and parents-in-law.18 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>51. Economic growth, coupled with the privatization of care services and an ageing 
population, have led to a rapid extension of the market for domestic and care services. 
According to the ILO, there were approximately 20 million domestic workers and 600,000 
domestic service agencies in China in 2009;19 however, there is a lack of data on current 
numbers. Approximately 90 per cent of domestic workers are women, who are either from 
rural areas or who have been laid off in urban centres. Most have a low level of education 
and are exposed to a high risk of exploitation, sexual harassment and forced labour.  
</p>
<p>52. The Group notes the advocacy work carried out by the All-China Women&#8217;s 
Federation on safeguarding the rights and interests of women domestic workers. It also 
appreciates the model training school for domestic workers, which it visited in Shanghai.

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>53.  The Working Group is concerned that there are no legislative provisions governing 
the working conditions of domestic workers, which leaves them with no guarantee of a 
minimum wage, maximum working hours or social security. </p>
<p>54. The Group notes the advocacy work carried out, inter alia, by the All-China 
Women&#8217;s Federation on safeguarding the rights and interests of women in the domestic 
work sector, including by providing domestic workers with vocational training programmes 
and certificates. It refers, in particular, to the the model training school for domestic 
workers, which it visited in Shanghai. It further notes the efforts made to regulate 
recruitment agencies dealing with domestic work, conduct inspections and promote the 
signing of contracts. However, it also notes that China has not yet ratified ILO Convention 
No. 189 (2011) concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers and encourages it to apply 
the labour law standards contained therein.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to assets including land, housing and inheritance 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Working Group notes that, according to a survey carried out in 2011, only 17 
per cent of existing land contracts and just over one third of existing land certificates 
included women&#8217;s names.20 Most rural women are not aware of their legal rights in relation 
to land and rarely request that their names be included in land registration. 
</p>
<p>56. The Group observes that, although women account for between 60 and 70 per cent 
of all farm labour and rely on agriculture for their subsistence, 70 per cent of the rural 
landless are women. It is concerned at the lack of security of tenure for many rural women, 
a significant proportion of whom have lost their land shares since the 1990s through 
government redistribution or widowhood.21  
</p>
<p>57. Village committees often exercise their discretionary powers to allocate land in 
accordance with traditional norms, whereby women who marry someone from another 
village are considered as &#8220;married-out&#8221;, leaving them in a precarious situation regarding 
land rights. There is no institution or mechanism to review such decisions. However, the 
Group commends some local governments and women&#8217;s organizations, which have 
amended village rules to ensure that married-out women retain their land rights in their own 
family villages and have applied judicial procedures to enforce compliance.22 
</p><p>58. As noted in paragraph 25 above, recent judicial interpretation of the Marriage Law 
allocates the matrimonial home to the registered owner, who is traditionally the husband, 
and this continues in spite of increasing contributions by the families of brides to its 
purchase. This has limited women&#8217;s ownership of housing. The Group was told that some 
women are purchasing housing before marriage to avoid the consequences of this 
interpretation. However, a solution for women who do not take such an initiative is lacking. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Girls&#8217; education 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Working Group commends the Compulsory Education Law, as amended in 
2006, which provides children, regardless of sex, ethnic status, family financial conditions 
or religious belief, with nine years of free compulsory education. This was achieved in

<p>2008 for girls and boys in urban and rural areas, with a net enrolment ratio for both boys 
and girls of 99.8 per cent.23 However, the Group is concerned at reports that some colleges 
in China have lowered the minimum pass scores for entrance examinations in certain 
subjects for males only, thereby discriminating against female candidates.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Participation of women in political and public life 
</b></p>
<p>60. The development of policy and social norms by the Government and the Communist 
Party has not led to the empowerment of women in political and public life. This is 
especially apparent in the low percentage of women at high levels of decision-making, both 
at the national and provincial levels. The Working Group emphasizes the fact that the 
empowerment of women in political and public life is an integral aspect of achieving 
national goals and dreams of China. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Group is concerned that, in the executive branch, the participation of women is 
exceptionally low, especially at the highest levels. Only one woman serves as a vice-
premier and there are no women in the most powerful decision-making body, the Standing 
Committee of the Central Politburo. According to reports, of the 31 governors and 31 party 
secretaries at the provincial level, only one is a woman. Within the Communist Party, 
women account for 17.3 per cent of the total membership. Two women currently serve on 
the twenty-five member Central Politburo of the Communist Party, while no figures are 
available on the number of women on the Central Committee of the Party, which comprises 
204 members and 167 alternates. 
</p>
<p>62. Women currently account for 23 per cent of the legislative branch, the National 
People&#8217;s Congress, placing China 62nd in the world in terms of percentage of women in the 
legislature.24 That is a record number following a decision in 2007 of the 10th Congress, at 
which a target minimum of 22 per cent was established. The Electoral Law of the National 
People&#8217;s Congress, the Local People&#8217;s Congresses and the Law on the Protection of Rights 
and Interests of Women merely stipulate that there shall be &#8220;an appropriate number&#8221; of 
women among deputies to the NPC and local people&#8217;s congresses at various levels, and that 
the proportion thereof shall be raised gradually, without specific policy measures to ensure 
a consistent and progressive increase. 
</p>
<p>63. The Organic Law of the Villagers Committees, as amended in 2010, requires a quota 
for women&#8217;s participation in the villagers&#8217; representative assemblies, in which more than 
one third of the places are allocated to women. Those women hold primarily administrative 
functions. The Group is concerned that legal guarantees on women&#8217;s political participation 
is confined only to the lowest level of Government.  
</p>
<p>64. The Group takes note of the growing openness of the Government to civil society 
organizations and its acceptance of recommendations made during its first universal 
periodic review in 2009 to strengthen its engagement with civil society to promote and 
protect human rights. The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee recognized 
the role of civil society and social organizations in governance and the need for greater 
cooperation between those actors and the Government, encouraging the Government to 
contract out services to social organizations, make it easier for them to register and increase 
the tax advantages for charitable donations.

<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>65. The Group emphasizes the need for the immediate implementation of these policies 
as a matter of urgency, particularly in the light of the rapid expansion of civil society 
organizations, including the autonomous group of women&#8217;s non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) catalysed by the Fourth Women&#8217;s Conference and NGO Forum held 
in Beijing in 1995. They include centres for women&#8217;s studies in research institutes and 
universities, self-organized service providers and advocacy organizations that monitor 
implementation of China&#8217;s laws and policies, including its human rights obligations. In 
recent years, young women have been increasingly using social media as a means of 
expression and public engagement on major social, economic and political issues, including 
in campaigning against discriminatory practices. 
</p>
<p>66. While the Group recognizes that reforms in this sector are ongoing, certain 
challenges require attention. The Group received reports of autonomous advocacy groups 
being forced to close and register as profit-based organizations, subject to commercial taxes 
and seizure of assets, rather than registering as non-profit organizations.  
</p>
<p>67. The Group expresses its deep concern at reports of repressive measures, mostly 
judicial in nature, including arrest, administrative detentions and prevention of freedom of 
movement, taken against women who seek to advance human  rights. It regrets the death of 
Cao Shunli, despite urgent calls for adequate medical attention during her time in detention, 
including that of the Working Group during its visit to China.25 The Group notes that the 
Government accepted a recommendation<b> </b>during the second cycle of the universal periodic 
review, according to which it would ensure that its citizens could freely engage in the 
universal periodic review process (A/HRC/25/5, para. 186.61). The Group emphasizes that 
the goal of gender equality cannot be fulfilled in China unless women&#8217;s rights defenders 
can function in an environment of freedom and transparency in national and international 
forums. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Women facing multiple forms of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Rural and migrant women 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Working Group appreciates the attention paid by the Government to the special 
needs of rural women during this time of economic and social transformation, including 
measures taken to support the transfer to non-agricultural industries of rural women, 
retraining and educational programmes and the extension of pension coverage to the rural 
population, which is particularly significant for the large number of older rural women.  
</p>
<p>69. However, as more rural men than women migrate for work to urban centres, women 
are left behind as heads of households and bear the double burden of responsibility for 
household work and generating income. They are also highly vulnerable targets of sexual 
violence, including rape.26 The Group also received reports of high suicide rates among 
rural women who lack structural support and access to mental care facilities. 
</p>
<p>70. According to national statistics, in 2009, there were a total of 229.8 million rural 
migrant workers in China.27 Approximately one third of all migrant workers are women.28 
Many migrant workers, including those from rural areas and factory workers known as

<p><i>dagongmei</i> (working girls), face difficult working conditions in the labour market, in 
particular low wages, wage arrears, lack of written contracts, inadequate social security 
coverage, lack of access to decent housing and public services, long overtime hours and 
poor or unsafe working conditions.  
</p>
<p>71. The <i>hukou</i> is a national household registration system required by law and 
introduced in 1958, restricting access to education, health care and welfare benefits to the 
locality where a person is officially registered. This system produces de facto 
discrimination for urban migrants, particularly regarding their access to employment, social 
security, public health services, housing and education. It causes indirect discrimination 
against women who seek work as urban migrants and need to access those services for their 
children and parents, for whose care they bear the main responsibility.  
</p>
<p>72. The Group welcomes the announcement made at the 18th Central Committee in 
relation to a reform of the <i>hukou,</i> which recognizes the opportunity for women to obtain 
greater freedom of choice regarding occupation and residence together with their children. 
</p>
<p>73. Some local governments and municipalities have already undertaken reform of the 
<i>hukou</i>, such as Shanghai, which has launched a new regulation for residency permits, 
allowing residents from outside the city to apply for a residency permit if they have 
accumulated a certain numbers of points based on age, education, professional skills and 
employment.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Women with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Working Group welcomes the extensive measures taken by the Government, in 
accordance with the Constitution, the Law on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities, as 
amended in 2008, and the Employment Promotion Law to support women and men with 
disabilities, reduce poverty and protect them from violence, exploitation and abuse. It notes 
the quota system requiring all State and private employers to set aside a small percentage of 
jobs for persons with disabilities.29  
</p><p>75. However, the Group reiterates the concerns of the Committee on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, set out in its concluding observations on the initial report of 
China, regarding the lack of definition of discrimination against persons with disabilities, 
forced sterilization and abortion and the prevalence of violence perpetrated against women 
and girls with disabilities (CRPD/C/CHN/CO/1, paras. 11, 33 and 57). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Stereotypes 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Group noted that stereotypes regarding the roles and responsibilities of women 
are reflected in family roles, education, occupation and preference for sons in China. Such 
stereotypes are reflected in, the State media claimed of a &#8220;crisis&#8221;, as increasing numbers of 
educated women could not find husbands..30

<p><b> D. Lesbian, bisexual and transgender women 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Working Group is concerned that lesbian, bisexual and transgender women in 
China are subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence in educational 
establishments, workplaces and the family. According to the results of a survey in 2009, 
over a third of the lesbian or bisexual women surveyed had suffered domestic violence, 
perpetrated by family members or partners. Many women reported contemplating suicide.31  
</p>
<p>78. Prohibitions on homosexuality were repealed in 1997 and homosexuality was 
removed from the official list of mental illnesses in 2001. However, since those two legal 
reforms, the Government has banned publications regarding lesbian, bisexual and 
transgender issues and stalled further developments to prevent discrimination.32 
</p>
<p><b> E. Women in detention 
</b></p>
<p>79. China has the fastest growing female prison population in the world. It has been 
reported that there is a lack of gender segregation in many prisons and an insufficient 
number of female staff, especially among guards and medical personnel.33  
</p>
<p>80. A large number of female prisoners have been jailed for killing or wounding abusive 
husbands after enduring years of domestic violence. China has executed a number of these 
women, including mothers. In one study of 121 women in a Sichuan prison who were 
convicted of killing or injuring their husbands, 93 were convicted of intentional homicide, 
71 were given suspended death sentences or life imprisonment, while 28 were jailed for 
more than 10 years.34 The Working Group has noted the call by the Supreme People&#8217;s 
Court for leniency in such cases.  
</p>
<p>81. The Group is concerned at reports of suspected prostitutes being detained without 
due process or a trial, for up to two years in &#8220;re-education through labour&#8221; camps or 
&#8220;custody and education&#8221; centres. Although the Government announced in 2013 that it 
would reform &#8220;re-education through labour,&#8221; there has been no such announcement for the 
estimated 183 custody and education centres, which hold more than 15,000 persons, the 
majority of whom are women.35 
</p>
<p><b> F. Ethnic minority women 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Working Group appreciates the attention given by the Government to ethnic 
minority women, as witnessed during its visit to Dai Autonomous Prefecture in 
Xishuangbanna province, where it held discussions with members of the village committee 
and women&#8217;s group and visited the Xishuangbanna women and children&#8217;s counselling and

<p>development of women in their communities through raising awareness of trafficking in 
persons, domestic violence, land and property issues and employment, and psychological 
counselling and mediation for local families in difficulties.  
</p>
<p>83. However, the Group received reports of discrimination against some other groups of 
ethnic minority women in China, who suffer multiple discrimination, both as women and as 
members of a minority group. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region, women have a life 
expectancy that is seven years lower than the national average for women in China36 and 
their maternal mortality rate is by far the highest.37 This is despite the fact that the farming 
and nomad population have been incorporated into the free medical care system. The 
Working Group reiterates the concerns of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women at the reported incidents of violence against women in 
detention centres in this region (CEDAW/C/CHN/CO/6, para. 21). The Group is also 
concerned at reports of unmarried Uighur women as young as 16 being forced to participate 
in a labour transfer programme from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region to urban 
factories in eastern China, enduring appalling working conditions, which has led to some 
families in the region arranging the marriages of their daughters to older men in order to 
escape transfer to the factories.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Women vulnerable to trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>84. China is a source, destination and transit country for trafficking in persons for sexual 
exploitation. The Working Group commends the Government on its efforts to combat 
trafficking in persons and notes the effective collaboration between law enforcement 
agencies and women&#8217;s organizations in Yunnan province to develop a &#8220;protection chain&#8221; 
for assisting survivors of trafficking. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to increase 
efforts, as an increase of almost one third in the annual number of recorded cases of 
trafficking in women and children was reported between 2008 and 2011.38 
</p>
<p>85. The Group has been informed of an increase in the number of women leaving the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea for China. It is concerned that these women who, 
according to the findings of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, have been trafficked to China and often sold into forced 
marriages, and have been classified as irregular foreign migrants not entitled to health care 
or basic education for their children, rather than refugees or asylum seekers, or refugees <i>sur 
place</i>, entitled to international protection. The Group is also aware that many of these 
women are apprehended and forcibly repatriated, and then subjected to persecution, torture, 
prolonged arbitrary detention and in some cases sexual violence or forced abortions at 
&#8220;gathering centres&#8221;, detention centres or prison camps.39 It is concerned that the Chinese 
authorities, knowing of these practices, offer pregnant women abortions in medical 
facilities before repatriation, rather than allowing them to remain in China.40

<p><b> H. Women suffering violence 
</b></p>
<p>86. Domestic violence is under-recognized and underreported in China. One in every 
four women is a victim of domestic violence.41  
</p>
<p>87. As noted above, China is currently drafting a law against domestic violence, but as 
yet there is no clear legal definition of domestic violence, nor a clear legal framework that 
directly addresses domestic violence at the national level. Police have had limited training 
in dealing with the special problems that arise in the reporting and prosecuting of domestic 
violence cases.  
</p>
<p>88. The Working Group notes the Supreme People&#8217;s Court guidelines of 2008 for 
handling cases involving retaliatory or defensive attacks by women on their husbands in the 
wake of domestic violence, which recommends leniency in cases of retaliation and the 
issuing of protection orders to remove the violent partner from the home. It understands that 
those guidelines, promulgated at the national level, are not mandatory, but welcomes the 
fact that some 25 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have taken the lead in 
giving effect to the guidelines and making them enforceable through local regulations. 
Some authorities have created a broader definition of domestic violence, while others have 
codified principles and procedures for handling domestic violence and are making a 
conscious effort to implement them.  
</p>
<p>89. The Group further notes that, with the adoption of the Special Provisions on the 
Labour Protection of Female Employees in 2012, employers are obliged for the first time 
under employment law to prevent sexual harassment of female employees in the workplace. 
It was informed that, to date, 27 of 31 provincial governments in mainland China have 
enacted implementing rules which contain provisions against sexual harassment. 
</p>
<p>90. The Group observes that cases of sexual assault of girls in schools have been 
reported in some provinces. In one survey of 5,000 students, at least 50 cases involved 
sexual assaults on girls by their teachers. In the wake of such child sex abuse scandals and 
the jailing of an activist who launched a campaign against the teachers concerned, a group 
of prominent women lawyers from across the country joined forces to represent the girl 
victims of sex attacks. The recent scandals have prompted widespread anger and calls for a 
review of the laws on sex with minors. 
</p>
<p>91. The Group also notes the inconsistency between articles 236 and 360 of the Criminal 
Law. Article 236 states that individuals who have sexual intercourse with girls under the 
age of 14 shall be deemed to have committed rape and punished severely, which includes 
the possibility of the death penalty. Article 360 states that whoever &#8220;whores with a girl&#8221; 
under the age of 14 shall receive a minimum five-year sentence and a fine. Although the 
Working Group notes with appreciation the 2013 Opinion of the Supreme People&#8217;s Court 
on the punishment of sexual abuse of minors, it considers that intercourse with any 
underage girl, including so-called child prostitutes, should be treated as rape and subject to 
the maximum penalty. Child prostitution is one of the worst forms of systematic sexual 
violence and children do not have the capacity to give consent.  
</p>
<p>92. Violence against women is also evident in the use of forced sterilization and 
abortions in furtherance of the one-child policy. The Group appreciates the recent 
condemnation by the Government of such practices by local officials, but strongly 
emphasizes that effective preventative measures need to be taken at the national level, to 
prevent any recurrence of such crimes.

</b></p>
<p>93. The Group notes that the quality of support services for women and girl victims of 
violence, such as shelters, legal aid and medical services, is currently insufficient to meet 
national demand and would benefit from concrete policy and budgetary measures.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Women living with HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>94. The Working Group appreciates the efforts of the Government to address the issue 
of HIV/AIDS, including its planned expansion of drug treatment for people with the disease 
and the protection of HIV/AIDs patients from discrimination in hospitals. However, it notes 
that China is experiencing a feminization of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Increases in infection 
rates are observed in mother-to-child transmission and heterosexual transmission, 
predominantly through intimate partner transmission, which is linked to domestic violence 
and women&#8217;s resulting inability to negotiate safe sex.42 The Group received information 
regarding discrimination by medical institutions which refuse to give treatment to patients, 
violate their right to privacy and withhold important information. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Good practices 
</b>95. The Working Group commends the Government for rooting the concept of gender 
equality in the Constitution and in the National Action Plan on Human Rights and the 
Twelfth Five-Year Plan. It also commends it for demonstrating a deep awareness of the 
challenges in achieving the goals of equality for women and its openness to a process of 
continuous learning, and welcomes its desire to &#8220;seize the opportunity of Beijing 20+ to 
take forward the work related to women.&#8221;43 
</p>
<p>96. The Working Group further commends the Government for eliminating almost all 
discriminatory laws and putting in place a framework of laws to prevent discrimination 
against women, particularly regarding employment and the family.  
</p>
<p>97. The Working Group notes the significant efforts made by the Government to extend 
social protection rights, especially for mothers. It also commends the remarkable 
achievement in making universal pension coverage a key policy issue, with a particular 
impact on women, who constitute a majority of the poor and elderly.  
</p><p>98. The Working Group commends the Government for its success in making the 
education of girls a high priority, as required by Millennium Development Goal 3 and 
increasing the level of education of girls ahead of 2015. 
</p>
<p>99. The Working Group further commends the Government on its efforts to provide 
universal health insurance. One billion people in China are now insured under one of three 
health insurance schemes and the Government aims to increase this to over 90 per cent of 
the population by 2020.

</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Gender equality is affirmed in the Constitution, national policy documents and 
the political, economic, social and cultural spheres, including family life, and 
significant efforts have been made to put in place a framework of law and policy to 
eliminate discrimination against women. China has made remarkable progress in 
achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, most notably increasing the 
level of education for girls and making significant strides in reducing maternal 
mortality rates. However, there is insufficient evidence on gender equality on the 
agenda of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Despite the progress in recognizing women&#8217;s right to equality, women are very 
underrepresented at the highest levels of political decision-making and, in this respect, 
there is no evidence that policies to empower women, the development of social norms 
by the Government or the political work of the Communist Party have succeeded in 
achieving their goals. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>There is a risk that the transition to a market economy may have a negative 
impact on women, as such transitions have generally involved privatization and hence 
a reduction in public service jobs, public care services and an increased pressure on 
women to take insecure employment. The Working Group found evidence of such 
developments in China. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Women&#8217;s participation rates have declined, there has been a rise in informal 
and precarious labour and a rise in the gender wage gap in the private sector.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Serious challenges persist in the implementation of the anti-discrimination 
legislation and of accountability. Existing anti-discrimination legislation does not 
provide effective accountability mechanisms, such as access to judicial or 
administrative tribunals, for resolution of disputes. There is a preference in 
Government, the legal community and most civil society organizations for mediation 
as the mechanism to resolve conflict; however mediation alone does not provide an 
effective accountability mechanism for women to implement their rights in 
accordance with the rule of law. Furthermore, central government frameworks are 
regarded as guidelines rather than mandatory, concrete and enforceable norms and 
giving effect to laws is delegated to the discretion of provincial governments.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>China is facing the challenge of demographic change on an unprecedented 
scale, both rapid rural-urban labour migration and an increasingly ageing society. 
Those factors will impact on Chinese women who, as elsewhere, are often the ones left 
behind in rural areas, who assume a major burden of care for children and the 
elderly. Chinese women are at a juncture between becoming equal participants, 
decision-makers and beneficiaries of the new reforms or, unless preventative measures 
are taken, bearing a disproportionate burden of care in an increasingly privatized and 
ageing society. There is a sense of urgency in the next five years to implement 
important reforms and make good on the promises of the National Action Plan on 
Human Rights and the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, in order to advance women&#8217;s human 
rights and equality in China.  </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>In order to ensure that the new agenda for reform, as announced by the Third 
Plenary Sessions of the 18th Central Committee, achieves the aims of the National 
Human Rights Action Plan and the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, which are committed to 
promoting gender equality and guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of 
women, the Working Group recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Initiate a process of nationwide consultations with a wide diversity of 
stakeholders, including local governments, civil society organizations and gender 
experts, on priorities for action necessary to overcome all forms of direct and indirect 
discrimination faced by diverse women; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Formulate a comprehensive multi-year national gender policy dealing, 
inter alia, with issues of employment, matrimonial property, political representation, 
violence against women, and integrate it into China&#8217;s macroeconomic planning;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Allocate sufficient budgetary resources to secure women&#8217;s human rights in 
the face of women&#8217;s dual burden of care and the impending care crisis in an ageing 
society; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Create a conducive environment, including through funding, 
independent research and analysis on the specific gender-based impacts of major 
demographic and economic changes occurring in different contexts and regions of the 
country, particularly as they affect women facing multiple forms of discrimination, 
and establish an effective means for incorporation of the findings into the policy 
decisions of the Communist Party and the Government. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>In order to enhance the enforceability of existing equality guarantees in its 
laws, the Working Group suggests that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Urgently adopt legislation on domestic violence, as already proposed, 
which will provide effective prevention, prosecution and punishment of perpetrators, 
including effective protection orders to remove the perpetrator from the home and 
prohibition of marital rape; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Enact legislation to prevent, punish and prosecute violence in schools, 
the sexual abuse of minors under the age of 16; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Enforce the government&#8217;s articulated policy to prohibit forced 
sterilization and abortion; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Implement legal provisions generated at national and local government 
levels to prevent discrimination against women throughout its territory in a holistic 
and accountable manner, including by concretizing those provisions, defining 
discrimination to include direct and indirect discrimination and prohibiting multiple 
discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Establish administrative agencies whose roles are to decide on 
complaints about discrimination which have not been settled by mediation and to 
resolve these complaints in accordance with the anti-discrimination provisions of the 
law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Introduce capacity development programmes for law enforcement 
agents, including police, prosecutors, judges and lawyers, at local, provincial and 
national levels, on the issue of gender and the law and its application in China, 
including through collaboration with national gender experts and international 
actors; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(g) Improve the legal literacy of women, particularly those who face 
multiple forms of discrimination, including through the active participation of local 
civil society organizations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Ensure freedom of information which relates to facts or opinions 
relevant to enforcing the laws on gender equality and fulfilling the Communist Party 
commitment to the rule of law with regard to the elimination of discrimination against 
women.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>In order to advance women&#8217;s equal participation in political and public life, 
including in the management of the State and of social affairs, in accordance with the 
National Human Rights Action Plan, the Working Group recommends that the 
Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Apply special measures, including temporary special measures, such as 
the establishment of adequate numerical goals, for women&#8217;s equal, meaningful and 
effective participation in high decision-making positions at the national, provincial 
and local levels and throughout the legislative, executive, administrative and judicial 
bodies, and provide a designated seat for the All-China Women&#8217;s Federation in the 
top decision-making bodies of the Communist Party, including the Standing 
Committee of the Central Politburo;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establish a national human rights institution consisting of independent 
experts to carry out comprehensive and thorough reviews of laws and policies and 
their impact on women, and propose changes in law and policy, including those based 
on an assessment of individual complaints; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Provide legal protection for all defenders of women&#8217;s human rights and 
autonomous women&#8217;s groups and coalitions in civil society to allow them to advance 
implementation of the law and advocate for policy changes affecting gender equality 
as part of the overall strengthening of the rule of law, democracy and human rights in 
China. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>In order to promote women&#8217;s equality in the economy and in employment, the 
Working Group recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) In the development of a socialist market economy, establish mechanisms 
and measures to monitor optimally and carefully the impact on women, including 
through cooperation and dialogue with autonomous women&#8217;s organizations in civil 
society, and choose ways to achieve this transition without sacrificing decent work and 
living conditions, social protection floors and care and health services; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establish an effective administrative agency to address issues of 
discrimination against women in employment, at both the national and provincial 
levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Amend equal pay legislation so that the right to equal pay not only 
applies to equal work but also to work of equal value; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Improve the legal framework protecting the employment rights and 
conditions of domestic workers, regulating recruitment agencies, mounting 
inspections, promoting the signing of contracts, providing labour protection and 
training systems and measures which professionalize domestic workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Take fully into account the disproportionate allocation of unpaid care 
work to women in the design of policies at the macroeconomic level and in labour and 
social security, including by encouraging men to share the care burden through the 
introduction of improved paternity leave; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Eliminate the early mandatory retirement of women and allow those 
who are willing and able to do so to continue working up to the same age as men; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Extend protection for decent work to the many women employed in the 
informal labour market by increasing women&#8217;s opportunities to work in the formal 
labour market and, alternatively, by guaranteeing them all social security rights, 
including maternity and care rights, which are available for formal sector employees; 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>In order to protect the rights of women in vulnerable situations, the Working 
Group recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Continue and extend measures to empower women in vulnerable 
situations, particularly women in detention, refugee women, disabled women, women 
living with HIV/AIDS and lesbian, bisexual and transgender women  and facilitate 
their participation in economic, social and political life;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Protect and humanely treat all North Korean women in China, 
especially those who are pregnant and have children, respect the principle of non-
refoulement, provide access for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees to the provinces bordering the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
implement specific legislative and administrative provisions on refugees and establish 
national asylum procedures under the provisions of the Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees.
