</p>
<p><i>Demanding</i> that the Syrian authorities meet their responsibility to protect the Syrian
</p>
<p>population,
</p>
<p><i>Condemning</i> the grave deterioration of the human rights situation and the

</p>
<p>humanitarian law, and acts of violence that foment sectarian tensions,
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its deepest concern</i> about the findings of the Independent International
</p>
<p>Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, and the allegations of torture and
</p>
<p>executions based on the evidence presented by the &#8220;Caesar&#8221; report in January 2014,
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the observation of the Commission of Inquiry that, since March 2011, the
</p>
<p>Syrian authorities have conducted widespread attacks against the civilian population as a
</p>
<p>matter of policy,
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the lack of cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the Commission of
</p>
<p>Inquiry,
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its deep regret</i> that, despite international efforts, a political solution to
</p>
<p>the Syrian crisis has not yet been found,
</p>
<p><i>Expressing full support</i> for the diplomatic efforts of the Special Envoy of the
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for Syria,
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that rapid progress on a political solution should include full participation
</p>
<p>by all segments of Syrian society, including women, and represents the only sustainable
</p>
<p>way to resolve the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic peacefully,
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the ongoing efforts by human rights defenders active in the Syrian
</p>
<p>Arab Republic to document abuses and violations of human rights and violations of
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, despite grave risks,
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry
</p>
<p>on the Syrian Arab Republic, and notes the importance of the work of the Commission of

</p>
<p>2. <i>Demands</i> that the Syrian authorities cooperate fully with the Human Rights
</p>

</p>
<p>3. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the continued systematic, widespread and gross violations
</p>
<p>and abuses of human rights and all violations of international humanitarian law by the
</p>
<p>Syrian authorities and affiliated militias, including foreign terrorist fighters and those
</p>
<p>foreign organizations fighting on behalf of the Syrian authorities, in particular Hizbullah,
</p>
<p>and expresses deep concern that their involvement further exacerbates the deteriorating

<p>situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, including the human rights and humanitarian
</p>

</p>
<p>human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and reaffirms that terrorism,

</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, recognizes the permanent damage from torture to victims

</p>
<p>method of combat against the Syrian population;

<p>other mass casualty incidents, including any which may constitute a war crime, taking place

<p>were killed, including women and children, and requests the Commission of Inquiry to
</p>
<p>continue to investigate all such acts;

</p>
<p>unlawful killings of civilians, including any during the attack in Douma, and also stresses

</p>
<p>2000 and 2122 (2013) of 18 October 2013;
</p>
<p>19. <i>Recalls</i> that the International Criminal Court was established to help to end
