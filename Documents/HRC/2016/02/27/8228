<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, visited 
Algeria from 9 to 19 July 2011. She focused in particular on housing policies currently 
in place and the reasons for which, after a decade of intense construction of public 
housing, the country still seems to have a housing crisis and major problems in terms of 
accessibility and affordability. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur was struck by the fact that the idea of housing as a 
fundamental right is deeply rooted in Algerian society and that the State considers the 
question of housing to be one of its main responsibilities vis-&#224;-vis the population. She 
welcomes the progress made by the State in implementing the right to adequate housing 
and notes in particular the construction of a large housing stock for low-income 
households. 
</p>
<p> Despite the progress achieved, the Special Rapporteur notes that considerable 
efforts must still be made, in particular to diversify housing policies in accordance with

<p>existing needs in the country and to ensure that everyone can benefit from this right 
without discrimination. In this report, the Special Rapporteur shows how a 
democratization of housing policy based on transparency and the direct involvement of 
citizens and organizations of civil society in the definition and implementation of these 
policies would constitute a very important step in shifting the focus from housing 
construction to the actual realization of the right to housing in Algeria.

</p>
<p><b>I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, Raquel 
Rolnik, undertook an official visit to Algeria from 9 to 19 July 2011 at the invitation of the 
Algerian Government.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the People&#8217;s Democratic 
Republic of Algeria for its invitation and for its cooperation during the preparatory phase 
and throughout her visit. She also expresses appreciation to the United Nations country 
team in Algeria for its support in organizing the visit, Algerian civil society for its 
participation and citizens for their testimony on their situation.  
</p>
<p>3. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with a number of representatives of 
State authorities at national, wilaya, daira and municipal levels.1 She spoke with the 
Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Housing and Urban Planning, and Agriculture and Rural 
Development, as well as with the staff of the ministries of justice, labour, employment and 
social security, regional development and the environment, and planning and statistics. She 
had meetings with the National Economic and Social Council and with the National 
Advisory Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, and she also had 
the opportunity to meet representatives of the wilaya administration of Algiers, Oran and 
Boumerdes and representatives of the elected assemblies of a number of municipalities of 
these wilayas. Unfortunately, an airline strike prevented her from travelling to Ghardaia as 
planned. She also discussed the question of housing with a number of United Nations 
agencies and with representatives of the diplomatic corps, as well as with representatives of 
civil society (non-governmental organizations, associations, trade unions, academics and 
experts) in Algiers, Oran and Blida.  
</p><p>4. The Special Rapporteur was able to visit several completed or ongoing housing 
projects in Algiers, Boumerdes and Oran which are part of the various housing programmes 
promoted by the State. She also visited housing developments, slums, chalets2 and other 
forms of substandard housing and squatter settlements in Algiers, Blida and Boumerdes. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit took place at a time when the Government was 
announcing reforms in the political parties, the representation of women in elected 
assemblies, the activity of associations, the administration and decentralization.3 A revision 
of the Constitution was also announced, and a constitutional commission was established 
for that purpose.4 The Government committed itself to undertaking those reforms following 
a wave of demonstrations and strikes in early 2011. It was against that background that the 
state of emergency, in force since 1992, was lifted on 24 February 2011, and that meetings 
and general consultations with representatives of civil society were held on a range of 
topics (including urban planning).  
</p><p>6. After reviewing the legal framework, the general housing situation and existing 
housing policies, the Special Rapporteur then addresses in her report what she considers to 
be the main challenges facing Algeria in the area of the right to adequate housing and 
concludes with a set of recommendations.

<p>GE.11-17611 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. The right to adequate housing in Algeria: legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. Algeria has ratified the principal international human rights conventions, including 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Article 11 of the 
Covenant is the main source of the right to adequate housing in international law. Algeria 
has also ratified other conventions of relevance to the right to adequate housing, including 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has also ratified the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, although with important 
reservations, notably with regard to articles 2, 15 (4), 16 and 29. Algeria has not yet ratified 
the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights or the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance.  
</p>
<p>8. Although the right to adequate housing is not recognized in Algeria&#8217;s Constitution,5 
article 132 of the Constitution provides that international commitments entered into by 
Algeria &#8212; and hence the Covenant and its article 11 &#8212; have primacy over national law. 
The Constitution also contains provisions relating to certain aspects of the right to adequate 
housing. Article 40, which guarantees the inviolability of the home, stipulates that a house 
may only be searched in accordance with the law and on the basis of a search warrant 
emanating from a judicial authority. Pursuant to article 20, expropriation may only take 
place in conformity with the law and entails prior, just and fair compensation. Article 52 
ensures the right to own private property and to inherit and recognizes &#8220;waqf&#8221;6 property. 
Lastly, article 59 specifies that &#8220;citizens who are under working age or who can no longer 
or will never be able to work are guaranteed satisfactory living conditions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>9. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was struck by the fact that the idea of 
housing as a fundamental right is deeply rooted in Algerian society and that the State 
considers the question of housing to be one of its main responsibilities vis-&#224;-vis the 
population.  
</p>
<p>10. In accordance with the principle that international commitments have a higher status 
than domestic law, all Algerian citizens may invoke international conventions, and hence 
the Covenant, in domestic courts7 in conformity with the provisions of the Covenant.8 The 
Special Rapporteur notes with concern that article 11 of the Covenant has never been 
invoked by the domestic courts, although housing issues are often the subject of judicial 
decisions,9 and that effective remedies for victims of violations of the right to housing are 
lacking. She draws attention in that connection to the weakness of the procedures available 
to the National Advisory Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights

housing (together with employment) is one of the two areas concerning which complaints 
are most often referred to the Commission.10  
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the housing situation and housing policies in 
Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>11. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that the Government&#8217;s current efforts 
in the area of housing are being made in the context of a strong demand for housing. To 
understand the housing shortage, its causes and current challenges to the implementation of 
the right to adequate housing, it is useful to review briefly the evolution of the housing 
situation and housing policies since Algeria gained independence.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Evolution of the housing situation and housing policies from 1962 to the 
present 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur notes that the country has inherited a significant housing 
shortage from the colonial period. According to data made available to her by the 
Government, only 10 per cent of the Algerian population had adequate housing at the time 
of decolonization. The considerable efforts made by the State to address the problem are to 
be seen within the context of the specific socio-economic situation stemming from the 
history of the decolonization of the country, but also the dominance of oil resources as the 
main source of State revenue.11 Between 1962 and 1981, the Government adopted a 
socialist policy of nationalizing the housing stock and property left vacant by the former 
colonial power, and it placed the construction sector under direct state control, in essence 
becoming solely responsible for the building, distribution and administration of the housing 
stock.12 Strictly speaking, during this period the State did not have a social housing policy, 
since it built a sole housing model for all and assigned dwellings to the population in 
accordance with quotas based on administrative criteria.13 
</p>
<p>13. Despite the Government&#8217;s efforts, demand has grown steadily, and the housing 
shortage has continued to worsen, due to a combination of structural and economic 
problems.  
</p>
<p>14. Two factors are responsible for the increasing demand for housing in the country&#8217;s 
urban centres: strong demographic growth,14 and the concentration of the population in the 
Tell Atlas zone in the north of the country, where the biggest cities (Algiers, Oran, 
Constantine and Annaba) are located. In 2008, 63 per cent of the population lived in the 
Tell Atlas zone, which accounts for only 4 per cent of the national territory, as against 27

<p>per cent in the semi-arid plains of the high plateaus (9 per cent of the national territory) and 
10 per cent in the Sahara (87 per cent of the national territory) in the south15. 
</p><p>15. Another factor has always had adverse consequences for the housing situation in the 
country: Algeria&#8217;s extreme vulnerability to natural disasters, in particular earthquakes and 
landslides in the Tell Atlas zone, flooding in the high plateaus and the rise in water levels 
and flooding in the south, a situation which has recently worsened due to climate change.  
</p>
<p>16. In addition to these structural factors, there has been the effect of the 
multidimensional crises which the country experienced in the mid-1980s and the 1990s and 
their impact on housing policies, which, clearly, were already finding it difficult to meet 
housing needs.  
</p>
<p>17. Beginning in the second half of the 1980s, the State, which had had to impose 
economic adjustment measures to offset the decline in oil prices and the increase in the 
foreign debt, only had limited means to finance its housing policy. Moreover, in 1981, the 
centrally planned housing system which had been set up had begun to be called into 
question because of its inability to ensure the construction of the number of housing units 
needed. The system did not seem viable.16 The acceleration of the phenomenon of 
migration to the big cities, brought about by the deterioration in living conditions, 
employment17 and wages,18 and the inability of the State to finance a consistent housing 
policy resulted in a worsening of the housing situation and the emergence of squatter 
camps, slums and new resettlement areas.19  
</p>
<p>18. This period, during which the system and the economic readjustment measures were 
called into question, was followed by two years, 1990 and 1991, of structural reforms 
aimed at liberalizing the property and real estate market. Act No. 90-25 of 18 November 
1990 on land planning established the right of private persons to own their dwelling and 
land, and it abrogated provisions impeding private initiative in the urban sector.20 These 
reforms were adopted at a time of an emerging crisis in the country21 which led to a major 
displacement of the rural population to the cities to flee the violence22 and to a reduction in 
State funding for initiatives in the area of urban planning and housing. The system, which 
had only just been reformed, was deregulated, resulting in uncontrolled urbanization. 
Informal housing arrangements in urban areas became increasingly common. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 This demographic concentration is due to the many advantages of the Tell Atlas zone: more 
</p>
<p>favourable natural and climatic conditions, fertile agricultural land, more water resources, the coastal 
and forest potential, good infrastructure, urban networks and training facilities. Commission nationale

 Between December 1991 (annulment by the Government of the elections after the result of the first 
</p>
<p>round indicated that the Islamic Salvation Front would win) and 2001, Algeria went through a grave 
crisis known as the &#8220;black decade&#8221;, in which the Government opposed a number of Islamist groups.

</p>
<p><b> B. The current situation and housing policies 
</b></p>
<p>19. In 1999, having recovered political and institutional stability and obtained 
considerable financial means thanks to increases in oil prices, the Government re-
established its role in urban planning. According to official sources, 810,000 housing units 
were built under the 1999&#8211;2004 housing programme and 912,326 under the 2005&#8211;2009 
programme. The five-year plan for 2010&#8211;2014 calls for the delivery of 1.2 million housing 
units, and another 800,000 are to be completed between 2015 and 2017.23 
</p>
<p>20. Despite major housing construction over the past 10 years, the housing crisis 
continues. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this is not only a question of the insufficient 
number of available housing units, but is also linked to various other factors which have 
contributed to the emergence of this complex, multifaceted problem. 
</p>
<p>21. The most important aspects of the problem include serious overcrowding: the 
existence of slums and squatter settlements devoid of minimum decent living conditions; 
the practice of renting small living spaces, such as rooms and garages, as housing; 
speculation on rental prices; the large number of evictions following judicial decisions 
rendered at the initiative of private persons; the perpetuation of temporary dwellings for 
victims of natural disasters; the decay of housing from the colonial and Ottoman periods; 
and the deterioration of the public housing stock.  
</p>
<p>22. The Government recognizes the existence of a housing crisis, but maintains that it 
has been alleviated over the past 10 years and that shortages have been greatly reduced.24 In 
that connection, the Special Rapporteur stresses the lack of detailed up-to-date information 
on existing housing needs and thus the impossibility of arriving at a precise diagnosis of the 
housing situation in the country. Although there is recent data on the number of housing 
units built by the State over the past 10 years,25 to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s knowledge 
there is no analogous data concerning quantitative or qualitative aspects of housing demand 
and the housing shortage. The evolution of the occupancy rate, i.e. the number of persons 
per occupied dwelling, seems to be used as one of the main criteria for assessing the 
evolution of the crisis (an evolution considered positive because of the decline in the 
occupancy rate from 7.15 persons per dwelling in 1998 to 6.42 in 2008),26 although by its 
very nature the occupancy rate does not provide information on housing conditions in either 
quantitative or qualitative terms. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges and obstacles to the realization of the right to 
adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>23. Considerable progress has been made since 1962 towards the realization of the right 
to adequate housing. The Special Rapporteur notes in that context the construction of a 
large housing stock for low-income families and the very positive development in the 
country towards ensuring that dwellings are supplied with clean running water, electricity

<p><b> A.  The need to diversify and democratize housing policies 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s decision to address the crisis 
by giving priority to combating the housing shortage. She appreciates the considerable 
effort made by the Government, especially over the past 10 years, to build urban and rural 
dwellings,28 in particular free public housing, and the substantial budgetary investment in 
this area by the State. For the five-year period 2010&#8211;2014, more than 3,700 billion dinars, 
or 50 billion dollars (17.4 per cent of the national budget),29 have been allocated to the 
housing sector. The Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of Algeria&#8217;s commitment to 
housing, which is particularly commendable in an international context in which States 
have been withdrawing from that role.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur recalls, however, that the substantial investment by the 
Government in this area has until recently focused entirely on the construction of new units 
as a function of the availability of public land and criteria of eligibility defined in public 
housing programmes. Since 1999 the State has diversified its housing assistance 
programmes to meet the needs of different occupational categories, but the Government 
bases its policy exclusively on supply and on quantitative objectives set without any prior 
assessment of needs and without a specific strategy to address individual questions and 
problems. For example, for the five-year period 2010&#8211;2014, the Government undertook to 
build 2 million housing units, including 500,000 rental units, 300,000 units to replace 
substandard housing and 700,000 rural housing units,30 but to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
knowledge, this distribution is not based on an assessment of regional needs.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur notes the lack of information or education campaigns on the 
Government&#8217;s housing policy, which remains unclear for the average citizen. That appears 
to affect, in particular, access to housing for the most underprivileged persons, who often 
are not even aware that they are eligible for a housing assistance programme. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to stress the lack of dialogue with or 
involvement of civil society in the definition, implementation, administration and follow-up 
of housing policies and urban planning. She notes, for example, the failure to consult with 
civil society in the definition of criteria for the allocation of housing, and the very limited 
participation of civil society in commissions responsible for the allocation of public 
housing. That is a major obstacle to the realization of the right to housing in Algeria. The 
Special Rapporteur appreciates the efforts recently made by the Government to give a 
hearing to society (for example, by organizing meetings on urban planning or holding its 
first public consultations with civil society), although they have not yet resulted in changes 
in the way in which housing policies are elaborated and put into effect.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27
 Ibid. However, the Special Rapporteur notes the presence of considerable regional disparities.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>28
 To deal with the rapid urbanization and rural migration to the big cities, the Government has started a 
</p>
<p>housing programme to promote rural areas and encourage local populations to remain in rural areas. 
The programme provides incentives to households that earn between one time and six times the 
guaranteed national minimum wage to enable families to build a decent dwelling in their own rural 
environment.

<p><b> B. Access to affordable housing  
</b></p>
<p>28. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur noted a general problem of access to 
housing associated with existing housing policies for basic standard dwellings and with real 
estate speculation. That makes the private real estate market inaccessible to the vast 
majority of the population.  
</p><p>29. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the new housing assistance policies in place 
since 1999, which have led to greater diversification. Today, a large part of the population 
appears to be eligible for these programmes, in particular the public housing programme31 
for low-income households and the home-ownership assistance programme32 for middle-
class households. In the Algiers wilaya, for example, between 1999 and 2010 a total of one 
third of the population applied for these programmes. Although from the standpoint of 
income a large percentage of the population is eligible for both programmes, major 
difficulties continue to prevent the persons concerned from actually obtaining adequate 
housing. There are many reasons for this: demand greatly exceeds supply,33 and there are 
problems with the allocation of such housing and the manner in which these policies are 
conceived and publicized.  
</p>
<p>30. With regard to the allocation of housing, and in particular public rental units, the 
Special Rapporteur notes that considerable efforts still need to be made to improve 
transparency and that the various bodies involved in allocating housing (such as the daira 
commissions) have a margin of discretion which opens the door to patronage and 
corruption. That has contributed to creating a climate of suspicion and to generating a lack 
of confidence on the part of the population, as seen by the rioting that regularly breaks out 
after the posting of the lists of persons who have been assigned such housing.34 The Special 
Rapporteur appreciates that applicants who claim that their rights have been infringed may 
lodge a complaint with a commission established to that effect and may thus have access to 
the classification of applications and learn their place on the list. However, it is problematic 
that the classification of all applications, with the position of all the applicants and the 
number of points granted to each applicant, is made public. Moreover, the Special 
Rapporteur has received allegations that applicants who have lodged a formal complaint 
have then had great difficulty obtaining public housing. There have also been many reports 
of the existence of a widespread black market for dwellings made available under two

<p> 
</p>
<p>31
 See Executive Decree No. 2008-142 of 5 Joumada El Oula 1429 (11 May 2008), establishing the 
</p>
<p>rules for the allocation of public housing. The programme is solely for persons who are in socially 
underprivileged categories on the basis of their wages. To be eligible, the monthly wage of a 
household must not exceed 24,000 dinars (less than twice the minimum monthly wage), and the 
person concerned must not have housing or must have substandard or insalubrious housing (arts. 4 
and 5). In this connection, the Special Rapporteur notes that until 1998, only households with wages 
less than 12,000 dinars were eligible, which excluded a large part of the population.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32
 See Executive Decree No. 10-235 of 26 Chaoual 1431 (5 October 2010). This programme provides 
</p>
<p>assistance for the purchase of a housing unit and is for applicants who earn between one and six times 
the minimum monthly wage (art. 3). These are new housing units built by a real estate promoter in 
accordance with fixed technical specifications and financial conditions. Access to such housing is on 
the basis of a financial plan consisting of the purchaser&#8217;s down payment, a preferential loan and direct 
State aid.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33
 In this connection, the Special Rapporteur notes that there is a discrepancy between the programmes 
</p>
<p>for the construction of housing that have been launched and the number of housing units actually 
allocated. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>34
 According to information available in the Algerian press, between January and July 2011, 90 
</p>
<p>demonstrations took place after the posting of housing allocation lists, and seven persons were said to 
have set themselves on fire for reasons related to access to housing.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>earlier programmes. Housing units are alleged to have been assigned, bypassing the 
existing procedures, to ineligible persons, who then sublet or sell them at a high price, in 
violation of the law.35  
</p>
<p>31. Some of the allocation criteria applied under the public housing programme are also 
problematic.36 The Special Rapporteur questions in particular whether it is appropriate to 
set aside 40 per cent of public housing units for allocation to applicants under 35 years of 
age,37 whereas the 35&#8211;50 age bracket is the one most in need of housing assistance. 
According to an analysis of demand in Algiers, applicants for housing under 35 years of 
age account for 9.07 per cent of all registered applications, as against 46.14 per cent for 
applicants aged 35 to 50 years of age.38 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that slum clearance policy and 
situations resulting from natural disasters have increased the considerable pressure that the 
public housing system was already experiencing. Pursuant to article 9 of Executive Decree 
No. 2008-142, when assistance is required to address a local need of general interest or an 
exceptional situation (for example, a natural disaster), or when substandard housing is 
removed, the Government may authorize the allocation of public housing in response to an 
application submitted by the wali or the central authority, and such housing is assigned 
without following the usual procedure, i.e. it is not allocated in accordance with a point 
system based on predefined criteria, and persons who are victims of natural disasters or 
who live in slums may benefit from the public housing programme even when they have 
income exceeding 24,000 dinars, which is the basic criterion for eligibility in a normal 
situation. This results in considerable tension between beneficiaries of the public housing 
programme, who are in competition for the same housing.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur also notes that eligible persons who have not yet benefited 
from these programmes, as well as persons who are not eligible, have great difficulty 
finding adequate housing because of high real estate and rental prices. That is a particularly 
serious problem, since the eligible population may remain on lists of applicants for years 
before being assigned housing.  
</p>
<p>34. The strong demand for housing together with the absence of a regulatory strategy 
has led to considerable speculation on real estate and on rental apartments in the private 
sector, resulting in prices that the vast majority of Algerians are unable to afford.39 
According to unofficial sources, prices have increased fivefold since 2004.40 The black 
market for dwellings under the low-income public housing and middle-income 
homeownership programmes encourages speculation, thus driving up housing prices. It is 
reported that private rental agencies often introduce arbitrary criteria, for example payment 
of a year&#8217;s rent in advance. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the down payment for 
the purchase of a dwelling under the middle-income homeownership programme (between 
700,000 and 1,000,000 dinars) is too high for the target groups. That constitutes an obstacle 
to access to adequate housing and may be a cause of the indebtedness and impoverishment 
of the households concerned.

</p>
<p>35. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes that the programmes to promote housing 
accessibility and affordability are being conducted at a time of a high vacancy rate in the 
housing stock (14 per cent nationally, according to official sources, or nearly 1 million 
units).41 This situation is contributing to the real estate bubble and the explosion in real 
estate prices.42 
</p>
<p><b> C. Habitability and services, materials, amenities and infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p>36. The difficulty of finding affordable housing has meant that the living conditions of 
part of the Algerian population are very precarious or informal. 
</p>
<p>37.  During her visit, the Special Rapporteur noted serious overcrowding. Many large 
families (as many as 11 persons) live in a single room,43 and many families share houses or 
hotels, each family renting a single room. It is common practice to rent rooms and garages 
to families, that thus are forced to live in particularly difficult and insalubrious conditions. 
In most cases, these are persons who are eligible for a dwelling under the public housing 
programme and have been on a waiting list for a long period.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur has also noted that many slums and other forms of 
makeshift housing44 do not provide minimum decent living conditions and that many of 
them (285,000 housing units according to data obtained from the Ministry of Housing) are 
not structurally sound and are thus very vulnerable in the event of an earthquake. In the sole 
wilaya of Algiers, for example, 24,300 temporary structures were built between 1998 and 
2008, and substandard housing as a percentage of total housing stock rose from 5.9 per cent 
to 9.1 per cent over the same period,45 or approximately 20 per cent of currently available 
housing.46 Whereas in the past, the Government had conducted programmes to rehabilitate 
substandard housing, in 2005 it embarked on a policy aimed at a complete eradication of 
slums by 2014. The goal of the programme for the reduction of substandard housing is to 
resettle families living in slums in new public housing units. However, slum residents often 
have to wait under very difficult conditions for many years or even decades; a considerable 
period of time may elapse between their registration in the waiting list and the actual 
allocation of a dwelling under the public housing programme. That being the case, the 
Government must also work to improve the living conditions of slum residents.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>41
 Data received by the Ministry of Planning and Statistics and elaborated on the basis of the results of 
</p>
<p>the 2008 population and housing census. Many of these vacant housing units are said to be new units 
received through the black market. See &#8220;<i>950 000 logements neufs inoccup&#233;s en Alg&#233;rie</i>&#8221;, <i>Libert&#233;</i>, 19 
February 2011. The Special Rapporteur notes that, according to official sources, only 27 per cent of 
vacant housing are habitable.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>43
 Until 2002, public housing units could be composed of a single room, which contributed to 
</p>
<p>overcrowding. In 2002, the Government decided to do away with single-room apartments, and in 
2006 two-room apartments were also discontinued.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>44
 According to information received from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning, in 2007 there 
</p>
<p>were 560,000 slum dwellings, of which 379,000 were made of bricks and disparate materials, at 
12,355 locations. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, the lack of exact figures on slums or of a 
Government definition of substandard housing. See also: International Federation for Human Rights,

</b></p>
<p>GE.11-17611 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>39. A large part of the population is living in badly decayed dwellings that date back to 
the colonial or Ottoman periods47 or in public housing that is in a very poor state of repair 
and is not usually maintained by the tenants, the private owners or the State. In 2008, a 
technical and socio-economic assessment carried out for the Algiers wilaya conurbation 
found that 70 per cent of housing was in a moderate or advanced stage of disrepair.48 
According to information received by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning, 
beneficiaries of a dwelling under the public housing programme often do not pay their rent 
and pay only 100 dinars every two months for basic maintenance.49 These problems are also 
related to the fact that the households concerned are not involved in the elaboration and 
implementation of housing policies. She appreciates the efforts which the Government has 
recently made to rehabilitate the old housing stock50 and public housing units, but stresses 
that, given the scale of the problem, action by the State in this sector must be stepped up, 
and new ways of maintaining public-sector housing must be explored. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur also noted the problem of the perpetuation of temporary 
housing for victims of natural disasters. An undetermined number of persons still live in the 
temporary dwellings built in the aftermath of the Boumerdes earthquake of May 2003. The 
victims had all been provisionally resettled in 14,700 housing units built in the six months 
following the earthquake. The authorities had subsequently offered them the choice 
between aid for on-site reconstruction, subsidies for purchasing their own dwelling, or 
assistance in resettlement in public housing. Although there are no precise figures, it is said 
that, eight years after the earthquake, a small number of families are still living in these 
temporary dwellings, in the vast majority of cases persons who had chosen on-site 
reconstruction, an option which has proved to be more drawn out and complicated than 
resettlement in public housing. These structures are now used by persons waiting to be 
allocated public housing. Theoretically, the administration has authorized these persons to 
remain on account of their particularly difficult situation. In practice, some are living there 
without authorization, for example relatives of the victims, or persons who have sublet the 
housing from the victims. Initially conceived as a temporary solution, these structures 
house persons under very difficult, confined and insalubrious conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Location of housing 
</b></p>
<p>41. As already pointed out, until very recently the Government&#8217;s approach to housing 
questions was exclusively quantitative. That resulted in large-scale construction, rather than 
the promotion of adequate housing, against a background of a shortage of available public 
land in urban areas. Until recently, there has not been any real regional planning policy, and 
this has led to considerable urban sprawl. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>47
 CNES, Rapport sur le logement social, op. cit., p. 7. The current housing stock is composed of nearly 
</p>
<p>2 million units. Built before independence, most of these dwellings are privately owned.

<p> 
</p>
<p>49
 As tenants, beneficiaries of public housing are required to pay rent that is equivalent to approximately 
</p>
<p>one-ninth of the national minimum wage, rent being calculated on the basis of the surface area and the 
national adjusted reference figure for a square metre applicable for calculating rent. This figure is set 
annually by a decree issued by the ministers responsible for housing (Executive Decree No. 2008-
142, art. 54). The tenant is also required to pay for the cost of maintenance of the communal parts and 
to make a deposit. According to her information, the rent and the deposit are minimal and should not 
in principle pose problems for the beneficiaries of this housing. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>50
 In 2008, the Government launched a programme of financial support for owners of housing chosen 
</p>
<p>under an urban renewal initiative. The initiative, which since 2010 has been embarked on in Algeria&#8217;s 
four biggest cities, is aimed at restoring, renovating and maintaining the housing stock in this 
category. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/53/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.11-17611 
</p>
<p>42. Thus, public housing policy has resulted in construction on the outskirts of urban 
areas, and many new housing settlements are located at a great distance from public 
services and the labour market. Owing to this circumstance, together with the uncontrolled 
growth of squatter settlements on the outskirts of urban areas and rural migration to the 
capital, the urban fabric has begun to unravel and decay, and cities are unable to fulfil all 
their functions or provide basic services and infrastructure. The result of an analysis of 
current and future infrastructure needs of the Algiers wilaya51 testifies to this situation. The 
existing cultural, sport and social assistance infrastructure is vastly inferior to needs (and is 
virtually non-existent in some municipalities), and the education and health-care 
infrastructure is almost everywhere inferior to existing needs, although less so than in the 
other three areas. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8217;s decision to allocate 150 
billion dinars, or an amount equivalent to the sums invested during the entire last decade, 
for the improvement of urban areas over the five-year period 2010&#8211;2014. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur considers that, with the adoption of the regional planning 
blueprint52 in 2010, Algeria has an important reference document for urban renewal, the 
promotion of more inclusive cities, the restoration of urban functions and the improvement 
of housing for the population. She also appreciates the adoption in 2010 of a land use and 
development plan for Algiers, which calls for the creation of a metropolitan zone in the 
capital through a restructuring of transport, urban renewal within the city&#8217;s current 
boundaries, and infrastructure projects. However, there are a number of obstacles to the 
implementation of these plans, in particular with regard to available urban land. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Security of tenure and forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>45. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received numerous testimonies of evictions, 
often carried out on the basis of judicial decisions following procedures instituted by 
private owners against tenants. The Special Rapporteur notes that the problem of evictions 
is closely associated with the question of legal security of tenure for tenants and their ability 
to pay. She expresses concern at a phenomenon which seems to be on the rise,53 especially 
since the adoption of the new Code of Civil Procedure in 2008. Under the new Code, 
eviction cases are dealt with on an urgent basis by an interim relief judge and thus are heard 
as a matter of priority.54 The deadline for a summons to appear may be reduced to 24 
hours.55 Interim orders are immediately enforceable, with or without surety, 
notwithstanding legal remedies,56 and as such they are not subject to appeal or annulment.57 
</p><p>46. According to information brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention, families that 
should have been resettled in the context of urban renewal projects or the clearance of 
substandard housing have been de facto victims of evictions, because they were excluded 
from the resettlement plan without any explanation or compensation. Such cases have been 
reported in a number of Algerian cities.

</b></p>
<p>GE.11-17611 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the large number of evicted 
persons who have become homeless due to the lack of State resettlement or compensation 
measures. According to reports, evictions have even taken place during the &#8220;winter truce&#8221;, 
which extends from 15 November to 15 March and concerns persons over 60 years of age, 
although this is strictly forbidden by Executive Decree No. 507 bis of 13 May 2007, which 
ensures that persons over 60 years of age may remain in their housing. The Special 
Rapporteur draws attention to existing international standards for eviction, and in particular 
the obligation to guarantee that persons affected by an eviction process have the right to 
legal assistance and access to the courts as well as to social assistance and housing support 
if they are destitute. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Specific situations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Gender discrimination in access to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>48. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that, despite legal improvements, in 
particular the 2005 reform of the Family Code, Algerian women still do not have the same 
status as men within the family58 and continue to be victims of de jure discrimination in 
access to housing. According to Algerian law (articles 142 and 144 of the Family Code), 
women cannot claim the same part of an inheritance as men, since they have the right to 
only half of what men are entitled to. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur heard many testimonies and received numerous reports on 
the various types of gender discrimination that exist. Single, divorced and widowed women 
are particularly vulnerable to discrimination in the allocation of housing. The commissions 
responsible for the assignment of housing often do not even accept housing applications 
from single women; that prevents these persons from lodging an appeal, and it is very rare 
for them to be allocated housing. Moreover, housing is assigned to the person who submits 
the application; in couples, that is almost always the husband, and thus in most cases the 
certificate of title of tenancy or ownership bears his name.59 The Special Rapporteur has 
also received testimonies according to which, when the commissions allocate housing to 
single women, the communities concerned challenge these decisions, and women who are 
beneficiaries of such housing are stigmatized. 
</p>
<p>50. With regard to divorced women, article 72 of the Family Code provides that, if a 
couple has children and the woman is granted custody,60 the father must ensure that she has 
decent housing or else must pay her rent. Moreover, a woman who has custody has the right 
to remain in the matrimonial home until the father implements the judicial decision. 
Although this provision of the Family Code constitutes a positive development compared to 
its earlier version,61 major problems persist. Firstly, women without children or who have 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>58
 The Family Code is in contradiction with article 29 of the Algerian Constitution, which recognizes 
</p>
<p>equality before the law without any discrimination on the basis of gender. 
 
</p>
<p>59
 According to official sources, of a sampling of 245,000 middle-income housing units benefiting from 
</p>
<p>State aid as part of the 2005&#8211;2009 home-ownership programme, 24 per cent were registered in the 
wife&#8217;s name. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>60
 Pursuant to article 64 of the Family Code, custody is vested in the first instance in the mother, then in 
</p>
<p>the father and then in the closest relatives. 
 
</p>
<p>61
 Under the earlier version of the Family Code (art. 52), only in cases in which the wife obtained 
</p>
<p>custody of the children and she did not have a guardian who agreed to take her in did she and her 
children have the right to her own housing, in keeping with the husband&#8217;s possibilities. However, the 
matrimonial home was excluded from that decision if it was the sole housing. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/53/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.11-17611 
</p>
<p>not been granted custody of their children do not benefit from any protection. In such cases, 
the Special Rapporteur notes that fathers sometimes attempt to obtain custody of the 
children so that they can continue to live in the matrimonial home. Secondly, article 72 
does not guarantee that a woman who has child custody can stay in the matrimonial home; 
this is not ensured until the father implements the judicial decision concerning housing. In 
cases in which women are granted child custody, it is the judge who decides case by case 
and may rule that the wife must continue to live with her children in the matrimonial home 
or that the husband must pay his former spouse an amount deemed to be sufficient to pay 
her rent. However, the amount set by the judge is based on official rental prices, whereas 
actual market prices are much higher. Moreover, it is reported that judges do not always 
rule on the question of housing. In both those cases, women do not have the means to pay 
the rent, and often their only alternative is either to become homeless or to remain in the 
home of their former spouses, where they are often victims of violence. The Special 
Rapporteur is particularly concerned by the insufficient number &#8212; and in some cities the 
lack &#8212; of shelters for women who are victims of domestic violence (for example, Oran had 
opened two shelters before 1990, but they have since been closed because of their state of 
disrepair, and Algiers, Constantine and Annaba each have only one such shelter). 
</p><p>51. Although the phenomenon of homelessness seems to be rather marginal in Algeria, 
women (sometimes accompanied by their children) constitute the highest share of this 
group. This may concern women who are divorced or have been repudiated by the 
husbands, women or girls who are considered to have dishonoured their families, and 
women who are victims of violence. In short, women become even more vulnerable when 
they are homeless. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur notes the insecure situation of women who live alone. In 
particular, she notes with concern the phenomenon of &#8220;punitive expeditions&#8221; targeting 
women who live alone and which are carried out on the pretext of defending moral 
standards, for example in Hassi Messaoud and in M&#8217;sila (in the latter case, which occurred 
shortly before the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the houses of women living alone had been set 
on fire).62 The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern the recent cases of violence 
committed against women living alone and which were allegedly perpetrated by police 
officers in the homes of the victims in Hydra, Algiers.63 
</p>
<p><b> B. Internally displaced persons, families of disappeared persons and 
Saharan refugees 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur notes that persons displaced during the &#8220;black decade&#8221; and 
who have not returned to their places of origin are often poorly housed in the country&#8217;s 
urban centres (including in slums).64 There is no specific policy guaranteeing the right to 
adequate housing for this group. There does not seem to be any programme to facilitate 
their safe return to their place of origin if they so wish, to meet their specific housing needs 
in localities where they currently live or to guarantee their right to restitution or 
compensation for lost housing.

 The Special Rapporteur notes the controversy over the number of displaced persons. According to 
</p>
<p>official sources, by 2007 there were no longer any internally displaced persons, because virtually all 
of them had returned to their places of origin. According to other sources, a large number of displaced 
persons are still living in the cities. See: International Displacement Monitoring Center and 
Norwegian Refugee Council, op. cit., pp. 9 ff.  </p>

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur also notes the administrative problems which the families of 
disappeared persons must overcome, in particular spouses and mothers of families, in order 
to be able to take part in housing programmes, obtain social security and enjoy the right to 
own and inherit property, as well as the direct impact of those problems on their right to 
housing.65 
</p>
<p>55. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes the extremely difficult living conditions of 
Saharan refugees in the Tindouf camps, and in particular their very poor housing. 
According to reports which she has received, the tents in which such persons live need to be 
replaced at least every five years, but the international organizations active there are unable 
to do so due to lack of funds. Thus, these persons have had to build their own dwellings, 
but such structures are unsuited to the climate and terrain and are vulnerable to the flooding 
that is typical of the region. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>56. <b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the considerable effort made by the 
Algerian State in the area of housing, in particular the construction of free public 
housing. She notes, however, that major efforts still need to be made to diversify 
policies in accordance with existing needs in the country and to incorporate the 
various components of the right to adequate housing. A democratization of housing 
policy based on transparency and the direct involvement of citizens and organizations 
of civil society in the definition and implementation of these policies would constitute a 
very important step in shifting the focus from housing construction to the actual 
realization of the right to housing in Algeria. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the State should take effective 
measures to raise the awareness of the members of the judiciary of the right to 
adequate housing as recognized in the Covenant and to ensure that legal training 
takes full account of the enforceability of that right. She also recommends the 
adoption of measures to strengthen the effective remedies available to victims of 
violations of the right to housing. She advocates, inter alia, ensuring the independence 
and effectiveness of the National Advisory Commission for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights, and she recommends the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. As 
part of the ongoing revision of the Constitution, she also recommends that the right to 
adequate housing should be recognized as a constitutional right. 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to engage in a genuine dialogue 
in order to define housing policies and institutionalize standing mechanisms to 
monitor the implementation of those policies. She recommends in particular the 
establishment of an independent housing agency. She also calls on the Government to 
promote, respect and protect the right of everyone to freedom of association and the 
right to organize, as well as the rights of human rights defenders, in particular those 
active in the area of housing, as defined in General Assembly resolution 
A/RES/53/144. 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends the establishment of public awareness 
programmes so that the population is informed about housing assistance programmes 
actually available and can easily request assistance.

</p>
<p>60.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to assess and analyse existing 
housing needs and to diversify its housing policies accordingly. In particular, she 
urges the Government to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that the policy for the reduction of substandard housing is accompanied 
by policies to improve living conditions in slums, together with participatory 
initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Introduce policies for the regulation of the public housing market, rent 
incentives and ceilings, together with policies to assist tenants (such as rent 
subsidies), and measures to encourage the use of vacant housing 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Introduce housing policies aimed at integrating the urban landscape and a 
housing construction policy that takes into account infrastructure, public 
spaces and transport, and not just housing units 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthen recently launched housing rehabilitation policies and establish 
mechanisms to ensure maintenance, in particular of public-sector housing 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take all necessary measures to enable internally displaced persons to return 
safely to their place of origin if they so wish, to meet their specific housing 
needs and to ensure their right to restitution or compensation 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> In order to guarantee a transparent allocation of apartments under the public 
housing programme for low-income households, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to set up a single national list of registered housing applications that 
specifies the number of points which each application has received and the position of 
each applicant on the list. The classification of all applications should be made public 
and accessible, for example on the website of the municipality, daira or wilaya. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends a concerted assessment of criteria for the 
allocation of public housing and, if necessary, their amendment. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The Special Rapporteur recalls the importance of guaranteeing the right of 
persons subject to an eviction procedure to legal assistance, access to the courts, social 
assistance and housing when they are destitute. She recommends that eviction orders 
should be subject to appeal or annulment. She also urges the Government to ensure 
that the &#8220;winter truce&#8221; is respected and that persons over 60 years of age are not 
evicted under Executive Decree No. 507 bis. She encourages the Government to ensure 
that, in the framework of urban renewal or slum clearance projects, no one becomes a 
de facto victim of a forced eviction and is rendered homeless. She recalls the 
obligation of the State to ensure that victims of forced evictions either receive 
compensation or are adequately resettled. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> In the light of widespread de jure and de facto gender discrimination, the 
Special Rapporteur urges the State to take the necessary legislative measures to 
recognize that women have the same legal capacity as men in civil matters by ensuring 
the same rights for both spouses with regard to ownership, use and disposal of 
property and by guaranteeing the legal basis for equal access to housing for single, 
widowed and divorced women. In this connection, she calls on the Government to 
withdraw its reservations to articles 2, 15 and 16 (h) of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to take affirmative action 
measures for women with regard to access to housing. She recommends in particular 
that, when a couple participates in a housing programme, the certificate of title should 
always bear the name of the couple and not the name of the person who submits the </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>application. In cases of divorce, she recommends that judges should set the amount of 
rent that the husband must pay to his former wife on the basis of market prices.  
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take all necessary measures 
to eliminate the obstacles which the families of disappeared persons must overcome, in 
particular spouses and mothers of families, in order to be able to take part in housing 
programmes, obtain social security and enjoy the right to own and inherit property. 
</b>67.<b> The Special Rapporteur stresses that violence against women and the right to 
adequate housing are closely linked. She appreciates the establishment of specialized 
entities for the protection of children and women who have been victims of aggression 
committed by members of the wilaya police force, and she urges the competent 
authorities to take all necessary measures to prevent, investigate and punish acts of 
violence against women. She also calls on the Government to provide for a sufficient 
number of shelters for women who are victims of violence.  
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the international community to provide 
sufficient funding to ensure decent living conditions, including adequate housing, for 
Saharan refugees in the Tindouf camps.
