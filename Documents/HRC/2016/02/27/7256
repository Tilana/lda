<p><b>  </b>Introduction<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 
</p>
<p>15 May 2015. The review of Andorra was held at the 7th meeting on 7 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Andorra was headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gilbert Saboya 
</p>
<p>Suny&#233;. At its 14th meeting, held on 12 May 2015, the Working Group adopted the 
</p>
<p>report on Andorra. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the followi ng group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Andorra: Ethiopia, Portugal and Qatar.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following 
</p>
<p>documents were issued for the review of Andorra:  
</p>
<p> (a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/AND/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/AND/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/AND/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Mexico, Slovenia, Spain, 
</p>
<p>Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
</p>
<p>transmitted to Andorra through the troika. These questions are available on the 
</p>
<p>extranet of the Working Group. 
</p>

<p><b> </b>I.<b> </b>Summary of the proceedings of the review process<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Presentation by the State under review<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gilbert Saboya Suny&#233;, representing the 
</p>
<p>delegation of Andorra, began his speech by thanking Germany, Mexico, Slovenia, 
</p>
<p>Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the 
</p>
<p>questions that they had transmitted in advance.  
</p>
<p>6. The Principality of Andorra had submitted its report for the first cycle of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review on 3 November 2010 and, following the review, the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Foreign Affairs had informed all government departments of the recommendations 
</p>
<p>that had been accepted and had assumed responsibility for coordinating  the follow-up 
</p>
<p>and implementation of those recommendations.  
</p>
<p>7. The report submitted to the Working Group for the second cycle of the review 
</p>
<p>had also been drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice and the Interior, the Ministry of Finance and Public 
</p>
<p>Administration, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Ministry of Education and 
</p>
<p>Youth, and the Public Prosecutor &#8217;s Office. The report had been submitted to all public 
</p>
<p>authorities and to the parliament and local authorities for their input. Civil society had 
</p>
<p>also been invited to participate in the drafting of the report , through an announcement 
</p>
<p>published in the Official Gazette.  
</p>
<p>8. Since joining the United Nations in 1993, Andorra had ratified more than 200 
</p>
<p>international treaties. Between September 2010 and January 2015, Andorra had 
</p>
<p>ratified 15 new treaties, including optional and additional protocols, and had adopted 
</p>
<p>over 130 laws and legislative amendments in compliance with its international 
</p>
<p>commitments.  </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-11980 <b>4/19 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>9. Since the first cycle of the review, Andorra had made progress in the submission 
</p>
<p>of reports to treaty bodies. In recognition of the importance of such periodic reports, it 
</p>
<p>would shortly submit a report to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>10. In the legislative field, a major reform undertaken by Andorra had been the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Foreign Investment Act of 21 June 2012, which had extended 
</p>
<p>economic rights to all legal residents, with no restrictions based on nationality or 
</p>
<p>residence. On 31 May 2012, the Immigration Act had been amended to bring all 
</p>
<p>provisions relating to the various types of residence in a single text.  
</p>
<p>11. At the European level, on 18 March 2015, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra had 
</p>
<p>entered into negotiations to establish a new framework of relations with the European 
</p>
<p>Union. The commitment of Andorra to human rights had also been reflected during its 
</p>
<p>chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, from 9 
</p>
<p>November 2012 to 16 May 2013, when it had set education for democratic citizenship 
</p>
<p>and human rights education as priorities.  
</p>
<p>12. Andorra had also contributed actively to promoting the European Convention on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights through a social network campaign.  
</p>
<p>13. Moreover, the University of Andorra had just established a new chair specifically 
</p>
<p>for human rights. 
</p>
<p>14. Regarding education, the delegation of Andorra referred to the invitation from 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General of the United Nations to serve as one of the champion countries 
</p>
<p>for the Global Education First Initiative, which aimed to put every child in school, 
</p>
<p>improve the quality of learning and foster global citizenship.  
</p>
<p>15. The Principality of Andorra had three national public education systems: French, 
</p>
<p>Spanish and Andorran. Education was free, and the system had no doubt encouraged 
</p>
<p>the integration of foreigners in a country that was home to more than 100 nationalities 
</p>
<p>and where the national population accounted for under half of all residents . 
</p>
<p>Multilingualism was therefore important for the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>16. The Principality of Andorra had since 2002 adopted legislation guaranteeing the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities. On 11 March 2014, in response to one of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made during the first cycle of the review, Andorra had acceded to 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p>17. Act No. 6/2014 on social and health-care services, which had been adopted on 24 
</p>
<p>April 2014, had set up a range of technical, economic and technological services for 
</p>
<p>all citizens, particularly persons in need of social assistance or those who were 
</p>
<p>dependent on others, socially excluded or at risk.  
</p>
<p>18. With regard to involuntary unemployment, at the request of Spain, the delegation 
</p>
<p>of Andorra set out in detail the conditions for granting benefits and allowances, such 
</p>
<p>as requirements in terms of the age of beneficiaries and their personal circumstances.  
</p>
<p>19. In response to questions on the measures taken to reduce youth unemployment, 
</p>
<p>the delegation of Andorra referred to the Youth Employment Plan, adopted jointly on 
</p>
<p>19 January 2015 by the Ministry of Justice and the Interior and the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Education and Youth. The Plan, which was directed at young persons aged 16 to 20 
</p>
<p>who, having completed their school education, were unable to access the labour 
</p>
<p>market, offered diversified and personalized training to facilitate their integration into 
</p>
<p>the labour force. In addition, on 29 December 2011, an amendment to the Social 
</p>
<p>Security Act had enabled students aged 25 to 30 to pay health insurance contributions. 
</p>
<p>The law had created a new system that allowed unemployed persons registered with </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p><b>5/19 </b>GE.15-11980 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>the Employment Service but not receiving an allowance to have access to social 
</p>
<p>security. 
</p>
<p>20. As for the steps taken to strengthen education and cooperation with civil society 
</p>
<p>and the media to eradicate traditional stereotypes that perpetuated discrimination and 
</p>
<p>violence against women &#8212; a question that had been submitted in advance by Germany 
</p>
<p>&#8212; the delegation of Andorra explained that the Ministry of  Health and Welfare and the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Education and Youth had launched joint programmes to increase 
</p>
<p>awareness in society of women&#8217;s rights. It drew attention to information campaigns on 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights conducted during International Women&#8217;s Day and to training 
</p>
<p>workshops aimed at preventing abusive behaviour. 
</p>
<p>21. In 2012, the University of Andorra had, for the first time, encouraged schools to 
</p>
<p>participate in the &#8220;children&#8217;s university&#8221; project in order to promote science and break 
</p>
<p>down stereotypes about scientific knowledge. In 2013, Andorra Telecom had 
</p>
<p>organized a day for girls to encourage them to choose a career in engineering or 
</p>
<p>telecommunications. 
</p>
<p>22. In response to a question from Germany and the United Kingdom of Great 
</p>
<p>Britain and Northern Ireland on whether the Government of Andorra intended to 
</p>
<p>establish a national human rights institution in compliance with the Paris Principles, 
</p>
<p>the delegation pointed out that, during the first cycle of the review, Andorra had not 
</p>
<p>accepted the recommendation. Courts of justice and the Raonador del Ciutad&#224; 
</p>
<p>(Ombudsman) were the main guarantors of human rights in the country and the 
</p>
<p>creation of a new institution might be viewed as a costly duplication of those bodies. 
</p>
<p>Andorra could, however, carry out a study to determine whether such an institution 
</p>
<p>was needed. 
</p>
<p>23. Germany had also submitted a question about ratifying the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its Optional Protocol. During 
</p>
<p>the first cycle of the universal periodic review, the Government of Andorra had not 
</p>
<p>accepted the recommendation to ratify certain international instruments , owing to 
</p>
<p>regulatory constraints, including a lack of laws to regulate the right to strike and the 
</p>
<p>economic rights of residents. Nevertheless, on 15 January 2015, in response to 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first cycle of the review, a bill to regulate labour disputes 
</p>
<p>had been submitted to the parliament. The new Government would review the bill with 
</p>
<p>the aim of resubmitting it before the end of the year.  
</p>
<p>24. In response to a question from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland on including a definition of torture in the Criminal Code and 
</p>
<p>establishing a national mechanism for the prevention of torture, the delegation of 
</p>
<p>Andorra referred to amendments made to the Criminal Code pursuant to Act No. 
</p>
<p>40/2014 of 11 December, which implemented a recommendation made by the 
</p>
<p>Committee against Torture after its consideration of the initial report of Andorra.  
</p>
<p>25. The delegation of Andorra added that the Ombudsman undertook regular visits to 
</p>
<p>detention centres to receive complaints from inmates for submission to the parliament. 
</p>
<p>26. As for the Rome Statute, national laws and cooperation with the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court &#8212; a question raised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland &#8212; according to the delegation, the Act of 29 December 2000 on 
</p>
<p>international judicial cooperation in criminal matters covered the necessary 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for cooperation with the Court, but the Government planned to st udy the 
</p>
<p>matter in greater detail. 
</p>
<p>27. The delegation of Andorra added that the question from the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland on procedures for determining refugee status and 
</p>
<p>non-refoulement was answered by Act No. 9/2012 of 31 May 2012, article 11 of which </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-11980 <b>6/19 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>acknowledged the right of international organizations such as the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to provide refugees with identity 
</p>
<p>documents. Andorra was also a party to the European Convention on Extr adition. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, article 14 of the Extradition Act of 28 November 1996 was very clear on 
</p>
<p>the matter. 
</p>
<p>28. Mexico had submitted a question on the right of seasonal workers to family 
</p>
<p>reunification. The delegation replied that Act No.  9/2012 of 31 May 2012 allowed 
</p>
<p>seasonal workers to live and work in the country for a continuous period of 12  months 
</p>
<p>at most and did not provide for the right to family reunification. However, the Minister 
</p>
<p>added that, regardless of their parents&#8217; immigration status, the children of seasonal 
</p>
<p>workers were covered by the Andorran education and health-care systems. 
</p>
<p>29. In response to recommendations to prohibit corporal punishment, the most recent 
</p>
<p>reform of the Criminal Code had in December 2014 established that such offences 
</p>
<p>constituted a criminal act. Corporal punishment was thus now prohibited in all places 
</p>
<p>and in all circumstances. 
</p>
<p>30. Regarding the promotion of gender parity, all parliamentary groups had endorsed 
</p>
<p>the drafting of a white paper on equality as a means of compiling information on the 
</p>
<p>actual situation of women in government and establishing a common strategy.  
</p>
<p>31. On 15 January 2015, the parliament had also adopted Act No. 1/2015 on the 
</p>
<p>eradication of domestic violence and the establishment of a national commission for  
</p>
<p>the prevention of domestic and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>32. In response to written questions from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland on gender-based discrimination, the delegation of Andorra indicated 
</p>
<p>that the Constitution and other legal texts such as the Labour Code strictly prohibited 
</p>
<p>all forms of discrimination, inter alia on account of gender. In order to improve the 
</p>
<p>observance of women&#8217;s rights, the Government intended to submit a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>gender equality bill to the parliament so as to equip the country and its institutions 
</p>
<p>with the mechanisms needed to promote and protect women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>33. With regard to the marriageable age and the recommendations to alter the 
</p>
<p>minimum age, the Government had noted that, over the last four  years, there had been 
</p>
<p>no marriages involving minors between the ages of 16 and 18, nor of minors between 
</p>
<p>the ages of 14 and 16 with judicial consent, and that, as there were no cases indicating 
</p>
<p>a problem, amending the law was not a priority for the Government at the present 
</p>
<p>time. 
</p>

</p>
<p>35. Thailand commended Andorra for taking steps to address the problems relating 
</p>
<p>to domestic violence, discrimination against persons with disabilities and human 
</p>
<p>trafficking. It welcomed the amendment to the Criminal Code in 2014 which created 
</p>
<p>new offences within the crime of trafficking in persons for purposes such as slavery 
</p>
<p>and sexual exploitation. Thailand also welcomed the adoption of the Act on the

<p><b>7/19 </b>GE.15-11980 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>Elimination of Gender-based and Domestic Violence and the ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p>36. Timor-Leste appreciated the measures taken by Andorra to face human rights 
</p>
<p>challenges, such as the establishment of the National Equality Commission to address 
</p>
<p>anti-discrimination issues and the adoption of a bill on the elimination of gender -based 
</p>
<p>violence and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>37. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland commended the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Labour Relations Code that prohibits discrimination on the grounds of 
</p>
<p>sex, the establishment of the National Equality Commission and the work done with  
</p>
<p>regard to the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. It encouraged further 
</p>
<p>action in those areas and hoped that Andorra would ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment.  
</p>
<p>38. The United States of America commended Andorra for its exemplary human 
</p>
<p>rights record and longstanding commitment to democracy and the promotion of human 
</p>
<p>rights. However, it was concerned that Andorra had not yet developed or implemented 
</p>
<p>all the mechanisms necessary for the protection of the rights of workers, including 
</p>
<p>laws, resources, investigations, remediation and penalties. It also noted that the law 
</p>
<p>did not provide for an independent mechanism to investigate abuses and killings by 
</p>
<p>the security force and that there was no official status for faiths other than 
</p>
<p>Catholicism. 
</p>
<p>39. Uruguay noted the recent ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It also noted the recent approval of the law  
</p>
<p>on gender-based and domestic violence and that a national commission on the 
</p>
<p>prevention of violence had been established. Uruguay welcomed the multidisciplinary 
</p>
<p>commission to combat gender-based and domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>40. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela stressed the political will of Andorra to 
</p>
<p>implement the recommendations accepted during the first universal periodic review, 
</p>
<p>despite the economic crisis. It underscored the strengthening of the legislative 
</p>
<p>framework for social and health services, which completed the management of the 
</p>
<p>Andorra social protection system. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) recognized the 
</p>
<p>progress made in implementing policies to protect the rights of women and to promote 
</p>
<p>their participation in society. It underlined the approval of significant legislative 
</p>
<p>provisions aimed at eradicating gender-based and domestic violence, which were 
</p>
<p>accompanied by national awareness-raising campaigns on the rights of women.  
</p>
<p>41. France welcomed the ratification by Andorra of several international 
</p>
<p>conventions, in particular the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>and its Optional Protocol, the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and 
</p>
<p>Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), as 
</p>
<p>well as the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against 
</p>
<p>Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuses. It also welcomed the recent legislative 
</p>
<p>amendments to the Criminal Code aimed at prohibiting corporal punishment.  
</p>
<p>42. Angola commended Andorra for enhancing new developments in the justice 
</p>
<p>sector, which enabled social inclusion of people, regardless of race, social condition or 
</p>
<p>affiliation. It also commended the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
</p>
<p>Organized Crime. It appreciated the establishment of the National Youth Forum, which 
</p>
<p>enabled youth to participate in political and social life.  
</p>
<p>43. Argentina commended Andorra for ratifying the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. It voiced and echoed the concern </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-11980 <b>8/19 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>raised by the Committee on the Rights of the Child about the rights of children with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, in particular their access to social and appropriate health -care services. 
</p>
<p>Argentina referred to the international campaign for the ratification of the 
</p>
<p>International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance.  
</p>
<p>44. The delegation of Andorra thanked the other delegations for acknowledgin g the 
</p>
<p>efforts undertaken by Andorra in the field of human rights. Regarding abuse by law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials, particularly the police, the delegation reaffirmed that the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code provided for relevant judicial procedures. As for the request made to 
</p>
<p>Andorra to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance, the Minister replied that the Government would conduct an 
</p>
<p>in-depth study of the commitments required under the Convention. 
</p>
<p>45. Australia appreciated the strong human rights framework of Andorra, which 
</p>
<p>valued the integrity of the person. It praised the efforts to address gender -based and

</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities, its Optional  Protocol and the Optional Protocol to 
</p>

</p>
<p>those same matters, as well as the forthcoming White Paper on the promotion of

<p>punishment against children so as to protect them from violence, sexual exploitation 
</p>
<p>and abuse. It also noted that Andorra had prohibited domestic violence against women, 
</p>

</p>
<p>Committee against Torture and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture 
</p>
<p>and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, including through the 
</p>
<p>incorporation of recommendations into national legislation. However, it was surprised 
</p>
<p>that Andorra had rejected the recommendations made during the first cycle of the 
</p>
<p>review to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
</p>
<p>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  
</p>
<p>52. Estonia noted that Andorra had made valuable progress in the areas of children &#8217;s

</p>
<p>recommendations made by the Committee against Torture. The delegation pointed out 
</p>
<p>that the Criminal Code contained a specific provision on child trafficking and that 
</p>
<p>Andorra had ratified the European Convention on Action against Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Human Beings and the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children 
</p>
<p>against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.

</p>
<p>gender-based and domestic violence and the adoption of legislation introducing 
</p>
<p>standards and mechanisms to improve equality between men and women with regard 
</p>
<p>to working conditions and remuneration.  
</p>
<p>56. Germany remained concerned, despite many positive developments, at persisting 
</p>
<p>discrepancies between the law on paper and in reality, such as the need to increase 
</p>
<p>awareness about the rights of persons with disabilities and the removal of all barriers, 
</p>
<p>both physical and cultural, which impede persons with disabilities from living in 
</p>
<p>dignity.

</p>
<p>foreign nationals to fully access their economic rights.  
</p>
<p>58. Ireland commended Andorra for extending a standing invitation to all special 
</p>
<p>procedures of the Human Rights Council. Ireland noted that, despite having ratified 
</p>
<p>both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in 2006, 
</p>
<p>Andorra had yet to submit an initial report to either of those treaty bodies. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, Ireland encouraged Andorra to take all possible steps to submit its outstanding 
</p>
<p>reports to the United Nations treaty bodies as expeditiously as possible. Ireland </p>

<p>with regard to gender equality, in particular the absence of a comprehensive gender 
</p>
<p>equality and anti-discrimination law and a corresponding national plan covering all 
</p>
<p>areas of the Convention, and asked Andorra to elaborate further on the steps and 
</p>
<p>measures taken in that regard.  
</p>
<p>65. Morocco noted the ratification of 15 international human rights treaties since the

</p>
<p>appropriateness of establishing such an institution.  
</p>
<p>80. The human rights training for journalists and the media mentioned by Slovenia

<p>85. The recommendations below did not enjoy the support of Andorra, but were 
</p>
<p>noted:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>85.1 Amend the Criminal Code with the view to specifically prohibiting 
</p>
<p>trafficking in human beings as a criminal offence (Ireland); <b> 
</b></p>
<p>85.2 Prohibit and appropriately sanction corporal punishment (Chile).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>86. Andorra noted the recommendation contained in paragraph 85.1 concerning 
</p>
<p>the need to amend the Criminal Code in order to specifically prohibit trafficking 
</p>
<p>in human beings as a criminal offence. It stated that article 134 bis, entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trafficking of human beings&#8221;, of the Andorran Criminal Code currently in 
</p>
<p>force, explicitly prohibits trafficking in human beings and sanctions anyone who 
</p>
<p>&#8220;recruits, transports, transfers, hosts one or more persons for the purpose of 
</p>
<p>slavery or other types of servitude&#8221; with a prison sentence from 2 to 6 years. 
</p>
<p>Article 134 bis, point 2, further extends the offence by specifying that whenever 
</p>
<p>such actions are perpetrated upon children, there is no need for any listed 
</p>
<p>misconducts, such as abuse, intimidation, threat, use of force, promise of 
</p>
<p>economical rewards or other benefits, in order to consider it human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>Putting at risk the life of persons who are victims of such conducts or acting on 
</p>
<p>persons with special vulnerabilities such as mental or physical incapacities are all 
</p>
<p>aggravating causes. Articles 121 bis and 157 bis of the Andorran Criminal Code 
</p>
<p>also criminalize trafficking in human beings for the purpose of the removal of 
</p>
<p>organs and sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>87. Andorra noted the recommendation contained in paragraph 85.2 regarding 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of corporal punishment of children, based on the legal framework 
</p>
<p>already in force in Andorra. It stated that article 476 of the Criminal Code 
</p>
<p>Qualifying Law 9/2005, as amended by article 40 of Law 40/2014 of 11 December 
</p>
<p>2014, clearly prohibits all forms of corporal punishment of children, including 
</p>
<p>teenagers, in all settings in Andorra.<b> </b></p>
