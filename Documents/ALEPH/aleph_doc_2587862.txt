MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2013
This  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (“MD&A”)  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  unaudited  condensed
interim consolidated financial statements of Goldcorp Inc. (“Goldcorp” or “the Company”) for the three and six months
ended  June  30,  2013  and  related  notes  thereto  which  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial
Reporting  Standards  (“GAAP”  or  “IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”).  This
MD&A  contains  “forward-looking  statements”  that  are  subject  to  risk  factors  set  out  in  a  cautionary  note  contained
herein. All figures are in United States (“US”) dollars unless otherwise noted. References to C$ are to Canadian dollars.
This MD&A has been prepared as of July 24, 2013.
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
Key consolidated financial information:
•   Net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $(1,934) million ($(2.38) per share), compared with
net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $268 million ($0.33 per share) in 2012.
•   Operating cash flows of $80 million, compared with $510 million in 2012.
•   Dividends paid of $121 million, compared to $110 million in 2012.
•   $3.4 billion of liquidity. (1)
•   At  June  30,  2013,  the  Company  recognized  an  impairment  charge  of  $1,958  million,  net  of  tax,
principally in respect of the Company’s exploration potential at its Peñasquito mine.
Key performance measures: (2)
•   Goldcorp’s  share  of  gold  production  increased  to  646,000  ounces  compared  with  578,600  ounces  in
2012 with the commencement of commercial production at Pueblo Viejo in 2013.
•   Total  cash  costs  of  $646  per  gold  ounce,  net  of  by-product  silver,  copper,  lead  and  zinc  credits,
compared with $370 per gold ounce in 2012. On a co-product basis, cash costs of $713 per gold ounce,
compared with $619 per gold ounce in 2012. (3)
•   All-in sustaining costs of $1,279 per ounce compared with $1,052 in 2012. (4)
•   Adjusted net earnings of $117 million ($0.14 per share), compared with $332 million ($0.41 per share) in
2012. (5)
•   Goldcorp’s share of adjusted operating cash flows was $388 million ($0.48 per share), compared to $520
million ($0.64 per share) in 2012. (6)
•   Goldcorp’s share of free cash flows of $(565) million, compared to $(73) million in 2012. (7)
(1) At June 30, 2013, the Company held $899 million of cash and cash equivalents, $491 million of money market investments
and held an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility.
(2) The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures on an attributable (or Goldcorp’s share) basis throughout this
document.  Attributable  performance  measures  include  the  Company’s  mining  operations  and  projects,  and  the  Company’s
share  from  Alumbrera  and  Pueblo  Viejo.  The  Company  believes  that  disclosing  certain  performance  measures  on  an
attributable basis is a more relevant measurement of the Company’s operating and economic performance, and reflects the
Company’s view of its core mining operations. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and
ability to generate cash flow; however, these performance measures do not have any standardized meaning. Accordingly, it
is  intended  to  provide  additional  information  and  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a  substitute  for  measures  of
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(3) The  Company  has  included  non-GAAP  performance  measures  –  total  cash  costs,  by-product  and  co-product,  per  gold
ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does
not  have  any  standardized  meaning.  The  Company  follows  the  recommendations  of  the  Gold  Institute  Production  Cost
Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group
of suppliers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally
accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies. The Company believes that, in addition
to  conventional  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  the  Company  and  certain  investors  use  this  information  to
evaluate  the  Company’s  performance  and  ability  to  generate  cash  flow.  Accordingly,  it  is  intended  to  provide  additional
information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp’s share of by-product silver, copper,
lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp’s share of production costs.
Total  cash  costs  on  a  co-product  basis  are  calculated  by  allocating  Goldcorp‘s  share  of  production  costs  to  each  co-product  based  on  the  ratio  of
actual  sales  volumes  multiplied  by  budget  metal  prices,  as  compared  to  realized  sales  prices.  The  Company  uses  budget  prices  to  eliminate  price
volatility and improve co-product cash cost reporting comparability between periods. The budget metal prices used in the calculation of co-product total
cash costs were as follows:

Using actual realized sales prices, co-product total cash costs would be $716 per gold ounce for the three months ended June 30, 2013 (June 30,
2012 – $630). Refer to page 41 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs.
(4) The Company, in conjunction with an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry, has adopted an all-in sustaining
cost non-GAAP performance measure that the Company believes more fully defines the total costs associated with producing
gold;  however,  this  performance  measure  has  no  standardized  meaning.  Accordingly,  it  is  intended  to  provide  additional
information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
with  GAAP.  The  Company  reports  this  measure  on  a  gold  ounces  sold  basis.  Effective  June  30,  2013,  the  Company  has
conformed its all-in sustaining definition to the measure as set out in the guidance note released by the World Gold Council
on June 27, 2013 and which is expected to be effective from January 1, 2014. The comparative periods have been restated
accordingly. Refer to page 42 for a reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs.
(5) Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes
that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this
information to evaluate the Company’s performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to
page 43 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp.
(6) Adjusted  operating  cash  flows  and  adjusted  operating  cash  flows  per  share  are  non-GAAP  performance  measures  which
comprise Goldcorp’s share of operating cash flows before working capital changes and which the Company believes provides
additional information about the Company’s ability to generate cash flows from its mining operations. Refer to page 44 for a
reconciliation  of  adjusted  operating  cash  flows  before  working  capital  changes  to  reported  net  cash  provided  by  operating
activities.
(7) Free  cash  flows  is  a  non-GAAP  performance  measure  which  the  Company  believes  that,  in  addition  to  conventional
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use to evaluate the Company’s ability to
generate cashflows. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or
as  a  substitute  for  measures  of  performance  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Free  cash  flows  are  calculated  by
deducting from net cash provided by operating activities, Goldcorp’s share of expenditures on mining interests, deposits on
mining  interest  expenditures  and  capitalized  interest  paid,  and  adding  Goldcorp’s  share  of  net  cash  provided  by  operating
activities  from  Alumbrera  and  Pueblo  Viejo.  Refer  to  page  44  for  a  reconciliation  of  free  cash  flows  to  reported  net  cash
provided by operating activities.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
OVERVIEW
Goldcorp  is  a  leading  gold  producer  engaged  in  the  operation,  exploration,  development  and  acquisition  of  precious
metal properties in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Central and South America. The Company’s current sources
of operating cash flows are primarily from the sale of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc.
Goldcorp is one of the world’s fastest growing senior gold producers. Goldcorp’s strategy is to provide its shareholders
with  superior  returns  from  high  quality  assets.  Goldcorp  has  a  strong  balance  sheet.  Its  low-cost  gold  production  is
located in safe jurisdictions in the Americas and remains 100% unhedged.
Goldcorp is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: GG) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol: G).
At June 30, 2013, the Company’s principal producing mining properties were comprised of the Red Lake, Porcupine and
Musselwhite  gold  mines  in  Canada;  the  Peñasquito  gold/silver/lead/zinc  mine  and  the  Los  Filos  and  El  Sauzal  gold
mines  in  Mexico;  the  Marlin  gold/silver  mine  in  Guatemala;  the  Alumbrera  gold/copper  mine  (37.5%  interest)  in
Argentina;  the  Marigold  (66.7%  interest)  and  Wharf  gold  mines  in  the  United  States;  and  the  Pueblo  Viejo
gold/silver/copper mine in the Dominican Republic (40% interest).
The  Company’s  significant  development  projects  at  June  30,  2013  were  comprised  of  the  Cerro  Negro  gold  project  in
Argentina;  the  Éléonore  and  Cochenour  gold  projects  in  Canada;  the  El  Morro  gold/copper  project  (70%  interest)  in
Chile;  the  Camino  Rojo  gold/silver  project  in  Mexico;  and  the  Cerro  Blanco  gold/silver  project  in  Guatemala.  The
Company also owns a 27.0% equity interest in Primero Mining Corp. (“Primero”), a publicly traded company engaged in
the  production  of  precious  metals  with  operations  (primarily  the  San  Dimas  gold/silver  mine)  in  Mexico,  and  a  39.8%
equity  interest  in  Tahoe  Resources  Inc.  (“Tahoe”),  a  publicly  traded  company  focused  on  the  exploration  and
development of resource properties, with a principal objective to develop the Escobal silver project in Guatemala.
During June 2013, the announcement of a potential reduction in quantitative easing by the US Open Market Committee
led  to  sharp  increases  in  long-term  US  interest  rates  and  the  US  dollar  index  trading  at  three-year  highs.  This,  along
with other macroeconomic indicators in the United States, suggested the US economy, and accordingly the strength of
the US dollar, would improve. In response, gold prices declined sharply during June, closing below $1,200 at the end of
the  second  quarter.  Other  commodity  prices  were  similarly  affected  and  commodity-linked  currencies,  including  the
Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso, weakened.
The Company realized an average gold price of $1,358 per ounce during the second quarter of 2013, a 16% decrease,
compared  to  $1,622  per  ounce  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013.  Average  realized  prices  were  5%  below  London  Metal
Exchange averages for the quarter due to the negative impact of provisional pricing and higher gold sales occurring late
in the quarter as prices declined. Gold production increased 5% from the prior quarter to 646,000 ounces, primarily as a
result of higher sulphide mill throughput and oxide production, higher ore grades and increased metallurgical recoveries
at Peñasquito, and the continued ramp-up of operations at Pueblo Viejo. These improvements in production compared
to the prior quarter were offset by a 16% decrease at Red Lake due to lower grades as a favourable mining sequence in
the  first  quarter  of  2013  provided  better  grades  and  higher  tonnage  in  the  High  Grade  Zone  in  the  prior  quarter.  At
June 30, 2013, Red Lake and Pueblo Viejo held finished goods inventory due to the timing of gold pours at the end of
the quarter. Production costs increased 8% due to higher labour and consumables costs, symptomatic of the continued
cost pressures seen across the mining industry.
Studies were completed and have defined an additional water source for Peñasquito referred to as the “Northern Well
Field” within Peñasquito’s current permitted Cedros basin. During the first half of 2013, water availability was stabilized
with  the  addition  of  new  wells  within  the  existing  well  field  and  new  dewatering  wells  around  the  mining  areas.  The
addition  of  the  Northern  Well  Field  will  provide  the  flexibility  to  resume  ramp-up  to  the  design  throughput  of  130,000
tonnes  per  day.  The  capital  cost  is  estimated  to  be  approximately  $150  million.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating
route alternatives to access the well field.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
To  address  water  requirements  over  the  longer  term,  ongoing  studies  will  continue  to  assess  the  potential  to  source
waste  water  from  nearby  towns  and  municipalities  to  help  meet  water  requirements  for  the  Camino  Rojo  project  and
potential  production  from  the  newly-discovered  skarn  mineralization  beneath  the  Peñasquito  pits.  Several  options  to
enhance tailings efficiency are also being assessed, with thickened tailings being a common component to the options
evaluated. A feasibility study is now underway that will analyze the potential of thickened tailings to reduce overall fresh
water requirements at Peñasquito. The study is expected to be completed in mid-2014.
At  Cerro  Negro,  advancements  continued  across  key  areas  of  the  project  throughout  the  second  quarter  of  2013
including  plant  construction,  infrastructure,  mine  development  and  exploration.  The  permit  for  the  construction  of  the
transmission line from site to the national grid was obtained in March 2013, six months later than previously expected.
This delay has shifted the construction period for the transmission line into the Patagonian winter and has the potential
to delay commissioning and initial production until the first quarter of 2014.
On June 13, 2013, the Province of Santa Cruz passed amendments to the Provincial Tax Code and Provincial Tax Law,
which imposes a new tax on mining real estate property in the Province. The tax will amount to 1% of the value of the
economically viable reserves of mining projects as indicated in feasibility studies filed with the Province or as published
in  a  corporation’s  annual  financial  statements.  The  new  law  came  into  force  on  July  5,  2013.  There  are  a  number  of
uncertainties  surrounding  the  scope,  calculation  and  enforcement  of  the  tax  and  the  mining  industry  is  waiting  for
publication of regulations detailing these matters. It is expected that the tax will be payable annually by the Company’s
Cerro Negro project, which is currently under construction. The Company, as well as potentially other mining companies
operating in the Province of Santa Cruz, plans to challenge the constitutionality and legality of the new tax law.
In May 2013, Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Corporation (“PVDC”) reached an agreement in principle with the Government of
the  Dominican  Republic  (the  “Government”)  concerning  amendments  to  the  Pueblo  Viejo  Special  Lease  Agreement
(“SLA”). The agreement in principle addresses the fiscal objectives of the country in a way that will provide stability for
both  parties  moving  forward.  If  the  proposed  amendments  are  implemented  and  entered  into  force,  revenues  to  the
Government will be increased and brought forward via a number of proposed changes.
Based  on  the  proposed  amendments,  it  is  anticipated  there  will  be  an  approximate  50/50  split  of  the  expected  cash
flows from the mine between PVDC and the Government over the years 2013-2016. This would result in tax revenues to
the Government of approximately $2.2 billion over this period at a gold price of $1,600 per ounce. The economic benefit
of  these  changes  over  the  life  of  the  mine  to  the  Government  is  approximately  $1.5  billion  (net  present  value  at  5%
discount rate and $1,600 gold price assumption).
The proposed amendments are subject to negotiation of a Definitive Agreement, which will require the approval of the
Boards  of  Directors  of  Barrick  Gold  Corporation  and  Goldcorp  and  the  project  lenders.  The  Definitive  Agreement  will
also be subject to approval by the Congress of the Dominican Republic. The SLA will continue according to its present
terms  unless  and  until  the  Definitive  Agreement  is  fully  executed  and  approved.  The  Government  has  reaffirmed  its
support  for  this  world  class  mine.  Based  on  the  Company’s  current  assessment  of  the  economic  impact  of  these
assessments, the carrying value of the project is recoverable.
Metals Price Environment
The sharp decline in commodity prices seen towards the latter part of the second quarter of 2013, and the decline in the
Company’s  share  price  resulted  in  the  Company’s  market  capitalization  falling  below  its  net  asset  value,  acted  as
indicators of potential impairment. The Company performs impairment testing annually and when impairment indicators
are present on all mining properties. Impairment testing is performed using life of mine after-tax cash flow projections,
which  incorporate  management’s  best  estimates  of  future  metal  prices,  production  based  on  current  estimates  of
recoverable  reserves  and  resources,  exploration  potential,  future  operating  costs  and  non-expansionary  capital
expenditures, inflation and long-term foreign exchange rates.

(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
If metal prices were to remain at spot prices for an extended period of time, the Company would need to re-evaluate the
pricing  assumptions  used  for  impairment  testing.  For  the  2012  year  end  (“YE”)  annual  and  second  quarter  2013
assessments, the metal prices assumptions were as follows:

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company recorded impairment charges of $1,958 million, net of
tax,  primarily  related  to  Peñasquito  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  the  metal  pricing  environment  related  to  in-situ
exploration ounces, in combination with the changes to the Life of Mine (“LOM”) plan and the pending Mexican mining
duty.
As at June 30, 2013, the carrying amounts, including goodwill and net of tax, for the Red Lake, Cerro Negro, Éléonore,
and Alumbrera cash generating units (“CGU”) were approximately $3.3 billion, $4.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $0.5 billion,
respectively.
The table below indicates the long-term gold price assumptions required in order for the estimated recoverable amounts
to equal the carrying amounts for each of the Red Lake, Cerro Negro, Éléonore, and Alumbrera CGUs.
Long-term gold price
Long-term price – $ per ounce where recoverable amount to equal

$    1,044
Cerro Negro
$    1,112
Éléonore   
$    980
Alumbrera
$    670 (1)
However, the Company believes that adverse changes in metal price assumptions would impact certain other inputs for
the LOM plans, which may offset, to a certain extent, the impact of the adverse changes.
The following change in production cost assumptions required in order for the estimated recoverable amounts to equal
the carrying amounts for each of the Red Lake, Cerro Negro, Éléonore, and Alumbrera CGUs is noted below:
Production cost
% increase required for recoverable amount to equal carrying value
As at June 30, 2013
Red Lake   
52.7%
Cerro Negro
25.6%
Éléonore     
73.4%
Alumbrera
6.5%
Additionally,  Argentina’s  current  inflationary  and  foreign  exchange  environment  continues  to  be  evaluated.  A  key
assumption  in  Cerro  Negro’s  current  LOM  after-tax  cash  flow  projections  is  that  total  operating  costs  increased  by
inflation  would  be  offset  by  a  devaluation  of  the  Argentine  peso  following  production  start-up.  Should  this  assumption
regarding  the  future  macroeconomic  situation  in  Argentina  change,  and  sustained  inflation  continues,  without  a
commensurate  change  in  the  foreign  exchange  rate,  the  estimated  recoverable  amount  of  Cerro  Negro  could  be
adversely impacted.
(1) Due to the limited remaining mine life at Alumbrera, its recoverable amount is not significantly impacted by a change in long-term gold prices.
Alumbrera would require short-term prices to be $1,240 for its estimated recoverable value to equal its carrying value.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
OUTLOOK UPDATE
In  light  of  the  decrease  in  metals  prices,  the  Company  is  reviewing  its  short-term  operating  plans  with  a  focus  on
improving operating cash flow through optimal mine planning in a lower cost price environment, cost containment, and
maximizing  returns  on  capital  employed.  Reductions  and  deferrals  at  mines  and  projects  have  been  implemented
effective  as  of  July  16,  2013  that  are  expected  to  reduce  total  2013  capital  expenditures  to  $2.6  billion  compared  to
previously-issued guidance of $2.8 billion. Production and cost guidance for 2013 are not expected to be affected by the
changes and remain at 2.55 to 2.8 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cash costs of $1,000 to $1,100 per ounce.
The Company will continue to assess the potential impact of capital spending changes on its five-year production profile
and provide updated guidance as appropriate.
The  Company  has  identified  opportunities  to  defer  2013  and  2014  capital  expenditures  at  its  three  growth  projects
currently  under  construction,  Cerro  Negro,  Éléonore  and  Cochenour.  These  reductions  involve  non-critical  path  items
and are not expected to have material impacts to the project schedules or the timing of initial gold production and ramp-
up  to  commercial  production.  Additional  reductions  have  also  been  identified  at  early-stage  development  projects
including  Camino  Rojo,  El  Morro  and  Cerro  Blanco.  Reductions  in  sustaining  capital  at  its  operating  mines  have  also
been  identified.  These  measures  are  expected  to  reduce  2013  capital  expenditures  by  approximately  $200  million  to
$2.6 billion. Production and cost guidance for 2013 are not affected by the changes and remain at 2.55 to 2.80 million
ounces  of  gold.  Despite  lower  by-product  metals  prices,  the  Company  continues  to  expect  full-year  all-in  sustaining
cash costs of between $1,000 and $1,100 per ounce.
In addition, reductions in general administrative and exploration expenses have also been implemented. The Company
has targeted a 10% reduction in general administrative expense for 2013, resulting in new G&A guidance of $164 million
for  2013  compared  to  previous  guidance  of  $180  million.  A  targeted  $25  million  reduction  in  exploration  expenditures
has resulted in new forecast 2013 guidance of $200 million compared to previous guidance of $225 million.
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013:
On March 20, 2013, the Company issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes (the “Company’s Notes”), consisting of
$0.5  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  2.125%  notes  due  March  15,  2018  (the  “5-year  Notes”)  and  $1.0  billion
aggregate  principal  amount  of  3.70%  notes  due  March  15,  2023  (the  “10-year  Notes”).  The  Company  received  total
proceeds  of  $1.48  billion,  net  of  transaction  costs.  The  Company  intends  to  use  these  proceeds  for  capital
expenditures, capital investments or working capital.
On  May  7,  2013,  the  Company  announced  the  appointment  of  Russell  Ball  as  Executive  Vice  President,  Capital
Management. In his new role, Mr. Ball will lead the focus on financial discipline within Goldcorp’s project team as the
Company continues to advance construction at Cerro Negro in Argentina, Éléonore in Quebec and Cochenour near Red
Lake  in  Ontario.  His  group  will  also  lead  development  at  the  Company’s  next  generation  of  gold  growth  projects  and
work with Goldcorp’s operations teams on project management at existing mines.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
(1) Excludes  pre-commissioning  sales  ounces  from  Pueblo  Viejo,  prior  to  January  1,  2013,  as  costs  incurred,  net  of  proceeds  from  sales,  were
credited against capitalized project costs.
(2) Effective as of January 1, 2013, the Company’s 37.5% interest in Alumbrera is now required to be accounted for as an investment in associate
and consolidated using the equity method. The Company has restated the 2012 comparative periods to remove Alumbrera’s revenues, cash from
operating activities, and cash and cash equivalents, and to include the effect of Alumbrera on earnings from operations and associates; however,
the 2011 quarterly results have not been restated.
(3) The Company has included the Company’s share of the applicable production, sales and financial information of Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo in
the undernoted non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that disclosing certain performance measures including Alumbrera and
Pueblo Viejo is a more relevant measurement of the Company’s operating and economic performance, and reflects the Company’s view of its core
mining operations.
(4) Total  cash  costs  per  gold  ounce  on  a  by-product  basis  is  calculated  net  of  Goldcorp’s  share  of  by-product  sales  revenues  (by-product  copper
sales revenues for Alumbrera; by-product silver sales revenues for Marlin and Pueblo Viejo; by-product lead and zinc sales revenues and 75% of
silver  sales  revenues  for  Peñasquito  at  market  silver  prices,  and  25%  of  silver  sales  revenues  for  Peñasquito  at  $4.02  per  silver  ounce  sold  to
Silver Wheaton Corporation (“Silver Wheaton”)).
(5) Total  cash  costs  per  gold  ounce  on  a  co-product  basis  is  calculated  by  allocating  Goldcorp’s  share  of  production  costs  to  each  co-product
(Alumbrera (copper); Marlin (silver); Pueblo Viejo (silver); Peñasquito (silver, lead and zinc)) based on the ratio of actual sales volumes multiplied by
budget metal prices (see page 2).

REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2012
Net  loss  attributable  to  shareholders  of  Goldcorp  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  $(1,934)  million,  or  $(2.38)  per
share,  compared  to  net  earnings  attributable  to  shareholders  of  Goldcorp  of  $268  million,  or  $0.33  per  share,  in  the
second quarter of 2012. Compared to the second quarter of 2012, net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for
the three months ended June 30, 2013 was impacted significantly by the following factors:
•   Revenues decreased by $192 million, or 18%, primarily due to a $117 million decrease in gold revenues, a $57
million  decrease  in  silver  revenues  and  a  $20  million  decrease  in  lead  and  zinc  revenues,  net  of  refining
charges. The decrease in precious metal revenues resulted from significant declines in gold and silver realized
prices;
•   Production costs increased by $99 million, or 22%, resulting from higher employee, consumables and power
costs, and unfavourable foreign exchange movements;
•   Depreciation  and  depletion  increased  by  $21  million,  or  15%,  primarily  due  to  higher  sales  volumes  and
additional assets put into service;
•   Exploration  costs  decreased  by  $4  million  due  to  timing  of  expenditures  at  the  Company’s  Canadian
operations;
•   The  Company’s  share  of  net  earnings  of  associates  of  $17  million  was  primarily  comprised  of  $22  million  of
net  earnings  from  Pueblo  Viejo  and  $2  million  of  net  earnings  from  the  Company’s  equity  investments  in
Primero  and  Tahoe,  partially  offset  by  a  $7  million  net  loss  from  Alumbrera.  The  Company’s  share  of  net
losses  of  associates  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012  was  comprised  of  a  $22  million  net  loss  from  Tahoe,
partially offset by net earnings from Primero of $3 million;
An impairment of mining interests and goodwill of $2,558 million as at June 30, 2013. An impairment expense
•   An impairment of mining interests and goodwill of $2,558 million as at June 30, 2013. An impairment expense
of  $2,427  million  and  $131  million  ($1,827  million  and  $131  million,  net  of  tax)  was  recognized  against  the
carrying value of the Peñasquito mine and the Cerro Blanco project, respectively;
•   Corporate  administration,  excluding  share-based  compensation  expense,  was  $41  million,  an  increase  of  $6
million  primarily  due  to  increased  company  growth.  Share-based  compensation  expense  of  $22  million  was
comparable with the second quarter of 2012;
•   A  $48  million  decrease  in  loss  on  securities,  representing  an  impairment  expense  recognized  in  respect  of
certain of the Company’s available-for-sale equity and marketable securities;
•   A $22 million net gain on derivatives in the second quarter of 2013 comprised of a $19 million net gain on the
Company’s contract to sell 1.5 million ounces of silver to Silver Wheaton at a fixed price over each of the four
years  ending  August  5,  2014  (the  “Silver  Wheaton  silver  contract”);  a  $13  million  unrealized  gain  on  the
conversion  feature  of  the  Company’s  convertible  notes  (the  “Convertible  Notes”);  partially  offset  by  an  $8
million net loss on foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, zinc and silver contracts which are marked-to-
market at each period end with changes in fair value recorded in net earnings. In the second quarter of 2012, a
$67 million net gain on derivatives was comprised of a $48 million unrealized gain on the conversion feature of
the Convertible Notes; a $16 million net gain on the Silver Wheaton silver contract; and a $3 million net gain on
foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, zinc and silver contracts;
•   A $9 million increase in finance costs primarily arising from interest expense on the Company’s Notes which
were issued in March 2013;
•   Other  income  of  $5  million  was  primarily  comprised  of  interest  income  arising  on  the  Company’s  cash  and
cash  equivalents,  money  market  investments  and  loans  held  with  certain  of  the  Company’s  associates,
partially offset by foreign exchange
GOLDCORP  |  9
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
losses  arising  mainly  on  value  added  tax  receivables  denominated  in  Mexican  and  Argentinian  pesos  and
cash  and  cash  equivalents  denominated  in  Canadian  dollars.  Other  expense  of  $7  million  in  the  second
quarter  of  2012  was  primarily  comprised  of  an  $8  million  impairment  expense  recognized  in  respect  of  the
Primero 1-year convertible note and a foreign exchange loss of $8 million, partially offset by a $5 million gain
recognized on a mineral interest option payment received on one of the Company’s exploration properties and
$3 million of interest income earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, and the 1-year $60 million
convertible note and $50 million note receivable from Primero (the “Primero Notes”);
•   Income tax recovery for the three months ended June 30, 2013 totaled $503 million (three months ended June
30, 2012 – income tax expense of $127 million) and comprised:
•
A  $74  million  foreign  exchange  loss  on  the  translation  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities
arising  primarily  from  the  Placer  Dome  and  Glamis  acquisitions  in  2006,  and  Camino  Rojo  and  Cerro
•
•
Negro  acquisitions  in  2010,  compared  to  a  $53  million  loss  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012.  The  foreign
exchange  related  deferred  income  tax  impacts  in  both  periods  result  from  the  weakening  Canadian
dollar, Mexican peso, and Argentine peso;
A deferred income tax recovery of $600 million arising on the impairment of mining interest recognized at
June 30, 2013;
After adjusting taxes for the above noted items and excluding the impact of share-based compensation
expense  and  impairment  expense  from  earnings  before  taxes,  the  income  tax  expense  for  the  three
months  ended  June  30,  2013  was  approximately  16%  of  earnings  before  taxes  (three  months  ended
June 30, 2012 – 18%). The 2013 second quarter income included equity income from Pueblo Viejo that
is not subject to further income tax in Canada reducing the effective income tax rate. The 2012 second
quarter income tax expense was favourably impacted by the settlement of certain past tax positions and
significantly higher non-taxable mark-to-market gains relating to the conversion option of the Company’s
Convertible  Notes,  partially  offset  by  impairment  expense  in  respect  of  the  Company’s  investment  in
Primero and certain equity securities which were not tax effected.
Adjusted  net  earnings  amounted  to  $117  million,  or  $0.14  per  share (1),  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2013,
compared to $332 million, or $0.41 per share, for the second quarter of 2012. Compared to the second quarter of 2012,
adjusted  net  earnings  decreased  due  to  lower  revenues  primarily  resulting  from  lower  realized  prices  and  higher
production costs due to higher employee, consumables and power costs.
Total cash costs (by-product) increased to $646 per gold ounce (2), in the second quarter of 2013, as compared to $370
per  gold  ounce  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012.  The  increase  in  cash  costs  per  ounce  was  primarily  due  to  higher
production costs and lower by-product sales credits.
(1) Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition
to  conventional  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  the  Company  and  certain  investors  use  this  information  to  evaluate  the
Company’s  performance.  Accordingly,  it  is  intended  to  provide  additional  information  and  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 43 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to
reported net (loss) earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp.
(2) The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures – total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout
this  document.  In  the  gold  mining  industry,  total  cash  costs  is  a  common  performance  measure  but  does  not  have  any  standardized
meaning.  The  Company  follows  the  recommendations  of  the  Gold  Institute  Production  Cost  Standard.  The  Company  believes  that,  in
addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate
the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product
basis  are  calculated  by  deducting  Goldcorp’s  share  of  by-product  silver,  copper,  lead  and  zinc  sales  revenues  from  Goldcorp’s  share  of
production costs. Refer to page 41 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
Three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013
The net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the second quarter of 2013 was $(1,934) million, or $(2.38) per
share, compared to net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $309 million, or $0.38 per share, for the first
quarter of 2013. Compared to the prior quarter, the net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the three months
ended June 30, 2013 was impacted significantly by the following factors:
Revenues  decreased  by  $126  million,  or  12%,  due  to  a  $107  million  decrease  in  gold  revenues  and  a  $27
•   Revenues  decreased  by  $126  million,  or  12%,  due  to  a  $107  million  decrease  in  gold  revenues  and  a  $27
million decrease in silver revenues, partially offset by a $9 million increase in lead and zinc revenues, net of
refining  charges.  The  decrease  in  revenues  was  driven  by  the  significant  decline  in  gold  and  silver  prices
during the second quarter of 2013;
•   Production  costs  increased  by  $42  million,  or  8%,  primarily  due  to  higher  employee,  contractor  and  power
costs, and unfavourable foreign exchange movements;
•   Depreciation and depletion increased by $15 million, or 10%, due to higher sales volumes;
•   Exploration  costs  were  comparable  to  the  prior  quarter  as  activities  continued  to  focus  at  the  Company’s
Canadian sites, Peñasquito and Marlin;
•   The  Company’s  share  of  net  earnings  of  associates  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  of  $17  million  was
comprised of $22 million of net earnings from Pueblo Viejo and $2 million of net earnings from the Company’s
equity investments in Primero and Tahoe, partially offset by a $7 million net loss from Alumbrera. In the prior
quarter,  the  Company’s  share  of  net  earnings  of  associates  of  $37  million  was  primarily  comprised  of  $33
million and $9 million of net earnings from Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera, respectively, partially offset by a net
loss of $5 million from the Company’s equity investments in Tahoe and Primero;
•   An impairment of mining interests and goodwill of $2,558 million as at June 30, 2013. An impairment expense
of  $2,427  million  and  $131  million  ($1,827  million  and  $131  million,  net  of  tax)  was  recognized  against  the
carrying value of the Peñasquito mine and the Cerro Blanco project, respectively;
•   Corporate administration was $41 million, excluding share-based compensation expense, and was comparable
to  the  prior  quarter.  Share-based  compensation  expense  was  $22  million,  an  increase  of  $4  million  due  to
additional share option grants in the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of
the Company’s Performance Share Units (“PSUs”);
•   A  $6  million  increase  in  loss  on  securities  representing  an  impairment  expense  recognized  on  certain  of  the
Company’s available-for-sale equity and marketable securities;
•   A $22 million net gain on derivatives in the second quarter of 2013 comprised of a $19 million net gain on the
Silver  Wheaton  silver  contract;  a  $13  million  unrealized  gain  on  the  conversion  feature  of  the  Company’s
Convertible Notes; partially offset by an $8 million net loss on foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, zinc
and silver contracts. A $49 million net gain on derivatives in the first quarter of 2013 comprised of a $33 million
unrealized  gain  on  the  conversion  feature  of  the  Company’s  Convertible  Notes;  a  $14  million  gain  on  foreign
currency, heating oil, copper, lead, zinc and silver contracts; and a $2 million net gain on the Silver Wheaton
silver contract;
•   Finance costs increased by $8 million primarily due to interest expense arising on the Company’s Notes which
were issued in March 2013;
GOLDCORP  |  11
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
•   Other  income  of  $5  million  was  primarily  comprised  of  interest  income  arising  on  the  Company’s  cash  and
cash  equivalents,  money  market  investments  and  loans  held  with  certain  of  the  Company’s  associates,
partially  offset  by  foreign  exchange  losses  arising  mainly  on  value  added  tax  receivables  denominated  in
Mexican  and  Argentinian  pesos  and  cash  and  cash  equivalents  denominated  in  Canadian  dollars.  Other
income of $3 million in the first quarter of 2013 was primarily comprised of foreign exchange gains of $2 million
arising from value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican pesos and $1 million of interest income;
•   Income  tax  recovery  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2013  totaled  $503  million  (three  months  ended
March 31, 2013 – income tax expense of $50 million) and comprised:
•
•
•
A  $74  million  foreign  exchange  loss  on  the  translation  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities
arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro
Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $17 million foreign exchange gain in the first quarter of 2013.
The foreign exchange related deferred income tax impacts in both periods resulted from the weakening
Canadian dollar, Argentine peso, and Mexican peso (strengthening Mexican peso in the first quarter of
2013);
A deferred income tax recovery of $600 million arising on the impairment of mining interest recognized at
June 30, 2013;
After adjusting taxes for the above noted items and excluding the impact of share-based compensation
expense  and  impairment  expense  from  earnings  before  taxes,  the  income  tax  expense  for  the  three
months  ended  June  30,  2013  was  approximately  16%  of  earnings  before  taxes  (three  months  ended
March 31, 2013 – 18%). Both quarters were impacted by non-tax effected impairments of certain equity
securities  which  were  more  than  offset  by  non-taxable  mark-to-market  gains  related  to  the  conversion
option  of  the  Company’s  Convertible  Notes  and  the  Silver  Wheaton  silver  contract.  Overall,  the  net
effect  of  these  items  along  with  certain  non-deductible  costs,  such  as  accretion  on  the  Convertible
Notes, and relatively lower earnings before tax in the second quarter, resulted in a higher effective tax
rate in the second quarter of 2013.
Adjusted  net  earnings  amounted  to  $117  million,  or  $0.14  per  share  (1),  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2013,
compared to $253 million, or $0.31 per share (1), for the first quarter of 2013. Compared to the prior quarter, adjusted net
earnings  were  significantly  impacted  by  lower  revenues  primarily  as  a  result  of  lower  realized  prices  and  higher
production costs due to higher employee, contractor and power costs.
Total cash costs (by-product) increased to $646 per gold ounce (2), in the second quarter of 2013, as compared to $565
per gold ounce in the prior quarter. The increase in cash costs per ounce was primarily due to higher production costs.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
Six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012
The net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $(1,625) million, or
$(2.01) per share, compared to net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $747 million or $0.92 per share
for the six months ended June 30, 2012. Compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012, the net loss attributable to
shareholders of Goldcorp for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was impacted significantly by the following factors:
•   Revenues  decreased  by  $388  million,  or  17%,  primarily  due  to  a  $181  million  decrease  in  gold  revenues,  a
$151 million decrease in silver revenues, and a $61 million decrease in lead and zinc revenues, net of refining
charges. The decrease in revenues resulted from the decline in commodity prices during the second quarter of
2013;
•   Production  costs  increased  by  $113  million,  or  12%,  primarily  due  to  higher  employee,  labour  and
consumables costs;
•   Depreciation and depletion increased by $30 million, or 11%, due to higher sales volumes;
•   Exploration and evaluation costs decreased by $10 million due to timing of the Company’s drilling programs;
•   An impairment of mining interests and goodwill of $2,558 million as at June 30, 2013. An impairment expense
of  $2,427  million  and  $131  million  ($1,827  million  and  $131  million,  net  of  tax)  was  recognized  against  the
carrying value of the Peñasquito mine and the Cerro Blanco project, respectively;
•   Corporate  administration  was  $83  million,  excluding  share-based  compensation  expense,  an  increase  of  $4
million  compared  to  the  second  quarter  of  2012,  due  to  increased  corporate  activity.  Share-based
compensation  expense  decreased  by  $10  million  primarily  resulting  from  a  decrease  in  the  fair  value  of  the
Company’s PSUs;
•   The Company’s share of net earnings of associates of $54 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was
primarily  comprised  of  net  earnings  of  $55  million  and  $2  million  from  Pueblo  Viejo  and  Alumbrera,
respectively, partially offset by $3 million of net losses from the Company’s equity investments in Primero and
Tahoe. The Company’s share of net losses of $3 million in the comparative period was primarily comprised of
a net loss of $39 million arising on the Company’s investments in Primero and Tahoe, which included a $23
million impairment expense recognized in respect of the Company’s equity interest in Primero, partially offset
by $35 million net earnings at Alumbrera;
•   A  $50  million  decrease  in  loss  on  securities  primarily  representing  an  impairment  expense  recognized  on
certain of the Company’s available-for-sale equity and marketable securities;
•   A $71 million gain on derivatives for the six months ended June 30, 2013 comprised of a $46 million unrealized
gain  on  the  conversion  feature  of  the  Company’s  Convertible  Notes;  a  $19  million  net  gain  on  the  Silver
Wheaton silver contract and a $6 million net gain on foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, zinc and silver
contracts.  A  $122  million  gain  on  derivatives  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2012  comprised  of  a  $100
million unrealized gain on the conversion feature of the Company’s Convertible Notes; a $23 million net gain on
foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, zinc and silver contracts; partially offset by a $1 million unrealized
loss on investments in warrants;
•   Finance  costs  increased  by  $13  million  primarily  due  to  $14  million  of  interest  expense  arising  on  the
Company’s Notes which were issued in March 2013 and a $4 million increase in accretion on the Company’s
reclamation and closure cost obligations;
•   Other income of $2 million comprised primarily of $34 million of interest income arising on the Company’s cash
and  cash  equivalents,  money  market  investments  and  loans  held  with  certain  of  the  Company’s  associates,
partially offset by $23 million of foreign exchange losses arising on value added tax receivables denominated
in  Mexican  and  Argentinian  pesos,  and  cash  and  cash  equivalents  denominated  in  Canadian  dollars.  Other
income of $7 million in the 2012 comparable period comprised primarily of $6 million of interest income earned
on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and the Primero Notes, and a
GOLDCORP  |  13
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
$5 million gain recognized on a mineral interest option payment received on one of the Company’s exploration
properties, partially offset by an $8 million impairment expense recognized on the Primero 1-year convertible
note;
•   Income tax recovery for the six months ended June 30, 2013 totaled $453 million (six months ended June 30,
2012 – income tax expense of $210 million) and comprised:
•
•
•
A  $57  million  foreign  exchange  loss  on  the  translation  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities
arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006, and the Camino Rojo and Cerro
Negro  acquisitions  in  2010,  compared  to  a  $2  million  foreign  exchange  gain  for  the  six  months  ended
June  30,  2012.  The  impact  of  foreign  exchange  on  deferred  income  tax  resulted  from  the  weakening
Mexican peso (strengthening in 2012), Canadian dollar, and Argentine peso.
A deferred income tax recovery of $600 million arising on the impairment of mining interest recognized at
June 30, 2013.
After adjusting taxes for the above noted items and excluding the impact of share-based compensation
expense  and  impairment  expense  from  earnings  before  taxes,  the  income  tax  expense  for  the  six
months ended June 30, 2013 was approximately 17% of earnings before taxes (six months ended June
30, 2012 – 21%). Income for the six months ended June 30, 2013 included equity income from Pueblo
Viejo that is not subject to further income tax in Canada reducing the 2013 effective income tax rate. In
both  2013  and  2012,  the  effective  tax  rate  was  decreased  by  the  non-taxable  mark-to-market  gains
arising  on  the  conversion  option  of  the  Company’s  Convertible  Notes  and  the  Silver  Wheaton  silver
contract,  partially  offset  by  impairments  of  certain  equity  securities  and  the  Company’s  equity
investment  in  Primero  which  were  not  tax  effected  in  2012.  The  favourable  impact  of  the  non-taxable
mark-to-market  gains  was  also  heightened  in  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2013  due  to  the  lower
earnings  in  the  period.  Income  tax  in  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2012  was  favourably  impacted
further by the settlement of certain past tax positions.
Adjusted  net  earnings  amounted  to  $370  million,  or  $0.46  per  share  (1),  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2013,
compared  to  $736  million,  or  $0.91  per  share,  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2012.  Compared  to  the  six  months
ended June 30, 2012, adjusted net earnings were primarily impacted by lower revenues and higher production costs.
Total cash costs (by-product) increased to $606 per ounce (2) for the six months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to
$310  per  ounce  in  the  comparative  period.  The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  lower  silver,  lead,  zinc  and  copper  by-
product sales credits.
(1) Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition
to  conventional  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  the  Company  and  certain  investors  use  this  information  to  evaluate  the
Company’s  performance.  Accordingly,  it  is  intended  to  provide  additional  information  and  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 43 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to
reported net (loss) earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp.
(2) The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures – total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout
this  document.  In  the  gold  mining  industry,  total  cash  costs  is  a  common  performance  measure  but  does  not  have  any  standardized
meaning.  The  Company  follows  the  recommendations  of  the  Gold  Institute  Production  Cost  Standard.  The  Company  believes  that,  in
addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate
the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product
basis  are  calculated  by  deducting  Goldcorp’s  share  of  by-product  silver,  copper,  lead  and  zinc  sales  revenues  from  Goldcorp’s  share  of
production costs. Refer to page 41 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs.

Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 18,500 ounces, or 18%, higher than in the second quarter of 2012
due to 31% higher grades, partially offset by 9% lower mill throughput due to lower than planned tonnage from Campbell
and  temporary  power  outages  affecting  both  the  Red  Lake  and  Campbell  Complex.  The  successful  completion  of  the
de-stress program in the third quarter of 2012 continued to provide an increase in heading availability, which resulted in
a 36% increase in grades from the High Grade Zone. Mining in the Upper Red Lake area was accelerated in 2013 as
planned and delivered higher than planned grades. At June 30, 2013, Red Lake held finished goods inventory due to the
timing of gold pours at the end of the quarter.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $523 per ounce, a decrease of $45 per ounce, or 8%, compared to the
second  quarter  of  2012  due  to  higher  gold  production  ($97  per  ounce)  and  a  weaker  Canadian  dollar  ($7  per  ounce),
partially  offset  by  higher  operating  costs  ($59  per  ounce).  The  increase  in  operating  costs  was  attributable  to  higher
employee costs ($4 million) due to an increase in manpower and an increase in consumables costs ($5 million), partially
offset by a decrease in contractor costs due to a lower usage of contractors for long hole drilling ($2 million).
Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 23,000 ounces, or 16%, lower than in the first quarter of 2013 due to
9% lower grades. A favourable mining sequence in the first quarter of 2013 provided better grades and higher tonnage in
the  High  Grade  Zone  as  compared  to  the  second  quarter  of  2013.  High  Grade  Zone  de-stressing  in  the  46-47  level
horizon is progressing as planned and mining the 46-47 level is included in the mine plan for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $47 per ounce, or 10%, higher than in the prior quarter due to lower gold
production ($63 per ounce), partially offset by lower operating costs ($10 per ounce) and a weaker Canadian dollar ($6
per ounce). The decrease in operating costs was attributable to a decrease in employee costs and a reduction in energy
costs due to warmer temperatures ($1 million).
Drilling  continued  on  the  NXT  zone  during  the  quarter.  To  date,  results  indicate  that  the  zone  remains  open  vertically
and  to  the  west.  Several  drills  are  targeting  this  zone  both  from  the  4199  exploration  drift  and  from  existing
infrastructure at higher levels in the mine.

(1) Earnings from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2012 were impacted by a non-cash provision related to the revisions in
estimates on the reclamation and closure cost obligations for the Porcupine mine’s closed sites of $83 million.
Gold  production  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  5,100  ounces,  or  7%,  lower  than  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012
primarily  due  to  3%  lower  grades  and  3%  lower  tonnage  processed.  Porcupine  currently  consists  of  three  mining
operations,  Hoyle  Pond,  Dome  and  Stockpile,  which  feed  one  processing  facility.  The  Hoyle  Pond  underground
operation experienced 26% higher tonnage as planned due to increased feed from lower grade long hole stopes, which
in addition to sequencing of the high grade VAZ zone, resulted in 20% lower grades. The Dome underground operation
experienced  32%  lower  grades,  partially  offset  by  34%  higher  tonnage  due  to  mining  in  higher  tonnage  bulk  zones.
Material reclaimed from Stockpile provided 7% lower grades from a lower grade section of the stockpile with 10% lower
tonnage as a result of the higher underground tonnage.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $782 per ounce, an increase of $108 per ounce, or 16%, compared to
the  second  quarter  of  2012  due  to  higher  operating  costs  ($76  per  ounce)  and  lower  gold  production  ($44  per  ounce),
partially  offset  by  a  weaker  Canadian  dollar  ($11  per  ounce).  The  increase  in  operating  costs  was  primarily  due  to
increased employee costs ($1 million), higher consumable costs ($2 million) and increased electricity costs ($1 million).
Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 2,600 ounces, or 4%, higher than in the first quarter of 2013 due to
7% higher grades, partially offset by 5% lower tonnage. The Hoyle Pond underground operation experienced 13% higher
grades due to the mining sequence in the higher grade VAZ zones. The Dome underground operation experienced 14%
lower grades due to mining of lower

(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
grade bulk stopes as planned. Material reclaimed from Stockpile provided 1% higher grades and 6% lower tonnage due
to less tonnes being milled.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $15 per ounce, or 2%, lower than in the prior quarter due to higher gold
production ($76 per ounce) and a weaker Canadian dollar ($9 per ounce), partially offset by higher operating costs ($70
per  ounce).  The  increase  in  operating  costs  was  attributable  to  higher  contractor  costs  ($2  million)  and  higher
maintenance and consumable costs ($2 million).
Two  key  exploration  platforms  were  completed  in  the  second  quarter  of  2013  which  enabled  deeper  exploration  to
commence on the down-plunge extension of the 1060 and VAZ zones. Surface exploration completed a winter drilling
program in the surrounding regional targets and findings are being compiled with results expected in late 2013.
At  the  Hoyle  Deep  Project,  work  focused  on  shaft  sinking  below  the  660  metre  skip  dump  and  completing  the  lateral
development on the 980 and 1370 metre levels to access the new shaft. Shaft sinking advanced a total of 142 metres
including the excavation and construction of the 720 metre level shaft station. The lateral development advance totaled
260  metres.  Construction  and  installation  work  continued  on  the  assembly  of  the  12-foot  service  hoist  plant.
Expenditures related to the Hoyle Deep Project for the second quarter of 2013 totaled $8 million.
The Hollinger Pit Project haul road between the Dome and Hollinger sites was completed during the quarter, including an
eight  metre  high  noise  berm  along  the  north  side  of  the  road.  On-site  work  continues  to  remediate  voids  below  areas
where  the  environmental  control  berm  will  be  constructed  and  reverse  circulation  drilling  to  define  ore  limits  prior  to
mining. As of June 6, 2013, all air and noise models and reports had been submitted to the Provincial Ministry of the
Environment  for  the  project’s  Environmental  Compliance  Approval  for  Air  and  Noise  permit  that  is  required  for
construction  and  mining  activity  to  start  on  the  property.  Given  the  current  metal  prices,  the  Company  is  advancing
alternatives  including  a  smaller  pit  which  has  stronger  economics  than  the  previous  plan  while  also  addressing  the
reclamation and safety issues associated with this historic mining site.

Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 6,300 ounces, or 11%, higher than in the second quarter of 2012
due to 16% increase in mill throughput, partially offset by a 7% decrease in grades. Lower grades were realized as a
result  of  increased  mining  dilution  in  the  PQ  Deeps  A  area  resulting  from  poor  ground  conditions.  A  key  focus  of  the
mine  continues  to  be  reducing  dilution  with  increased  ground  support  and  modifying  the  mining  sequence.  Mill
throughput  was  higher  in  the  second  quarter  of  2013  as  a  methane  gas  pocket  interception  in  the  second  quarter  of
2012 impacted ore production.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $786 per ounce, a decrease of $33 per ounce, or 4%, compared to the
second quarter of 2012 due to increased gold production ($67 per ounce) and a weaker Canadian dollar ($11 per ounce),
partially  offset  by  higher  operating  costs  ($45  per  ounce).  The  higher  operating  costs  were  due  to  increased  fuel  and
consumables  costs  ($3  million)  and  increased  labour  and  contractor  costs  ($2  million),  partially  offset  by  decreased
operational development expenses ($2 million).
Gold  production  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  3,700  ounces,  or  6%,  higher  than  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013
primarily  due  to  a  10%  increase  in  mill  throughput,  partially  offset  by  a  4%  decrease  in  grades.  Lower  grades  were
realized as a result of  increased  mining  dilution  generated  in  the  PQ  Deeps  A  area.  Mill  throughput  was  higher  in  the
second quarter of 2013 as compared to the prior quarter due to stope delays encountered during the first quarter caused
by  additional  ground  control  requirements,  unscheduled  conveyor  repairs,  and  lower  manpower  availability  due  to
seasonal flu.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $55 per ounce, or 7%, lower than in the prior quarter due to increased
gold  production  ($105  per  ounce)  and  a  weaker  Canadian  dollar  ($10  per  ounce),  partially  offset  by  higher  operating
costs ($60 per ounce). The increase in operating costs was attributable to increased contractor and consulting costs ($5
million)  and  increased  operational  development  expenses  ($1  million),  partially  offset  by  reduced  royalties  and  power
costs ($2 million).
Exploration  in  the  second  quarter  of  2013  focused  on  the  northern  and  upper  extension  of  the  Lynx  zone  from
underground  and  the  northern  extension  of  the  PQ  Deeps.  Positive  results  were  returned  on  the  C-Block  of  the  PQ
Deeps, the Upper Lynx/Esker horizon, and the West Limb target.

(1) Gold equivalent ounces are calculated using the following assumptions: $1,350 per ounce for gold; by-product metal prices of $24.00 per
ounce  silver;  $3.00  per  pound  copper;  $0.85  per  pound  zinc;  and  $0.80  per  pound  lead.  By-product  metals  are  converted  to  gold
equivalent ounces by multiplying by-product metal production with the associated by-product metal price and dividing it with the gold price.
(2)
Includes  25%  of  silver  ounces  sold  to  Silver  Wheaton  at  $4.02  per  ounce.  The  remaining  75%  of  silver  ounces  are  sold  at  market  rates.
During the second quarter of 2013, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1,827 million, net of tax ($2,427 million before tax)
on its mining interests at the Peñasquito mine.
(3) The calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold is net of by-product silver, lead and zinc sales revenues. If silver, lead and zinc were
treated as co-products, average total cash costs at Peñasquito for three and six months ended June 30, 2013 would be $998 per ounce of
gold, $15.95 per ounce of silver, $0.87 per pound of lead and $0.77 per pound of zinc. Production costs are allocated to each co-product
based on the ratio of actual sales volumes multiplied by budget metal prices (see page 2). The actual and budget silver price for Peñasquito
takes into consideration that 25% of silver ounces are sold to Silver Wheaton at $4.02 per ounce with the remaining 75% of silver ounces
sold at market rates.
(4) Off-site costs consist primarily of transportation, warehousing, and treatment and refining charges.
Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 15,700 ounces, or 15%, less than in the second quarter of 2012 due
to  lower  ore  grades  as  mining  progressed  through  the  lower  grade  lower  benches  of  Phase  4A  as  planned,  and  lower
metallurgical recoveries as a result of high carbon content ore, partially offset by higher mill throughput. The sulphide
plant  achieved  throughput  of  105,503  tonnes  per  day  during  the  quarter  following  the  completion  of  the  crusher
maintenance, blasting improvements, and the addition of new fresh water wells. Significant improvement was achieved
in the month of June with the sulphide plant achieving average throughput of 120,840 tonnes per day during the month.
Co-product  cash  costs  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  were  $998  per  ounce,  an  increase  of  $356  per  ounce,  or  55%,
compared to the second quarter of 2012 due to higher operating costs ($302 per ounce), lower gold production ($78 per
ounce),  partially  offset  by  a  weaker  Mexican  peso  ($24  per  ounce).  Higher  operating  costs  resulted  primarily  from
increased  labour  costs  resulting  from  the  annual  settlement  of  labour  agreements  ($22  million),  increased  contractor
costs  associated  with  the  development  of  Phase  5  ($20  million),  higher  fuel  prices  ($5  million)  and  explosives
consumption rates ($4 million), which were partially offset by decreased grinding media and reagents consumption ($2
million). The lower operating costs in the second quarter of 2012 reflected the impact of capitalized development costs
related to stripping activities ($11 million).
Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 28,000 ounces, or 47%, higher than in the first quarter of 2013 due
to 39% higher gold head grades, 7% higher metallurgical recoveries, 14% higher oxide production and 3% higher plant
throughput. Higher ore grades and recoveries were in line with the advancement of ore mining into higher grade zones of
the lower grade lower benches of Phase 4A as planned.
Co-product cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $130 per ounce, or 12%, lower than in the prior quarter due
to higher gold production ($168 per ounce), a weaker Mexican peso ($14 per ounce), partially offset by higher operating
costs ($46 per ounce) and higher off-site costs ($6 per ounce). Higher operating costs resulted primarily from increased
contractor  costs  ($9  million)  associated  with  the  development  of  Phase  5,  additional  labour  costs  resulting  from  the
annual settlement of labour agreements ($8 million),

(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
consumables  ($3  million),  higher  maintenance  costs  ($2  million),  increased  fuel  prices  ($1  million)  and  consumption
rates, partially offset by decreased tire and power consumption.
As planned, grades and recoveries were higher than in the prior quarter and are expected to continue increasing over
the  remainder  of  2013  as  mining  moves  into  the  higher  grade  zones  of  Phase  4A;  however,  revenues  in  the  second
quarter of 2013 were impacted by the significant decline in metal prices as well as the negative impact of provisional
pricing  due  to  lower  realized  gold,  silver,  lead  and  zinc  prices.  The  provisional  pricing  impact  from  sales  in  the  first
quarter of 2013 that settled in the second quarter of 2013 resulted in a negative $8 million adjustment to sales revenue.
The negative adjustment primarily related to silver sales ($5 million) and gold sales ($2 million). The provisional pricing
impact  in  the  previous  quarter  was  a  positive  $2  million.  These  negative  impacts  to  revenues,  in  conjunction  with
increased operating costs as mentioned previously, resulted in a loss from operations of $28 million for the quarter.
Studies were completed and have defined an additional water source for Peñasquito referred to as the “Northern Well
Field” within Peñasquito’s current permitted Cedros basin. During the first half of 2013, water availability was stabilized
with  the  addition  of  new  wells  within  the  existing  well  field  and  new  dewatering  wells  around  the  mining  areas.  The
addition  of  the  Northern  Well  Field  will  provide  the  flexibility  to  resume  ramp-up  to  the  design  throughput  of  130,000
tonnes  per  day.  The  capital  cost  is  estimated  to  be  approximately  $150  million.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating
route alternatives to access the well field.
To  address  water  requirements  over  the  longer  term,  ongoing  studies  will  continue  to  assess  the  potential  to  source
waste  water  from  nearby  towns  and  municipalities  to  help  meet  water  requirements  for  the  Camino  Rojo  project  and
potential  production  from  the  newly-discovered  skarn  mineralization  beneath  the  Peñasquito  pits.  Several  options  to
enhance tailings efficiency are also being assessed, with thickened tailings being a common component to the options
evaluated. A feasibility study is now underway that will analyze the potential of thickened tailings to reduce overall fresh
water requirements at Peñasquito. The study is expected to be completed in mid-2014.
Commissioning activities of the Waste Rock Overland Conveyor were delayed in the second quarter as improvements
to the system had to be realized, which were anticipated to be completed later in the commissioning phase of the waste
handling system. Production ramp up will continue into the third quarter of 2013 after improvements to the system are
complete. System improvements and adjustments will continue late into the third quarter of 2013.
An intensive exploration drilling program continued in the second quarter of 2013, resulting in a total of 10,616 metres
drilled,  distributed  in  8  holes,  of  which  6  were  completed  in  the  quarter  and  2  remain  in  progress.  The  exploration
program  continues  to  define  the  intersection  of  the  copper–gold  sulphide  rich  skam  ore  body  and  porphyry  deposit
located  below  and  adjacent  to  the  diatreme  ore  body.  Current  exploration  activities  are  focused  on  delineating  the
vertical  and  horizontal  size  and  extension  the  skarn  deposit  with  intersections  continuing  to  show  attractive  gold  and
copper grades.
During the second quarter of 2013, the Company recorded impairment charges of a $1,827 million, net of tax ($2,427
million  before  tax)  related  to  Peñasquito  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  the  metal  pricing  environment  related  to  in-situ
exploration ounces, in combination with the changes to the Life of Mine plan and the pending Mexican mining duty.

(1) Recovery is reported on a cumulative basis to reflect the cumulative recovery of ore on the leach pad, and does not reflect the true recovery
expected over time.
Gold  production  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  1,700  ounces,  or  2%,  lower  than  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012
mainly due to 2% lower tonnage processed as a result of heavy rainfall at the start of the season, partially offset by 1%
higher grades.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $624 per ounce, an increase of $89 per ounce, or 17%, compared to
the second quarter of 2012 due to higher operating costs ($107 per ounce), partially offset by higher gold sales ($3 per
ounce) and a weaker Mexican peso ($15 per ounce). The increase in operating costs was primarily attributable to higher
consumables costs ($2 million), increased employee costs ($2 million) and higher fuel consumption ($2 million).
Gold  production  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  2,000  ounces,  or  2%,  higher  than  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013
primarily due to 3% higher grades, partially offset by 2% lower tonnage processed.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $35 per ounce, or 6%, higher than in the first quarter of 2013 due to
higher operating costs ($86 per ounce), partially offset by higher gold production ($47 per ounce) and a weaker Mexican
peso  ($4  per  ounce).  The  increase  in  operating  costs  was  primarily  attributable  to  higher  consumables  costs  ($2
million), increased employee costs ($1 million) and higher fuel costs ($1 million).
The construction of the latest expansion phase of the Los Filos heap leach pad facility was completed as planned. The
2013  exploration  program  continues  towards  converting  the  previous  year’s  addition  of  inferred  mineral  resources  into
reserves focusing at El Bermejal north.
The evaluation of mine crushing and agglomeration expansion opportunities for Los Filos is underway and is anticipated
to be completed by the end of 2013.

Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 3,900 ounces, or 17%, lower than in the second quarter of 2012,
mainly due to 6% lower grades, consistent with the mine plan and 10% lower tonnage milled resulting from greater than
expected ore hardness.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $890 per ounce, an increase of $352 per ounce, or 65%, compared to
the  second  quarter  of  2012  due  to  lower  gold  production  ($3  per  ounce),  higher  operating  costs  ($370  per  ounce),
partially offset by a weaker Mexican peso ($21 per ounce). The increase in operating costs was primarily due to higher
employee costs ($2 million) and higher fuel, and maintenance costs ($3 million).
Gold  production  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  1,500  ounces,  or  8%,  higher  than  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013
primarily due to 2% higher grades and 3% higher recovery rates.
Cash  costs  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  were  $56  per  ounce,  or  6%,  lower  than  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013  due  to
higher gold production ($282 per ounce) and a weaker Mexican peso ($2 per ounce), partially offset by higher operating
costs ($228 per ounce). The increase in operating costs was primarily attributable to higher employee costs ($1 million)
and higher fuel and consumables costs ($1 million).

(1) Gold  equivalent  ounces  are  calculated  using  the  following  assumptions:  $1,350  per  ounce  for  gold;  by-product  metal  prices  of  $24.00  per
ounce silver; $3.00 per pound copper; $0.85 per pound zinc; and $0.80 per pound lead. By-product metals are converted to gold equivalent
ounces by multiplying by-product metal production with the associated by-product metal price and dividing it with the gold price.
(2) The calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold is net of by-product silver sales revenues. If silver were treated as a co-product, average
total cash costs at Marlin for the three months ended June 30, 2013 would be $599 per ounce of gold and $11.44 per ounce of silver (2012
– $511 and $11.05, respectively). Production costs are allocated to each co-product based on the ratio of actual sales volumes multiplied by
budget metal prices (see page 2). Using actual realized sales prices, the co-product total cash costs would be $645 per ounce of gold and
$10.14 per ounce of silver for the three months ended June 30, 2013.
Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 6,700 ounces, or 12%, lower than in the second quarter of 2012.
Silver  production  was  164,600  ounces,  or  10%,  higher  than  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012.  The  decrease  in  gold
production  was  due  to  8%  lower  grades  and  3%  lower  tonnage  processed.  The  increase  in  silver  ounces  was  due  to
12%  higher  grades  and  1%  increase  in  recovery.  The  lower  gold  grades  were  due  to  lower  grade  ore  processed  from
stockpiles and lower underground grades, in accordance with the mine plan.
Cash  costs  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  were  $260  per  ounce,  an  increase  of  $240  per  ounce,  compared  to  the
second quarter of 2012 due to lower gold production ($137 per ounce), higher operating costs ($48 per ounce), and lower
silver  by-product  sales  credits  ($55  per  ounce).  The  increase  in  operating  costs  was  primarily  attributable  to  higher
consumables  costs,  including  shotcrete  and  split  sets  for  underground  support  and  cement  for  the  filter  plant,  higher
contractors  cost  due  to  additional  underground  development  and  higher  power  consumption,  partially  offset  by  lower
royalties due primarily to lower metal prices.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
Gold  production  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  comparable  to  the  first  quarter  of  2013.  Silver  production  was
195,000  ounces,  or  12%,  higher  than  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013,  due  to  15%  higher  grades.  The  higher  silver  grades
resulted from high grade silver areas in Marlin and West Vero.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $158 per ounce, or 155%, higher than in the first quarter of 2013 due to
lower  silver  by-product  sales  credits  ($161  per  ounce)  and  higher  operating  costs  ($23  per  ounce),  partially  offset  by
higher  gold  sales  ($26  per  ounce)  The  increase  in  operating  costs  was  primarily  attributable  to  higher  maintenance
costs, partially offset by lower contractors costs.

Goldcorp’s share of Marigold’s production for the second quarter of 2013 was 3,600 ounces, or 19%, higher than in the
second quarter of 2012. The increase in production was attributable to 22%, or 4,300 ounces, higher recoverable gold
ounces stacked to the pad in the second quarter of 2013 than in the second quarter of 2012.
Tonnage processed increased by 54% in the second quarter of 2013 to offset lower grades than planned, with mining
focused on the lower stripping ratio benches in Target II Phase 1 pit and waste stripping in Mackay Phase 1 pit. Grades
processed decreased by 21% in the second quarter of 2013 as expected, with the ore predominately sourced from the
lower grade Target II pit compared to the second quarter of 2012 when 45% of ore was sourced from the higher grade
Basalt Phase 8 pit.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $901 per ounce, an increase of $175 per ounce, or 24%, compared to
the  second  quarter  of  2012  due  to  higher  operating  costs  ($325  per  ounce),  partially  offset  by  higher  gold  production
($150  per  ounce).  Higher  operating  costs  were  attributable  to  higher  employee  costs  ($2  million),  higher  fuel  and
explosives costs ($2 million) and increased royalties as a result of higher production and royalty rates ($3 million).
Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 9,200 ounces, or 29%, lower than in the first quarter of 2013 as a
result  of  drawing  down  heap  leach  pad  inventory  in  the  first  quarter.  Recoverable  ounces  stacked  on  the  pad  in  the
second  quarter  of  2013  were  22%,  or  12,900  ounces,  less  than  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013.  Additionally,  the  ounces
produced in the first quarter of 2013 were placed closer to the heap leach pad liner resulting in a faster leach cycle time
contributing to the higher production in the prior quarter. Grades processed decreased by 15% in the second quarter of
2013 as expected, with the ore principally sourced from the lower grade Target II pit as compared to the first quarter of
2013, where 16% of the ore was sourced from the higher grade Red Rock pit. Combined ore and waste mined was 5%
lower in the second quarter of 2013 due to increased ore and longer haulage cycle times attributed to backfilling of the
Basalt Phase 7 and 8 pits.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $47 per ounce, or 6%, higher than in the first quarter of 2013 due to
lower  gold  production  ($343  per  ounce),  partially  offset  by  lower  operating  costs  ($295  per  ounce).  The  decrease  in
operating costs was attributable to lower employee and contractors costs ($4 million) and lower fuel and tire costs ($3
million).
Drilling activity for the second quarter of 2013 was primarily focused on development drilling in the Mackay Pit Phase 1,
Red Dot and Herco-North deposits. Stripping activity started in Phase 1 Mackay Pit in preparation for the electric shovel
arrival in the fourth quarter of 2013. The final three of six new 290 tonne electric drive trucks acquired to phase out the
smaller mechanical drive trucks were commissioned in the second quarter.

Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 2,100 ounces, or 11%, lower than in the second quarter of 2012 due
to 3% lower tonnage processed at 9% lower grades. Tonnage processed was lower due to heavy rainfalls resulting in
unfavourable mining and crushing conditions. The lower grades were in accordance with the mining plan.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $808 per ounce, an increase of $206 per ounce, or 34%, compared to
the second quarter of 2012 due to higher operating costs ($111 per ounce) and lower gold production ($95 per ounce).
Higher operating costs were due to higher labour costs and higher equipment rental costs.
Gold production for the second quarter of 2013 was 3,700 ounces, or 30%, higher than in the first quarter of 2013 due to
20%  higher  tonnage  processed  as  a  result  of  better  crushing  conditions,  and  the  resolution  of  the  temporary  solution
distribution issues associated with the startup of Leach Pad 4. Grades were 9% lower, as planned.
Cash  costs  for  the  second  quarter  of  2013  were  $28  per  ounce,  or  3%,  lower  than  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013  due  to
higher  gold  production  ($235  per  ounce),  partially  offset  by  higher  operating  costs  ($207  per  ounce).  Higher  operating
costs were attributed to higher fuel, maintenance, and consumables costs ($3 million).

(1) The calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold is net of by-product copper sales revenue. If copper were treated as a co-product, total
cash costs for the three months ended June 30, 2013 would be $907 per ounce of gold and $2.18 per pound of copper (2012 – $723 and
$1.81,  respectively).  Production  costs  are  allocated  to  each  co-product  based  on  the  ratio  of  actual  sales  volumes  multiplied  by  budget
metal  prices  (see  page  2).  Using  actual  realized  sales  prices,  the  co-product  total  cash  costs  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2013
would  be  $953  per  ounce  of  gold  and  $1.71  per  pound  for  copper  (2012  -  $788  per  ounce  of  gold  and  $1.73  per  pound  of  copper,
respectively).
(2) As a result of the application of IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements (“IFRS 10”), the Company’s 37.5% interest in Alumbrera, which
was  previously  proportionately  consolidated  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements,  has  been  classified  as  an  investment  in
associate and is accounted for using the equity method with the Company’s share of net earnings and net assets separately disclosed in
the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Earnings  and  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  respectively.  The  financial  data  disclosed  in  the  table
represents the financial data of Alumbrera on a proportionate rather than equity basis.
For the three months ended June 30, 2013, the Company’s equity (loss) earnings from Alumbrera were $(7) million (six
months ended June 30, 2013 - $2 million).
Goldcorp’s share of Alumbrera’s gold and copper production in the second quarter of 2013 was 6,800 ounces, or 19%,
and  9.9  million  pounds,  or  31%,  respectively,  lower  than  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012,  primarily  due  to  lower  grades
and  lower  recoveries.  Gold  and  copper  head  grades  were  12%  and  18%  lower  than  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012
respectively, as a consequence of processing ore from the Southwest phase 10 during the second quarter of 2013, in
accordance  with  the  mine  plan,  where  head  grades  were  lower  than  the  Northwest  and  Northeast  phase  10  ore
processed  in  the  second  quarter  of  2012.  As  mining  moves  into  higher  grade  areas  over  the  remainder  of  2013,
anticipated full year production remains on track.
GOLDCORP  |  32
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
Ore mined in the second quarter of 2013 was 44% lower than in the second quarter of 2012 mainly due to having one
shovel in operation due to the constricted area being mined as compared to the second quarter of 2012 when there were
two in operation.
Cash costs in the second quarter of 2013 were $299 per ounce, an increase of $506 per ounce, compared to the second
quarter  of  2012  primarily  due  to  higher  operating  costs  ($1,211  per  ounce),  partially  offset  by  higher  gold  production
($590  per  ounce)  and  higher  by-product  credits  ($115  per  ounce).  The  increase  in  operating  costs  was  mainly
attributable to higher repair and maintenance costs as well as higher employee and contractor costs, partially offset by
higher  capitalized  development  related  to  stripping  activities.  Costs  were  impacted  by  approximately  $4  million  as  a
result of inflationary pressures in Argentina.
Goldcorp’s  share  of  Alumbrera’s  gold  and  copper  production  during  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  5,200  ounces,  or
21%, and 2.8 million pounds, or 15%, higher than in the first quarter of 2013, respectively, due to higher head grades
and  higher  recoveries.  Gold  and  copper  head  grades  were  higher  than  in  the  prior  quarter  by  12%  and  16%,
respectively, due to ore being mined from the higher levels of the Southwest benches in phase 10 compared to the prior
quarter when ore was mined from the lower grade, deeper levels of phase 10.
Cash costs for the second quarter of 2013 were $285 per ounce higher than in the first quarter of 2013 primarily due to
higher operating costs ($234 per ounce) and lower by-product sales credits ($217 per ounce), partially offset by higher
gold production ($166 per ounce). The increase in operating costs was primarily attributable to higher YMAD royalties,
higher  repair  and  maintenance  costs  and  higher  power  costs  due  to  higher  unit  prices,  partially  offset  by  higher
capitalized  development  related  to  stripping  activities.  The  higher  unit  price  of  power  costs  are  driven  by  price
seasonality due to lower climate temperatures.
The  provisional  pricing  impact  of  lower  realized  copper  prices  during  the  second  quarter  of  2013  was  $10  million,  or
$402  per  ounce.  The  provisional  pricing  impact  of  lower  realized  copper  prices  in  the  prior  quarter  was  $4  million,  or
$178 per ounce.
The feasibility study for the Agua Rica project is in progress and is expected to be complete by the end of the second
half of 2013.

(1) The calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold is net of by-product silver sales revenue. If silver were treated as a co-product, total
cash costs for the three months ended June 30, 2013 would be $531 per ounce of gold and $9.96 per ounce of silver. Production costs are
allocated  to  each  co-product  based  on  the  ratio  of  actual  sales  volumes  multiplied  by  budget  metal  prices  (see  page  2).  Using  actual
realized  sales  prices,  the  co-product  total  cash  costs  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2013  would  be  $534  per  ounce  of  gold  and
$8.72 per ounce of silver.
(2) The Company’s 40% interest in Pueblo Viejo is classified as an investment in associate and is accounted for using the equity method with
the Company’s share of net earnings and net assets separately disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated
Balance  Sheets,  respectively.  The  financial  data  disclosed  in  the  table  represents  the  financial  data  of  Pueblo  Viejo  on  a  proportionate
rather than equity basis.
For  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2013,  the  Company’s  equity  earnings  from  Pueblo  Viejo  were  $22  million  (six
months ended June 30, 2013 - $55 million).
Goldcorp’s share of Pueblo Viejo’s gold and silver production in the second quarter of 2013 was 16,900 ounces, or 26%,
and  89,000  ounces,  or  76%,  respectively,  higher  than  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013,  primarily  due  to  higher  tonnage
processed.  The  increase  in  tonnes  milled  during  the  quarter  resulted  from  the  ramp  up  of  the  autoclave  facility  and
resolution  of  issues  with  certain  components  which  affected  production  during  the  first  quarter.  Production  in  the  first
half of 2013 was lower than expected as a result of these ongoing modifications and repairs to the autoclave facility.
The  modifications  are  being  implemented  on  all  four  autoclaves  as  they  are  available  for  maintenance  and  it  is
anticipated that planned production levels will be achieved and sustained during the second half of the year.
GOLDCORP  |  34
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
Silver recoveries were impacted by heating and lime issues. Remediation activities to improve the silver recoveries are
currently being evaluated.
Cash costs in the second quarter of 2013 were $507 per ounce, an increase of $35 per ounce, or 7%, compared to the
first  quarter  of  2013  primarily  due  to  higher  operating  costs  ($40  per  ounce)  and  lower  silver  credits  ($51  per  ounce),
partially offset by higher gold production ($56 per ounce). The increase in operating costs was primarily attributable to
increased  power  costs  as  operations  continue  to  ramp  up  and  higher  tire  costs  due  to  increased  hauling  distances,
partially offset by lower contractor costs incurred during the second quarter of 2013.
Construction  of  the  215  MW  dual  fuel  power  plant  is  progressing  according  to  schedule  and  is  expected  to  be
commissioned by the end of the third quarter of 2013. Commissioning activities related to the copper circuit continued
during the quarter and first copper production is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2013.
In  May  2013,  PVDC  reached  an  agreement  in  principle  with  the  Government  concerning  amendments  to  the  Pueblo
Viejo SLA. The agreement in principle addresses the fiscal objectives of the country in a way that will provide stability
for both parties moving forward. If the proposed amendments are implemented and entered into force, revenues to the
Government will be increased and brought forward via a number of proposed changes.
Based  on  the  proposed  amendments,  it  is  anticipated  there  will  be  an  approximate  50/50  split  of  the  expected  cash
flows from the mine between PVDC and the Government over the years 2013-2016. This would result in tax revenues to
the Government of approximately $2.2 billion over this period at a gold price of $1,600 per ounce. The economic benefit
of  these  changes  over  the  life  of  the  mine  to  the  Government  is  approximately  $1.5  billion  (net  present  value  at  5%
discount rate and $1,600 gold price assumption).
The proposed amendments are subject to negotiation of a Definitive Agreement, which will require the approval of the
Boards  of  Directors  of  Barrick  Gold  Corporation  and  Goldcorp  and  the  project  lenders.  The  Definitive  Agreement  will
also be subject to approval by the Congress of the Dominican Republic. The SLA will continue according to its present
terms  unless  and  until  the  Definitive  Agreement  is  fully  executed  and  approved.  The  Government  has  reaffirmed  its
support  for  this  world  class  mine.  Based  on  the  Company’s  current  assessment  of  the  economic  impact  of  these
assessments, the carrying value of the project is recoverable.
PROJECTS REVIEW
Cerro Negro Project, Argentina
GOLDCORP  |  35
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
The  Cerro  Negro  project  is  an  advanced-stage,  high  grade  vein  system  located  in  the  Province  of  Santa  Cruz,
Argentina. The land position comprises 215 square kilometres with numerous discoveries of high grade gold and silver
veins.  As  of  December  31,  2012,  Cerro  Negro  contained    5.74  million  ounces  of  proven  and  probable  gold  reserves
(18.91mt at 9.43g/t) as compared to 4.54 million ounces at December 31, 2011 due to a successful exploration program
focused  on  the  Mariana  Central,  Mariana  Norte  and  San  Marcos  veins.  With  annual  production  expected  to  average
525,000  ounces  of  gold  in  its  first  five  full  years  of  production,  Cerro  Negro  is  well-positioned  as  Goldcorp’s  next
cornerstone gold mine.
Throughout  the  second  quarter  of  2013,  advancements  continued  across  key  areas  of  the  project  including  plant
construction, infrastructure, mine development and exploration. While the required permit was obtained in March, the six
month delay in the construction start of the main transmission line has shifted the execution period into the Patagonian
winter  and  has  the  potential  to  delay  commissioning  and  initial  production  until  the  first  quarter  of  2014.  Effective
immediately and due to current metal prices and business climate, all nonessential activities and support infrastructure
considered  supplementary  to  the  operating  facility  will  be  deferred  until  2014,  and  the  termination  of  all  exploration
activities at site. Key challenges to achieving first gold production according to the current schedule and capital cost
estimates include:
•   Completion and energization of the transmission line;
•   Mechanical completion of the plant by the end of the year;
•   Achieving target concrete and steel erection productivity rates throughout the winter months;
•   Labor productivity, including minimization of labour disputes and disruptions; and
•   Inflation and foreign currency exchange rate assumptions.
Manpower  levels  have  increased  as  required  to  support  the  project  schedule,  growing  to  a  total  workforce  of  3,451  in
June of which 670 were direct employees. Safe production remains a fundamental pillar for all activities and the project
successfully completed over 2.8 million hours of work without a lost time injury. Safety and training efforts continue in
the  development  of  a  local  workforce.  With  the  purchase  and  installation  of  two  mine  simulator  training  units  in  the
second  quarter,  training  for  underground  equipment  operators  will  commence  in  July  to  support  the  mine  production
schedule.
Infrastructure and Construction
Activities  advanced  well  with  Engineering,  Procurement  and  Construction  Management  (“EPCM”)  activities  reaching
60% of the execution plan, and detailed engineering at 93% complete by the end of the second quarter of 2013.
Key activities and developments in the second quarter of 2013 include:
•   Continuation with erection of structural steel for the grinding building with 76% completion;
•   Commencement with the installation of siding and roof for the grinding building with 30% completed;
•   Ball mill mounted and ring gear installed;
•   Completed  the  retaining  wall  for  the  primary  crusher,  mounted  the  primary  crusher  and  continued  with
installation of structural steel in the crusher building, reaching 75% completion by the end of the quarter;
•   Completion of the tailings facility remains on plan for completion in the third quarter of 2013;
•   The majority of the concrete foundations were poured for the power line poles for construction of the power line
to connect Eureka Mine to the Marianas Mines (100%) and from the Marianas Mines to the plant (90%);
•   Reclaim tunnel concrete complete with commencement of mechanical work at the end of the second quarter;
and
•   Contractor selection for construction of the 132KVA transmission line to connect to the national power grid.

Mine Development
Underground ore production from the Eureka mine commenced on April 1, and initial ore development commenced at
the  Mariana  Norte  and  Mariana  Central  mines  during  June.  Ore  is  being  stockpiled  on  the  surface  while  mine
development continues with ramp access, vertical raises, and horizontal stope development. At the end of the second
quarter  of  2013,  the  stockpile  is  in  line  with  planned  tonnes,  while  estimated  gold  and  silver  grades  are  higher  than
anticipated.  The  Eureka  mine  continues  to  accelerate  production  activities  in-line  with  planned  levels  as  production
quantities ramped up to approximately 500 tonnes per day at the end of the second quarter. Production levels from the
Eureka mine are schedule to increase to approximately 800 tonnes per day during the third quarter of 2013, with initial
stope production at the Mariana Central and Mariana Norte mines scheduled to occur during 2014. The following table
outlines the quantity of ore stockpiled at Cerro Negro:

the  prior  quarter.  The  Eureka  and  Mariana  Central  mines  exceeded  their  planned  development  metres  for  the  quarter
and  remain  the  focus  for  development,  as  they  will  collectively  contribute  approximately  93%  of  the  contained  gold
ounces  mined  until  the  end  of  2014.  Both  the  Mariana  Central  and  Mariana  Norte  mines  are  now  developing  multiple
areas  and  combined  with  the  primary  ramp  and  development  rates  are  expected  to  continue  to  increase  in-line  with
planned levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2013.

Surface  exploration  diamond  drilling  commenced  on  the  Cerro  Negro  property  during  the  month  of  April  and  16,308
metres  were  drilled  during  the  quarter.  Initial  assay  results  were  starting  to  be  received  late  in  the  second  quarter  of
2013.
Capital Expenditures
At June 30, 2013, total project expenditures and future commitments are $975 million, excluding exploration, of which
$789 million is spent and $186 million is committed. Capital expenditures and capitalized exploration, including deposits
on mining interests and net of capitalized interest, for the three months ended June 30, 2013 were $137 million and $5
million, respectively ($289 million and $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively).
On June 13, 2013, the Province of Santa Cruz passed amendments to the Provincial Tax Code and Provincial Tax Law,
which imposes a new tax on mining real estate property in the Province. The tax will amount to 1% of the value of the
economically viable reserves of mining projects as indicated in feasibility studies filed with the Province or as published
in  a  corporation’s  annual  financial  statements.  The  new  law  came  into  force  on  July  5,  2013.  There  are  a  number  of
uncertainties  surrounding  the  scope,  calculation  and  enforcement  of  the  tax  and  the  mining  industry  is  waiting  for
publication of regulations detailing these matters. It is expected that the tax will be

(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
payable annually by the Company’s Cerro Negro project, which is currently under construction. The Company, as well
as potentially other mining companies operating in the Province of Santa Cruz, plans to challenge the constitutionality
and legality of the new tax law.
Éléonore Project, Canada
The Éléonore project is located in the northeast corner of the Opinaca Reservoir in the James Bay region of Quebec,
Canada.  The  Éléonore    deposit    is  a  major  gold  discovery  in  a  relatively  unexplored  area  in  the  Province  of  Quebec,
located  in  the  core  of  what  Goldcorp  believes  to  be  a    promising  new  gold  district  in  North  America.  Proven  and
probable gold reserves at Éléonore at December 31, 2012 were 3.03 million ounces  (12.48mt at 7.56g/t). Initial capital
expenditures  are  estimated  to  be  $1.75  billion  as  at  January  1,  2013.  First  gold  production  remains  on  track  for    late
2014. Forecast average life-of-mine gold production from Éléonore at full production is approximately 600,000 ounces
per year.
Forest  fires  in  early  July  in  the  James  Bay  area  caused  a  temporary  evacuation  of  the  site  and  suspension  of
construction activities. All infrastructure and equipment were undamaged. In addition, certain activities were halted for
the  last  two  weeks  of  June  due  to  a  general  strike  of  the  construction  sector  in  the  province  but  workers  returned  to
work  in  the  first  week  of  July.  Management  is  currently  evaluating  the  construction  schedule  with  minor  impacts
expected.
Engineering and Construction
Engineering activities progressed significantly during the second quarter of 2013 in all areas on-site.
Key activities and development in the second quarter of 2013 include:
•   Surface  construction  activities  advanced  well  throughout  the  second  quarter  of  2013,  with  total  progress
nearing 59% complete;
•   Completed the foundations and building construction of the concentrator building and started interior concrete
work including the equipment bases;
•   Mechanical installation in the concentrator building was started;
•   Construction of the paste backfill plant continued with foundations completed and structural steel erection on-
going;
•   Commenced construction of foundations for the crushing buildings (primary and secondary);
•   Expansion of the ore and waste pad is substantially complete and in operation;
•   Commenced construction and industrial water piping installation;
•   Continued the construction of the tailings management facility;
•   Ball mill shell is expected to arrive at site by end of July;
•   Potable water treatment upgrade was completed providing a capacity of 450 cubic metres per day;
•   Completed Simoneau Bridge enlargement work to improve access to site; and
•   Delivered the last 100 rooms of the permanent camp.
Exploration
Exploration activities during the second quarter focused on in-fill drilling in the Upper mine area and exploration in the
Lower mine area. A total of 23,528 metres of diamond drilling was completed from working platforms in the exploration
ramp  and  at  the  650m  level,  as  compared  to  18,885  metres  in  the  prior  quarter.  Currently,  four  diamond  drills  are
conducting infill and exploration drilling.
Mine Development
The  exploration  ramp  excavation  progressed  as  planned,  and  has  now  reached  3,352  metres  in  length,  which
corresponds to a vertical depth of 515 metres below surface. The ramp is planned to connect with the main mine level
(650m level) in November and will create a second way of egress with a complete ventilation circuit. In parallel with the
ramp development, four other development crews were active at the end of June excavating mining levels in the Upper
mine.
GOLDCORP  |  38
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
The production shaft reached a depth of 383 metres and is on track to reach the year end objective of 742 metres.
At  June  30,  2013,  total  project  expenditures  since  January  1,  2011,  excluding  investment  tax  credits  and  capitalized
interest, are $1.2 billion, $979 million of which is spent and $237 million of which is committed. Capital expenditures,
excluding capitalized interest and investment tax credits, during the three months ended June 30, 2013, amounted to
$161 million ($284 million - six months ended June 30, 2013).
Cochenour Project, Canada
The  Cochenour  Project  combines  the  existing  workings  of  the  historic  Cochenour  mine  with  the  Bruce  Channel  gold
discovery. The  Cochenour/Bruce Channel deposit is located down dip from the historic Cochenour mine and is a key
component of Goldcorp’s consolidation plans  in the Red Lake district. A study of the overall project was completed in
the fourth quarter of 2012 which has concluded that the centre of the  Bruce Channel ore body is lower than previously
expected, necessitating the deepening of the Cochenour shaft by 245 metres. Initial capital  expenditures are estimated
to be $540 million at January 1, 2013, excluding the $108 million spent prior to 2011 and move first gold production into 
the  first  half  of  2015.  Following  ramp-up  to  full  production,  forecast  life-of-mine  gold  production  from  Cochenour  is
expected to be between 225,000  – 250,000 ounces per year. As a result of 2012 drilling, inferred resources increased
to 3.25 million ounces of gold (9.05mt at 11.18g/t) as  compared to 3.21 million ounces of gold at December 31, 2011.
Widening of the old Cochenour shaft continued to advance during the second quarter of 2013, with 65 metres slashed to
a total depth of 716 metres, as compared to 120 metres in the prior quarter. A concrete liner was also placed for a total
concrete depth of 707 metres, as compared to 640 metres in the prior quarter. The advance rates are consistent with
plan.
Advancing  of  the  five  kilometre  Cochenour  Red  Lake  Haulage  Drift  continued  with  76%  completed  at  the  end  of  the
second  quarter  of  2013.  The  advance  rate  in  the  drift  has  been  reduced  to  address  the  ground  conditions  and  to
accommodate additional diamond drill platforms. Two drills continue to work in the haulage drift to test the potential of
the  underexplored  area.  Underground  exploration  diamond  drilling  of  the  Bruce  Channel  Deposit  will  commence  in  the
second half of the year once the haulage drift is close enough to drill from and drilling platforms are excavated.
At June 30, 2013, total project expenditures since January 1, 2011, excluding investment tax credits, are $268 million,
$258  million  of  which  is  spent  and  $10  million  of  which  is  committed.  Capital  expenditures,  excluding  investment  tax
credits, during the three months ended June 30, 2013 amounted to $20 million ($42 million – six months ended June 30,
2013).  These  have  been  included  in  total  expenditures  on  mining  interests  in  Red  Lake,  and  consist  mainly  of
exploration,  construction  of  surface  infrastructure,  shaft  slashing  (widening)  and  sinking,  and  development  of  the
Cochenour Red Lake Haulage Drift.
El Morro Project, Chile (Goldcorp’s interest – 70%)
El  Morro  is  an  advanced  stage,  world-class  gold/copper  project  in  northern  Chile,  one  of  the  most  attractive  mining
jurisdictions  in  the  world.  El    Morro  contained  6.73  million  ounces  (Goldcorp’s  share)  of  proven  and  probable  gold
reserves (449.51mt at 0.47g/t) at December 31, 2012, compared to 5.84 million ounces at December 31, 2011, due to a
redesign  of  the  ultimate  pit  based  on  higher  gold  and  copper  prices.  Located  in    the  Atacama  region  of  Chile
approximately 80 kilometres east of the city of Vallenar and at a 4,000 metre altitude, El Morro comprises a large, 36-
square  kilometre  land  package  with  significant  potential  for  organic  growth  through  further  exploration.  Two  principal
zones  of  gold-copper    mineralization  have  been  identified  to  date  –  the  El  Morro  and  La  Fortuna  zones  –  and  the
Company has identified several additional targets as part  of its regional exploration plan. Future exploration efforts will
also test the potential bulk-mineable gold and copper production below the bottom of  the current pit.
All  El  Morro  project  field  construction  activities  remain  suspended  since  April  27,  2012  pending  the  definition  and
implementation  by  the  Chilean  environmental  permitting  authority  (the  “SEA”)  of  a  community  consultation  process
which corrects certain deficiencies in that
GOLDCORP  |  39
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
process as specifically identified by the Antofogasta Court of Appeals. The Chilean authorities and local communities
continue to refine and advance this new consultation process with the Company’s support. Overall project activities are
restricted  to  gathering  information  and  engineering  to  support  permit  applications  for  submission  following  the
completion of the administrative process and optimization of the project including securing a long-term power supply.
At  June,  2013,  total  project  expenditures  are  $212  million.  Capital  expenditures,  excluding  capitalized  interest,  during
the three months ended June 30, 2013 were $8 million ($21 million – six months ended June 30, 2013).
Camino Rojo Project, Mexico
The Camino Rojo project is located approximately 50 kilometres southeast of Goldcorp’s Peñasquito mine with a 3,389
square kilometre land position which includes the Represa deposit. Successful drilling at the Camino Rojo project has
contributed 1.63 million ounces to proven and probable gold reserves (66.76mt at 0.76g/t) at December 31, 2012, based
on  a  positive  study  for  mining  of  near-surface  oxide  and  transition  mineralization  with  conventional  heap  leach
processing. The Company is following up on positive exploration results in the sulphide portions of the deposit that have
deferred development of the oxide heap leach operation until the scope of the sulphide opportunity is better understood.
During  the  second  quarter  of  2013,  exploration  activities  were  focused  on  infill  drilling  and  extraction  of  more  than  15
tonnes of core samples for metallurgical studies of the sulphide portions of the West Extension and Represa zones. In
addition,  20  tonnes  of  oxide  and  transitional  core  samples  were  extracted  from  the  Represa  zone  for  column  and
floatation testing. Ten core drills operated for a total 34,533 metres drilled in 70 holes. Technical studies supporting the
request for environmental permits for the exploration activities were submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities.
At June 30, 2013, total project expenditures were $51 million. Capitalized expenditures, excluding capitalized interest,
during the three months ended June 30, 2013 amounted to $4 million ($13 million – six months ended June 30, 2013).
Cerro Blanco Project, Guatemala
The  Cerro  Blanco  Project  is  located  in  southwestern  Guatemala  and  is  considered  to  be  a  classic  hot  springs  gold
deposit  with  typical  bonanza  type  gold  mineralization.  At  December  31,  2012,  Cerro  Blanco  contained  1.27  million
ounces  of  measured  and  indicated  gold  resources  (2.52mt  at  15.64g/t).  The  activities  in  2012  were  focused  on
accessing the mineralized zone from underground.
Activities  continued  to  focus  on  the  updated  project  feasibility  study  which  is  now  expected  to  be  completed  in  the
second half of 2013. The Company has indefinitely suspended work at the Cerro Blanco project, in light of the capital
expenditure deferrals in 2013, which has resulted in an impairment charge of $131 million, net of tax ($131 million before
tax), related to its carrying value.
As  of  June  30,  2013,  total  project  expenditures  were  $151  million.  Capital  expenditures,  including  deposits  on  mining
interests, during the three months ended June 30, 2013 amounted to $3 million ($6 million – six months ended June 30,
2013).

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The  Company  has  included  certain  non-GAAP  performance  measures  throughout  this  document.  The  Company
believes  that,  in  addition  to  conventional  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  the  Company  and  certain
investors  use  this  information  to  evaluate  the  Company’s  operating  and  economic  performance;  however,  these  non-
GAAP  performance  measures  do  not  have  any  standardized  meaning.  Accordingly,  these  performance  measures  are
intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The  Company  calculates  its  non-GAAP  performance  measures  on  an  attributable  basis.  Attributable  performance
measures include the Company’s mining operations and projects, and the Company’s share from Alumbrera and Pueblo
Viejo. The Company believes that disclosing certain performance measures on an attributable basis is a more relevant
measurement  of  the  Company’s  operating  and  economic  performance,  and  reflects  the  Company’s  view  of  its  core
mining operations.
TOTAL CASH COSTS (BY-PRODUCT) PER GOLD OUNCE
By-product  cash  costs  incorporate  Goldcorp’s  share  of  all  production  costs,  adjusted  for  changes  in  estimates  at  the
Company’s  closed  mines  which  are  non-cash  in  nature,  and  include  Goldcorp’s  share  of  by-product  credits,  and
treatment  and  refining  charges  included  within  revenue.  Additionally,  cash  costs  are  adjusted  for  realized  gains  and
losses arising on the Company’s commodity and foreign currency contracts which the Company enters into to mitigate
the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in by-product metal prices, heating oil prices and foreign exchange rates, which
may impact the Company’s operating costs.
In addition to conventional measures, the Company uses total cash costs, by product and co-product, per gold ounce,
to monitor its operating cash costs internally and believes these measures provide investors and analysts with useful
information  about  the  Company’s  underlying  cash  costs  of  operations  and  the  impact  of  by-product  revenues  on  the
Company’s  cost  structure.  The  Company  reports  total  cash  costs  on  a  gold  ounces  sold  basis.  In  the  gold  mining
industry, this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows
the  recommendations  of  the  Gold  Institute  Production  Cost  Standard.  The  Gold  Institute,  which  ceased  operations  in
2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of suppliers of gold and gold products. The production
cost  standard  developed  by  the  Gold  Institute  remains  the  generally  accepted  standard  of  reporting  cash  costs  of
production by gold mining companies.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
NON-GAAP MEASURE – ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS PER GOLD OUNCE
The  Company,  in  conjunction  with  an  initiative  undertaken  within  the  gold  mining  industry,  has  adopted  an  all-in
sustaining  cost  performance  measure;  however,  this  performance  measure  has  no  standardized  meaning.  Effective
June  30,  2013,  the  Company  has  conformed  its  all-in  sustaining  definition  to  the  measure  as  set  out  in  the  guidance
note  released  by  the  World  Gold  Council (1) on  June  27,  2013  and  which  is  expected  to  be  effective  from  January  1,
2014. The comparative periods have been restated accordingly.
All-in  sustaining  costs  include  total  production  cash  costs  incurred  at  the  Company’s  mining  operations,  which  forms
the basis of the Company’s by-product cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures,
corporate  administrative  expense,  exploration  and  evaluation  costs,  and  reclamation  cost  accretion.  The  Company
believes  that  this  measure  represents  the  total  costs  of  producing  gold  from  current  operations,  and  provides  the
Company and other stakeholders of the Company with additional information of the Company’s operational performance
and  ability  to  generate  cash  flows.  As  the  measure  seeks  to  reflect  the  full  cost  of  gold  production  from  current
operations, new project capital is not included. Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments, dividends and
financing costs are also not included. The Company reports this measure on a gold ounces sold basis.

NON-GAAP MEASURE – ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS
Adjusted net earnings excludes gains/losses and other costs incurred for acquisitions and disposals of mining interests,
impairment charges, unrealized and non-cash realized gains/losses of financial instruments, foreign exchange impacts
on deferred income tax and foreign exchange arising on working capital at certain of the Company’s capital projects, as
well  as  significant  non-cash,  non-recurring  items.  The  Company  also  excludes  the  net  (earnings)  losses  from  the
Company’s equity investments in Primero and Tahoe. The Company excludes these items from net (loss) earnings to
provide a measure which allows the Company and investors to evaluate the results of the underlying core operations of
the Company and its ability to generate cash flow. The Company’s adjusted net earnings does include the Company’s
equity share of net earnings from Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo as the Company considers those operations to comprise
part of the Company’s core mining portfolio and to be significant contributors to the Company’s financial results.

Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
ADJUSTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND FREE CASH FLOWS
Adjusted  operating  cash  flows  comprises  Goldcorp’s  share  of  operating  cash  flows  before  working  capital  changes.
Free cash flows comprises Goldcorp’s share of net cash provided by operating activities and includes the Company’s
share of expenditures on mining interests and deposits on mining interests expenditures. The Company believes that, in
addition  to  conventional  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  the  Company  and  certain  investors  use  this
information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to operate without reliance on additional external funding
or use of available cash.
The following table provides a reconciliation of Goldcorp’s share of adjusted operating cash flows to net cash provided
by  operating  activities  per  the  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  three  and  six

Second Quarter Report – 2013
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RISK EXPOSURE
The Company manages its exposure to financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk
and  price  risk,  in  accordance  with  its  Risk  Management  Policy.  The  Company’s  Board  of  Directors  oversees
management’s  risk  management  practices  by  setting  trading  parameters  and  reporting  requirements.  The  Risk
Management Policy provides a framework for the Company to manage the risks it is exposed to in various markets and
to protect itself against adverse price movements. All transactions undertaken are to support the Company’s ongoing
business. The Company does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The following describes the types of risks that the Company is exposed to, and its objectives and policies for managing
those risk exposures:
(i) Credit risk
Credit  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  counterparty  to  a  financial  instrument  will  cause  a  financial  loss  for  the  Company  by
failing to discharge its obligations. There has been no change in the Company’s objectives and policies for managing
this risk during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.
(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  Company  will  encounter  difficulty  in  meeting  obligations  associated  with  its  financial
liabilities  that  are  settled  by  delivering  cash  or  another  financial  asset.  There  has  been  no  significant  change  in  the
Company’s  objectives  and  policies  for  managing  this  risk  during  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2013.
However, in light of the recent decline in metal prices, access to capital markets has become more constrained with a
potential to increase the cost of any future borrowings.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company generated operating cash flows of $80 million and
$374 million, respectively (three and six months ended June 30, 2012 – $510 million and $849 million, respectively). At
June 30, 2013, Goldcorp held cash and cash equivalents of $899 million (December 31, 2012 – $757 million; January 1,
2012  –  $1,458  million)  and  working  capital  of  $1,815  million  (December  31,  2012  –  $1,127  million;  January  1,  2012  –
$2,130  million)  which  the  Company  defines  as  current  assets  less  current  liabilities.  The  Company  also  held  $491
million of deposits with terms greater than 90 days at June 30, 2013 (December 31, 2012 – $nil; January 1, 2012 – $272
million).
On March 20, 2013, the Company issued two tranches of notes totalling $1.5 billion, consisting of $500 million of 5-year
Notes  with  a  coupon  rate  of  2.125%  and  $1.0  billion  of  10-year  Notes  with  a  coupon  rate  of  3.70%.  The  Notes  are
unsecured and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on
September 15, 2013. The Company received proceeds of $1.48 billion, net of transaction costs. Holders of the Notes
may redeem their holding at any time during the three months prior to maturity.
During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the Company’s Cerro Negro project in Argentina entered into a 1-year
$131 million credit facility agreement with Alumbrera. The principal drawn bears interest at 2% per annum. At June 30,
2013, Cerro Negro had drawn $131 million against the facility which has been recorded in other current liabilities in the
Condensed Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets.
On December 18, 2012, the Company entered into a 1-year 469 million Argentine peso ($100 million) credit facility with
a  third  party  in  Argentina.  This  credit  facility  will  be  used  to  fund  construction  at  the  Company’s  Cerro  Negro  project.
The  facility  bears  interest  at  Badlar,  the  average  interest  rate  paid  on  short-term  deposits  over  1  million  Argentine
pesos, plus a floating margin based on 75% of the differential between the general lending rate and the deposit rate set
by  the  Standard  Bank  Argentina  S.A.  At  June  30,  2013,  the  Company  had  drawn  220  million  Argentine  peso  ($41
million) against the credit facility (December 31, 2012 – 220 million Argentine peso ($45 million); January 1, 2012 – $nil)
which has been recorded in other current liabilities in the Condensed Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets.
GOLDCORP  |  45
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
At June 30, 2013, the Company had an undrawn $2.0 billion revolving credit facility available.
In  April  2010,  Barrick  Gold  Corporation  (“Barrick”),  the  project  operator,  and  Goldcorp  finalized  the  terms  for  $1.035
billion  (100%  basis)  in  project  financing  for  Pueblo  Viejo  (Goldcorp’s  share  –  $414  million).  The  lending  syndicate  is
comprised  of  international  financial  institutions  including  two  export  credit  agencies  and  a  syndicate  of  commercial
banks. The financing amount is divided into three tranches consisting of $375 million, $400 million and $260 million with
terms of fifteen years, fifteen years and twelve years, respectively. The $375 million tranche bears a fixed coupon rate
of 4.02% for the entire fifteen years. The $400 million tranche bears a coupon rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% pre-completion
and scales gradually to LIBOR plus 5.10% (inclusive of a political risk insurance premium) for years thirteen to fifteen.
The $260 million tranche bears a coupon rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% pre-completion and scales gradually to LIBOR plus
4.85%  (inclusive  of  political  risk  insurance  premium)  for  years  eleven  and  twelve.  Barrick  and  Goldcorp  have  each
provided a guarantee for their proportionate share of the loan. The guarantees will terminate upon Pueblo Viejo meeting
certain  operating  completion  tests  and  are  subject  to  a  carve-out  for  certain  political  risk  events.  At  June  30,  2013,
there  was  a  total  of  $940  million  drawn  against  the  credit  facility  (Goldcorp’s  share  –  $376  million).  Subsequently,  in
July 2013, the remaining balance of $95 million was drawn against the credit facility (Goldcorp’s share – $38 million) for
total outstanding balance of $1.035 billion (Goldcorp’s share – $414 million).
At  June  30,  2013,  the  Company  had  letters  of  credit  outstanding  and  secured  deposits  in  the  amount  of  $422  million
(December 31, 2012 – $427 million; January 1, 2012 – $308 million).
In the opinion of management, the working capital at June 30, 2013, together with future cash flows from operations and
available  funding  facilities,  is  sufficient  to  support  the  Company’s  commitments.  At  June  30,  2013,  the  Company’s
capital and operating commitments over the next twelve months, including its share of commitments of its associates,
amounted  to  $757  million  (December  31,  2012  –  $755  million;  January  1,  2012  –  $768  million).  The  Company’s  total
planned  capital  expenditures  for  2013  are  $2.6  billion,  40%  of  which  relate  to  operations  and  the  remaining  60%  to
projects (Cerro Negro, Éléonore, Cochenour, El Morro and Camino Rojo).
For  the  periods  beyond  2013,  the  Company’s  cash  flows  from  operations  and  available  funding  under  the  Company’s
loan and credit facilities are expected to sufficiently support further expansions and growth. Peñasquito will be the main
driver of the Company’s gold production growth expected in the next five years, with significant contributions from Red
Lake, Pueblo Viejo and Cerro Negro.
(iii) Market risk
Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that the fair values or future cash flows of the Company’s financial instruments will fluctuate
because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. There has been no change in the Company’s objectives and
policies for managing this risk during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.
The Company is exposed to currency risk through financial assets and liabilities, and deferred income tax assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars (“the foreign currencies”).
During  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2013,  the  Company  recognized  a  net  foreign  exchange  loss  of  $25
million and $23 million, respectively (three and six months ended June 30, 2012 – net loss of $8 million and net gain of
$1 million, respectively). Based on the Company’s net exposures (other than those relating to taxes) at June 30, 2013,
a  10%  depreciation  or  appreciation  of  the  foreign  currencies  against  the  US  dollar  would  have  resulted  in  an
approximate $11 million increase or decrease in the Company’s after-tax net earnings, respectively.
During  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2013,  the  Company  recognized  a  net  foreign  exchange  loss  of  $78
million  and  $58  million  in  income  tax  expense  on  income  taxes  receivable/(payable)  and  deferred  taxes,  respectively
(three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2012  –  net  loss  of  $54  million  and  $3  million,  respectively).  Based  on  the
Company’s net exposures relating to taxes at June 30,
GOLDCORP  |  46
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
2013,  a  10%  depreciation  or  appreciation  of  the  foreign  currencies  against  the  US  dollar  would  have  resulted  in  an
approximate $164 million decrease or increase in the Company’s after-tax net earnings, respectively.
During  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2013,  and  in  accordance  with  its  Risk  Management  Policy,  the
Company  entered  into  Canadian  dollar  and  Mexican  peso  forward  and  option  contracts  to  purchase  and  sell  the
respective  foreign  currencies  at  pre-determined  US  dollar  amounts.  These  contracts  were  entered  into  to  normalize
operating expenses incurred by the Company’s foreign operations as expressed in US dollar terms.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair values and future cash flows of the Company will fluctuate because of changes
in market interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily on its outstanding borrowings, its share
of the Pueblo Viejo project financing and credit facility, and its cash and cash equivalents, money market investments,
certain short-term credit facilities and interest-bearing receivables.
There has been no significant change in the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk, and there has been no change to
its objectives and policies for managing these risks during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.
Price risk
Price  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  the  Company’s  financial  instruments  will  fluctuate
because  of  changes  in  market  prices.  The  Company  has  a  policy  not  to  hedge  gold  sales.  In  accordance  with  the
Company’s Risk Management Policy, the Company may hedge up to 50% and 30% of its by-product base metal sales
volume  over  the  next  fifteen  months  and  subsequent  sixteen  to  twenty-seven  months,  respectively,  to  manage  its
exposure to fluctuations in base metal prices. There has been no change in the Company’s objectives and policies for
managing this risk during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.
Profitability of the Company depends on metal prices for gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Gold, silver, copper, lead
and  zinc  prices  are  affected  by  numerous  factors  such  as  the  sale  or  purchase  of  gold  and  silver  by  various  central
banks and financial institutions, interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, fluctuations in the value of the US
dollar and foreign currencies, global and regional supply and demand, and the political and economic conditions of major
gold,  silver  and  copper-producing  countries  throughout  the  world.  A  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  metal  prices  would
result in a $72 million and $158 million increase or decrease in the Company’s after-tax net earnings for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively.
The Company holds certain investments in available-for-sale equity securities which are measured at fair value, being
the closing share price of each equity investment, at the balance sheet date. The Company is exposed to changes in
share prices which would result in gains and losses being recognized in other comprehensive income.
OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
There were no significant changes to the Company’s exposure to risks and other uncertainties, including risks relating
to the Company’s foreign operations and environmental regulation, as described in the 2012 year end MD&A during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2013 other than as follows:
Government Regulation
Province of Santa Cruz, Argentina
On June 13, 2013, the Province of Santa Cruz passed amendments to the Provincial Tax Code and Provincial Tax Law,
which imposes a new tax on mining real estate property in the Province. The tax will amount to 1% of the value of the
economically viable reserves of mining projects as indicated in feasibility studies filed with the Province or as published
in  a  corporation’s  annual  financial  statements.  The  new  law  came  into  force  on  July  5,  2013.  There  are  a  number  of
uncertainties  surrounding  the  scope,  calculation  and  enforcement  of  the  tax  and  the  mining  industry  is  waiting  for
publication of regulations detailing these matters. It is expected that the tax will be
GOLDCORP  |  47
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
payable annually by the Company’s Cerro Negro project, which is currently under construction. The Company, as well
as potentially other mining companies operating in the Province of Santa Cruz, plans to challenge the constitutionality
and legality of the new tax law.
Mexico
During the first quarter of 2013, the Mexican government introduced a bill which proposes a 5% tax-deductible mining
duty  calculated  on  an  operating  mine’s  taxable  income  before  the  deduction  of  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and
amortization. The bill is progressing through the Mexican legislative process and is currently ready for discussion at the
level of the Mexican Senate. The senate has not yet approved the proposal and is expected to review it during the next
session scheduled for September 2013. If approved, the new mining duty would be applicable on a prospective basis
and would therefore affect future earnings from the Company’s mining operations in Mexico.
Dominican Republic
On  May  8,  2013,  the  Government  and  PVDC  entered  a  non-binding  memorandum  of  understanding  which  provided  in
general  terms  that  the  respective  parties  would  attempt  to  finalize  an  agreement  which  would  resulting  in  bringing
forward  payments  to  the  government  into  the  early  years  of  the  project  but  resulting  in  no  more  than  a  $1.5  billion
impact on the modeled net present value of the project, assuming a $1,600 per ounce gold price, and that would impose
an alternate minimum tax structure. Talks to finalize such an agreement continue in a constructive manner, but to-date
the  parties  have  not  finalized  the  agreement.  The  overall  impact  of  such  an  agreement  on  the  profitability  and
operations  of  the  mine  cannot  yet  be  ascertained  beyond  the  general  parameters  outlined  in  the  memorandum  of
understanding.
On April 4, 2013, the main opposition party in the Dominican Republic introduced a bill in the Chamber of Deputies that
would establish a windfall profit tax on PVDC. To the Company’s knowledge, no further action has been taken by the
Chamber of Deputies with respect to this bill.
On March 13, 2013, customs authorities in the Dominican Republic prevented PVDC from exporting a shipment of gold
and  silver  from  the  Pueblo  Viejo  mine.  The  shipment  was  subsequently  released  and  shipped  out  of  the  Dominican
Republic on March 18, 2013. In late March and early April 2013, PVDC was informed of certain additional requirements
that  will  apply  to  shipments  of  gold  and  silver  from  the  Pueblo  Viejo  mine.  PVDC  is  complying  with  these  new
measures.
Other Risks
Ejido Land Claims
Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution and subsequent legislation established the “ejido” and communal landholding as
forms  of  land  tenure  in  Mexico.  There  are  eleven  ejido  communities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Company’s  Mexican  mining
operations  and  ejido  lands  cover  all  of  the  lands  used  by  the  Company  for  its  current  mining  operations  at  its
Peñasquito, Los Filos and El Sauzal mines. The Company enters into temporary occupation agreements ranging from 5
to  30  years  with  the  ejido  communities  which  allow  the  Company  to  use  the  surface  of  the  lands  for  its  mining
operations. In Mexico, mining rights that are covered under a concession do not include direct ownership or possession
rights over the surface, or surface access, and at any particular time the Company may be involved in negotiations with
various ejido communities to enter into new temporary occupation agreements or amend existing agreements. Failure to
reach agreement may cause delays to operations and projects, and on occasion, lead to litigation.
OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA
As  of  July  24,  2013,  there  were  812  million  common  shares  of  the  Company  issued  and  outstanding  and  18  million
stock options outstanding which are exchangeable into common shares at exercise prices ranging between C$16.87 per
share to C$48.72 per share.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
IAS  34  – Interim  Financial  Reporting (“IAS  34”)  as  issued  by  the  IASB.  Accordingly,  certain  disclosures  included  in
annual financial statements
GOLDCORP  |  48
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRSs  as  issued  by  the  IASB  have  been  condensed  or  omitted  and  the  Company’s
unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Company’s
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012.
The  accounting  policies  applied  in  preparation  of  the  Company’s  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial
statements are consistent with those applied and disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2012, with the exception of the application of certain new and amended IFRSs issued by the
IASB, which were effective from January 1, 2013. Those new and revised IFRSs which had a significant impact on the
Company’s  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  are  described  in  note  3  to  the  Company’s
unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial  statements.  Note  3  includes  reconciliations  of  the  Company’s
unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  balance  sheets,  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  statements  of
(loss)  earnings  and  comprehensive  (loss)  income  and  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  statements  of  cash
flows  for  the  2012  comparative  periods  which  were  previously  disclosed  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial
statements.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The  Company’s  management  makes  judgements  in  its  process  of  applying  the  Company’s  accounting  policies  in  the
preparation  of  its  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial  statements.  In  addition,  the  preparation  of  the
financial data requires that the Company’s management make assumptions and estimates of effects of uncertain future
events  on  the  carrying  amounts  of  the  Company’s  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  and  the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates
as  the  estimation  process  is  inherently  uncertain.  Estimates  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis  based  on  historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to estimates and
the resulting effects on the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities are accounted for prospectively.
The  critical  judgements  and  estimates  applied  in  the  preparation  of  the  Company’s  unaudited  condensed  interim
consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied and disclosed in notes 5 and 6 to the Company’s
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012. Additional significant judgements and
estimates  applied  to  the  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  three  and  six  months
ended  June  30,  2013  are  disclosed  in  note  7  to  the  Company’s  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial
statements.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Application of new and revised accounting standards
The  Company  has  applied  the  following  new  and  revised  IFRSs  in  these  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated
financial statements and the Company has restated the 2012 comparative periods, where applicable, accordingly.
Effective  from  January  1,  2013,  IFRS  10  – Consolidated  Financial  Statements (“IFRS  10”)  supersedes  SIC  12  –
Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities and the requirements relating to consolidated financial statements in IAS 27 –
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. Concurrent with the issuance of IFRS 10, the IASB issued IFRS 11 –
Joint Arrangements (“IFRS 11”) and IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (“IFRS 12”) and reissued IAS 27
– Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
Consolidation
IFRS  10  establishes  control  as  the  basis  for  an  investor  to  consolidate  its  investees  and  defines  control  as  an
investor’s power over an investee with exposure, or rights, to variable returns from the investee and the ability to affect
the investor’s returns through its power over the investee.
Joint arrangements
GOLDCORP  |  49
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
IFRS  11  supersedes  IAS  31  – Interests  in  Joint  Ventures and  SIC  13  –  Jointly  Controlled  Entities  –  Non-Monetary
Contributions by Venturers. Under IFRS 11, joint arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint ventures based
on the rights and obligations of the parties to the joint arrangements. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby
the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (“joint operators”) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the
liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control
of  the  arrangement  (“joint  venturers”)  have  rights  to  the  net  assets  of  the  arrangement.  IFRS  11  requires  that  a  joint
operator recognize its portion of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of a joint arrangement, while a joint venturer
recognizes its investment in a joint arrangement using the equity method.
Disclosure of interests in other entities
IFRS  12  combines  and  enhances  the  disclosure  requirements  for  the  Company’s  subsidiaries,  joint  arrangements,
associates  and  unconsolidated  structured  entities.  The  requirements  of  IFRS  12  include  enhanced  reporting  of  the
nature  of  risks  associated  with  the  Company’s  interests  in  other  entities,  and  the  effects  of  those  interests  on  the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.
As  a  result  of  the  application  of  these  standards,  the  Company’s  37.5%  interest  in  Alumbrera,  which  was  previously
proportionately consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has been classified as an investment
in an associate and is accounted for using the equity method, with the Company’s share of net earnings (losses) and
net  assets  separately  disclosed  in  the  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  statements  of  (loss)  earnings  and
consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
The  Company  has  accounted  for  this  change  in  consolidation  retrospectively  using  the  transitional  requirements  of
IFRS 10 and the Company has restated the 2012 comparative periods accordingly. A reconciliation of the Company’s
2012  comparative  periods,  as  previously  disclosed,  to  the  2012  comparative  periods  disclosed  in  these  unaudited
condensed interim consolidated financial statements is as follows:

IFRS  13  – Fair Value Measurement  (“IFRS  13”)  defines  fair  value  and  sets  out  a  single  framework  for  measuring  fair
value  which  is  applicable  to  all  IFRSs  that  require  or  permit  fair  value  measurements  or  disclosures  about  fair  value
measurements.  IFRS  13  requires  that  when  using  a  valuation  technique  to  measure  fair  value,  the  use  of  relevant
observable  inputs  should  be  maximized  while  unobservable  inputs  should  be  minimized.  The  Company  has  applied
IFRS 13 on a prospective basis, commencing January 1, 2013.
Employee benefits
GOLDCORP  |  51
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
A  revised  IAS  19  – Employee  Benefits  (“IAS  19”)  has  introduced  significant  changes  to  the  accounting  for  defined
benefit  plans  and  other  employee  benefits.  The  amendments  include  elimination  of  the  options  to  defer  or  recognize
actuarial gains and losses in full in profit or loss and instead mandate the immediate recognition of all actuarial gains
and  losses  in  other  comprehensive  income.  The  amended  IAS  19  also  requires  calculation  of  net  interest  on  the  net
defined benefit liability or asset using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation.
In addition, other changes incorporated into the amended standard include changes made to the date of recognition of
liabilities  for  termination  benefits,  and  changes  to  the  definitions  of  short-term  employee  benefits  and  other  long-term
employee benefits which may impact on the classification of liabilities associated with those benefits.
The Company has adopted these amendments retrospectively; however, these amendments to IAS 19 did not have a
significant impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine
IFRIC  20  – Stripping  Costs  in  the  Production  Phase  of  a  Surface  Mine  (“IFRIC  20”)  clarifies  the  requirements  for
accounting for the costs of stripping activity in the production phase when two benefits accrue: (i) usable ore that can
be  used  to  produce  inventory;  and  (ii)  improved  access  to  further  quantities  of  material  that  will  be  mined  in  future
periods. The Company has applied IFRIC 20 on a prospective basis in compliance with the transitional requirements of
IFRIC 20. The application of IFRIC 20 did not result in an adjustment to the Company’s unaudited condensed interim
consolidated financial statements.
Financial statement presentation
Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements (“IAS 1”), effective for annual periods beginning
on  or  after  July  1,  2012,  require  an  entity  to  group  items  presented  in  the  statement  of  other  comprehensive
income on the basis of whether they may be reclassified to profit or loss subsequent to initial recognition. For
those items presented before tax, the amendments to IAS 1 also require that the tax related to the two separate
groups be presented separately.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET EFFECTIVE
Financial instruments
The IASB intends to replace IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety with
IFRS  9  – Financial  Instruments (“IFRS  9”)  which  will  be  effective  for  annual  periods  commencing  on  or  after
January 1, 2015. IFRS 9 is intended to reduce the complexity for the classification and measurement of financial
instruments.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  the  final  standard  is  expected  to  have  on  its
consolidated financial statements.
Levies imposed by governments
In  May  2013,  the  IASB  issued  IFRIC  21  – Levies (“IFRIC  21”),  an  interpretation  of  IAS  37  – Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (“IAS 37”), on the accounting for levies imposed by governments.
IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to have a
present  obligation  as  a  result  of  a  past  event  (“obligating  event”).  IFRIC  21  clarifies  that  the  obligating  event
that  gives  rise  to  a  liability  to  pay  a  levy  is  the  activity  described  in  the  relevant  legislation  that  triggers  the
payment  of  the  levy.  IFRIC  21  is  effective  for  annual  periods  commencing  on  or  after  January  1,  2014.  The
Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  the  final  interpretation  is  expected  to  have  on  its  consolidated
financial statements.
OUTLOOK
GOLDCORP  |  52
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
For 2013, the Company expects to produce between 2.55 and 2.80 million ounces of gold at a total cash cost of
$525  to  $575  per  ounce  on  a  by-product  basis.  On  a  co-product  basis,  the  Company  is  forecasting  total  cash
costs between $700 to $750 per ounce of gold. Cash costs are expected to rise from 2012 levels primarily due to
industry-wide cost inflation and the impacts of lower grades and by-product production at Peñasquito in 2013.
Assumptions  used  to  forecast  total  cash  costs  for  2013  include  by-product  metal  prices  of  $30.00  per  ounce
silver; $3.50 per pound copper; $0.90 per pound zinc; $0.90 per pound lead; an oil price of $100.00 per barrel;
and the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso at $1.00 and $12.75, respectively, to the US dollar. All-in sustaining
costs, on a by-product basis, are expected to be between $1,000 – $1,100 per ounce as Pueblo Viejo ramps up
operations. Gold equivalent ounces production of 3.5-4.0 million ounces is also forecasted.
Capital expenditures for 2013 are forecast at approximately $2.6 billion of which approximately 60% is allocated
to projects and 40% to operations. Exploration expenditures in 2013 are expected to amount to approximately
$200  million,  of  which  approximately  one  third  is  expected  to  be  expensed.  Goldcorp’s  primary  focus  will
remain  on  the  replacement  of  reserves  mined  and  on  extending  existing  gold  zones  at  all  of  its  prospective
mines  and  projects.  Corporate  administration  expense,  excluding  share-based  compensation,  is  forecast  at
$164 million for 2013. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $335
per ounce of gold sold. The Company expects an overall effective tax rate of 29% for 2013.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, with the participation of its President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive
Vice  President  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  has  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  disclosure
controls  and  procedures.  Based  upon  the  results  of  that  evaluation,  the  Company’s  President  and  Chief
Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide
reasonable  assurance  that  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  the  Company  in  reports  it  files  is
recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported,  within  the  appropriate  time  periods  and  is  accumulated  and
communicated  to  management,  including  the  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Executive  Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management, with the participation of its President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive
Vice  President  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal
control  over  financial  reporting.  Under  the  supervision  of  the  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the
preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  IFRS.  The  Company’s  internal
control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
•   pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that  accurately  and  fairly  reflect,  in  reasonable  detail,  the  transactions  and
dispositions of assets of the Company;
•   provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial
statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  and  that  the  Company’s  receipts  and  expenditures  are  made  only  in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Company’s Directors; and
•   provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or
disposition  of  the  Company’s  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial
statements.
GOLDCORP  |  53
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three and six
months  ended  June  30,  2013  that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations of Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President
and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  believes  that  any  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or  internal  control  over
financial  reporting,  no  matter  how  well  conceived  and  operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable,  not  absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints,  and  the  benefits  of  controls  must  be  considered  relative  to  their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that
all  control  issues  and  instances  of  fraud,  if  any,  within  the  Company  have  been  prevented  or  detected.  These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts
of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by unauthorized override of the control. The design of
any  control  system  also  is  based  in  part  upon  certain  assumptions  about  the  likelihood  of  future  events,  and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Accordingly, because of  the  inherent  limitations  in  a  cost  effective  control  system,  misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This  report  contains  “forward-looking  statements”,  within  the  meaning  of  the  United  States  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995  and  applicable  Canadian  securities  legislation,  concerning  the  business,
operations and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are
not limited to, statements with respect to the future price of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, the estimation
of  mineral  reserves  and  resources,  the  realization  of  mineral  reserve  estimates,  the  timing  and  amount  of
estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures, costs and timing of the development of
new  deposits,  success  of  exploration  activities,  permitting  time  lines,  hedging  practices,  currency  exchange
rate 
for  additional  capital,  government  regulation  of  mining  operations,
environmental  risks,  unanticipated  reclamation  expenses,  timing  and  possible  outcome  of  pending  litigation,
fluctuations,  requirements
title disputes or claims and limitations on insurance coverage. Generally, these forward-looking statements can
be  identified  by  the  use  of  forward-looking  terminology  such  as  “plans”,  “expects”,  “is  expected”,  “budget”,
“scheduled”,  “estimates”,  “forecasts”,  “intends”,  “anticipates”,  “believes”  or  variations  of  such  words  and
phrases  or  statements  that  certain  actions,  events  or  results  “may”,  “could”,  “would”,  “might”  or  “will  be
taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative connotation thereof.
Forward-looking  statements  are  made  based  upon  certain  assumptions  and  other  important  factors  that,  if
untrue,  could  cause  the  actual  results,  performances  or  achievements  of  Goldcorp  to  be  materially  different
from future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Such statements
and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the
environment  in  which  Goldcorp  will  operate  in  the  future,  including  the  price  of  gold,  anticipated  costs  and
ability  to  achieve  goals.  Certain  important  factors  that  could  cause  actual  results,  performances  or
achievements  to  differ  materially  from  those  in  the  forward-looking  statements  include,  among  others,  gold
price  volatility,  discrepancies  between  actual  and  estimated  production,  mineral  reserves  and  resources  and
metallurgical  recoveries,  mining  operational  and  development  risks,  litigation  risks,  regulatory  restrictions
(including environmental regulatory restrictions and liability), activities by governmental authorities (including
changes  in  taxation),  currency  fluctuations,  the  speculative  nature  of  gold  exploration,  the  global  economic
climate,  dilution,  share  price  volatility,  competition,  loss  of  key  employees,  additional  funding  requirements
and defective title to mineral claims or property. Although Goldcorp has attempted to identify important factors
that  could  cause  actual  actions,  events  or  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  described  in  forward-looking
statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated
or intended.
Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors
that  may  cause  the  actual  results,  level  of  activity,  performance  or  achievements  of  Goldcorp  to  be  materially
different from those expressed or implied by
GOLDCORP  |  54
Second Quarter Report – 2013
(in United States dollars, tabular amounts in millions, except where noted)
such  forward-looking  statements,  including  but  not  limited  to:  risks  related  to  the  integration  of  acquisitions;
risks  related  to  international  operations,  including  economical  and  political  instability  in  foreign  jurisdictions
in  which  Goldcorp  operates;  risks  related  to  current  global  financial  conditions;  risks  related  to  joint  venture
operations;  actual  results  of  current  exploration  activities;  environmental  risks;  future  prices  of  gold,  silver,
copper,  lead  and  zinc;  possible  variations  in  ore  reserves,  grade  or  recovery  rates;  mine  development  and
operating  risks;  accidents,  labour  disputes  and  other  risks  of  the  mining  industry;  delays  in  obtaining
governmental  approvals  or  financing  or  in  the  completion  of  development  or  construction  activities;  risks
related to indebtedness and the service of such indebtedness, as well as those factors discussed in the section
entitled “Description of the Business – Risk Factors” in Goldcorp’s Annual Information Form for the year ended
December 31, 2012 available at www.sedar.com. Although Goldcorp has attempted to identify important factors
that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  contained  in  forward-looking  statements,  there
may  be  other  factors  that  cause  results  not  to  be  as  anticipated,  estimated  or  intended.  There  can  be  no
assurance  that  such  statements  will  prove  to  be  accurate,  as  actual  results  and  future  events  could  differ
materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on
forward-looking  statements.  Forward-looking  statements  are  made  as  of  the  date  hereof  and  accordingly  are
subject to change after such date. Except as otherwise indicated by Goldcorp, these statements do not reflect
the potential impact of any non-recurring or other special items or of any dispositions, monetizations, mergers,
acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may be announced or that may occur after
the  date  hereof.  Forward-looking  statements  are  provided  for  the  purpose  of  providing  information  about
management’s current expectations and plans and allowing investors and others to get a better understanding
of our operating environment. Goldcorp does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are
included in this document, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.
CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING RESERVES AND RESOURCES
Scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A was reviewed and approved by Maryse Belanger,
P.Geo.,  Senior  Vice-President,  Technical  Services  for  Goldcorp,  and  a  “qualified  person”  as  defined  by
National  Instrument  43-101  –  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects  (“NI  43-101”).  All  mineral  reserves
and  mineral  resources  have  been  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Canadian  Institute  of
Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  and  NI  43-101,  or  the  AusIMM  JORC  equivalent.  All  mineral  resources  are
reported  exclusive  of  mineral  reserves  and  mineral  resources  which  are  not  mineral  reserves  do  not  have
demonstrated  economic  viability.  Information  on  data  verification  performed  on  the  mineral  properties
mentioned in this MD&A that are considered to be material mineral properties to the Company are contained in
Goldcorp’s Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2012 and the current technical report for
those properties, all available at www.sedar.com.
Cautionary Note to United States investors concerning estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources:
United States investors are advised that while the terms “measured”, “indicated” and “inferred” resources are
recognized  and  required  by  Canadian  regulations,  the  United  States  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission
does not recognize them. “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence,
and as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral
resource  will  ever  be  upgraded  to  a  higher  category.  Under  Canadian  rules,  estimates  of  inferred  mineral
resources may not form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. United States investors are cautioned
not  to  assume  that  all  or  any  part  of  measured  or  indicated  mineral  resources  will  ever  be  converted  into
mineral  reserves.  United  States  investors  are  also  cautioned  not  to  assume  that  all  or  any  part  of  an  inferred
mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.
