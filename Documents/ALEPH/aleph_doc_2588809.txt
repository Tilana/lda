ARTICLE II.
REGISTRATION RIGHTS
Section 2.01 Shelf Registration.
(a) If the Registrable Securities then represent at least five percent (5.0%) of the issued and
outstanding Common Stock of the Company, the Company shall prepare and file with the
Commission a registration statement under the Securities Act providing for the resale of
the Registrable Securities as permitted by Rule 415 of the Securities Act with respect to all
of the Holders’ (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) no later than the earlier of (i) the one
year anniversary of the consummation of such Qualified Equity Offering and (ii) 30 days
after the date the Company first becomes eligible to use a Form S-3 (the “Filing
Deadline”). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as soon as reasonably
practicable after the initial filing of the Shelf Registration Statement, but in any event no
later than one hundred and twenty (120) days of the Filing Deadline
3
(the “Effectiveness Deadline”). The Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for the
resale pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and
requested by, the Holders of any and all Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf
Registration Statement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.01 to be
continuously effective, supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that
it is available for the resale of all Registrable Securities by the Holders until all Registrable
Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have ceased to be Registrable
Securities (the “Effectiveness Period”). The Shelf Registration Statement when effective
(and the documents incorporated therein by reference) shall comply as to form in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. As soon as
practicable following the date that the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, but
in any event within two (2) business days of such date, the Company shall provide the
Holders with written notice of the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement. Once a
Holder’s Registrable Securities become eligible for resale without restriction and without
the need for current public information pursuant to any section of Rule 144 (or any similar
provision then in effect) under the Securities Act, assuming the Holder of such Registrable
Securities is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144(a)(1) under the Securities Act) of the
Company, such Holder may, at any time, request that the Company take such steps as are
reasonably necessary to deregister such Holder’s Registrable Securities and in
connection therewith, such Holder’s rights under this Agreement shall all be terminated,
including without limitation the right to demand an Underwritten Offering and the right to
participate in a Piggyback Registration and, further, such Holder shall no longer be
subject to any obligations under this Agreement, including specifically but not limited to
the obligation to enter into letter agreements with underwriters pursuant to Section 2.02.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may, upon
written notice to any Selling Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in a Shelf
Registration Statement, suspend such Selling Holder’s use of any prospectus which is a
part of such Shelf Registration Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall suspend
sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement) if (i) the
Company is pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar
transaction and the Company determines in good faith that the Company’s ability to
pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially and adversely affected by
any required disclosure of such transaction in such Shelf Registration Statement or (ii) the
Company has experienced some other material non-public event, the disclosure of which
at such time, in the good faith judgment of the Company, would materially and adversely
affect the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall the Selling Holders be
suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration
Statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of forty-five (45) days in any 90-day
period or ninety (90) days in any 365-day period. Upon disclosure of such information or
the termination of the condition described above, the Company shall provide prompt
notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in such Shelf
Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put
into effect and shall take such other actions necessary or appropriate to permit registered
sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.

Section 2.02 Underwritten Offerings.
(a) Request for a Secondary Offering. If the Company fails to have a Shelf Registration
Statement declared effective on or prior to the Effectiveness Deadline, then on or prior to
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date hereof, if the Holders elect to dispose of all of their
Registrable Securities pursuant to an Underwritten Offering, the Company shall, upon the
written request by such Holder, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) retain
underwriters in order to permit such Holders to effect such sale through an Underwritten
Offering (a “Secondary Offering”); (ii) if a registration statement is not then already
available and effective, prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement
under the Securities Act providing for a Secondary Offering as permitted by Rule 415 of
the Securities Act with respect to such Registrable Securities (a “Secondary Offering
Registration Statement”); and (iii) cause such Secondary Offering Registration Statement
to be declared effective. The obligation of the Company to retain underwriters shall include
the preparation and entry into an underwriting agreement, in customary form, with the
Secondary Managing Underwriter and other underwriters, if any, which shall include,
among other provisions, indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in
Section 2.07 and customary lock-up provisions for the Company and its directors and
officers. The Company shall take all reasonable actions as requested by the Secondary
Managing Underwriter or other underwriters (if any) to expedite or facilitate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities, including causing its management to participate in a
“roadshow” or similar marketing efforts.
(b) Limitation on Offerings. In no event shall the Company be required hereunder to
participate in more than one Secondary Offering pursuant to the terms hereof; provided
that, if a Secondary Offering is commenced but terminated prior to the pricing thereof for
any reason, the Company shall be required to participate in an additional Secondary
Offering pursuant to the terms hereof.
(c) Selection of Secondary Managing Underwriter. In connection with any Secondary
Offering under this Agreement, the Secondary Managing Underwriter shall be selected by
the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering, which underwriter shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company.
(d) Withdrawal. If any Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of a Secondary Offering,
such Person may elect to withdraw its request that the Company undertake such offering
by written notice to the Company; provided, however, that such withdrawal must be made
at a time prior to the time of pricing of such offering. No such withdrawal shall affect the
Company’s obligation to pay Registration Expenses, if applicable.
Section 2.03 Piggyback Rights.
(a) Participation. So long as any Holder has Registrable Securities, if the Company
proposes to file, whether for its own account or for the account of the Holders: (i) a shelf
registration statement (other than the Shelf Registration Statement contemplated by
Section 2.01) or (ii) a registration statement other than a shelf registration statement (other
than a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor forms thereto) (each of
(i) and (ii), a “Piggyback Registration Statement”), then the Company shall give prompt
written notice (a “Piggyback Notice”) (including notice by electronic mail) to each Holder
regarding such proposed registration, and such notice shall offer such Holders the
opportunity to include in such Piggyback Registration
5
Statement such number of Registrable Securities as each such Holder may request. Each
Piggyback Notice shall specify, at a minimum, the number and type of securities proposed
to be registered, the proposed date of filing of such Piggyback Registration Statement
with the Commission, the proposed means of distribution, the proposed Primary
Managing Underwriter and other underwriters (if any and if known) and a good faith
estimate by the Company of the proposed minimum offering price of such securities. Each
such Holder shall make such request in writing to the Company (including by electronic
mail) within five (5) business days (or one (1) business day in connection with any
overnight or bought Underwritten Offering) after the receipt of any such Piggyback Notice,
which request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed
of by such Holder or the number of Registrable Securities such Holder intends to have
redeemed by the Company, and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to include in such Piggyback
Registration Statement all Registrable Securities held by such Holders; provided, that if, at
any time after giving written notice of its intention to file a Piggyback Registration
Statement and prior to the effective date of such Piggyback Registration Statement, the
Company shall determine for any reason not to have such Piggyback Registration
Statement be declared effective, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of
such determination within five (5) business days thereof to each Holder of Registrable
Securities and, thereupon, shall not be obligated to register any Registrable Securities in
connection with such Piggyback Registration Statement (but shall nevertheless pay the
Registration Expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights
of the Holders of Registrable Securities that a registration be effected under Section 2.01
or Section 2.02.
(b) Selection of Primary Managing Underwriter. In connection with any Underwritten
Offering under this Section 2.03, the Primary Managing Underwriter shall be selected by
the Company, which Primary Managing Underwriter shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Selling Holders.
(c) Priority. If in connection with an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Section 2.03, the
Primary Managing Underwriter shall advise the Company that, in its reasonable opinion,
the number of securities requested and otherwise proposed to be included in such
Underwritten Offering exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without an
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities to be offered (an
“Adverse Effect”), then the Company shall include in such Underwritten Offering the
number of Registrable Securities that such Primary Managing Underwriter advises the
Company can be sold without having such Adverse Effect, with such number to be
allocated (i) first to the Company and (ii) second, and if any, the number of included
Registrable Securities that, in the opinion of such Primary Managing Underwriter, can be
sold without having such Adverse Effect, with such number to be allocated pro rata
among the Holders that have requested to participate in such Underwritten Offering based
on the relative number of Registrable Securities then held by each such Holder (provided
that any securities thereby allocated to a Holder that exceed such Holder’s request shall
be reallocated among the remaining requesting Holders in like manner).
Section 2.04 Sale Procedures. In connection with its obligations under this Article II, the
Company will, as expeditiously as possible:
(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to any
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be
necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period and as
may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement;
6
(b) if a prospectus supplement, offering memorandum or similar marketing document will
be used in connection with the marketing of a Secondary Offering and the Secondary
Managing Underwriter notifies the Company in writing that, in the sole judgment of such
Secondary Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed information in such prospectus
supplement is of material importance to the success of such offering, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to include such information in such prospectus
supplement, offering memorandum or similar marketing document;
(c) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably practicable before
filing any Registration Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, upon request,
copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents proposed to be filed
(including exhibits and each document incorporated by reference therein to the extent
then required by the rules and regulations of the Commission) or use of a similar
marketing instrument, and provide each such Selling Holder the opportunity to object to
any information pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution that is
contained therein and make the corrections reasonably requested by such Selling Holder
with respect to such information prior to filing the Registration Statement or supplement or
amendment thereto or use of a similar marketing instrument, and (ii) such number of
copies of the Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein and any
supplements and amendments thereto or similar marketing instrument as such Persons
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement;
(d) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement under the securities or blue
sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or, in the case of a Secondary
Offering, the Secondary Managing Underwriter, shall reasonably request; provided,
however, that the Company will not be required to qualify generally to transact business in
any jurisdiction where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would
subject it to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;
(e) promptly notify each Selling Holder and, if applicable, any Secondary Managing
Underwriter, at any time when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the

supplement thereto, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto, when the same has become effective; and (ii) any written comments
from the Commission with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and any written
request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration
Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;

Underwriter, at any time when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus or
prospectus supplement contained in the Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any
7
prospectus contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is
made); (ii) the issuance or threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Company of any notification with

the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of
such notice, the Company agrees to, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the
prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that the
prospectus or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and to
take such other reasonable action as is necessary to remove a stop order, suspension,
threat thereof or proceedings related thereto;
(g) upon a Selling Holder’s request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations,

customary form and covering substantially the same matters with respect to such
Registration Statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement included
therein) as have been customarily covered in opinions of issuer’s counsel and in

or private placements, as applicable, of securities by the Company and such other matters

resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated

Section 2.07 Indemnification.
(a) By the Company. In the event of a registration of any Registrable Securities under the
Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless
each
9
Selling Holder participating therein, its directors, officers, employees and agents, and each
Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees or agents, against any
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses) (collectively, “Losses”), joint or several, to which such Selling Holder, director,
officer, employee, agent or controlling Person may become subject under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings,
whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact (in the case of any
prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which such statement is made) contained
in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement, free
writing prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse each such Selling Holder, its directors,
officers, employee and agents, and each such controlling Person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such Loss or actions or proceedings as such expenses are incurred; provided, however,
that the Company will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder, its directors, officers, employees and agents or such controlling Person in
writing specifically for use in the Registration Statement, or prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto, as applicable. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder or any such
directors, officers, employees agents or controlling Person, and shall survive the transfer
of such securities by such Selling Holder.
(b) By Each Holder. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, employees and agents and each
Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or of
the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees and agents, to the same extent as
the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Selling Holders, but only with respect to
information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such
Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any preliminary
prospectus, prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus or final prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto; provided, however, that the
liability of each Selling Holder shall not be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of
the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.
(c) Notice. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is
to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in
writing thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from
any liability that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this Section 2.07. In
any action brought against any indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and,
to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
10
under this Section 2.07 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation
and of liaison with counsel so selected; provided, however, that, (i) if the indemnifying
party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the
indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified
party and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have
concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that
are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the
interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests
of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to select a
separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the
defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel
and other reasonable expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the
indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
indemnified party shall settle any action brought against it with respect to which such
indemnified party is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the
indemnifying party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and
includes a complete and unconditional release from all liability of, the indemnifying party
and further, no indemnifying party shall settle any action brought against any indemnified
party with respect to which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification hereunder
without the consent of such indemnified party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no
liability or obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release from all
liability of, the indemnified party.
(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.07 is held by a court or
government agency of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any indemnified party
or is insufficient to hold them harmless in respect of any Losses, then each indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of
such indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate
amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by
such Selling Holder. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by
such party, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to
be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not
take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an
indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this
paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any Loss that is
the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
Person who is not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation.
11
(e) Other Indemnification. The provisions of this Section 2.07 shall be in addition to any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that an indemnified party may have
pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.
Section 2.08 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain
rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit the sale of the Registrable
Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to:
(a) make and keep public information regarding the Company available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times from and after the
date hereof;
(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required
of the Company under the Exchange Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and
(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to such Holder forthwith
upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and
such other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any
such securities without registration.
Section 2.09 Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the
Company to register Registrable Securities granted to an Initial Holder by the Company
under this Agreement may be transferred or assigned by such Initial Holder to one or
more transferees or assignees of such Registrable Securities; provided, however, that
(a) the Company is given written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating
the name and address of each such transferee or assignee and identifying the Registrable
Securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned,
and (b) each such transferee or assignee agrees to be bound by this Agreement.
Section 2.10 Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable Securities. Each Holder
who, along with its Affiliates, holds at least five percent (5%) of the then-outstanding
shares of Common Stock agrees to enter into a customary letter agreement with
underwriters providing such Holder will not effect any public sale or distribution of the
Registrable Securities during the 180 calendar day period beginning on the date of a
prospectus or prospectus supplement filed with the Commission with respect to the
pricing of an Underwritten Offering, provided that (i) the duration of the foregoing
restrictions shall be no longer than the duration of the shortest restriction generally
imposed by the underwriters on the Company or the officers, directors or any other
shareholder of the Company on whom a restriction is imposed; and (ii) the restrictions set
forth in this Section 2.10 shall not apply to any Registrable Securities that are otherwise
sold in connection with an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.05 Specific Performance. Damages in the event of breach of this Agreement by a

each party, in addition to and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will
have the right to an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and all defenses it
may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such an
injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this right will not preclude any such
party from pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or in equity that such party may
have.
Section 3.06 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original and all of

only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

Agreement.
Section 3.09 Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof or affecting or impairing the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction.
Section 3.10 Scope of Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final
expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of
the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter
contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other
than those set forth or referred to herein with respect to the rights granted by the
Company set forth herein. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
Section 3.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written
amendment signed by both the Company and the Holders of a majority of the then
outstanding Registrable Securities; provided, however, that no such amendment shall

such Holder.
Section 3.12 No Presumption. If any claim is made by a party relating to any conflict,

covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than the Company and the
Holders shall have any obligation hereunder and that, notwithstanding that one or more of
the Holders may be a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, no recourse
under this Agreement or under any documents or instruments delivered in connection
herewith or therewith shall be had against any former, current or future director, officer,
employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of
any of the Holders or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent,
general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or
otherwise by incurred by any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent,
general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the Holders
or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited
partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, as such, for
any obligations of the Holders under this Agreement or any documents or instruments
delivered in connection herewith or therewith or for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligation or its creation, except in each case for any assignee of the
Holders hereunder.
Section 3.15 Independent Nature of Purchaser’s Obligations. The obligations of each
Holder under this Agreement are several and not joint with the obligations of any other
Holder, and no Holder shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the
obligations of any other Holder under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein, and no
action taken by any Holder pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Holders as
a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of group or entity, or create
a presumption that the Holders are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect
to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Holder
shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including without

under this Agreement, such action shall be in the Holders’ sole discretion unless
otherwise specified.

expressly subordinate to the rights of, the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder.
