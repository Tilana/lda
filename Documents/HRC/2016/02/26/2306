</p>
<p><b>  23/12. 
Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights 
and the Human Rights Council on the issue of human rights and international solidarity, 
including Commission resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005, Council resolutions 6/3 of 27 
September 2007, 7/5 of 27 March 2008, 9/2 of 24 September 2008, 12/9 of 1 October 
2009,15/13 of 30 September 2010, 17/6 of 16 June 2011, 18/5 of 29 September 2011, and 
21/10 of 27 September 2012, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights 
should be conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations and international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States 
pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination 
of obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing 
countries and, as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective 
international cooperation is essential in order to provide these countries with the 
appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>&#8727;
 The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report 
</p>
<p>of the Council on its twenty-third session (A/HRC/23/2), chap. I. 
 
</p>

<p> <i>Taking into account</i> the fact that article 2 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant 
undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, 
especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view 
to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by 
all appropriate means, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p> <i>Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, 
friendly relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political 
systems, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that the widening gap between economically developed and 
developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in 
the international community and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, 
according to its capacities, to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the 
process of globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, 
communities and individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of 
several developing countries, particularly least developed and African countries, as well as 
the small and vulnerable economies, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a 
massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental 
consequences for developing countries, in particular the most vulnerable countries 
throughout the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for official 
development assistance, recalling the pledge of industrialized countries to allocate 0.7 per 
cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, and recognizing the 
need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of 
developing countries,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> the fact that the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals and the realization of the right to development call for a more enlightened approach, 
mindset and action based on a sense of community and international solidarity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international 
community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours 
through an increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity,  
</p>
<p> <i>Asserting</i> the necessity of establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership 
and intra-generational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a 
vital component of the efforts made by developing countries to realize the right to 
development of their peoples and to promote the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p> <i>Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their 
responsibilities towards future ones, and that a better world is possible for both present and 
future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of 
State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the fundamental value of solidarity to 
international relations in the twenty-first century in stating that global challenges must be 
managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with the basic </p>


<p>principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer or benefit least deserve 
help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> that international solidarity is not limited to international 
assistance and cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance; it is a broader concept 
and principle that includes sustainability in international relations, especially international 
economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all members of the international 
community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of benefits and burdens; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create conditions that will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the 
past, and to hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their 
development endeavours and for the promotion of conditions conducive to the full 
realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to promote international solidarity 
and cooperation as an important tool to help to overcome the negative effects of the current 
economic, financial and climate crises, particularly in developing countries; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reaffirms</i> the fact that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for 
States, that it should be implemented without any conditionality and on the basis of mutual 
respect, in full compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United 
Nations, in particular respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national 
priorities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also reaffirms</i> that much more is needed owing to the magnitude of global 
and local challenges, the alarming increase in natural and man-made disasters and the 
continuing rises in poverty and inequality; ideally, solidarity should be preventive rather 
than simply reactive to massive irreversible damage already caused, and must address both 
natural and man-made disasters; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recognizes</i> that there is an overwhelming manifestation of solidarity by 
States, individually and collectively, civil society, global social movements and countless 
people of goodwill reaching out to others; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely 
interrelated with the fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development 
within the United Nations human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the 
increasing challenges of international cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity into their activities, and to cooperate with the 
Independent Expert on human rights and international solidarity in her mandate, to supply 
all necessary information requested by her and to give serious consideration to responding 
favourably to her requests to visit their country to enable her to fulfil her mandate 
effectively;

programme of work; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its request</i> to the Independent Expert, in accordance with her work 
plan, to continue to work in the preparation of a draft declaration on the right of peoples 
and individuals to international solidarity and in further developing guidelines, standards, 
norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting this right by addressing, inter 
alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its realization; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to continue consultations with States, and to 
consider holding regional consultations on the issues mentioned in paragraph 14 above, and 
requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist 
the Independent Expert in the organization and holding of those consultations, including
