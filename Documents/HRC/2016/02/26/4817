Accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against 
women: ensuring due diligence in prevention 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming and building upon</i> its resolution 11/2 of 17 June 2009, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> its resolution 7/24 of 28 March 2008 and all resolutions of the 
Commission on Human Rights on the elimination of violence against women, and recalling 
General Assembly resolution 64/137 of 18 December 2009 on the intensification of efforts 
to eliminate all forms of violence against women, and all other resolutions of the Assembly 
and the Commission on the Status of Women relevant to the elimination of all forms of 
violence against women, and Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 
and 1820 (2008) of 19 June 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration 
on the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for 
Action, the Cairo Programme of Action, the outcome of the twenty-third special session of 
the General Assembly entitled &#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for 
the twenty-first century&#8221;, and the declarations adopted at the forty-ninth and fifty-fourth 
sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women, 
</p>
<p><i> Underscoring</i> the fact that the duty of States to exercise due diligence to prevent 
violence against women and girls includes using<b> </b>all appropriate means of a legal, political, 
administrative and social nature that promote the protection of human rights and ensuring 
that acts of violence are considered and treated as illegal acts for which adequate, effective, 
prompt and appropriate punishment and remedies are available,  
</p>
<p> ** The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its fourteenth session (A/HRC/14/37), chap. I. 
</p>

<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that power imbalances and structural inequality between men and 
women are among the root causes of violence against women, and that effective prevention 
of violence against women and girls requires action at all levels of government, the 
engagement of civil society, the involvement of men and boys and the adoption and 
implementation of multifaceted and comprehensive approaches that promote gender 
equality and empowerment of women, and integrate awareness, education, training, 
political will, legislation, accountability, targeted policies and programmes, specific 
measures to reduce vulnerability, data collection and analysis, monitoring and evaluation, 
and protection, support and redress for victims,   
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that violence against women is one of the factors impeding 
progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>further </i>the importance of the full participation of women in the 
development of effective policies and programmes relating to the prevention of violence 
against women,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that confronting and changing the harmful attitudes, customs, 
practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women are 
fundamental to ensuring effective prevention,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that the realization of all human rights by women and girls, such as those 
regarding education, access to health, economic participation, access to the labour market, 
conditions of work, disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political 
participation, access to decision-making processes, inheritance, financial services, including 
loans, nationality and legal capacity, ownership of land, property, housing, social security 
and cultural life, supported by appropriate responses dealing with legal literacy, skills 
training and access to productive resources, is a key factor in preventing violence against 
women and girls, and that, in many instances, the different treatment of women before the 
law has resulted in the lack of equal opportunities for them in these areas, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of 
discrimination and disadvantage, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of 
some women and girls, including women belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, 
refugee and internally displaced women, stateless women, migrant women, women living 
in rural or remote communities, women living in slums and informal settlements, women 
living in conditions of poverty, women in institutions or in detention, women with 
disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in all situations of armed conflict, women 
who face trafficking, sexual or labour exploitation, and women who are otherwise 
discriminated against, including on the basis of their HIV/AIDS status,  
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> that the threat or risk of being exposed to violence may constitute a 
barrier to women and girls realizing their right to education, 
</p>
<p> <i>Alarmed</i> that, in situations of armed conflict, women are particularly exposed to 
various forms of violence, including sexual violence, and recognizing the need to intensify 
efforts to prevent such violence in accordance with international humanitarian law and 
human rights law, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Stresses</i> that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to 
prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and 
girls and provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or 
nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> States to enact and, where necessary, reinforce or amend domestic 
legislation and take measures to enhance the protection of victims, to investigate, prosecute, </p>


<p>punish and redress, including by ensuring access to adequate, effective, prompt and 
appropriate remedies, the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of 
violence, whether in the home, the workplace, the community or society, in custody or in 
situations of armed conflict, to ensure that such legislation conforms with relevant 
international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law, to abolish 
existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against 
women, and to remove gender bias in the administration of justice;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to place a high priority on strengthening and 
implementing legal and policy measures that promote the full enjoyment by women and 
girls of all human rights, particularly those aimed at eliminating discrimination against 
women, promoting gender equality, empowering women and promoting their autonomy, 
including with regard to land, property, marriage and divorce, child custody and 
inheritance, and to promote equal access to literacy, education, skills training and 
employment opportunities, land, credit, agricultural extension, adequate housing, just and 
favourable conditions of work, and business and leadership skills training; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to take all measures to empower women and 
strengthen their economic independence, including through their full participation in the 
development and implementation of socio-economic policies and poverty eradication 
strategies, and through recognition of the value of the unremunerated work by women to 
better protect themselves against violence and, in this regard, to give priority to and to 
promote their access, without discrimination, to education, training, economic opportunity 
and economic advancement; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges </i>States to adopt and implement policies and programmes that enable 
women to avoid and escape situations of violence and prevent its recurrence, and that 
provide, inter alia, financial support and affordable access to safe housing or shelters, 
childcare and other social supports, legal assistance, skills training and productive 
resources, and to make these services accessible to women and girls with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 6 <i>Also urges</i> States to promote, at all levels, environments and communities 
that are safe for women and girls, and to support the efforts of civil society and other 
stakeholders towards this end, including by taking measures designed to enhance personal 
security and reduce the risk of violence in the community, in the home and in the 
workplace, in particular those that eliminate barriers to safe access to schools and other 
educational settings, drinking water sources and sanitation facilities, workplaces and 
livelihoods, and participation in the life of the community; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Further urges</i> States to publicly condemn violence against women and 
provide visible and sustained leadership at the highest levels to prevent all forms of 
violence against women and girls, and, in particular, in efforts to confront the attitudes, 
customs, practices and gender stereotypes that lie at the core of discriminatory and harmful 
acts and practices that are violent towards women, such as female genital mutilation, forced 
and early marriage, femicide, crimes committed in the name of honour and crimes 
committed in the name of passion;   
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> States to support initiatives undertaken by women&#8217;s groups, 
international and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and 
community groups and other relevant civil society actors aimed at promoting gender 
equality and the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls, and raising 
awareness of and preventing violence against women and girls;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges </i>States to devote the resources necessary to ensure effective and 
ongoing outreach, awareness-raising, education, training and engagement with relevant 
stakeholders who have an important role in the prevention and early response to warning 
signs of violence against women and girls, including government officials, community and </p>


<p>religious leaders, and health, education, justice and law enforcement personnel, including 
prison personnel; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> States to integrate gender analysis into policymaking to better 
understand the potential impact of policies on women and their contribution to eliminating 
violence against women and girls; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges</i> Governments to identify and address the effects of all forms of 
discrimination that combine to heighten the vulnerability of women and girls to violence 
and include targeted, compounded and structural discrimination;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Urges</i> States to enhance efforts to involve men and boys in initiatives to 
prevent violence against women and in highlighting the unacceptability of violence against 
women; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Stresses</i> that women should be empowered to protect themselves against 
violence and, in this regard, that women have the right to have control over and decide 
freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and 
reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and urges States to take 
legislative and policy steps in this regard;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Urges</i> States to strengthen initiatives that would increase the capacity of 
women and adolescent girls to protect themselves from HIV infection, including by 
providing HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services, to ensure 
protection from and prevention of stigma and discrimination, and to cooperate with United 
Nations bodies, programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-
governmental organizations in this regard;   
</p>
<p>15. <i>Also urges States</i> to take appropriate legislative and policy steps to 
investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of all forms of rape; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i> Urges</i> States and the United Nations system to give attention to 
and encourages greater international cooperation in systematic research and the collection, 
analysis and dissemination of data, including data disaggregated by sex, age, disability and 
other relevant information on the extent, nature and consequences of violence against 
women and girls, as well as on the impact and effectiveness of policies and programmes 
aimed at combating this violence and, in this context, also urges States and the United 
Nations system to regularly provide information for inclusion in the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
database on violence against women; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Encourages</i> States to implement Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) 
and 1820 (2008); 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Also encourages</i> States to create gender-sensitized training and education 
programmes and other appropriate measures for their armed forces, civilian police, 
peacekeeping units and humanitarian personnel that include instructions on their 
responsibilities towards the civilian population, particularly women and children, as well as 
mechanisms to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent violence against women and full 
accountability in cases of misconduct involving their personnel; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Urges</i> States to establish or strengthen plans of action to eliminate violence 
against women and girls that clearly delineate government accountabilities for prevention 
and are supported by the necessary human, financial and technical resources, including, 
where appropriate, time-bound measurable targets, to promote the protection of women 
against any form of violence, and accelerate the implementation of existing plans of action 
that are regularly monitored and updated by Governments, taking into account inputs by 
civil society, in particular women&#8217;s organizations, networks and other stakeholders;  </p>


<p> 20. <i>Notes with appreciation</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, and takes note of her recent report on 
reparations for women subjected to violence; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Decides</i> to include in the annual full-day discussion on women&#8217;s human 
rights, at its seventeenth session, in consultation with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, the theme of violence against women and 
girls, with an emphasis on prevention, with a view to sharing good practices and identifying 
remaining gaps in the area of prevention, and requests the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare and disseminate a summary of the 
proceedings; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a compilation of 
good practices in efforts aimed at preventing violence against women, in consultation with 
the Special Rapporteur, States, civil society and other relevant stakeholders, and to present 
a report thereon during the annual full-day discussion on women&#8217;s human rights at its 
seventeenth session; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Looks forward</i> to the contribution that the new composite United Nations 
entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women can make to the prevention and 
elimination of violence against women; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of the issue of the elimination of all forms
