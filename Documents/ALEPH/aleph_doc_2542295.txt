1.  Other current assets consist of securities held by Commerce for the
        Commerce Group Corp. Employee Benefit Account, which are stated at a
        cost of $86,650 as of June 30, 2004.  The funds are to be used to pay
        the El Salvadoran employee medical benefits and pension benefits as
        required by the El Salvadoran Government.
The El Salvadoran vacation and Christmas bonus payments are due
        when earned while the severance pay is due and payable at such
        time when the employee has been discharged, retired, permanently
        laid off, dies or when incapable of working due to permanent
        health/work related conditions.  The Company has sole control and
        jurisdiction over this account and to the best of the Company's
        knowledge, there is absolutely no condition, right, or
        requirement by the El Salvadoran authorities to have such funds
        segregated in any form of a reserve.
Also included in other current assets are certain precious stones
        and jewelry stated at cost of $132,448 as of June 30, 2004.

2.  The accounts receivable-related consist of advances to Mineral
        San Sebastian S.A. (Misanse), which is 52% owned by the Company.
        These advances are an offset for the past and future Misanse
        rental charges that are included in the accounts payable.  An
        accounting, as of June 30, 2004, is as follows:
Misanse     Others      Total
                                 -------     ------      -----
        Accounts receivable      $584,011   $ 24,658   $608,669
        Accounts payable         $226,915   $280,499   $507,414
On January 14, 2003, at a Misanse shareholders' meeting held at
       the Company's office, located in the City of San Miguel, El Salvador,
       the shareholders and the Directors approved, confirmed and ratified
       the amount that Misanse owed the Company for advances and other
       obligations the Company incurred on behalf of Misanse.  The
       amount due to Misanse at that time was also approved, ratified
       and confirmed.
The Company is of the opinion, as of June 30, 2004, that it is
       appropriate to record the fact that Misanse owes the Company
       $584,011 and that the Company owes Misanse $226,915 as Misanse  is
       not consolidated with the Company's financial records, because the
       Company does not control the election of the Directors; 60% of the
       directors must be El Salvadoran shareholders. When gold production
       commences, the 5% royalty payable to Misanse for rent of the San
       Sebastian Gold Mine property based on the gross proceeds from the
       sale of gold and the accounts payable offset will reduce this
       receivable until it is paid in full.
3. Mining supplies consist of consumable items used in processing
       gold ore, which are stated at the average cost.
The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated
financial statements.

                              JUNE 30, 2004
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
The financial statements included in this report were reviewed as required
under Section 102 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by an independent public
accounting firm that is registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB).  The purpose for filing this SEC Form 10-Q/A is
because the Company's previous independent public accountant was not
registered with the PCAOB prior to October 22, 2003.  Reference is made to
the Company's Form 8-Ks filed on January 21,2005 and May 6, 2005.
THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------
(1)  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
- --------------------------
Commerce Group Corp. ("Commerce," the "Company" and/or "Registrant")
and its 82 1/2%-owned subsidiary, San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc.
("Sanseb")  both United States corporations, have formed the
Commerce/Sanseb Joint Venture ("Joint Venture") for the purpose of
performing gold mining, the sale of gold, and related activities,
including, but not limited to, exploration, exploitation, development,
extraction and processing of precious metals in the Republic of El
Salvador, Central America.   Gold bullion, currently the Joint
Venture's principal product, was produced (but not on a full
production basis) in El Salvador and refined and sold in the United
States.  Expansion of exploration is a goal at the San Sebastian Gold
Mine ("SSGM") which is located near the city of Santa Rosa de Lima.
Expanded exploration is being curtailed at other mining projects until
adequate funding is obtained under acceptable terms and conditions.
All of the mining projects are located in the Republic of El Salvador,
Central America.
On March 3, 2003, the Company received an exploration license from the
Government of El Salvador (GOES) dated February 24, 2003, for the
exploration of minerals in an area encompassing the SSGM, consisting
of 42 square kilometers, which is hereafter referred to as the "New
SSGM Exploration Concession/License" or the "New SSGM."  This expanded
area provides the Company with an opportunity to increase its gold and
silver ore reserves.  Included in this area are three formerly-
operated gold and silver mines:  the La Lola Mine, the Santa Lucia
Mine and the Tabanco Mine.
As of March 31, 2000, the Joint Venture had temporarily suspended the
San Cristobal Mill and Plant  ("SCMP") operations (operations ceased
on December 31, 1999) until such time as it has adequate funds to
retrofit, rehabilitate, restore and expand these facilities and until
there is certainty that the price of gold will be stabilized at the
current or a higher selling price.

COMMERCE GROUP CORP., ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND THE JOINT VENTURE
   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                             JUNE 30, 2004
The Company continues to be cognizant of its cash needs until such
time as it is able to produce adequate profits from its SSGM gold
production.  It will continue to attempt to obtain sufficient funds to
assist the Joint Venture in placing the SSGM into production as the
anticipated profits from the existing SCMP operation (unless
accumulated over a period of time) appear insufficient to meet the
SSGM capital and the other mining exploration requirements.  In order
to continue to follow its goal to conduct the Joint Venture's
exploration, exploitation, development expansion programs, and the
production of gold from the SSGM open-pit, heap-leaching operation, it
is necessary for the Company to obtain funds from other sources.  The
Company may have to borrow funds by issuing open-ended, secured, on-
demand or unsecured promissory notes, by selling its shares to its
directors, officers and other interested accredited investors, or by
entering into a joint venture, merging, or developing an acceptable
form of a business combination with other companies.
The Company's directors and officers, with the aid of investment
bankers and finders, are aggressively seeking a compatible financial
or business arrangement.  The verbal and written proposals or
arrangements received were not acceptable by the Company primarily due
to the terms and conditions.
The Joint Venture plans to begin its open-pit, heap-leaching process
on the SSGM site when adequate funding becomes available, and if the
price of gold maintains the current price level.  It also plans to
continue its SSGM site preparation, the expansion of its exploration
and exploitation targets, and the enlargement and development of its
gold ore reserves.  Furthermore, it plans to explore the potential of
other gold mine exploration prospects in El Salvador.  Concurrently,
it is in the process of obtaining necessary funding for each of these
separate programs while its Joint Venture is performing minor retrofit
and rehabilitation work at the SCMP.  It commenced an exploration
program on the New SSGM.
During interim periods, Commerce Group Corp. and its subsidiaries
(collectively "Commerce," the "Company" and/or "Registrant") follow the
accounting policies set forth in Commerce's Annual Report to Shareholders
and in Commerce's Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, except as modified for appropriate interim financial
statement presentation.  These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto which are
included in Commerce's Annual Report filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Form 10-K/A for its fiscal year ended March 31,
2004.  These interim results are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be achieved in the future.

(2)  MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
- -----------------------------------------
Certain amounts included in or affecting the Company's financial
statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring that
certain assumptions be made with respect to values or conditions which
cannot be made with certainty at the time the financial statements are
prepared.  Therefore, the reported amounts of the Company's assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and associated disclosures with
respect to contingent assets and obligations may be affected by
these estimates.  The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing
basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts, and
other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances.
Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from the Company's
estimates.
(3)  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS
The Joint Venture and the following subsidiaries are all majority-owned
by the Company and are included in the consolidated financial statements
of the Company.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.  The Company does not have corporate control of
Misanse as the majority of Misanse's elected directors are El Salvadoran
shareholders.

MINORITY INTEREST
During the periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, there were no material
expenses in the entities wherein minority interests existed.  Minority
interest as a whole is immaterial in these financial statements and therefore
has not been presented.

OTHER CURRENT ASSETS
Other current assets consist of securities held as nominee for the
Commerce Group Corp. Employee Benefit Account, and are stated at cost.
Other current assets also include certain precious stones and jewelry
also stated at cost.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - RELATED
The accounts receivable-related consist of advances to Misanse, a 52%-owned
subsidiary, which will be offset for the Misanse future rental
charges and by the amount in the accounts payable-related account.
INTERCOMPANY BALANCES
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements.
MINING SUPPLIES
Mining supplies consist of consumable supplies used in connection with
processing ore, and are stated at cost, which is believed to be lower
than the market value.
DEFERRED MINING COSTS
The Company, in order to avoid expense and revenue unbalance, capitalizes
all costs directly associated with acquisition, exploration and
development of specific properties, until these properties are put into
operation, sold or are abandoned.  Gains or losses resulting from the
sale or abandonment of mining properties will be included in operations.
The Joint Venture capitalizes its costs and expenses and will write off
these cumulative costs on a units of production method at such time as it
begins producing gold derived from the gold ore on a full production
basis.  If the prospect of gold production, due to different conditions
and circumstances becomes unlikely, all of these costs may be written off
in the year that this occurs.
The Company regularly evaluates its carrying value of exploration
properties in light of their potential for economic mineralization and
the likelihood of continued work by either the Company or a joint venture
partner.  The Company may, from time to time, reduce its carrying value
to an amount that approximates fair market value based upon an assessment
of such criteria.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from the sale of gold will be recognized when delivery has
occurred, title and risk of loss passes to the buyer, and collectability
is reasonably assured.  Gold sales will be made in accordance with sales
contracts where the price is fixed or determinable.

                              JUNE 30, 2004
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant, and equipment is stated at the lower of cost or
estimated net realizable value.  Mining properties, development costs and
plant and equipment will be depreciated when full production takes place
using the units of production method based upon proven and probable
reserves.  Until the Company suspended its mining operations, the assets
were depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives ranging from three to ten years.  Depreciation and amortization
expenses include the amortization of assets acquired, if any, under
capital leases.  Replacements  and major improvements are capitalized.
When in operation, maintenance and repairs will be charged to expense
based on average estimated equipment usage.  Interest costs incurred
while in a standby position or in the construction or acquisition of
property, plant, and equipment are capitalized and amortized over the
useful lives of the related assets.  Since the Company suspended its gold
processing operations effective March 31, 2000, it also ceased to
depreciate its fixed assets.
MINERAL EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Significant property acquisition payments for active exploration
properties are capitalized.  If no minable ore body is discovered,
previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period the property is
abandoned.  Expenditures for the development of new mines, to define
further mineralization at and adjacent to existing ore bodies, and to
expand the capacity of operating mines, are capitalized and amortized on
the units of production basis over proven and probable reserves.
Management's estimates of gold and other metal prices, recoverable proven and
probable reserves, operating, capital, and reclamation costs are subject to
certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of the
Company's investment in property, plant, and equipment.  Although management
has made its best estimate for these factors based on current conditions, it
is reasonably possible that changes could occur in the near-term which could
adversely affect management's estimate of the net cash flows expected to be
generated from its mining properties.

                             JUNE 30, 2004
IMPAIRMENTS
The Company evaluates the carrying value of its properties and equipment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the properties or
equipment may be impaired and then at that time it plans to apply the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS
121), Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.  Estimated future net cash flows, on
an undiscounted basis, from each property are calculated using estimated
recoverable ounces of gold (considering current proven and probable
reserves and mineral resources expected to be converted into mineral
reserves.  The inclusion of mineral resources is based on various
circumstances, including but not limited to, the existence and nature of
known mineralization, location of the property, results of drilling; and
analysis to demonstrate the ore is commercially recoverable), estimated
future gold price realization (considering historical and current prices,
price trends and related factors); and operating, capital and site
restoration costs.  Reduction in the carrying value of property, plant
and equipment, with a corresponding charge to income, are recorded to the
extent that the estimated future net cash flows are less than the
carrying value.
INTEREST CAPITALIZATION
Interest costs are capitalized as part of the historical cost of
facilities and equipment, if material.
INCOME TAXES
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with its
subsidiaries (See Note 11).  The Joint Venture files a U.S. partnership
return.
EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE
The Company has in the past years reported its "Earnings per Share" (EPS)
which presently complies with the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128 (SFAS No. 128).  As required by this
standard, the Company, if applicable, could report two earnings per share
amounts, basic net income and diluted net income per share.  Basic net
income per share is computed by dividing income or loss reportable to
common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding (the denominator).  The computation of diluted
net income or loss per share is similar to the computation of basic net
income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the
dilutive effect of the additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if all convertible securities, stock options, rights, share
loans etc. had been converted to common shares.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                             JUNE 30, 2004
However, the computation of diluted EPS shall not assume conversion,
exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an
antidilutive effect on earnings per share.  Shares issued on actual
conversion, exercise, or satisfaction of certain conditions for which the
underlying potential common shares were antidilutive shall be included in
the computation as outstanding common shares from the date of conversion,
exercise, or satisfaction of those conditions, respectively.  Therefore,
at this time, there is no difference in the losses, earnings or the
number of basic or diluted shares.
The computation of earnings per share of common stock is based on the
weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the
financial statements.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
The Company conducts the majority of its operations in the Republic of El
Salvador, Central America. Currently, El Salvador is on the U.S. dollar
system and therefore all receipts and expenditures since January 1, 2001
are in U.S. dollars.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform
to the current year presentations. The Company changed the amounts
classified as general & administrative expense from amounts previously
recorded as mining resources.
(4)  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
- -----------------------------
The Company became subject to the accounting and reporting requirements
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143).  SFAS No. 143 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs.  SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period

                              JUNE 30, 2004
in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made.  Fair value is determined by estimating the retirement obligations
in the period an asset is first placed in service and then adjusting the
amount for estimated inflation and market risk contingencies to the
projected settlement date of the liability.  The result is then
discounted to a present value from the projected settlement date to the
date the asset was first placed in service.  The present value of the
asset retirement obligation is recorded as an additional property cost
and as an asset retirement liability.  The amortization of the additional
property cost (using the units of production method) will be included in
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the accretion of the
discounted liability will be recorded as a separate operating expense,
when applicable, in the Company's Statement of Operations.  At this time,
the Company believes that there is no financial impact.
In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 "Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS
No. 149") to provide, amend and clarify financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities.  The
changes in this statement improve financial reporting by requiring that
contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly to
achieve more consistent reporting of contracts as either derivative or
hybrid instruments.  SFAS No. 149 has been adopted by the Company and
will be applied prospectively for contracts, if any, entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003.  The adoption of this statement, as of this
date, has not had a material effect on Commerce's consolidated financial
position or results of operations as the Company has not entered into any
transactions of this type.
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150 "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity" ("SFAS No. 150") which clarifies the classification as
liabilities for certain financial instruments including equity shares
that are mandatorily redeemable, or a financial instrument other than
equity shares that has an obligation to repurchase the instrument with
equity shares, including a conditional obligation to settle the financial
instrument with equity shares.  SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial
instruments entered into after May 31, 2003.  The adoption of this
statement has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated
financial position or results of operations.
The Emerging Issues Task Force is in the process of forming a committee
to evaluate certain mining industry accounting issues, including issues
arising from the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
to business combinations within the mining industry and accounting for
goodwill and other intangibles.  Although such committee has not yet been
formed, and no formal agenda has been set, the issues related to the
business combinations within the mining industry and accounting for
goodwill and other intangibles may be addressed along with the related
question of whether mineral interests conveyed by leases and/or
concessions represent tangible or intangible assets and the amortization
of such assets.  While the Company believes that its accounting for its
mineral interests conveyed by leases and/or concessions is in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company cannot predict
whether the deliberations of this committee will ultimately modify or
otherwise result in new accounting standards or interpretations thereof
that differ from its current practices.

Vehicles, office, mining and laboratory equipment, buildings, etc. are
stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives of three to ten years.  Maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred.  Since the Joint Venture suspended
operations effective March 31, 2000 in view of the weak price of gold and
the need to expand and rehabilitate production facilities, no
depreciation has been recorded.  The Company is maintaining the property
and the equipment and will begin to depreciate these assets once its
operation commences.
(6) COMMERCE/SANSEB JOINT VENTURE ("JOINT VENTURE")
- ---------------------------------------------------
The Company is in a joint venture with and owns 82 1/2% of the total
common stock (2,002,037 shares) of Sanseb, a U.S. State of Nevada
chartered (1968) corporation.  The balance of Sanseb's stock is held by
approximately 180 non-related shareholders, including the President of
the Company who owns 2,073 common shares.  Sanseb was formed in 1968 to
explore, exploit, research, and develop adequate gold reserves.  Sanseb
produced gold from the SSGM from 1972 through February 1978.
On September 22, 1987, the Company and Sanseb entered into a joint
venture agreement to formalize their relationship with respect to the
mining venture and to account for the Company's substantial investment in
Sanseb.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is authorized to
supervise and control all of the business affairs of the Joint Venture
and has the authority to do all that is necessary to resume mining
operations at the SSGM on behalf of the Joint Venture.  The net pre-tax
profits of the Joint Venture will be distributed as follows:  Company
90%; and Sanseb 10%.  Since the Company owns 82 1/2% of the authorized
and issued shares of Sanseb, the Company in effect has over a 98%
interest in the Joint Venture activities.

SSGM ACTIVITY
The Company had no significant activity at the SSGM site from February
1978 through January 1987 due to the civil unrest in El Salvador.  The
present status is that, the Company, since January 1987, and thereafter,
the Joint Venture, since September 1987, have completed certain of the
required mining pre-production preliminary stages in the minable and
proven gold ore reserve area, and the Company is active in attempting to
obtain adequate financing for the proposed open-pit, heap-leaching
operations at the SSGM.  The Joint Venture plans to resume its

exploration and expansion program to develop additional gold ore reserves
in the area surrounding the minable gold ore reserves.  Presently, it is
completing the erection of its cone crushing system and performing minor
rehabilitation repairs to its San Cristobal Mill and Plant.  On February
24,  2003, the Ministry of Economy's Director of El Salvador Department
of Hydrocarbons and Mines (DHM) granted an exploration concession
referred to as the "New SSGM" which area includes and encompasses the
existing SSGM.  Reference is made to Mineral San Sebastian S.A. de C.V.
(c) for information on the exploitation and a second exploration
concession.  Presently the Company is in the process of exploring three
of the formerly operated gold mines.
MINERAL SAN SEBASTIAN S.A. DE C.V. ("MISANSE")
(a)  MISANSE CORPORATE STRUCTURE
The SSGM real estate is owned by and leased to the Joint Venture by
Misanse, a Salvadoran-chartered corporation.  The Company owns 52% of the
total of  Misanse's issued and outstanding shares.  The balance is owned
by approximately 100 El Salvador, Central American, and United States'
citizens.
(b)  SSGM MINING LEASE
On January 14, 2003, the Company entered into an amended and renewed
30-year lease agreement with Mineral San Sebastian Sociedad Anomina de
Capital Variable (Misanse) pursuant to the approval of the Misanse
shareholders and Misanse directors at a meeting held on January 12, 2003.
The renewed lease is for a period of thirty (30) years commencing on the
date that the Company received its Renewed San Sebastian Gold Mine
Exploitation Concession/License, hereinafter identified as the "Renewed
SSGM," from the DHM.  The lease is automatically extendible for one or
more equal periods.  The Company will pay to Misanse for the rental of
this real estate the sum of five percent of the net sales of the gold and
silver produced from this real estate, however, the payment will not be
less than $343.00 per month.  The Company has the right to assign this
lease without prior notice or permission from Misanse.  This lease is
pledged as collateral for loans made to related parties (Note 9).
(c)  THREE CONCESSIONS:
     ONE EXPLOITATION AND TWO EXPLORATION MINERAL CONCESSIONS/LICENSES
RENEWED SAN SEBASTIAN GOLD MINE EXPLOITATION CONCESSION/LICENSE UNDER EL
SALVADOR AGREEMENT NUMBER 591 DATED MAY 20, 2004 AND DELIVERED ON JUNE 4,
2004 (RENEWED SSGM) - APPROXIMATELY 1.2306 SQUARE KILOMETERS (304 ACRES)
LOCATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LA UNION, EL SALVADOR, CENTRAL AMERICA
On September 6, 2002, at a meeting held with the El Salvadoran Minister
of Economy and the DHM, it was agreed to submit an application for the
Renewed SSGM for a 30-year term and to  simultaneously cancel the
concession obtained on July 23, 1987.  On September 26, 2002, the Company
filed this application.  On February 28, 2003 (received March 3, 2003)
the DHM admitted to the receipt of the application and the Company

proceeded to file public notices as required by Article 40 of the El
Salvadoran Mining Law and its Reform (MLIR).  On April 16, 2003, the
Company's El Salvadoran legal counsel filed with the DHM notice that it
believed that it complied with the requirements of Article 40, and that
there were no objections; and requested that the DHM make its inspection
as required by MLIR Article 42.  An inspection by the DHM was made. The
Company then provided a bond which was required by the DHM to protect
third parties against any damage caused from the mining operations, and
it simultaneously paid the annual surface tax.  On August 29, 2003 the
Office of the Ministry of Economy formally presented the Company with a
twenty-year Renewed SSGM which was dated August 18, 2003.  On May 20,
2004 (delivered June 4, 2004) the Government of El Salvador under this
Agreement Number 591 extended the exploitation concession for a period of
thirty (30) years.  This Renewed SSGM replaces the collateral that the
same parties held with the previous concession.
NEW SSGM EXPLORATION CONCESSION/LICENSE UNDER EL SALVADOR RESOLUTION
NUMBER 27 (New SSGM) - APPROXIMATELY 40.7694 SQUARE KILOMETERS (10,070
ACRES) LOCATED IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF LA UNION AND MORAZAN, EL SALVADOR,
CENTRAL AMERICA
On October 20, 2002, the Company applied to the Government of El Salvador
through the DHM for the New SSGM, which covers an area of 42 square
kilometers and includes approximately 1.2306 square kilometers of the
Renewed SSGM.  The New SSGM is in the jurisdiction of the City of Santa
Rosa de Lima in the Department of La Union and in the Nueva Esparta in
the Department of Morazan, Republic of El Salvador, Central America.  On
February 24, 2003, the DHM issued the New SSGM for a period of four years
starting from the date following the notification of this resolution
which was received on March 3, 2003.  The New SSGM may be extended for
two two-year periods, or for a total of eight years.  Besides the San
Sebastian Gold Mine, the following three other formerly operative gold
and silver mines included in the New SSGM are being explored: the La Lola
Mine, the Santa Lucia Mine, and the Tabanco Mine.
NUEVA ESPARTA EXPLORATION CONCESSION/LICENSE (NUEVA ESPARTA) - 45 SQUARE
KILOMETERS (11,115 ACRES)
On or about October 20, 2002, the Company filed an application with the
Government of El Salvador through the DHM for the Nueva Esparta, which
consists of 45 square kilometers north and adjacent to the New SSGM.
This rectangular area is in the Departments of La Union (east) and
Morazan (west) and in the jurisdiction of the City of Santa Rosa de Lima,
El Salvador, Central America.  On May 25, 2004 (received June 4, 2004)
the Government of El Salvador under Resolution Number 271 issued the
exploration concession for a period of four years with a right to request
an additional four year extension.  An important observation is that
these mines form a belt of mineralization following a fault line from the
SSGM to the Montemayor Mine for a distance of approximately five miles.
Included in the Nueva Esparta are eight other formerly operated gold and
silver mines known as:  the Grande Mine, the Las Pinas Mine, the Oro
Mine, the Montemayor Mine, the Banadero Mine, the Carrizal Mine, the La
Joya Mine and the Copetillo Mine.

El SALVADOR MINERAL PRODUCTION FEES
As of July 2001, a series of revisions to the El Salvador Mining Law
offer to make exploitation more attractive.  The principal change is that
the fee has been reduced to two percent of the gross gold and silver
receipts.  The Company believes that it is in compliance with the new law,
and plans to file applications for all of the mining concessions in which
it has an interest.
SCMP LAND AND BUILDING LEASE
On November 12, 1993, the Joint Venture entered into an agreement with
Corporacion Salvadorena de Inversiones ("Corsain"), an El Salvadoran
governmental agency, to lease for a period of ten years, approximately
166 acres of land and buildings on which its gold processing mill, plant
and related equipment (the SCMP) are located, and which is approximately
15 miles west of the SSGM site.  The basic annual lease payment was U.S.
$11,500, payable annually in advance, unless otherwise amended, and
subject to an annual increase based on the annual United States'
inflation rate.  As agreed, a security deposit of U.S. $11,500 was paid
on the same date and this deposit was subject to increases based on any
United States' inflationary rate adjustments.
On April 26, 2004, a three-year lease, which includes an automatic
additional three-year extension subject to Corsain's review, was executed
by and between Corsain and the Company.  This lease is retroactive to
November 12, 2003 and the monthly lease payments are $1,418.51 plus the
El Salvadoran added value tax.  The lease is subject to an annual
increase based on the U.S. annual inflationary rate adjustments.  The
SCMP is strategically located to process ore from other mining projects.
MODESTO MINE - REAL ESTATE
The Company owns 63 acres of land which are a key part of the Modesto
Mine that is located near the city of El Paisnal, El Salvador.  This real
estate is subject to a mortgage and promissory note and is pledged as
collateral to certain parties described in Note 9.
SAN FELIPE-EL POTOSI MINE ("POTOSI") - REAL ESTATE LEASE AGREEMENT
The Joint Venture entered into a lease agreement with the San Felipe-El
Potosi Cooperative ("Cooperative") of the city of Potosi, El Salvador on
July 6, 1993, to lease the real estate encompassing the San Felipe-El
Potosi Mine consisting of 675 acres based on a royalty payment for a
period of 30 years and with an option to renew the lease for an
additional 25 years, for the purpose of mining and extracting minerals.
MONTEMAYOR MINE - LEASE AGREEMENT
The Joint Venture has leased approximately 175 acres of land that it
considers to be the key mining property.  The terms of the various leases
are one year with automatic renewal rights.  This property is located 14
miles northwest of the SCMP, six miles northwest of the SSGM, and about
two miles east of the city of San Francisco Gotera in the Department of
Morazan, El Salvador.

(9)  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
- -------------------------------
The Company, in an attempt to preserve cash, had prevailed on its
President to accrue his salary for the past 24 years and three months,
including vacation pay, for a total of $2,856,515 and $2,677,765 at June
30, 2004 and 2003 respectively.
In addition, with the consent and approval of the Directors, the
President of the Company, as an individual and not as a Director or
Officer of the Company, entered into the following financial transactions
with the Company, the status of which is reflected as follows:
The amount of cash funds which the Company has borrowed from its President
from time to time, together with accrued interest, amounts to $6,866,170 and
$5,790,875 at June 30, 2004 and 2003 respectively.  To evidence this debt,
the Company has issued to its President a series of  open-ended, secured,
on-demand promissory notes, with interest payable monthly at the prime
rate plus two percent, but not less than 16% per annum.
The Company had borrowed an aggregate of $952,577 and $858,210 at June 30,
2004 and 2003 respectively, including accrued interest, from the Company's

are evidenced by the Company's open-ended, secured, on-demand promissory note,
with interest payable monthly at the prime rate plus four percent per annum,
but not less than 16% per annum.
In order to satisfy the Company's cash requirements from time to time,
the Company's President has sold or pledged as collateral for loans,
shares of the Company's common stock owned by him.  In order to
compensate its President for selling or pledging his shares on behalf of
the Company, the Company has made a practice of issuing him the number of
restricted shares of common stock equivalent to the number of shares sold
or pledged, plus an additional number of shares equivalent to the amount
of accrued interest calculated at the prime rate plus three percent  per
annum and payable monthly.  The Company receives all of the net cash
proceeds from the sale or from the pledge of these shares.  The Company
did not borrow any common shares during this fiscal period.  The share
loans, if any, are all in accordance with the terms and conditions of
Director-approved, open-ended loan agreements dated June 20, 1988,
October 14, 1988, May 17, 1989, and April 1, 1990.

consent of the Board of Directors, compensation in the form of a bonus in
the amount of two percent of the pre-tax profits realized by the Company
from its gold mining operations in El Salvador, payable annually over a
period of twenty years commencing on the first day of the month following
the month in which gold production commences.
The President, as an individual, and not as a Director or Officer of the
Company, presently owns a total of 467 Misanse common shares.  There are
a total of 2,600 Misanse shares issued and outstanding.

    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                              JUNE 30, 2004
The Directors, by their agreement, have deferred cash payment of their
Director fees beginning on January 1, 1981, until such time as the
Company's operations are profitable.   Effective from October 1, 1996,
the Director fees are $1,200 for each quarterly meeting and $400 for
attendance at any other Directors' meeting.  The Executive Committee
Director fees are $400 for each meeting.  The Directors and Officers have
an option to receive cash at such time as the Company has profits and an
adequate cash flow, or to exchange the amount due to them for the
Company's common shares.  As of June 30, 2004, the Company owes $4,400
for Director fees and $61,863 for the accrued Officers'/employee
compensation (President excluded).
The Company advances funds, allocates expenses, and charges for
disbursements made to the Joint Venture.  The Joint Venture in turn
capitalizes all of these advances, allocations, expenses, and
disbursements.
The Company has adopted a policy to maintain a separate accounting of the
amount due to it from Sanseb and the Joint Venture.  This independent
accounting will be maintained by the Company to reflect its investment
and the amount due to it.  This record will become the official document
for future Joint Venture cash distributions.  All of the advances and
interest earned will be paid to the Company before the distribution to
others of any of the Joint Venture's profits or cash flow.
The Company maintains a separate accounting for the funds or credits
advanced to the Joint Venture and for the interest charged which is at
the prime rate quoted on the first business day of each month plus four
percent and said interest is payable monthly.  These advances, together
with interest, are to be paid to the Company prior to the distribution of
any of the Joint Venture profits, and are reflected as follows:

(11)  INCOME TAXES
- -----------------
At March 31, 2003, the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding the Joint
Venture, have estimated net operating losses remaining in a sum of
approximately $5,063,150 which may be carried forward to offset future
taxable income; the net operating losses expire at various times to the
year of 2018.
Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the
financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes.
Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets
are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss, tax
credit carry-forwards, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable
temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences between the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of
enactment.

There were no options issued to any Director, Officer, or employee.
d.  STOCK RIGHTS - TO THE PRESIDENT
Reference is made to Note 9, Related Party Transactions, of the Company's
financial statements which disclose the terms and conditions of the share
loans to the Company by the President and the interest which is payable
to him by the Company's issuance of its restricted common shares.
Any share interest payable to the President is for shares loaned to the
Company and/or for such shares loaned or pledged for collateral purposes,
or for unpaid interest, from time to time, all in accordance with the
terms and conditions of Director-approved, open-ended loan agreements
dated June 20, 1988, October 14, 1988, May 17, 1989 and April 1, 1990.
e.  SHARE LOANS - OTHERS
In the past, a series of borrowings of the Company's common shares were
made from time to time under the provision that the owners would sell
said shares as the Company's designee, with the proceeds payable to the
Company.  In exchange, the Company agreed to pay these shares loaned
within 31 days or less by issuing its restricted common shares, together
with interest payable in restricted common shares payable at a negotiated
rate of interest normally payable in advance for a period of one year.
As of June 30, 2004, there were no shares due to other parties for shares
borrowed or due for interest payment.
f.  S.E.C. FORM S-8 REGISTRATION
On June 10, 2002, the Company filed its fifth Securities and Exchange
Commission Form S-8 Registration Statement No. 333-90122 under the
Securities Act of 1933, and it registered 1,500,000 of the Company's
$0.10 par value common shares for the purpose of distributing shares
pursuant to the plan contained in such registration.  From the 1,500,000
shares registered  704,959 shares were issued, and 795,041 shares remain
to be issued as of June 30, 2004.
g.  COMMERCE GROUP CORP. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ACCOUNT (CGCEBA)
This account was established for the purpose of compensating the
Company's employees for benefits such as retirement, severance pay, and
all other related compensation that is mandatory under El Salvadoran
labor regulations, and/or as determined by the Officers of the
Corporation.  The Directors provided the Officers of the Company with the
authority to issue its common shares to the CGCEBA on an as needed basis.
Under this plan, payment can be made to any employee of the Company or
the Company's subsidiaries.  The CGCEBA has sold some of the shares
issued to this account from time to time to meet its obligations to its
El Salvadoran employees.  As of June 30, 2004, 385,000 shares remained in
the account.

                              JUNE 30, 2004
(13)  CERTAIN CONCENTRATIONS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
- --------------------------------------------------------------
The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk in connection
with maintaining its cash primarily in two financial institutions for the
amounts in excess of levels.  One is insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.  The other is an El Salvadoran banking institution
which the Company uses to pay its El Salvadoran expenses and obligations.
The Company considers the U.S. institution to be financially strong and
does not consider the underlying risk at this time with its El Salvadoran
bank to be significant.  To date, these concentrations of credit risk
have not had a significant effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.
The Company is not subject to credit risk in connection with any hedging
activities as it has not hedged any of its gold production.  If the
Company changes its policies, then it will only use highly-rated credit
worthy counterparties, therefore it should not anticipate
non-performance.
(14) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- ----------------------------------
Environmental Compliance
Based upon current knowledge, the Company believes that it is in
compliance with the U.S. and El Salvadoran environmental laws and
regulations as currently promulgated.  However, the exact nature of
environmental control problems, if any, which the Company may encounter
in the future cannot be predicted, primarily because of the increasing
number, complexity and changing character of environmental requirements
that may be enacted or of the standards being promulgated by governmental
authorities.
Environmental Guarantees
In connection with the issuance of environmental permits, the Company has
provided the Government of El Salvador with the following guarantees on
September 27, 2002:  three-year guarantees were issued by the Banco
Agricola, S.C. on behalf of the Company to the Ministry of Environment
and Natural Resources; Guarantee No. 1901-0000059-8 was issued for the
San Cristobal Mill and Plant in the sum of $771.49; and Guarantee No.
1901-0000058-7 was issued for the Renewed SSGM Exploitation
Concession/License in the sum of $14,428.68.
In connection with the Renewed SSGM Exploitation Concession/License, on
July 15, 2003 a one-year, third party liability guarantee (bond) in the
sum of $42,857.14 was issued by Compania Anglo Salvadorena de Seguros,
S.A. (Anglosal) on behalf of the Company to the  Ministry of Economy's
Office of the Department of Hydrocarbons and Mines.  The Company pledged
its SSGM laboratory real estate as collateral to Anglosal for the
issuance of the bond.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                              JUNE 30, 2004
The El Salvadoran Environmental Law, Decree No. 233, 1998 and the General
Regulation of the Environmental Law specify the following:
- - An environmental permit from the Ministry of Environment and Natural
  Resources (MARN) based on the approval of an Environmental Impact
  Assessment, is required for exploration, exploitation and industrial
  processing of minerals and fossil fuels;
- - The environmental permit requires the company to implement prevention,
  minimization or compensation measures established in the environmental
  management program, which is a component of the Environmental Impact
  Assessment;
- - A financial security (bond) is required that covers the total cost of
  the facilities or investment required to comply with the environmental
  management plans included in the Environmental Impact Assessment.
Numeric standards for ambient air quality; emissions from fixed sources;
maximum environmental noise levels; water quality and effluent limits are
specified in various norms and regulation, including the Special
Regulation of Technical Norms for Environmental Quality Decree No. 40,
and the Special Regulations of Wastewater Decree No. 39.
The El Salvadoran Department of Hydrocarbons and Mines (DHM) requires
environmental permits to be issued in connection with the application of
the Renewed SSGM.  The issuance of these permits is under the
jurisdiction of the El Salvador Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources Office (MARN).  On October 15, 2002, MARN issued an
environmental permit under Resolution 474-2002 for the SCMP.  On October
20, 2002, MARN issued an environmental permit under Resolution 493-2002
for the Renewed SSGM Exploitation area.
Lease Commitments
The month-to-month lease of its offices is described in note (9) Related
Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The lease of the SCMP and other mining leases are described in note (6)
Commerce/Sanseb Joint Venture ("Joint Venture") and in note (7) Synopsis
of Real Estate Ownership and Leases of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Confirmation Agreements
The Company, with Directors' approval, as of the end of each fiscal year,
enters into confirmation agreements with Edward L. Machulak as an
individual, and not as a Director or Officer of the Company, the Edward
L. Machulak Rollover Individual Retirement Account, General Lumber &
Supply Co., Inc., and Sylvia Machulak as an individual and for the Sylvia
Machulak Rollover Individual Retirement Account, to acknowledge the
amount due, the collateral pledged, and other pertinent facts and
understandings between the parties.  These agreements are filed annually
as exhibits to the SEC Form 10-K.

(15) BUSINESS SEGMENTS
- ----------------------
The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131),
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.
SFAS 131 establishes standards for the way that public business
enterprises determine operating segments and report information about
those segments in annual financial statements.  SFAS 131 also requires
those enterprises to report selected information about operating segments
in interim financial reports issued to shareholders.  SFAS 131 further
establishes standards for related disclosure about products and services,
geographic areas, and major customers.
The Company presently has two reportable segments:  mining and other.
The mining segment was engaged in the exploration and production of
precious metals.  The mining processing is temporarily suspended.  The
other segments are those activities that are combined for reporting
purposes.  There were no reportable activities in the Internet business;
no income and no expenses were recorded.  Reference is made to other
sections in the annual financial statements for details.
The following is a tabulation of unaudited quarterly operating results
for 2004 and 2003:

(16)  UNCERTAINTIES
- -------------------
The Company has experienced recurring operating losses since the gold
extraction operations have been placed on a hold status. The Company has had
no  revenues during this phase and is therefore dependent upon raising capital
to continue operations. Since the Company has suspended gold production
operations as of March 31, 2000, the Company and its shareholders and officers
have been able to provide the capital necessary to continue the operations of
the Company and the maintenance of the mine and related equipment.   However,
there is no guarantee that the Company can continue to provide required
capital  to keep the Company's assets maintained.  If the Company was unable
to raise sufficient funds, the Company would be unable to pay the employees
maintaining its mining equipment in El Salvador, which could result in loss of
assets or impairment thereof. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Management believes it has sufficient reserves through loans from its
principal officer and through interested accredited investors to continue
operations for the coming year. Management is also entertaining joint
venture opportunities, and other financing in order to generate
sufficient capital to begin the open pit heap leaching operation at the
San Sebastian Gold Mine or to process gold at its San Cristobal Mill and
Plant.
(17)  UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- ------------------------------------
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company,
without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  The financial information included herein is
unaudited; however, the Company believes that the information reflects
all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to be a fair presentation of
the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the
interim periods.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The Company believes that the
disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading.  It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements
be read in connection with the financial statements and the notes thereto
included in the Company's latest annual report and  the filing of the
required Securities and Exchange Commission annual Form 10-K/A.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
The financial statements included in this report were reviewed as required
under Section 102 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by an independent public
accounting firm that is registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB).  The purpose for filing this SEC Form 10-Q/A is
because the Company's previous independent public accountant was not
registered with the PCAOB prior to October 22, 2003.  Reference is made to the
Company's Form 8-Ks filed on January 21, 2005 and May 6, 2005.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
The matters discussed in this report on Form 10-Q/A, when not historical
matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from projected results.  Such factors include, among others, the
speculative nature of mineral exploration, gold and silver prices,
production and reserve estimates, litigation, environmental and
government regulations, general economic conditions, conditions in the
financial markets, political and competitive developments in domestic and
foreign areas in which the Company operates, availability of financing,
force majeure events, technological and operational difficulties
encountered in connection with the Company's mining activities, labor
relations, other risk factors as described from time to time in the
Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other
matters discussed under this reporting category.  Many of these factors
are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict.  The Company
disclaims any intent or obligation to update its forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of receiving new information, the
occurrence of future events, or otherwise.  Should one or more of those
risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumption
prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from
those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected or
intended.
Management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") of the financial condition
and results of operations of  the Company should be read in conjunction

                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
Overview
- --------
The Company is in the precious metals exploration, exploitation,
development, production business with at least four formerly operated mines
that are located in the Republic of El Salvador, Central America.  The
Company's objective is to increase shareholder value by increasing its
gold and silver ore reserves within the concession/license areas granted
to the Company by the Government of El Salvador (GOES) and by processing
these reserves to produce gold and silver at an above average profit.
Substantial capital expenditures are required to explore, develop and
process gold and silver ore.  The Company's geologists and engineers
believe that its existing precious metal reserves can be substantially
increased by continuous exploration.
The Company is determined to obtain the capital it requires to produce
gold and silver at its San Cristobal Mill and Plant (SCMP) facilities and
to construct an open-pit, heap-leach operation on its San Sebastian Gold
Mine site which is located approximately two and one half miles off of
the Pan American highway northwest of the City of Santa Rosa de Lima in
the Department of La Union, El Salvador.
The Company has no revenues because it is not in production and it
requires funds to purchase the necessary equipment, inventory and working
capital to commence processing the 15 million ton ore reserves which
should contain approximately 1.5 million ounces of gold.  The Company is
determined to raise sufficient capital to enter into production. Its
alternative is to joint venture, merge, be acquired  or enter into a
business combination that will benefit all parties concerned.
THREE CONCESSIONS:
ONE EXPLOITATION AND TWO EXPLORATION MINERAL CONCESSIONS/LICENSES
All of the Company's mines and exploration targets are located in the
Republic of El Salvador, Central America.  The GOES has issued three
concessions/licenses to the Company, which are described as follows:
RENEWED SAN SEBASTIAN GOLD MINE EXPLOITATION CONCESSION/LICENSE UNDER EL
SALVADOR AGREEMENT NUMBER 591 DATED MAY 20, 2004 AND DELIVERED ON JUNE 4,
2004 (RENEWED SSGM) - APPROXIMATELY 1.2306 SQUARE KILOMETERS (304 ACRES)
LOCATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LA UNION, EL SALVADOR, CENTRAL AMERICA
On September 6, 2002, at a meeting held with the El Salvadoran Minister
of Economy and the DHM, it was agreed to submit an application for the
Renewed SSGM for a 30-year term and to  simultaneously cancel the
concession obtained on July 23, 1987.  On September 26, 2002, the Company
filed this application.  On February 28, 2003 (received March 3, 2003)
the DHM admitted to the receipt of the application and the Company
proceeded to file public notices as required by Article 40 of the El
Salvadoran Mining Law and its Reform (MLIR).  On April 16, 2003, the
Company's El Salvadoran legal counsel filed with the DHM notice that it
believed that it complied with the requirements of Article 40, and that
there were no objections; and requested that the DHM make its inspection

              PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
as required by MLIR Article 42.  An inspection by the DHM was made.  The
Company then provided a bond which was required by the DHM to protect
third parties against any damage caused from the mining operations, and
it simultaneously paid the annual surface tax.  On August 29, 2003 the
Office of the Ministry of Economy formally presented the Company with a
twenty-year Renewed SSGM which was dated August 18, 2003.  On May 20,
2004 (delivered June 4, 2004) the Government of El Salvador under this
Agreement Number 591 extended the exploitation concession for a period of
thirty (30) years.  This Renewed SSGM replaces the collateral that the
same parties held with the previous concession.
NEW SSGM EXPLORATION CONCESSION/LICENSE UNDER EL SALVADOR RESOLUTION
NUMBER 27 (New SSGM) - APPROXIMATELY 40.7694 SQUARE KILOMETERS (10,070
ACRES) LOCATED IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF LA UNION AND MORAZAN, EL SALVADOR,
CENTRAL AMERICA
On October 20, 2002, the Company applied to the Government of El Salvador
through the DHM for the New SSGM, which covers an area of 42 square
kilometers and includes approximately 1.2306 square kilometers of the
Renewed SSGM.  The New SSGM is in the jurisdiction of the City of Santa
Rosa de Lima in the Department of La Union and in the Nueva Esparta in
the Department of Morazan, Republic of El Salvador, Central America.  On
February 24, 2003, the DHM issued the New SSGM for a period of four years
starting from the date following the notification of this resolution
which was received on March 3, 2003.  The New SSGM may be extended for
two two-year periods, or for a total of eight years.  Besides the San
Sebastian Gold Mine, the following three other formerly operative gold
and silver mines included in the New SSGM are being explored: the La Lola
Mine, the Santa Lucia Mine, and the Tabanco Mine.
NUEVA ESPARTA EXPLORATION CONCESSION/LICENSE (NUEVA ESPARTA) - 45 SQUARE
KILOMETERS (11,115 ACRES)
On or about October 20, 2002, the Company filed an application with the
Government of El Salvador through the DHM for the Nueva Esparta, which
consists of 45 square kilometers north and adjacent to the New SSGM.
This rectangular area is in the Departments of La Union (east) and
Morazan (west) and in the jurisdiction of the City of Santa Rosa de Lima,
El Salvador, Central America.  On May 25, 2004 (received June 4, 2004)
the Government of El Salvador under Resolution Number 271 issued the
exploration concession for a period of four years with a right to request
an additional four year extension.  An important observation is that
these mines form a belt of mineralization following a fault line from the
SSGM to the Montemayor Mine for a distance of approximately five miles.
Included in the Nueva Esparta are eight other formerly operated gold and
silver mines known as:  the Grande Mine, the Las Pinas Mine, the Oro
Mine, the Montemayor Mine, the Banadero Mine, the Carrizal Mine, the La
Joya Mine and the Copetillo Mine.

HISTORICAL INFORMATION
The Company is a U.S. Wisconsin chartered corporation engaged in exploration,
exploitation, development and gold and silver production with its primary asset
being the San Sebastian Gold Mine (SSGM).  The SSGM is located in the Republic
of El Salvador, Central America and produced over one million ounces of gold
during the 1900-1917 period.  The Company became involved as an investor and
then as a majority owner.  Gold and silver was produced by the Company from
mid-1972 through the first quarter of 1978.  The suspension was caused by the
El Salvador civil unrest which peace pact was entered into in December 1992
conditioned upon meeting the terms during a three-year period.  Production of
gold and silver commenced on April 1, 1995 and the operations were suspended
during the first quarter of 2000 due to the low selling price of gold at that
time and the need to retrofit, restore and expand the San Cristobal Mill and
Plant (SCMP).  The Company presently is seeking funds to restore the SCMP and
to set up an open-pit, heap-leach operation at the SSGM site.  Its alternative
is to joint venture or to enter into a merger or business combination.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
- ------------------------------------------
The ensuing discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations are based on the Company's unaudited consolidated financial
statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and contained within this report
on S.E.C. Form 10-Q/A.  Certain amounts included in or affecting the
Company's financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated,
requiring that certain assumptions be made with respect to values or
conditions which cannot be made with certainty at the time the financial
statements are prepared.  Therefore, the reported amounts of the
Company's assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and associated
disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations could be
affected by these estimates.  The more significant areas requiring the
use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves
that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units-of-production
amortization determination; recoverability and timing of gold production
from the heap-leaching process; environmental, reclamation and closure
obligations; asset impairments (including estimates of future cash
flows); useful lives and residual values of intangible assets; fair value
of financial instruments; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets;
and contingencies and litigation.  The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company believes the following significant assumptions and estimates
affect its more critical practices and accounting policies used in the
preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
A critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of
the Company's financial condition and results, and requires the Company
to make difficult subjective and/or complex judgments.  Critical
accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently
uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown.  The
Company believes the following accounting policies are critical policies;
accounting for its gold ore reserves, environmental liabilities, income
taxes and asset retirement obligations.

COMMERCE GROUP CORP., ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND THE JOINT VENTURE
                     S.E.C. FORM 10-Q/A - JUNE 30, 2004
                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and
assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement
date.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported  amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses.  Actual results could differ
from those amounts.
Gold ore reserves include reserves that represent estimated quantities of
gold in which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reserves under
existing economic and operating conditions.  The gold ore reserves are
based on estimates prepared by geology and mining consultants and are
used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) and
determine if any potential impairment exists related to the recorded
value of the Company's gold ore reserves.  Decline in the market price of
gold may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grade of
mineralization uneconomic to mine.  Changes in capital and operating
costs including other factors could materially and adversely affect ore
reserves.
The Company reviews, on an as needed basis, its estimates of costs of
compliance with environmental laws and the cleanup of various sites,
including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the
Company as a potentially responsible party.  When it is probable that
obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable
estimate of the actual costs of compliance or remediation can be
determined, the applicable amount is accrued.  Actual costs can differ
from estimates due to changes in laws and regulations, discovery and
analysis of site conditions and changes in technology.
The Company makes certain estimates, which may include various tax
planning strategies, in determining taxable income, the timing of
deductions and the utilization of tax attributes, which can differ from
estimates due to changes in laws and regulations, discovery and analysis
of site conditions and changes in technology.
Management is required to make judgments based on historical experience
and future expectations on the future abandonment cost, net of salvage
value, of its mining properties and equipment.  The Company reviews its
estimate of the future obligation periodically and will accrue the
estimated obligation based on the SFAS No. 143 "Account for Asset
Retirement Obligations."
From time to time, the Company estimates its ore reserves when it is in
production.  There are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of reserves, including many factors beyond the control of the
Company.  Ore reserve estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of
assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings.
Additionally, declines in the market price of gold may render certain
reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic
to mine.  Further, availability of permits, changes in operating and
capital costs, and other factors could materially and adversely affect
ore reserves.  The Company uses its ore reserve estimates in determining
the unit basis for mine depreciation and closure rates, as well as in
evaluating mine asset impairments.  Changes in ore reserve estimates
could significantly affect these items.

                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
The Company at least annually plans to assess its properties and
undeveloped mineral claims and leases, if any, for impairment when events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the properties may be impaired.
For producing properties and equipment, an impairment is recognized when
the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest)
expected to result in the use of the asset are less than the carrying
amount of that asset.  Measurement of the impairment loss is based on
discounted cash flows.  Undeveloped mineral claims and leases are
measured on a fair value basis.  Fair value with respect to such mineral
interest, pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets,
effective January 1, 2002, would generally be assessed with reference to
comparable property sales transaction in the market place.  The expected
values associated with potential property development are estimated using
the traditional net present value analysis of revenues, costs and capital
investment cash flow projections discounted at a risk-adjusted rate
reflective to the time periods associated with each possible outcome.
Assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks
and uncertainties.  Also, the occurrence of past market transactions does
not mean that such comparable amounts would be applicable to the
Company's situation.  Any differences between significant assumptions and
market conditions could have a material effect on the fair value
estimate.
The amended financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004,
and prior years reflect and include Commerce Group Corp.'s subsidiaries
and the Commerce Group Corp./Sanseb Joint Venture (Joint Venture) on a
consolidated basis.  Previously, the Company reported the investment in
the Joint Venture as advances to the Joint Venture and the Company's
advances included the interest earned on these advances in anticipation
of the interest being reimbursed.  Now these advances are restated and
combined with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  Although
the elimination of interest income reduces the retained earnings, it does
not eliminate the interest charged by and earned by the Company which is
due and payable to it and which is maintained additionally with a
separate accounting.  At such time when the profits from the gold mining
operation are distributed, the interest earned on these advances will be
paid first to the Company pursuant to an agreement entered into by the
joint venture parties.
GOLD ORE RESERVES
The Company's geologists have defined the following San Sebastian Gold
Mine gold ore reserves:
Tons      Average Grade       Ounces
----      -------------       ------
Virgin ore            14,404,096       0.081         1,166,732
Stope fill estimated   1,000,000       0.340           340,000
                      ----------                     ---------
  Totals              15,404,096                     1,506,732
The estimated recoverable ounces by processing through the San Cristobal
Mill and Plant ranges from 85% to 95%; the recovery of gold from the
heap-leaching operations should range from 60% to 70%.

                   PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
PRECIOUS METAL MINING STRATEGY
The Company has produced gold from 1972 through March 1978 at the SSGM
site and from March 31, 1995 through December 31, 1999 at its SCMP.  Its
SCMP consisted primarily of used equipment that had been installed at its
leased site by a previous mining company.  The used processing equipment
was acquired by the Joint Venture on February 23, 1993, and the SCMP
operations were officially suspended as of March 31, 2000.  During this
period, the price of gold suffered a severe decline.
Although while in operation at the SCMP site the Company has on a
continuous basis repaired, maintained, modified, and restored the
equipment, it presently lacks sufficient funds to retrofit and to expand
the SCMP facilities.
The Company has temporarily suspended its gold processing until such time
as it has adequate funds for the retrofitting, rehabilitation,
restoration, overhauling, and most importantly for the expansion of the
SCMP facilities.  During the last two fiscal periods, the price of gold
has increased to a level to place the SCMP into a profitable position.
The Company has a number of non-exclusive independent consulting
agreements for the purpose of raising the sum of up to U.S. $20 million.
The funds are to be used to purchase and install equipment, perform site
development, working capital for the SSGM open-pit, heap-leaching
operation, and for the retrofit and expansion of the Joint Venture's
SCMP.  The predominant obstacle in negotiations is to prevent a substantial
dilution of the existing shareholders' equity position.
Through December  1999, the Joint Venture produced gold primarily from
processing the SSGM tailings and from the virgin ore it was excavating
from its SSGM open pit.  The gold was processed at its SCMP facility
which is located approximately 15 miles from the SSGM site.  It is
contemplating the installation  of a pilot open-pit, heap-leaching
gold-processing system on the SSGM site.  The cone crushing system is
being maintained at this site.  It also is continuing its SSGM site
preparation, the expansion of its exploration and exploitation targets,
and the enlargement and development of its gold ore reserves.  The
Modesto Mine has been placed on a standby exploration program basis
pending the advice from its legal counsel relative to the filing of
applications for concessions (licenses) on the real estate that it owns
in this area. All of the mining properties are located in the Republic
of El Salvador, Central America.
The Joint Venture will continue its attempts to commence its production
of gold from the SSGM site.  Its objectives are to have an expanded
complementary operation while continuing its endeavor to obtain
sufficient funds for the SSGM open-pit, heap-leach operation. The
Company's main objective and plan, through the Joint Venture, is to
operate at the SSGM site, a moderate tonnage, low-grade, open-pit,
heap-leaching, gold-producing mine.  It intends to commence this
gold-mining operation as soon as adequate funding is in place and
providing the gold price remains at or above the current price level.
Dependent on the grade of gold ore processed and the funds it is able to
obtain, it then anticipates producing annually approximately 10,000
ounces of gold from the SCMP operation and eventually up to 113,000
ounces of gold from its SSGM open-pit, heap-leaching operation.  The
Joint Venture continues on a limited basis to conduct an exploration
program to develop additional gold ore reserves at the SSGM.  Since it
has the New SSGM and the Nueva Esparta Exploration Concession/License, it
is exploring the La Lola Mine, the Tabanco Mine and the Santa Lucia Mine.

                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
The Company produced gold at the SSGM site from 1972-1978 and the Joint
Venture produced gold from March 1995 through December 1999 at the SCMP
through a start-up or preliminary operation, which was a forerunner of
its greater goals.  The Company's revenues, profitability and cash flow
are greatly influenced by the price of gold.  Gold prices fluctuate
widely and are affected by numerous factors which will be beyond the
Company's control, such as, expectations for inflation, the strength of
the U.S. dollar, overproduction of gold, global and regional demand, acts
of terrorism, or political and economic conditions, or for that matter,
many other reasons.  The combined effect of these and other factors is
difficult; perhaps impossible to predict.  Should the market price of
gold fall below the Company's production costs and remain at such level
for any sustained period, the Company could experience losses.
The Company believes that neither it, nor any other competitor, has a
material effect on the precious metal markets and that the price it will
receive for its production is dependent upon world market conditions over
which it has no control.
RESULTS OF OPERATION FOR THE THREE-MONTH FISCAL PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2004
COMPARED TO THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2003
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no revenues as the Company has suspended its gold production
until it is able to procure the funds it requires to rehabilitate,
retrofit, overhaul, and expand its SCMP and/or when it has funds to
commence an open-pit, heap-leach operation at the SSGM site.  The price
of gold has stabilized at a price level that could assure a profitable
operation.  The Company recorded a net loss of $52,188 or $.00 cents
per share for the first three months ended June 30, 2004. This compares
to a net loss of $49,873 or $.00 cents per share for the fiscal period
ended June 30, 2003.
There was no current or deferred provision for income taxes during this
fiscal period ended June 30, 2004 or 2003.  Additionally, even though the
Company has an operating tax loss carryforward, the Company has
previously recorded a net deferred tax asset due to an assessment of the
"more likely than not" realization criteria required by the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Taxes.
Inflation did not have a material impact on operations in the fiscal
periods ended June 30, 2004 or 2003.  The Company does not anticipate
that inflation will have a material impact on continuing operations
during this next fiscal year.
Accrued interest expense in the sum of $392,413 was capitalized by the
Joint Venture during this fiscal period compared to $334,584 which was
capitalized for the same period in 2003, and it was eliminated by
reducing the interest income earned from the Joint Venture.
Almost all of the costs and expenses incurred by the Company are
allocated and charged to the Joint Venture. The Joint Venture capitalizes
these costs and expenses and will continue to do so until such time when
it is in full production.  At the time production commences, these
capitalized costs will be charged as an expense based on a per unit
basis.  If the prospect of gold production becomes unlikely, all of these
costs will be written off in the year that this occurs.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -----------------------------------------------------
As of December 31, 1999 (effective March 31, 2000), the Joint Venture
suspended its SCMP operations until such time as it has adequate funding
to repair, retrofit, overhaul and expand the mill to process its gold
ore, and at such time that the price of gold will stabilize at a higher
price.  After almost five years of  24-hour-per-day operation with used
equipment, the plant requires a major overhaul.  At that time the low
price of gold did not provide an adequate cash reserve for these needs.
Additional equipment has to be purchased, delivered and installed.
The Company will endeavor to commence an open-pit, heap-leaching
operation at the SSGM as there is a substantial amount of gold ore that
grades less than 0.04 ounces per ton.  The Company's engineers had
determined that a 2,000 ton-per-day open-pit, heap-leach, start-up
operation may produce 1,280 ounces of gold per month. It is necessary to
raise adequate funds from outside sources for this operation; the amount
required is dependent on the targeted daily volume of production.

                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
The Company estimates that it will need up to U.S. $17 million to start
a 2,000 ton-per-day open-pit, heap-leaching operation.  Eventually the
production capacity would be increased in stages to 6,000 tons per day so
that annual production could be 113,000 ounces of gold at the SSGM.  The
use of the $17,000,000 proceeds is as follows: $8,250,000 for mining
equipment and the completion of erecting a crushing system; $3,783,548
for the processing equipment and site and infrastructure costs; and a sum
of $4,966,452 is to be used for working capital.  The once depressed
price of gold has substantially increased during the last two years.  The
Company's current incredibly low common share market price is a  major
deterrent in raising funds for the Company's needs.
The Company continues to be cognizant of its cash liquidity until it is
able to produce adequate profits from its SSGM gold production.   It will
attempt to obtain sufficient funds to assist the Joint Venture in placing
the SSGM into production as the anticipated profits from the existing
SCMP operation (unless accumulated over a period of time) appear
insufficient to meet the SSGM capital  and the other mining exploration
requirements.  In order to continue obtaining funds to conduct the Joint
Venture's exploration, exploitation, development, expansion programs, and
the production of gold from the SSGM  open-pit, heap-leaching operation,
it is  necessary for the Company to obtain funds from other sources.  In
order for the Company to reach its goal of gold production, it may have
to borrow funds by issuing open-ended, secured, on-demand or unsecured
promissory notes, by selling its shares to its directors, officers and
other interested accredited investors, or by entering into a joint
venture, merging, or developing an acceptable form of a business
combination with other companies.
During the past,  the Joint Venture was engaged in  exploration,
exploitation and development programs designed to increase its gold ore
reserves.  The prospects of expanding the gold reserves with the recent
acquired concession/license are extremely positive.  The Company believes
that the past invested funds significantly contributed to the value of
the SSGM and  to the value of its other mining prospects as the results
of the exploratory efforts evidence the potential for a substantial
increase of gold ore reserves.  The Company was unable to obtain
sufficient funds during this fiscal period to complete the modification
and expansion of the SCMP or for its open-pit, heap-leach operation.
However, the Company did invest funds during this fiscal period which
were used for a limited exploration program to progress the erection of
the cone crushing system, and to maintain the SCMP.
The Company continues to rely on its directors, officers, related parties
and others for its funding needs.  The Company believes that it may be
able to obtain such short-term and/or equity funds as are required from
similar sources as it has in the past.   It further believes that the
funding needed to proceed with the continued exploration of the other
exploration targets for the purpose of increasing its gold ore reserves

will be greatly enhanced if the price of gold continues to increase.
These exploration programs will involve airborne geophysics, stream
chemistry, geological mapping, trenching, drilling, etc.  The Joint
Venture believes that it may be able to joint venture or enter into other
business arrangements to share these exploration costs with other
entities.
From September 1987 through June 30, 2004, the Company has advanced the
sum of $45,338,278 to the Joint Venture (which includes interest charges
payable to the Company), and three of the Company's subsidiaries have
advanced the sum of $590,265, for a total of $45,928,543.  This
investment includes the charge of $28,090,512 for interest expense during
this period of time.  The funds invested in the Joint Venture were used
primarily for the exploration, exploitation, and development of the SSGM,
for the construction of the Joint Venture laboratory facilities on real
estate owned by the Company near the SSGM site, for the operation of the
laboratory, for the purchase of a 200-ton per day used SCMP precious
metals' cyanide leaching mill and plant,  for the initial retrofitting,
repair, modernization and expansion of its SCMP facilities, for

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
- ---------------------------------
The ensuing discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements,
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and contained within this report on S.E.C.  Form
10-Q/A.  Certain amounts included in or affecting the Company's financial
statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring that certain
assumptions be made with respect to values or conditions which cannot be made
with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared.  Therefore,
the reported amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and
obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates.  The more significant
areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to
mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and
units-of-production amortization determination; recoverability and timing of

                   S.E.C. FORM 10-Q/A - JUNE 30, 2004
               PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
gold production from the heap-leaching process; environmental, reclamation and
closure obligations; asset impairments (including estimates of future cash
flows); useful lives and residual values of intangible assets; fair value of
financial instruments; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; and
contingencies and litigation.  The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128
(SFAS128), Earnings per Share in prior years.  SFAS128's objective is to
simplify the computation of earnings per share (EPS) and to make the U.S.
standard more compatible with that of other countries and the
International Accounting Standards Committee.  SFAS128 supersedes APB
Opinion 15, replacing the presentation of "primary" and "fully diluted"
EPS with "basic" and "diluted" EPS.  Reference is made to earnings (loss) per
share in the financial statements for details.
The financial statements for the quarterly periods ended June 30,
2004 and 2003 and prior years reflect and include Commerce Group Corp.'s
subsidiaries and the Commerce Group Corp./Sanseb Joint Venture (Joint
Venture) on a consolidated basis.  Prior to the fiscal year ended March
31, 1997,  the Company reported the investment in the Joint Venture as
advances to the Joint Venture and the Company's advances included the
interest earned on these advances in anticipation of the interest being
reimbursed.  Now these advances are restated and combined with the
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  Although the elimination of
interest income reduces the retained earnings, it does not eliminate the
interest charged by and earned by the Company which is due and payable to
it and which is maintained additionally with a separate accounting.  At
such time when the profits from the gold mining operation are
distributed, the interest earned on these advances will be paid first to
the Company pursuant to an agreement entered into by the joint venture
parties.
EMPLOYEES
- ---------
As of June 30, 2004, the Joint Venture employed between 40 and 50
full-time persons in El Salvador to perform its limited exploration,
exploitation, and development programs; to erect the cone crushing
system, to provide 24-hour seven-day-a-week security at three different
sites; to provide engineering, geology, drafting, and computer-related
services;  and to handle the administration of its activities. None of
these employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements.  It
has developed a harmonious relationship with its employees, and it
believes that in the past, it was one of the largest single
non-agricultural employers in the El Salvador Eastern Zone.   Also, the
Company employs up to four persons, including part-time help, in the
United States.   Since the Joint Venture has laid off most of its
employees, the Joint Venture had to pay the severance pay and other
benefits to its employees and therefore it had to sell and continues to
sell the Company's common shares which were issued to the Commerce Group
Corp. Employee Benefit Account.  El Salvador employees are entitled to
receive severance pay, which is based on one month's pay for each year of
employment.

                     S.E.C. FORM 10-Q/A - JUNE 30, 2004
                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
RELATED PARTY LOANS, OBLIGATIONS AND TRANSACTIONS
- -------------------------------------------------
The related party transactions are included in detail in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
COMPANY ADVANCES TO THE JOINT VENTURE
- -------------------------------------
Since September 1987 through June 30, 2004, the Company, and three of its
subsidiaries, have advanced to the Joint Venture $45,928,543.  Included
in the total advances is the interest charged to the Joint Venture by the
Company which amounts to $28,090,512 through June 30, 2004.  The Company
furnishes all of the funds required by the Joint Venture.  This interest
expense charge has been eliminated from these financial statements.
EFFORTS TO OBTAIN CAPITAL
- -------------------------
Since the concessions were granted, and through the present time,
substantial effort is exercised by the Directors and Officers in
attempting to secure funding through various sources, all with the
purpose to refurbish and expand the operations of the SCMP, to construct
an open-pit heap-leach operation at the SSGM site, and to continue the
exploration of its other mining prospects.
The Company, Sanseb, and the Joint Venture consider the past political
situation in the Republic of El Salvador to have been unstable, and
believe that the final peace declaration on December 16, 1992, has put an
end to the conflict.  Even though many years have passed, the stigma of
the past unfavorable political status in the Republic of El Salvador
exists and therefore certain investors continue to be apprehensive to
invest the funds required.  However, as explained in this report, the
Company was able to obtain a sum of funds to invest in the expansion and
retrofitting of its SCMP and for the exploration of its other mining
prospects.  The decline in the Company's stock market price places the
Company in a situation of substantially diluting its common shares if it
wants to raise equity capital via the sale of its shares.  The Company
believes that it will be able to obtain adequate financing to conduct its
operations from the same sources as in the past.  There are no assurances
that funds will be available, except at this time, there is a greater
world-wide interest in the ownership of gold.  The price of gold has
increased substantially during this past fiscal year which should
encourage investors to invest in gold mining companies.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
- -------------------------
The Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and
regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the
jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Accordingly, the Company
has adopted policies, practices and procedures in the areas of pollution
control, product safety, occupational health and the production,
handling, storage,  use and disposal of hazardous materials to prevent
material environmental or other damage, and to limit the financial
liability which could result from such events.  However, some risk of
environmental or other damage is inherent in the business of the Company,
as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
The DHM requires environmental permits to be issued in connection with
the application of the Renewed SSGM.  The issuance of these permits are
under the jurisdiction of the El Salvador Ministry of Environment and
Natural Resources Office (MARN).  On October 15, 2002, MARN issued an
environmental permit under Resolution 474-2002 for the SCMP.  On October
20, 2002, MARN issued an environmental permit under Resolution 493-2002
for the Renewed SSGM Exploitation area.
GUARANTEES
- ----------
The Company has provided the Government of El Salvador with the following
guarantees on September 27, 2002: three-year guarantees were issued by the
Banco Agricola, S.C. on behalf of the Company to the Ministry of Environment
and Natural Resources; Guarantee No. 1901-0000059-8 was issued for the San
Cristobal Mill and Plant in the sum of $771.49; and Guarantee No.
1901-0000069-7 was issued for the Renewed SSGM in the sum of $14,428.68.
On July 10, 2003 a one-year third party liability guarantee in the sum of
$42,875.14 expiring July 10, 2004 was issued by Compania Anglo Salvadorena de
Seguros, S.A. on behalf of the Company to the Ministry of Economy's Office of
the Department of Hydrocarbons and Mines.
DIVIDENDS
- ---------
For the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that the Company will use
all of its earnings to finance its growth and expansion, therefore,
dividends will not be paid to shareholders.
IMPACT OF INFLATION
- -------------------
The impact of inflation on the Company has not been significant in recent
years because of the relatively low rates of inflation and deflation
experienced in the United States.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS
- ---------------------------------------
Reference is made to Note 4 in the financial statements included with
this report.
ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- -------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMODITY PRICES
- ----------------
When in production, the Company's earnings and cash flow will be
significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold.  Gold
prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors, such as
demand, production levels, economic policies of central banks, producer
hedging, and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other
currencies.  During the last five years, the average annual market price
of gold has fluctuated between $270 per ounce and $375 per ounce.  The
Company has not been engaged in any hedging contracts whatsoever.

                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
DEBT OWED TO RELATED PARTIES
- ----------------------------
As of June 30, 2004, the Company's debt secured and payable to related
parties was $9,851,488 and to others $252,963, compared to June 30, 2003,
when the Company's debt payable to related parties was $8,423,537 and to
others $231,307.  All of the debt is subject to interest at a rate of two
to four percent over the prime rate, but not less than sixteen percent,
payable monthly and as more fully described in the financial statements.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
- ----------------
The Company conducts the majority of its operations in the Republic of El
Salvador, Central America.  Currently, El Salvador is on the U.S. dollar
system, and therefore all receipts and expenditures since January 1, 2001
are in U.S. dollars.
ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
- --------------------------------
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures.
The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined by regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), means controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits to the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits to the SEC under the Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions to be made regarding required disclosure.  The
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
evaluated the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K and have
concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective as of the date of such evaluation.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company also maintains a system of internal controls.  The term
"internal controls," as defined by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants' Codification of Statement on Auditing Standards, AU
Section 319, means controls and other procedures designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the
reliability of the Company's financial reporting, the effectiveness and
efficiency of the Company's operations and the Company's compliance with
applicable laws and regulations.  There have been no changes in the
Company's internal controls or in other factors during this first fiscal
quarter that could significantly affect the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.

                 PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
ITEM 5.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
The financial statements included in this report were reviewed as required
under Section 102 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by an independent public
accounting firm that is registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB).  The purpose for filing this SEC Form 10-Q/A is
because the Company's previous independent public accountant was not
registered with the PCAOB prior to October 22, 2003.  Reference is made to the
Company's Form 8-Ks filed on January 21, 2005 and May 6, 2005.
There has been a change in the Company's certified public accountant which
resulted from the previous certified public accountant who audited and
certified the Company's March 31, 2004 financial statements not being
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) as is
required by Section 102 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Therefore, the
financial statements for the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 were
regarded as being incomplete.  In order to correct the deficiency the Company
on January 18, 2005 engaged a certified public accountant from Las Vegas,
Nevada.  The Company on January 21, 2005 filed an 8-K notifying that the
previous accountant resigned and that the Company engaged its new independent
accountant.  The March 31, 2004 audit report prepared by the previous
accountant did not contain an adverse opinion or was qualified or modified as
to uncertainty audit scope or accounting principles.  There were no
disagreements with the previous accountant on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.
After a lapse of time and upon preliminary review of the Company's financial
records the new Las Vegas accountant explained that his firm did not have the
capacity and time to audit the Company's financial statements within the due
date time frame.  This CPA firm referred the Company to Chisholm, Bierwolf &
Nilson, LLC, Certified Public Accountants.  on May 6, 2005, the Company filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 8-K explaining that on
May 2, 2005 it engaged the accounting firm of Chisholm, Bierwolf & Nilson, LLC
as independent certified accountants and simultaneously accepted the
resignation of the Las Vegas accounting firm.  For more details, reference is
made to the SEC Form 8-Ks filed on January 21, 2005 and May 6, 2005.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the statements contained in this report are forward-looking
unaudited statements, such as estimates and statements that describe the
Company's future plans, objectives or goals, including words to the
effect that the Company or management expects a stated condition or
result to occur.  Since forward-looking statements address future events
and conditions, by their very nature, they involve inherent risks and
uncertainties.  Actual results in each case could differ materially from
those currently anticipated in such statements by reason of factors such
as production at the Company's mines, changes in operating costs, changes
in general economic conditions and conditions in the financial markets,
changes in demand and prices for the products the Company produces,
litigation, legislative, environmental and other judicial, regulatory,
political and competitive developments in areas in which the Company
operates and technological and operational difficulties encountered in
connection with mining.  Many of these factors are beyond the Company's
ability to control or predict.  The Company disclaims any intent or
obligation to update its forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of receiving new information, the occurrence of future events, or
otherwise.

I, Edward A. Machulak, certify that:

     Corp.;
2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
     flows of the registrant as of, and for, the period presented in this
     report;
4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible
     for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
     (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
     internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
     Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:
a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
         disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
         supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
         known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
         the period in which this report is being prepared;
b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
         caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
         designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
         regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
         preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
         controls and procedures and presented in this report our
         conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
         and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
         report based on such evaluation; and
d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting that occurred during the
         registrant's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
         affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
         registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and
5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed,
     based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
     financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
     committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
     performing the equivalent functions):
a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
         design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
         which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
         ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
         information; and
b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
         other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
         internal control over financial reporting.
