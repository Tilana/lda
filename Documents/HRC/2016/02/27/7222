<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 27/13, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to prepare a study on the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>the rights of indigenous peoples with respect to their cultural heritage, including through 
</p>
<p>their participation in political and public life, and to present it to the Council at its thirtieth 
</p>
<p>session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Expert Mechanism called for submissions from States, indigenous peoples, non-
</p>
<p>State actors, national human rights institutions and other stakeholders to inform the study. 
</p>
<p>The submissions received are, where permitted, available on the website of the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism.1 The study also benefited significantly from presentations made at the Expert 
</p>
<p>Seminar on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights with Respect to their Cultural Heritage (Rovaniemi, 
</p>
<p>Finland, 26 and 27 February 2015), organized by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights and the University of Lapland. The Expert Mechanism 
</p>
<p>appreciates the submissions and is informed by them. 
</p>
<p>3. Although the Expert Mechanism has not specifically addressed the issue of cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage, it has given significant attention to the cultures of indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/21/53). The present study offers a comprehensive overview of the international 
</p>
<p>legal framework and jurisprudence regarding the rights of indigenous peoples with respect 
</p>
<p>to their cultural heritage and addresses specific aspects of those rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Concept of cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>4. The term &#8220;cultural heritage&#8221; has evolved considerably in recent decades. While 
</p>
<p>previously referring exclusively to the monumental remains of cultures, &#8220;cultural heritage&#8221; 
</p>
<p>has gradually come to include new categories; in particular, more emphasis has been put on 
</p>
<p>intangible cultural heritage. The 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible 
</p>
<p>Cultural Heritage defines intangible cultural heritage as &#8220;the practices, representations, 
</p>
<p>expressions, knowledge, skills &#8212; as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural 
</p>
<p>spaces associated therewith &#8212; that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals 
</p>
<p>recognize as part of their cultural heritage&#8221; (art. 2). There is also increasing recognition of 
</p>
<p>the relationship between communities and cultural heritage. The Council of Europe 
</p>
<p>Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society defines cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage as &#8220;a group of resources inherited from the past which people identify, 
</p>
<p>independently of ownership, as a reflection and expression of their constantly evolving 
</p>
<p>values, beliefs, knowledge and traditions. It includes all aspects of the environment 
</p>
<p>resulting from the interaction between people and places through time&#8221; (art. 2). 
</p>
<p>5. As noted by the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, although no 
</p>
<p>uniform definition exists, several international instruments and a number of references 
</p>
<p>relating to traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions provide useful 
</p>
<p>guidance for defining what is usually understood as cultural heritage. Noting that no list is 
</p>
<p>exhaustive, the Special Rapporteur referred to cultural heritage as &#8220;tangible heritage (e.g. 
</p>
<p>sites, structures and remains of archaeological, historical, religious, cultural or aesthetic 
</p>
<p>value), intangible heritage (e.g. traditions, customs and practices, aesthetic and spiritual 
</p>
<p>beliefs; vernacular or other languages; artistic expressions, folklore) and natural heritage 
</p>
<p>(e.g. protected natural reserves; other protected biologically diverse areas; historic parks 
</p>
<p>and gardens and cultural landscapes)&#8221; (A/HRC/17/38 and Corr.1, para. 4). She added that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/EMRIP/Pages/Studyonculturalheritage.aspx. </p>


<p>cultural heritage should be understood as resources enabling the cultural identification and 
</p>
<p>development processes of individuals and communities which they, implicitly or explicitly, 
</p>
<p>wish to transmit to future generations (ibid., para. 6). Cultural heritage also includes 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge and cultural expressions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous peoples and cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>6. Indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural heritage includes tangible and intangible manifestations 
</p>
<p>of their ways of life, world views, achievements and creativity, and should be considered an 
</p>
<p>expression of their self-determination and their spiritual and physical relationships with 
</p>
<p>their lands, territories and resources. While the notion of heritage encompasses traditional 
</p>
<p>practices in a broad sense, including language, art, music, dance, song, stories, sports and 
</p>
<p>traditional games, sacred sites, and ancestral human remains, for indigenous peoples the 
</p>
<p>preservation of heritage is deeply embedded and linked to the protection of traditional 
</p>
<p>territories. Indigenous cultural heritage is a holistic and inter-generational concept based on 
</p>
<p>common material and spiritual values influenced by the environment.2 It also includes bio-
</p>
<p>cultural heritage and traditional food production systems such as rotational farming, 
</p>
<p>pastoralism, artisanal fisheries and other forms of access to natural sources.3 
</p>
<p>7. Taking into account the various understandings of culture and cultural heritage, the 
</p>
<p>Expert Mechanism proposed the following:  
</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures include tangible and intangible manifestations of their 
</p>
<p>ways of life, achievements and creativity, and are an expression of their self-
</p>
<p>determination and of their spiritual and physical relationships with their lands, 
</p>
<p>territories and resources. Indigenous culture is a holistic concept based on common 
</p>
<p>material and spiritual values and includes distinctive manifestations in language, 
</p>
<p>spirituality, membership, arts, literature, traditional knowledge, customs, rituals, 
</p>
<p>ceremonies, methods of production, festive events, music, sports and traditional 
</p>
<p>games, behaviour, habits, tools, shelter, clothing, economic activities, morals, value 
</p>
<p>systems, cosmovisions, laws, and activities such as hunting, fishing, trapping and 
</p>
<p>gathering. (A/HRC/21/53, para. 52) 
</p>
<p>8. It is important to acknowledge that the traditional categorization of heritage as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;tangible&#8221;, &#8220;intangible&#8221;, and &#8220;natural&#8221; demonstrates its limitations: tangible heritage carries 
</p>
<p>out meanings, while intangible heritage is often embodied in specific objects. This 
</p>
<p>categorization is particularly inappropriate in the case of indigenous peoples. It is important 
</p>
<p>to adopt a holistic approach to cultural heritage and acknowledge that the rigid legal regime 
</p>
<p>of protection for cultural heritage could be problematic for indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Review of the international legal framework on the rights of 
indigenous peoples with respect to their cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>9. Standards relating to the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples are dispersed in 
</p>
<p>several international regimes, in particular in human rights instruments, United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) instruments, intellectual 
</p>
<p>property treaties and the international environmental law and policy regime. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 See the submission from the Asia Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Pact. 
</p>
<p> 3 See the submission from the International Indian Treaty Council. </p>


<p><b> A. Human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>10. Culture is one of the underlying pillars of the United Nations Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The close relationship between the cultural rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and their right to self-determination is reflected in article 3 of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration, which states that by virtue of their right to self-determination, indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples may freely pursue their cultural development. The Declaration addresses the 
</p>
<p>tangible heritage, traditions and customs of indigenous peoples (art. 11); the spiritual and 
</p>
<p>religious traditions and customs of indigenous cultures (art. 12); their intangible heritage 
</p>
<p>(art. 13); and their right to uphold the dignity and diversity of their cultures and languages, 
</p>
<p>in relation to education and public information (arts. 14 and 15). More specifically, 
</p>
<p>regarding cultural heritage, the Declaration states that: 
</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control protect and develop their 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well 
</p>
<p>as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human 
</p>
<p>and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and 
</p>
<p>flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and 
</p>
<p>performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop 
</p>
<p>their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and 
</p>
<p>traditional cultural expressions. (art. 31)  
</p>
<p>11. The Declaration upholds the rights of indigenous peoples to develop their own 
</p>
<p>cultures and customs, to the use and control of their ceremonial objects, not to be subjected 
</p>
<p>to destruction of their cultures or to discrimination on cultural grounds, and to redress 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for action that deprives them of their cultural values. 
</p>
<p>12. The International Labour Organization Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 
</p>
<p>(No. 169) contains a number of provisions relating to the cultural heritage of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. Drawing attention to the distinctive contributions of indigenous peoples to the 
</p>
<p>cultural diversity of humankind (preamble), the Convention requires Governments to 
</p>
<p>promote and safeguard the cultures of indigenous peoples through special measures (arts. 2 
</p>
<p>and 4), and to recognize and protect their cultural values and practices (art. 5). 
</p>
<p>Governments are required to respect and safeguard the cultural and traditional values of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and (art. 13) their use and management of the land and natural resources 
</p>
<p>(arts. 14 and 15), and ensure that the traditional activities of indigenous peoples are 
</p>
<p>strengthened and promoted (art. 23). Governments are required to consult with and ensure 
</p>
<p>the effective participation of indigenous peoples at all levels of decision-making in 
</p>
<p>political, legislative and administrative bodies and processes which may affect them 
</p>
<p>directly, including their cultural development, and ensure that studies are carried out to 
</p>
<p>assess, inter alia, the cultural impact of development activities on indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>(arts. 6 and 7). 
</p>
<p>13. The right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage forms part of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law (A/HRC/17/38, para. 78). A number of international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments provide the legal basis for the right of access to and enjoyment of cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 27), the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 15) and the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights (art. 27). The obligation to respect the right to take part in 
</p>
<p>cultural life &#8220;includes the adoption of specific measures aimed at achieving respect for the </p>


<p>right of everyone, individually or in association with others or within a community or group 
</p>
<p>&#8230; to have access to their own cultural and linguistic heritage and to that of others.&#8221;4 
</p>
<p>14. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides for the right of 
</p>
<p>members of minorities to enjoy their own culture, practice their own religion and use their 
</p>
<p>own language (art. 27), while the Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly extends 
</p>
<p>that right to persons of indigenous origin (art. 30) and requires that the education of the 
</p>
<p>child be directed to &#8220;the development of respect for his or her cultural identity, language 
</p>
<p>and values&#8230;&#8221; (art. 29).  
</p>
<p>15. At the regional level, the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights guarantees 
</p>
<p>the right of every individual to freely take part in the cultural life of his or her community 
</p>
<p>(art. 17) and upholds the right of all peoples to their cultural development and the equal 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the common heritage of mankind (art. 22). The American Declaration of the 
</p>
<p>Rights and Duties of Man proclaims the right of every person to take part in the cultural life 
</p>
<p>of the community (art. 13). 
</p>
<p>16. Overall, international and regional human rights instruments guarantee the right to 
</p>
<p>take part in cultural life, the right to enjoy one&#8217;s own culture, and the right to maintain, 
</p>
<p>control, protect and develop one&#8217;s cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural heritage and indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>17. Cultural heritage is a central part of the mandate of UNESCO. The 1972 Convention 
</p>
<p>concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (the World Heritage 
</p>
<p>Convention), addresses both cultural heritage (e.g. sacred sites, monuments or buildings) 
</p>
<p>and natural heritage (e.g. biodiversity hotspots or outstanding geological formations). 
</p>
<p>18. More recent instruments provide greater recognition of the cultural heritage of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. The Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (2001) protects the 
</p>
<p>exchange of cultural heritage, calling specifically for respect for human dignity and 
</p>
<p>commitment to the human rights of minorities and indigenous peoples as a key element to 
</p>
<p>defend cultural diversity (art. 4). The 2003 Convention on the Safeguarding of Intangible 
</p>
<p>Cultural Heritage recognizes that &#8220;communities, in particular indigenous communities, 
</p>
<p>groups and, in some cases, individuals, play an important role in the production, 
</p>
<p>safeguarding, maintenance and re-creation of the intangible cultural heritage&#8221; (preamble). 
</p>
<p>The Operational Directives for the implementation of the Convention emphasize that State 
</p>
<p>activities may only be undertaken with the active involvement or participation of the 
</p>
<p>concerned communities, groups and individuals. In particular, the free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent of the concerned communities is required to inscribe intangible cultural heritage 
</p>
<p>elements on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding or the 
</p>
<p>Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity and to include 
</p>
<p>programmes, projects or activities in the register of best practices (paras. 1, 2, 7 and 101). 
</p>
<p>19. The 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural 
</p>
<p>Expressions refers to the State obligation to pay &#8220;due attention&#8221; to creating an environment 
</p>
<p>conducive to enabling indigenous peoples to create, produce, disseminate and access their 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage through their cultural expressions (art. 7 (a)). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 21 (2009), para. 50. </p>


<p><b> C. Convention on Biological Diversity and Nagoya Protocol 
</b></p>
<p>20. The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity promotes protection of the natural and 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage of indigenous peoples through the conservation of biological diversity and 
</p>
<p>the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic 
</p>
<p>resources (arts. 1 and 19). It requires States to &#8220;respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, 
</p>
<p>innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional 
</p>
<p>lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity &#8230; and 
</p>
<p>encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such 
</p>
<p>knowledge, innovations and practices&#8221; (art. 8 (j)). The Nagoya Protocol on Access to 
</p>
<p>Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their 
</p>
<p>Utilization (2010) is particularly relevant as it requires States to uphold the established 
</p>
<p>rights and customary laws of indigenous peoples and ensure their participation in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Protocol (arts. 5 and 12). The Protocol protects access to indigenous 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage by requiring States to take measures to obtain the prior informed consent 
</p>
<p>and involvement of indigenous communities for access to relevant genetic resources (art. 6) 
</p>
<p>and traditional knowledge (art. 7). 
</p>
<p>21. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations International Treaty 
</p>
<p>on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, recognizing the enormous 
</p>
<p>contribution of indigenous communities to food production worldwide, requires the 
</p>
<p>Contracting parties to take measures to protect traditional knowledge relevant to plant 
</p>
<p>genetic resources for food and agriculture (art. 9) and promote wild crops and plants by 
</p>
<p>supporting the efforts of indigenous communities (art. 5). 
</p>
<p><b> D. World Intellectual Property Organization 
</b></p>
<p>22. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has three conventions that are 
</p>
<p>particularly relevant to the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples. The Berne Convention 
</p>
<p>for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886) provides a mechanism to ensure 
</p>
<p>international protection of anonymous, pseudonymous and unpublished works, including 
</p>
<p>traditional cultural expressions (art. 15); the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty 
</p>
<p>(1996) provides for international protection for performances and phonographic recordings 
</p>
<p>of expressions of folklore (arts. 2 and 33); and the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual 
</p>
<p>Performances (2012), which, upon entry into force, will provide protection to performers of 
</p>
<p>expressions of folklore with regard to authorizing their performances in audiovisual media. 
</p>
<p>23. In 2000, WIPO members established an Intergovernmental Committee on 
</p>
<p>Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore to serve 
</p>
<p>as a forum to discuss intellectual property issues arising in the context of access to genetic 
</p>
<p>resources and benefit-sharing, and protection of traditional knowledge and traditional 
</p>
<p>cultural expressions. In 2009, the Committee initiated formal text-based negotiations with 
</p>
<p>the objective of reaching agreement on texts of international legal instruments to ensure the 
</p>
<p>effective protection of genetic resources, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural 
</p>
<p>expressions. 
</p>
<p>24. Although a multitude of legal regimes exist to protect cultural heritage, there is a 
</p>
<p>lack of adequate integration of protections for indigenous peoples. Such complex and 
</p>
<p>parallel systems of protection of cultural heritage leads to fragmentation within a multitude 
</p>
<p>of legal frameworks, which ultimately do not adequately protect the cultural heritage of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. The systems fail to recognize that, for indigenous peoples, cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage is holistic and encompasses their spiritual, economic and social connections to 
</p>
<p>their lands and territories. </p>


<p><b> III. Overview of the jurisprudence on rights relating to cultural 
heritage 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>25. Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protects the 
</p>
<p>cultural rights of indigenous peoples. In its general comment No. 23 (1994), the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee observed that &#8220;culture manifests itself in many forms, including a 
</p>
<p>particular way of life associated with the use of land resources, especially in the case of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8221; (para. 7). With regard to the relationship between land and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights, the approach is that, where land is of central significance to the sustenance of a 
</p>
<p>culture, the right to enjoy one&#8217;s culture requires the protection of land5 and the recognition 
</p>
<p>of land rights for indigenous peoples, as reiterated in several concluding observations and 
</p>
<p>individual communications of the Committee. Avoiding the danger of adopting an overly 
</p>
<p>rigid or &#8220;frozen&#8221; approach to the definition of cultural activities, the Committee has 
</p>
<p>consistently underlined that indigenous peoples who have adapted their methods of carrying 
</p>
<p>out traditional activities over the years and have incorporated the use of modern technology 
</p>
<p>are not prevented from invoking protection under the Covenant.6 
</p>
<p>26. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has been particularly 
</p>
<p>proactive in recognizing the cultural rights of indigenous peoples.7 In its general comment 
</p>
<p>No. 21, the Committee noted that: 
</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to act collectively to ensure respect for their right 
</p>
<p>to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their 
</p>
<p>sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, 
</p>
<p>medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literature, 
</p>
<p>designs, sports and traditional games, and visual and performing arts. (para. 37) 
</p>
<p>27. The Committee has also expressed concern about the lack of adequate protection for 
</p>
<p>and information on the intellectual property rights and cultural heritage of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples (E/C.12/RUS/CO/5, para. 34) and the restrictions to land and resources and the lack

<p>of involvement of indigenous peoples in decision-making processes regarding land rights, 
</p>
<p>which pose a threat to the realization of their cultural life (E/C.12/TZA/CO/1-3, para. 29).  
</p>
<p>28. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination made a direct 
</p>
<p>connection between the cultural rights and land rights of indigenous peoples, and between 
</p>
<p>their language and cultural heritage.8 It recommended that States parties respect indigenous 
</p>
<p>culture, history, language and way of life as an enrichment of the State&#8217;s cultural identity 
</p>

<p><b> B. Special procedures of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>and Protection of Minorities, Erica-Irene Daes, conducted studies on the protection of the 
</p>
<p>cultural and intellectual property of indigenous peoples (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/28) and on the 
</p>
<p>protection of the heritage of indigenous peoples (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1995/26). The studies 
</p>
<p>considered measures to strengthen respect for the cultural and intellectual property of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, and included the draft principles and guidelines for the protection of 
</p>
<p>the heritage of indigenous peoples (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1995/26, annex), which set standards for 
</p>
<p>governments to ensure that the heritage of indigenous peoples survives for future 
</p>
<p>generations and continues to enrich the common heritage of humanity.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights has made recommendations on 
</p>
<p>the right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage for all persons, which are relevant 
</p>
<p>to indigenous peoples (A/HRC/17/38). She underlined the need to build stronger 
</p>
<p>relationships between cultural institutions and communities, including indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>and to develop good practices (para. 16). 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has consistently 
</p>
<p>addressed the issue of cultural heritage in thematic and country reports, documenting 
</p>
<p>instances where indigenous peoples have had major concerns regarding the protection of 
</p>
<p>their cultural heritage, such as the endangerment of their sacred places, heritage languages 
</p>
<p>and cultures (A/HRC/21/47/Add.1, appendix II, para. 107), and the lack of control by 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to establish their historical cultural heritage sites (A/HRC/15/37/Add.5, 
</p>
<p>para. 64). The Special Rapporteur has highlighted how the cultural heritage of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples could be put in jeopardy when extractive industries or large-scale developmental 
</p>
<p>projects invade indigenous peoples&#8217; territories,9 and the importance of education, 
</p>
<p>particularly the role of indigenous languages, in the preservation of cultural heritage.10 In 
</p>
<p>particular, the Special Rapporteur has drawn attention to the lack of inclusion and 
</p>
<p>participation of indigenous peoples in the nomination and management of world heritage 
</p>
<p>sites under the World Heritage Convention (A/67/301, paras. 33&#8211;42). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Regional human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>32. Regional courts and human rights commissions have lent robust support to the rights 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples to their cultural heritage. The Inter-American Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights have firmly established that 
</p>
<p>States should create effective mechanisms for titling and demarcating the lands, territories 
</p>
<p>and resources of indigenous peoples in accordance with their customs, cultures and 
</p>
<p>traditions.11 The Court has emphasized that the close relationship between indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples and their land must be recognized and understood as the fundamental base of their 
</p>
<p>culture, spiritual life, integrity, economic survival and cultural preservation.12 
</p>
<p>33. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has also examined the 
</p>
<p>right to cultural heritage as it applies to indigenous peoples. In the Endorois decision, the 
</p>

</p>
<p>of 17 June 2005 (Series C, No. 125), para. 131. </p>


<p>Commission highlighted that article 17 of the Charter was dual dimensional in both its 
</p>
<p>individual and collective nature, protecting, on the one hand, individuals&#8217; participation in 
</p>
<p>the cultural life of their community and, on the other hand, obliging the State to promote 
</p>
<p>and protect the traditional values recognized by a community.13 It added that article 17 
</p>
<p>required governments to take measures aimed at the conservation, development and 
</p>
<p>diffusion of culture, such as promoting awareness and enjoyment of the cultural heritage of 
</p>
<p>national ethnic groups and minorities and of indigenous sectors of the population.14 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Participation of indigenous peoples in cultural heritage 
policies 
</b></p>
<p>34. Effective participation in decision-making processes relating to cultural heritage is 
</p>
<p>crucial for indigenous peoples, who are often the victims of both cultural and natural 
</p>
<p>heritage protection policies that fail to take their rights and perspectives into consideration. 
</p>
<p>35. The rights to effective participation, consultation and consent are strongly expressed 
</p>
<p>in several articles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>Article 32 requires States to consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free 
</p>
<p>and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories 
</p>
<p>and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or 
</p>
<p>exploitation of mineral, water or other resources. This provision relates to any decisions 
</p>
<p>that would affect the lands and territories of indigenous peoples, including the classification 
</p>
<p>of their lands as cultural or natural heritage sites. 
</p>
<p>36. Free, prior and informed consent is a key element of human rights jurisprudence. 
</p>
<p>The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights calls on States to &#8220;respect the 
</p>
<p>principle of free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples in all matters covered 
</p>
<p>by their specific rights&#8221;,15 and has also put great emphasis on such consent in the context of 
</p>
<p>their cultural heritage (E/C.12/TZA/CO/1-3, para. 29). The Human Rights Committee, in 
</p>
<p>several concluding observations, has highlighted that it is essential for States to ensure the 
</p>
<p>participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making processes that would affect their 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, stressing the need to seek their consent on all matters affecting them 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/PAN/CO/3, para. 21; CCPR/C/KEN/CO/3, para. 24). 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights has underlined that the 
</p>
<p>participation of individuals and communities in cultural heritage matters is crucial and that. 
</p>
<p>the power differentials that exist between, as well as within, communities must be taken 
</p>
<p>into consideration, as they impact the ability of individuals and groups to effectively 
</p>
<p>contribute to the identification, development and interpretation of what should be 
</p>
<p>considered as a common &#8220;culture&#8221; or shared cultural heritage. She considered that it was 
</p>
<p>also important to fully respect the freedom of individuals to participate or not in one or 
</p>
<p>several communities, to develop their multiple identities, to access their cultural heritage as 
</p>
<p>well as that of others, and to contribute to the creation of culture, including through the 
</p>
<p>contestation of dominant norms and values within the communities they belong to as well 
</p>
<p>as those of other communities (A/HRC/17/38 and Corr.1, para. 10). In this respect, 
</p>
<p>particular attention should be paid to the position of women within indigenous

<p>communities, and States should ensure that diverse women&#8217;s voices within specific 
</p>
<p>communities are heard and that their human rights are not sacrificed in the name of culture 
</p>
<p>(A/67/287, para. 80). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Participation at the international level 
</b></p>
<p>38. Since the adoption of the Declaration, there have been repeated complaints by 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and human rights organizations about violations of the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples in the implementation of the World Heritage Convention.16 There is no 
</p>
<p>procedure to ensure the participation of indigenous peoples in the nomination and 
</p>
<p>management of World Heritage sites nor is there a policy to ensure their free, prior and 
</p>
<p>informed consent to the nomination of such sites.17 Both the Permanent Forum on 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism have emphasized the importance of obtaining 
</p>
<p>the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples with regard to territories 
</p>
<p>proposed for nomination and inscription as World Heritage sites. The Expert Mechanism 
</p>
<p>also noted that &#8220;robust procedures and mechanisms should be established to ensure 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples are adequately consulted and involved in the management and 
</p>
<p>protection of World Heritage sites&#8221; (A/HRC/18/42, annex, para. 38). 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights recommended that States seek 
</p>
<p>the free, prior and informed consent of source communities before adopting measures 
</p>
<p>concerning their specific cultural heritage, in particular in the case of indigenous peoples, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. She 
</p>
<p>specifically emphasized that no inscription on UNESCO lists relating to cultural heritage or 
</p>
<p>national lists or registers should be requested or granted without the free, prior and 
</p>
<p>informed consent of the communities concerned (A/HRC/17/38 and Corr.1, para. 80). 
</p>
<p>40. In 2011, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights adopted a 
</p>
<p>resolution condemning the inscription of Lake Bogoria National Reserve in Kenya on the 
</p>
<p>World Heritage List, as the World Heritage Committee had failed to respect the rights of 
</p>
<p>the Endorois community.18 In the resolution, the African Commission noted that many sites 
</p>
<p>&#8220;have been inscribed without the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>in whose territories they are located and whose management frameworks are not consistent 
</p>
<p>with the principles of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&#8221;. The 
</p>
<p>resolution drew attention to the general lack of respect for the rights of indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>in the context of nomination of World Heritage sites. 
</p>
<p>41. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature World Conservation 
</p>
<p>Congress adopted a resolution calling on the World Heritage Committee to review and 
</p>
<p>revise its procedures in consultation with indigenous peoples to ensure that their rights are 
</p>
<p>upheld and implemented in the management and protection of existing World Heritage 
</p>
<p>sites. The aim of the resolution is to make the decision-making process consistent with the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to ensure that no World Heritage sites

<p>are established in the territories of indigenous peoples without their free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent.19 
</p>
<p>42. International Finance Corporation performance standard 7 on indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>states that &#8220;where a project may significantly impact on critical cultural heritage that is 
</p>
<p>essential to the identity and/or cultural, ceremonial, or spiritual aspects of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; lives, priority will be given to the avoidance of such impacts. Where significant 
</p>
<p>project impacts on critical cultural heritage are unavoidable, the client will obtain the FPIC 
</p>
<p>of the Affected Communities of Indigenous Peoples&#8221; (para. 16). The adoption of this 
</p>
<p>standard by a corporation that supports investments globally is significant and indicates that 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations are not limited to the public sector. Nonetheless, it has been 
</p>
<p>widely observed that the requirements of participation and consultation, and in particular 
</p>
<p>the requirement to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples, are 
</p>
<p>not yet properly implemented and respected at the international level. 
</p>
<p>43. Some questions have also been raised with regard to the rights of women in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural 
</p>
<p>Heritage. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights stressed that article 13 (d) 
</p>
<p>(ii) of the Convention, according to which access to cultural heritage should be ensured 
</p>
<p>&#8220;while respecting customary practices governing access to specific aspects of such 
</p>
<p>heritage&#8221;, cannot be interpreted as permitting gender-based discrimination. Distinctions 
</p>
<p>must not lead to indirect or structural discrimination against women and girls (A/67/287, 
</p>
<p>para. 63). 
</p>
<p>44. Since its inception, the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee has been trying to 
</p>
<p>support an inclusive approach to promote the direct involvement of all stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>especially indigenous peoples and local communities. During all its sessions, indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples may intervene on any issue on the agenda and make draft proposals, which could 
</p>
<p>be incorporated into the text under discussion if supported by at least one member State. In 
</p>
<p>2005, the WIPO General Assembly established a voluntary fund to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>participation of accredited indigenous peoples and local communities. Through this 
</p>
<p>mechanism, representatives of more than 80 indigenous peoples and local communities 
</p>
<p>worldwide have received funding to participate in sessions of the Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Committee. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>45. In its general comment No. 21, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights emphasized that States had an obligation to allow and encourage the participation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples in the design and implementation of laws and policies that affect 
</p>
<p>them.20 In particular, States parties should obtain their free, prior and informed consent 
</p>
<p>when the preservation of cultural resources, especially those associated with their way of 
</p>
<p>life and cultural expression, are at risk. This includes decisions to classify their territories 
</p>
<p>under the label of Cultural or Natural Heritage Sites. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights has stressed that concerned 
</p>
<p>communities and individuals should be consulted and be able to actively participate in the 
</p>
<p>process of identification, selection, classification, interpretation, preservation/safeguard, 
</p>
<p>stewardship and development of cultural heritage. Furthermore, States have the duty not to

</p>

<p>destroy, damage or alter cultural heritage, at least not without the free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent of concerned communities, and to take measures to preserve/safeguard cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage from destruction or damage by third parties (A/HRC/17/38, para. 80 (b) and (c)). 
</p>
<p>47. Indigenous peoples in Canada are actively involved in the protection of their cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage and have been supported by formal legislation in this area. For example, the 
</p>
<p>Province of British Columbia enacted the Heritage Conservation Act of 1996, which was 
</p>
<p>created in order &#8220;to encourage and facilitate the protection and conservation of heritage 
</p>
<p>property in British Columbia.&#8221; This includes ensuring that indigenous peoples are consulted 
</p>
<p>on the status of cultural heritage sites and objects within their traditional lands and 
</p>
<p>territories. Another positive example is the recent nomination of Pimachiowin Aki as a 
</p>
<p>World Heritage site, a joint effort of two Canadian provinces and the First Nations 
</p>
<p>affected.21 
</p>
<p>48. The Australian National Committee of the International Council on Monuments and 
</p>
<p>Sites adopted the Burra Charter for Places of Cultural Significance (2013) as a best practice 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage conservation and management guide. The conservation principles set out 
</p>
<p>in the Burra Charter form the basis for management of all places of cultural significance in 
</p>
<p>Australia. The Charter establishes appropriate decision-making procedures and ensures the 
</p>
<p>participation of cultural groups affected by the decisions.22 
</p>
<p>49. The 2012 Free, Prior and Informed Consent Guidelines of the National Commission 
</p>
<p>on Indigenous Peoples of the Philippines mentions sacred grounds, burial sites and cultural 
</p>
<p>and heritage sites as areas excluded for any activity except for exclusive purposes where 
</p>
<p>they are identified. However, it seems that its implementation remains a huge challenge, 
</p>
<p>owing to the manipulation of the process by interested parties.23 
</p>
<p>50. The indigenous peoples of the States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) 
</p>
<p>participated in the creation of a draft CARICOM regional framework, which seeks to 
</p>
<p>establish a regional instrument for the protection of genetic resources, traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, while ensuring the free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent of the rightful owners/holders/beneficiaries on mutually agreed terms and with fair 
</p>
<p>and equitable benefit-sharing.24 
</p>
<p>51. While there are some good practices emerging at the national level, there are still 
</p>
<p>many instances where indigenous peoples have not been allowed to participate in decision-
</p>
<p>making processes that affect their cultural heritage.25 In 2011, for example, the Western 
</p>
<p>Ghats (India) and the Sangha Trinational (Congo/Cameroon/Central African Republic) 
</p>
<p>were inscribed as natural World Heritage sites, despite the fact that in both situations, 
</p>
<p>serious objections were raised about the lack of any meaningful participation of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples living in the respective areas. In both cases, there was a blatant lack of respect for 
</p>
<p>the free, prior and informed consent of the concerned communities, as the affected

<p>indigenous peoples had not even seen the submitted nomination documents, which had not 
</p>
<p>been made publicly available.26 
</p>
<p><b> V. Specific issues relating to the rights of indigenous peoples 
with respect to their cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Lands, territories and cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>52. Access to and use of lands, territories and the environment are essential elements of 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage for many indigenous peoples. The connection between land rights and 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage is strongly embedded in international legal instruments and in international 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence. Many human rights institutions have highlighted that ownership, control and 
</p>
<p>management of their ancestral territories constitutes an essential element of the cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage of indigenous peoples.27 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</p>
<p>calls on States to &#8220;respect the rights of indigenous peoples to their culture and heritage and 
</p>
<p>to maintain and strengthen their spiritual relationship with their ancestral lands and other 
</p>
<p>natural resources traditionally owned, occupied or used by them, and indispensable to their 
</p>
<p>cultural life.&#8221;28 
</p>
<p>53. Both the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Court of Human Rights have given prominence to the importance of land and 
</p>
<p>territorial rights in their decisions, emphasizing that land rights constitute a foundation for 
</p>
<p>the cultural integrity of indigenous peoples, including their rights to culture, religion, 
</p>
<p>health, development and natural resources.29 Both recognize the spiritual value that 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples attach to their territories as part of their cultural heritage. The protection 
</p>
<p>of sacred sites is a key element of indigenous peoples&#8217; territorial rights, and therefore of 
</p>
<p>their cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>54. Lack of recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; land rights and their relationships with 
</p>
<p>their territories negatively affects their right to enjoy, access and promote their cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage. As such, no policy or legislation can adequately address the cultural heritage of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples without recognizing their fundamental rights to their lands and 
</p>
<p>territories. 
</p>
<p>55. The establishment of World Heritage sites, or other forms of protected areas can 
</p>
<p>have a negative impact on indigenous peoples because, often, their ancestral rights over 
</p>
<p>their lands and territories are not respected or protected. In many nature-protected areas, 
</p>
<p>including areas inscribed on the World Heritage List, narrow restrictions are imposed on 
</p>
<p>traditional practices and activities, such as hunting, gathering, farming or animal husbandry, 
</p>
<p>in violation of the cultural and subsistence rights of indigenous peoples. To be included on 
</p>
<p>the World Heritage List, sites must be of &#8220;outstanding universal value&#8221;, a concept which 
</p>
<p>can lead to management frameworks that prioritize the protection of those heritage aspects

<p>at the expense of the land rights of indigenous peoples. As a result, the protection of world 
</p>
<p>heritage can undermine indigenous peoples&#8217; relationship with their traditional lands, 
</p>
<p>territories and resources, as well as their livelihoods and cultural heritage, especially in sites 
</p>
<p>where the natural values are deemed to be of outstanding universal value but the cultural 
</p>
<p>values of indigenous peoples are not taken into account. 
</p>
<p>56. Non-State actors who invade indigenous peoples&#8217; territories often negatively impact 
</p>
<p>the fundamental connection between land rights and cultural heritage. Extractive industries 
</p>
<p>and other business can result in profound and often irreversible damage to the cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage of indigenous peoples. There is an urgent need to protect indigenous natural 
</p>
<p>heritage from the operations of extractive industries and to recognize indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>substantive rights to self-determination. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Traditional knowledge, intellectual property and cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>57. Traditional knowledge can be understood as a living body of knowledge that is 
</p>
<p>developed, sustained and passed on from generation to generation within a community, 
</p>
<p>often forming part of its cultural and spiritual identity. It encompasses knowledge, know-
</p>
<p>how, skills, innovations and practices. Traditional knowledge also encompasses traditional 
</p>
<p>cultural expressions, including dances, songs, handicrafts, designs, ceremonies, tales, or 
</p>
<p>other artistic or cultural expressions. Intellectual property protection could make it possible 
</p>
<p>to protect traditional remedies and indigenous crafts and music against misappropriation 
</p>
<p>and enable communities to control and benefit collectively from their commercial 
</p>
<p>exploitation. 
</p>
<p>58. In recent years, indigenous peoples, local communities and governments, mainly in 
</p>
<p>developing countries, have demanded intellectual property protection for traditional forms 
</p>
<p>of creativity and innovation. Indigenous peoples have expressed concern that existing 
</p>
<p>international mechanisms to protect intellectual property are inadequate. They note that the 
</p>
<p>intellectual property system focuses on protecting the intellectual property of individuals, 
</p>
<p>rather than collectives, and views intellectual property as alienable, which is not consistent 
</p>
<p>with indigenous peoples&#8217; laws and policies related to their knowledge (A/HRC/21/53, 
</p>
<p>para. 62). Furthermore, indigenous peoples reject the &#8220;public domain&#8221; status of traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge and traditional cultural expressions and argue that it opens them up to 
</p>
<p>misappropriation and misuse. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Tourism and cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>59. Cultural heritage has acquired enormous economic value as one of the mainstays of 
</p>
<p>the tourism industry, often negatively impacting the rights of indigenous peoples. The 
</p>
<p>inscription of sites on the World Heritage List is a catalyst for rapid tourism development. 
</p>
<p>However, indigenous peoples rarely benefit from the often large-scale developments on 
</p>
<p>their territories. 
</p>
<p>60. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area in the United Republic of Tanzania, which is 
</p>
<p>classified as a World Natural Heritage site and constitutes a key tourist destination, 
</p>
<p>provides very little benefit to the indigenous peoples of the area.30 Pastoralist organizations 
</p>
<p>have urged the Government to ensure that the income accruing from tourism in the area is 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 30 W. Olenasha, &#8220;A World Heritage Site in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area&#8221;, S. Disko and H. 
</p>
<p>Tugendhat (eds.), <i>World Heritage Sites </i>and Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights, p. 214 (see footnote 25 
</p>
<p>above).  </p>


<p>distributed equally. This is certainly not an isolated situation. It is essential that benefit-
</p>
<p>sharing mechanisms be established in cases of tourism development on indigenous 
</p>
<p>territories. 
</p>
<p>61. Misappropriation of the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples by the tourism 
</p>
<p>industry is another issue. For example, the Saami costume, a symbol of the cultural heritage 
</p>
<p>of the Saami people, is misused in many ways by the tourism industry in Finland. Gift 
</p>
<p>shops often sell handicrafts with Saami designs that are not produced by indigenous crafters 
</p>
<p>or use traditional Saami styles and colours in products that are in no way related to Saami 
</p>
<p>culture. Imitations of the Saami costume are also often misused in tourism as employees&#8217; 
</p>
<p>uniforms.31 Such misappropriation of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural heritage by the tourism 
</p>
<p>industry has detrimental effects on their identity and self-image. It is important that States 
</p>
<p>monitor the tourism industry to ensure the protection of the cultural heritage of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Sports and traditional games 
</b></p>
<p>62. Sports and traditional games have been recognized as integral parts of the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as affirmed in article 31 of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration. This right to sports and traditional games has been explicitly recognized by the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, in the report on its fourth session (E/2005/43). 
</p>
<p>63. The benefits and value of sports and traditional games, which are also alluded to in 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child, are an important component in ensuring that 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples are able to freely determine and pursue their cultural development as 
</p>
<p>part of their right to self-determination, as set out in articles 3 and 5 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>64. The Mato Grosso Declaration, adopted at the Second International Sports Congress 
</p>
<p>held in Cuiab&#225;, Brazil, from 9 to 16 November 2013, called on States and governments to 
</p>
<p>join indigenous peoples in partnership and mutual respect in implementing their right to 
</p>
<p>self-determination through sports and traditional games as well as the manifestations of 
</p>
<p>their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/CRP.2, annex, 
</p>
<p>para. 2). 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Cultural appropriation, restitution and repatriation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Cultural misappropriation and interpretation 
</b></p>
<p>65. Many indigenous peoples are affected by the misappropriation of their cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage, which may take many forms, including commodification, the use of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; imagery and symbols in marketing, and the misappropriation of traditional songs. 
</p>
<p>A recent settlement included the requirement to recognize the indigenous composer of the 
</p>
<p>Maori <i>haka</i> (tribal war dance) whenever it is used in public or commercial situations.32 
</p>
<p>66. Cultural misinterpretation is another issue that negatively impacts the cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage of indigenous peoples. This occurs when visitor centres, interpretive signage, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 31 See the submission from the Saami Parliamentary Council of Finland; and the presentation by 
</p>
<p>Piia Nuorgam, Expert Seminar on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights with Respect to their Cultural Heritage, 
</p>
<p>2015. 
</p>
<p> 32 See the submission from the New Zealand Human Rights Commission. </p>


<p>information brochures, guided tours or audio guides on cultural or natural heritage sites do 
</p>
<p>not provide correct information regarding indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural or natural heritage 
</p>
<p>or do not reflect their particular interpretation of the cultural or natural heritage in question. 
</p>
<p>67. Museums are regarded as sources of education and cultural understanding. In 
</p>
<p>particular, museums provide a space for displaying artefacts and objects that represent 
</p>
<p>particular events and the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. For 
</p>
<p>example, the National Museum of the American Indian and the Canadian Museum for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, among others, display original copies of treaties signed between the 
</p>
<p>Government of Canada, the British Crown, the Government of the United States of 
</p>
<p>America and indigenous peoples. The significance of those displays is the vital role of 
</p>
<p>spirituality and the cultural ceremony of treaty-making. Museums are an important space 
</p>
<p>for the promotion and appreciation of indigenous cultural heritage. The S&#225;mi Museum Siida 
</p>
<p>is an example of how museums that are managed by indigenous peoples themselves play a 
</p>
<p>key role in the preservation, promotion and transmission of cultural heritage.33 
</p>
<p>68. However, museums often contribute to the misappropriation of the cultural heritage 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples. Many museums, both private and public, hold and display the 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage of indigenous peoples without the consent of the peoples concerned. For 
</p>
<p>example, the Swedish National Museum of Ethnography currently holds a ceremonial deer 
</p>
<p>head (<i>Maaso Kova</i>), a sacred item of the highest spiritual and cultural significance for the 
</p>
<p>Yaqui Nation, used in the Yaqui Deer Dance ceremony. Despite many official requests for 
</p>
<p>restitution, the museum authorities have refused to return the deer head.34 Unfortunately, 
</p>
<p>this is not an isolated situation. Many cultural items and human remains of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples are held by public museums and by private collectors worldwide, without the free, 
</p>
<p>prior and informed consent of the peoples concerned. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Restitution and repatriation 
</b></p>
<p>69. The right to redress and restitution where violations of the rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples have occurred is a foundational element to ensuring reconciliation and the future 
</p>
<p>commitment to protecting the rights of indigenous peoples. Under human rights law, there 
</p>
<p>is a strong principle in favour of restitution when a violation has occurred. The Declaration 
</p>
<p>affirms that &#8220;States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include 
</p>
<p>restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, 
</p>
<p>intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs&#8221; (art. 11). 
</p>
<p>70. The establishment and management of protected cultural heritage sites have often 
</p>
<p>resulted in indigenous peoples&#8217; dispossession of and alienation from their traditional lands 
</p>
<p>and resources. In such cases, indigenous peoples are entitled to restitution of their ancestral 
</p>
<p>lands. The right to restitution of land and territories obtained without their consent 
</p>
<p>constitutes a key component of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.35 
</p>
<p>71. The repatriation of the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples is an important aspect 
</p>
<p>of such restitution. The ancient burial grounds of many indigenous communities have been 
</p>
<p>disrespected and the communities concerned have asked for the repatriation of human 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>Respect to their Cultural Heritage, 2015.

</p>
<p> 35 Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, general recommendation No. 23 (1997), 
</p>
<p>para. 5. </p>


<p>remains and sacred and cultural objects, whether held in private or public collections.36 The 
</p>
<p>General Assembly affirmed and recognized the importance of repatriating indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; ceremonial objects and human remains.37 
</p>
<p>72. Although some potential avenues for redress or protection might exist in legal terms, 
</p>
<p>notably via the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law Convention on 
</p>
<p>Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects (2005), in reality it is extremely difficult for 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to receive proper protection and reparation when their cultural heritage, 
</p>
<p>particularly intangible heritage, is misappropriated. While the role of public authorities is 
</p>
<p>crucial to ensuring such repatriation, the repatriation of ceremonial objects and human 
</p>
<p>remains requires the cooperation of the places where the objects and remains are stored, 
</p>
<p>such as museums and auction houses. 
</p>
<p>73. Some legislation and policies stipulating repatriation of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage exist. In 2011, the Australian Government adopted a policy on indigenous 
</p>
<p>repatriation which facilitates the return of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders&#8217; ancestral 
</p>
<p>remains from overseas institutions to their communities of origin. To date, this programme 
</p>
<p>has facilitated the return of over 1,400 ancestral remains and over 1,400 sacred objects from 
</p>
<p>within Australian collections, and brought home more than 1,200 ancestral remains to 
</p>
<p>Australia from overseas.38 Other examples include the Native American Grave Protection 
</p>
<p>and Repatriation Act and the National Museum of the American Indian Act in the United 
</p>
<p>States.39 In Canada, the First Nations Sacred Ceremonial Objects Repatriation Act creates a 
</p>
<p>mechanism by which cultural heritage sites and objects can be protected, preserved and 
</p>
<p>repatriated. However, numerous examples throughout the world exist where restitution and 
</p>
<p>repatriation are not respected and enforced. One such example is the recent legal case 
</p>
<p>against indigenous chiefs in Canada, including Bernie Makokis, under the Wildlife Act, 
</p>
<p>after they had offered a sacred headdress as a gift to a non-indigenous guest from the 
</p>
<p>United States.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to cultural revitalization 
</b></p>
<p>74. Article 11 of the Declaration states that &#8220;indigenous peoples have the right to 
</p>
<p>practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs&#8221;. During the Expert Seminar on 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights with Respect to their Cultural Heritage, many presentations 
</p>
<p>highlighted how important the process of cultural revitalization is for the cultural heritage 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples. Some positive examples of indigenous peoples taking the initiative 
</p>
<p>to revitalize their cultural heritage exist, such as the revitalization of the Maori language, or 
</p>
<p>the use of bilingual education programmes and radio to strengthen and revitalize indigenous 
</p>
<p>languages in Mexico.40  
</p>
<p>75. The increasing recognition of food production systems and seeds as cultural heritage 
</p>
<p>is another instance of cultural revitalization. In Guatemala, for example, corn is considered 
</p>
<p>intangible cultural heritage due to its historical, cultural, and spiritual value.41 
</p>
<p>76. In terms of good practices, the Indigenous Rights Programme of the National 
</p>
<p>Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, in Mexico, has implemented a 
</p>
<p>programme on cultural rights, which supports community-level initiatives to revitalize 
</p>

<p>cultural heritage among indigenous peoples, including languages, music and traditional 
</p>
<p>medicine. This includes training for indigenous youth on the protection of cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>To date, the programme has supported 505 community initiatives.42 Another important 
</p>
<p>element relating to the revitalization of indigenous cultures is the recognition of indigenous 
</p>
<p>women as active agents of transformation. Recent studies have demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>indigenous women play an immense role in the revitalization and the transmission of the 
</p>
<p>cosmovision and cultural heritage of indigenous peoples.43

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Expert Mechanism advice No. 8 (2015): 
  Promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples with respect to their cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>1. The cultural heritage of indigenous peoples is a holistic and inter-generational 
</p>
<p>concept based on common material and spiritual values and includes distinctive 
</p>
<p>manifestations in language, spirituality, membership, the arts, literature, traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge, customs, rituals, ceremonies, methods of production, festive events, music, 
</p>
<p>sports and traditional games, behaviour, habits, tools, shelter, clothing, economic activities, 
</p>
<p>morals, value systems, cosmovision, laws and activities such as hunting, fishing, trapping 
</p>
<p>and gathering. 
</p>
<p>2. The cultural heritage of indigenous peoples is comprised of all objects, sites, plants 
</p>
<p>and animal species, customs and practices, expressions, beliefs and knowledge, the nature 
</p>
<p>or use of which has been transmitted from generation to generation, and which are regarded 
</p>
<p>as pertaining to a particular people or its territory. 
</p>
<p>3. The cultural heritage of indigenous peoples includes tangible and intangible 
</p>
<p>manifestations of their ways of life, achievements and creativity, and should be considered 
</p>
<p>an expression of their self-determination and of their spiritual and physical relationships 
</p>
<p>with their lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p>4. The right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage forms part of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law and represents an important aspect of the rights of indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>including the right to take part in cultural life, the right to enjoy their own culture and the 
</p>
<p>right to self-determination. The right of indigenous peoples to self-determination implies 
</p>
<p>their right to maintain, control, protect and develop their own cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>5. The safeguard and development of the cultures of indigenous peoples require the 
</p>
<p>protection of their lands, territories and resources. Cultural rights entail rights to land and 
</p>
<p>natural resources, and imply an obligation to protect the cultural heritage of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples through the recognition of their rights to own, control and manage their ancestral 
</p>
<p>territories. 
</p>
<p>6. Heritage policies, programmes and activities affecting indigenous peoples should be 
</p>
<p>based on full recognition of the inseparability of natural and cultural heritage, and the deep-
</p>
<p>seated interconnectedness of intangible cultural heritage and tangible cultural and natural 
</p>
<p>heritage. 
</p>
<p>7. For indigenous peoples, cultural and natural values are inseparably interwoven and 
</p>
<p>should be managed and protected in a holistic manner. It is imperative that all the 
</p>
<p>instruments that derive from such regimes and relate to the cultural heritage of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples are interpreted in the light of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of </p>


<p>Indigenous Peoples, which is the most specific, representative and comprehensive 
</p>
<p>instrument on indigenous cultural heritage.44 
</p>
<p>8. Indigenous peoples have the right to redress when their cultural heritage is 
</p>
<p>misappropriated without their free, prior and informed consent. This includes a right to 
</p>
<p>repatriation and restitution. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Advice for States 
</b></p>
<p>9. States should recognize the value and livelihood aspects of the cultural heritage of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, which is not limited to the protection of specific manifestations, 
</p>
<p>symbols or objects, but also includes tangible and intangible manifestations of their ways of 
</p>
<p>life, achievements and creativity, and of their spiritual and physical relationships with their 
</p>
<p>lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p>10. Indigenous peoples should be consulted and enabled to actively participate in the 
</p>
<p>whole process of identification, evaluation, classification, interpretation, preservation, 
</p>
<p>safeguarding, monitoring, stewardship and development of their cultural and natural 
</p>
<p>heritage.  
</p>
<p>11. States should revisit the draft Principles and guidelines for the protection of the 
</p>
<p>heritage of indigenous peoples (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1995/26, annex), with a view to adopting 
</p>
<p>them as an instrument to protect the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>12. In accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples, States have the obligation to seek the free, prior and informed consent of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples before adopting measures affecting their cultural or natural heritage. No 
</p>
<p>inscription on lists of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
</p>
<p>(UNESCO) relating to the cultural or natural heritage of indigenous peoples or national lists 
</p>
<p>or registers should be requested or granted without the free, prior and informed consent of 
</p>
<p>the indigenous peoples concerned. 
</p>
<p>13. States need to legally recognize and protect the right of indigenous peoples to their 
</p>
<p>lands, territories and resources through appropriate measures and policies, including 
</p>
<p>declaring cultural heritage sites, sacred sites and other areas of spiritual significance to 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples as &#8220;no-go zones&#8221; for extractive industries, tourism development and 
</p>
<p>other development projects which have not received the free, prior and informed consent of 
</p>
<p>the indigenous peoples concerned. 
</p>
<p>14. States need to harmonize their national legislations based on the provisions of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration and taking note of the outcome document of the World Conference on 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples (General Assembly resolution 69/2), and should develop national action 
</p>
<p>plans for the protection and promotion of the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>15. In the case of cross-border indigenous peoples, bordering States should ensure the 
</p>
<p>protection of cultural rights on an equal basis. 
</p>
<p>16. States should ensure that the benefits arising from the use of the lands, territories and 
</p>
<p>resources of indigenous peoples&#8217; as World Heritage sites are defined by and genuinely 
</p>
<p>accrue to the indigenous peoples concerned, in a fair and equitable manner. 
</p>
<p>17. States should guarantee that indigenous peoples have available financial resources 
</p>
<p>that effectively allow them to maintain, safeguard and protect their cultural heritage, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 44 Presentations by Alexandra Xanthaki, Expert Seminar on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights with Respect to 
</p>
<p>their Cultural Heritage, 2015.  </p>


<p>including through the recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to control and benefit from 
</p>
<p>their natural resources, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.  
</p>
<p>18. States should provide measures for the revitalization and transmission of the cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage of indigenous peoples in formal and informal education, including the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages through effective mother tongue education 
</p>
<p>for indigenous children.  
</p>
<p>19. States should take effective measures to assess, redress and remedy the effects of 
</p>
<p>past injustices and violations of the rights of indigenous peoples by ensuring the restitution 
</p>
<p>and repatriation of their cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>20. States should increase their financial support to museums that are owned and 
</p>
<p>managed by indigenous peoples, as part of the redress and repatriation process. 
</p>
<p>21. States should strengthen their legal and policy frameworks to encourage public and 
</p>
<p>private museums to reach out to indigenous communities in order to better understand the 
</p>
<p>impact of restoring stolen cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>22. States should ensure that investors and corporations respect the cultural heritage of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. Businesses have a responsibility to protect the right to cultural heritage; 
</p>
<p>if operations have a negative impact on the realization of that right, businesses have a 
</p>
<p>responsibility to remedy that impact. 
</p>
<p>23. States that have not already done so should ratify the Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, as a measure to increase the protection 
</p>
<p>afforded to indigenous peoples&#8217; intangible cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Advice for international organizations 
</b></p>
<p>24. There is a need for better coordination and collaboration between institutions and 
</p>
<p>agencies of the United Nations system on matters relating to cultural heritage and its human 
</p>
<p>rights dimensions so as to increase coherence and avoid duplication of work. This issue 
</p>
<p>could be addressed in the system-wide action plan on indigenous peoples that is currently 
</p>
<p>being developed, as requested by the General Assembly in the outcome document of the 
</p>
<p>World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>25. Relevant special procedures should monitor State policies on access to cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage to ensure that they respect the principles of the Declaration and that States act in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the provisions in the International Labour Organization Indigenous and 
</p>
<p>Tribal Peoples Convention No. 169 that protect cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>26. International organizations working in the field of cultural heritage, such as 
</p>
<p>UNESCO, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and other United Nations 
</p>
<p>specialized agencies, must integrate and respect the rights proclaimed in the Declaration in 
</p>
<p>their work. This includes obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples before any decision affecting their lands is taken.  
</p>
<p>27. The World Heritage Committee should take effective measures to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>protection of World Heritage does not undermine indigenous peoples&#8217; relationship with 
</p>
<p>their traditional lands, territories and resources, their livelihoods and their rights to protect, 
</p>
<p>exercise and develop their cultural heritage and expressions. 
</p>
<p>28. The World Heritage Committee needs to review its current procedures and 
</p>
<p>Operational Guidelines, with the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples, to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the implementation of the World Heritage Convention is consistent with the 
</p>
<p>Declaration. </p>


<p>29. The World Heritage Committee should adopt changes to the criteria and regulations 
</p>
<p>for the assessment of &#8220;outstanding universal value&#8221; so as to ensure that the values assigned 
</p>
<p>to World Heritage sites by indigenous peoples are fully and consistently recognized as part 
</p>
<p>of their outstanding universal value. 
</p>
<p>30. UNESCO and the World Heritage Committee should dedicate resources to the 
</p>
<p>development of mechanisms to ensure that indigenous peoples can effectively participate in 
</p>
<p>all World Heritage Convention processes affecting them and that their rights, priorities, 
</p>
<p>values and needs are duly recognized, considered and reflected. 
</p>
<p>31. UNESCO should strengthen its efforts to finalize its Policy on Indigenous Peoples, 
</p>
<p>in cooperation with indigenous peoples and the three United Nations mechanisms with 
</p>
<p>specific mandates regarding the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>32. UNESCO should consider developing a charter on sports and traditional games that 
</p>
<p>protects the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples in the area of sports and traditional 
</p>
<p>games. 
</p>
<p>33. United Nations institutions should continue to develop guidelines and other norms 
</p>
<p>and practices aimed at the protection and inclusion of traditional cultural heritage, including 
</p>
<p>the role of traditional knowledge, in enhancing community resilience and sustainable 
</p>
<p>development. 
</p>
<p>34. WIPO and its Intergovernmental Committee should ensure that indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>fully participate in the current negotiations and that their free, prior and informed consent is 
</p>
<p>sought and obtained before any new international instruments for the protection of 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge is adopted. The process in which laws governing the use of 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge, cultural expressions and genetic resources are developed needs to 
</p>
<p>conform with the rights guaranteed under the Declaration, particularly article 31. 
</p>
<p>35. The Human Rights Council should consider calling for an immediate halt to any 
</p>
<p>removal of ancestral remains and cultural items indigenous peoples for any reason, unless 
</p>
<p>their free, prior and informed consent is obtained. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Advice for indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>36. Indigenous peoples are the primary keepers of their cultural heritage. As such they 
</p>
<p>have an active role to play in its preservation, transmission and revitalization.  
</p>
<p>37. Indigenous peoples should ensure the equal participation of women in discussions 
</p>
<p>and decisions on cultural heritage at the level of the community. 
</p>
<p>38. Indigenous peoples should engage and take an active part in international fora 
</p>
<p>related to the protection of cultural heritage, notably under the aegis of WIPO and 
</p>
<p>UNESCO. 
</p>
<p>39. Indigenous peoples should participate in the practical Workshops for Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples and Local Communities on intellectual property, traditional knowledge and 
</p>
<p>traditional cultural expressions that are organized by WIPO, which impart knowledge of the 
</p>
<p>main principles of the intellectual property system, and explain, among other things, the 
</p>
<p>rationale, objectives and methodology of the negotiations that are currently being 
</p>
<p>conducted by the Intergovernmental Committee. 
</p>
<p>40. Indigenous peoples should participate actively to educate the non-indigenous 
</p>
<p>population about the importance of the collective protection of the heritage of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. </p>


<p>41. Indigenous peoples should ensure the inter-generational transmission of their 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage within their communities. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Advice for museums 
</b></p>
<p>42. Museums and other places in which the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples is 
</p>
<p>stored should inform the relevant indigenous peoples and develop mechanisms to facilitate 
</p>
<p>the return of such cultural heritage when sought by the indigenous peoples concerned.
