<p><b>  22</b>/&#8230;<b> Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
 punishment: rehabilitation of torture victims 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> all resolutions on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment adopted by the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and 
the Council,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and recalling in this regard the Convention against 
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and relevant 
provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment is a non-derogable right under international law that must be respected and 
protected under all circumstances, including in times of international or internal armed 
conflict or internal disturbance or any other public emergency, that the absolute prohibition 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is affirmed in 
relevant international instruments, and that legal and procedural safeguards against such 
acts must not be subject to measures that would circumvent this right,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that torture and inhuman treatment are grave breaches of the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949, and that under the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for 
the Former Yugoslavia, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and 
the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court, acts of torture can constitute crimes 
against humanity and, when committed in a situation of armed conflict, constitute war 
crimes,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> article 14 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment providing a right to redress for victims of torture, and 
General Assembly resolution 60/147 of 16 December 2005, in which the Assembly adopted 
the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims 
of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the general comment of the Committee against Torture regarding the 
implementation of article 14 of the Convention,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>and recalling</i> resolutions of the Human Rights Council and the General 
Assembly, including Assembly resolution 36/151 of 16 December 1981, in which the 
Assembly established the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, in which 
States are urged to ensure that victims of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment obtain redress and are awarded fair and adequate compensation 
and receive appropriate social, psychological, medical and other relevant specialized 
rehabilitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that, for the purposes of the present resolution, the term &#8220;victim&#8221; means a 
victim of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and that a 
person should be considered a victim regardless of whether the perpetrator of the violation 
is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted and regardless of any familial or other 
relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that redress depends upon and is obtained through prompt, effective 
and impartial investigations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and acknowledgement of the violations, and that the provision of redress has an 
inherent preventive and deterrent effect in relation to future violations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that the main purpose of rehabilitation is to enable victims to 
regain and maintain maximum independence, full physical, mental, social and vocational 
ability, and full inclusion and participation in all aspects of life,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Condemns</i> all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Emphasizes</i> that States must take persistent, determined and effective 
measures to prevent and combat all acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, stresses that all acts of torture must be made offences under 
domestic criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties that take into account their grave 
nature, and calls upon States to prohibit under domestic law acts constituting cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  </p>


<p>3. <i>Urges</i> all States that have not yet become parties to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to do so, and to 
give early consideration to signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol thereto as a matter of 
priority;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Stresses</i> that an independent, competent domestic authority must promptly, 
effectively and impartially investigate all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, as well as wherever there is reasonable ground to 
believe that such an act has been committed and that those who encourage, instigate, order, 
tolerate, acquiesce in, consent to or perpetrate such acts must be held responsible, brought 
to justice and punished in a manner commensurate with the severity of the offence, 
including the officials in charge of any place of detention or other place where persons are 
deprived of their liberty, where the prohibited act is found to have been committed; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Recalls</i>, in this respect, the Principles on the Effective Investigation and 
Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a valuable tool in efforts to prevent and combat 
torture, and the updated set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 
through Action to Combat Impunity; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Stresses</i> that national legal systems must ensure that victims obtain redress 
without suffering any reprisals for bringing complaints or giving evidence; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Recognizes</i> the interdependence and equal importance of providing an 
effective remedy and reparation, including restitution, fair and adequate compensation, 
rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition, to redress torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Calls upon </i>States to provide redress for victims of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment encompassing effective remedy and 
adequate, effective and prompt reparation, which should include restitution, compensation, 
rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition, taking into full account the 
specific needs of the victim; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Encourages</i> States to adopt a victim-oriented approach and put victims and 
their individual needs at the centre of redress procedures, including by implementing 
procedures for the effective participation of victims in the redress process, consulting 
victims and organizations representing them in determining appropriate individual 
reparation, and taking measures to avoid retraumatisation of the victim caused by or during 
the redress process; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Urges</i> States to pay special attention to the provision of redress for gender-
based violence that constitutes torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, and to adopt a gender-sensitive approach to redress; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Recognizes</i> that sexual and gender-based violence that constitutes torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment affects victims, their families, 
communities and societies, and stresses that effective remedies in those situations should 
include access to health care, psychosocial support, legal assistance and socioeconomic 
reintegration services for victims of such violence; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure that appropriate rehabilitation is promptly available to 
all victims without discrimination of any kind, provided either directly by the public health 
system or through the funding of private rehabilitation facilities, including those 
administered by civil society organizations, and to consider making rehabilitation available 
to immediate family or dependents of the victim and persons who have suffered harm in 
intervening to assist victims in distress or to prevent victimization; </p>


<p>13. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of full, holistic and specialized rehabilitation 
services, which include any necessary coordinated combination of medical and 
psychological care, as well as legal, social, community- and family-based, vocational, 
educational services and interim economic support and that are performed by specialists 
with a view to establish the restoration of functions or the acquisition of new skills required 
by the changed circumstances of a victim in the aftermath of torture or other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Urges</i> States to establish, maintain, facilitate or support rehabilitation centres 
or facilities where victims can receive such treatment and where effective measures for 
ensuring the safety of their staff and patients are taken; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Encourages</i> States to make rehabilitation services available at the earliest 
possible stage and without limitation in time until as full rehabilitation as possible is 
achieved; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that victims are duly informed about the 
availability of rehabilitation services and that procedures for obtaining rehabilitation are 
transparent; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Encourages</i> States to ensure early assessment and evaluation of individuals&#8217; 
rehabilitation needs, and recalls in this regard the Istanbul Principles as a valuable tool; and 
to further ensure continuous evaluation of the quality of the rehabilitation services; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Urges</i> States to respect the professional and moral independence, duties and 
responsibilities of rehabilitation personnel, as well as the confidentiality of the 
rehabilitation process, and to ensure that they or the victims are not subjected to reprisals or 
intimidation; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Encourages</i> States to ensure that persons providing rehabilitation services, as 
well as other relevant professionals, receive initial and continuing, adequate and regular 
training relevant to implement the prohibition against torture and to provide rehabilitation; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Encourages</i> bilateral and international cooperation on effective remedy and 
reparation, including rehabilitation for victims, encourages States and other donors to 
contribute generously to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, 
established to provide humanitarian, legal and financial aid to victims of torture and their 
relatives, and requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to provide advisory services in cooperation with other relevant United Nations 
agencies to States on the provision of redress to torture victims; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, the Committee against Torture, the Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
and other relevant special procedures and treaty bodies to continue to address effective 
remedy and reparation, including rehabilitation of victims; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.1
