GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES GROUP, INC.
Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
 
NOTE 1 - CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES
GROUP, INC. (“the Company”) without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows at June 30, 2016, and for all periods presented
herein, have been made.
 
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's
December 31, 2015 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the period ended
June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries as disclosed in Item 2 below. All significant inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN
 
The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the
realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company
has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and
allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until
it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to
cease operations.
 
In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional
capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining
capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its operating expenses
and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances
that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
 
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to
successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure
other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.
 
NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Beneficial Conversion Feature of Debentures and Convertible Notes Payable
In accordance with FASB ASC 470-20, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, we recognize the
advantageous value of conversion rights attached to convertible debt.  Such rights give the debt
holder the ability to convert his debt into common stock at a price per share that is less than the
trading price to the public on the day the loan is made to us. The beneficial value is calculated as
the intrinsic value (the market price of the stock at the commitment date in excess of the
conversion rate) of the beneficial conversion feature of the debentures and related accruing
interest, and is recorded as a discount to the related debt and an addition to additional paid in
capital.  The discount is amortized over the remaining outstanding period of related debt using
the straight-line method.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
No accounting pronouncements were issued during the second quarter of 2016 that would have
a material effect on the accounting policies of the Company when adopted.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited) 
Oil and Gas Interests
The Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities. Under this
method, subject to a limitation based on estimated value, all costs associated with property
acquisition, exploration and development, including costs of unsuccessful exploration; are
capitalized within a cost center. No gain or loss is recognized upon the sale or abandonment of
undeveloped or producing oil and gas interests unless the sale represents a significant portion of
oil and gas interests and the gain significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs
and proved oil and gas reserves of the cost center. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil
and gas interests are computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves.
Amortizable costs include estimates of future development costs of proved undeveloped
reserves.
 
Capitalized costs of oil and gas interests may not exceed an amount equal to the present value,
discounted at 10%, of the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves plus
the cost, or estimated fair market value, if lower, of unproved interests. Should capitalized costs
exceed this ceiling, an impairment is recognized. The present value of estimated future net cash
flows is computed by applying average prices, in the preceding twelve months, of oil and gas to
estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of year-end, less estimated future
expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions.
 
The oil and gas interests were purchased with the issuance of 46,685,300 shares and were
valued at market value at the grant date as $513,538. However at December 31, 2012, due to a
mechanics lien and impairment of title to the assets, the Company impaired the recorded cost,
leaving no value associated with the acquisition. The Company recorded an impairment on long
lived assets in the amount of $513,538.
 
Asset Retirement Obligation
The Company follows FASB ASC 410-20 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
 
FASB ASC 410-20 requires recognition of the present value of obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred. The liability is
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset's carrying amount.
 
Over time, accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized
cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. The Company's asset
retirement obligations are related to the plugging, dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and
similar activities of its oil and gas exploration activities.
The asset retirement obligation is as follows:

Investments at Cost
The Company accounts for its investment in private entities using the equity method for
investments where the Company’s shares held are in excess of 20% of the outstanding shares of
the investee.  The Company acquired a 25% equity investment in three entities from Brazil as
part of the assets of the ARUR acquisition in December 2012. Due to the inactivity of the entities,
the Company did not allocate any purchase price to these investments. The Company
evaluates its cost in investments for impairment of value annually.  If cost investments become
marketable they are reclassified to Marketable Securities-Available for Sale.
Investments are as follows:
Balance, December 31, 2015  $0 
Realized gains and losses
    0 
Unrealized gains and losses     0 
Balance, June 30, 2016
  $0 
                                                        
Marketable Securities-Available for Sale
The Company purchased marketable securities during 2012, 2015 and 2016. The Company's
marketable securities are classified as "available for sale". Accordingly, the Company originally
recognizes the shares at the market value purchased. The shares are evaluated quarterly using
the specific identification method. Any unrealized holding gains or losses are reported as Other
Comprehensive Income and as a separate component of stockholder's equity. Realized gains
and losses are included in earnings. Also other than temporary impairments are recorded as a
loss on marketable securities in the statements of operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” ASC 820
defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value
measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels
are defined as follows:
o
Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets
or liabilities in active markets.
o
Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
o
Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair
measurement.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, and current
liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of fair value
because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their
expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The carrying value of notes payable
approximates fair value because negotiated terms and conditions are consistent with current
market rates as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Marketable securities are reported at the quoted and listed market rates of the securities held at
the period end.
  
The following table presents the Company’s  Marketable securities and Notes Payable within the
fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:
Level 1

GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES GROUP, INC.
Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
 
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries, NetThruster, Inc., BioEnergy Applied Technologies Inc.,
GoHealthMD, Inc., MLN, Inc., Eye Care Centers International, Inc., GoHealthMD Nano
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., TTI Strategic Acquisitions and Equity Group, Inc. and TTII Oil & Gas,
Inc. All subsidiaries of the Company except TTII Oil & Gas, Inc., currently have no financial
activity. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major financial
institutions in the U S. Deposits held with these banks at times exceed $250,000 of insurance
provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and
believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. There
were no cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
 
Accounts Receivable/Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
The Company regularly assesses the collectability of its accounts receivable, and considers
receivables with aging exceeding 120 days to be potentially uncollectible. Management will
analyze the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts at that time. As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, there are no allowances recorded.
 
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC
718.  ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant-date fair value of
the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to
provide service in exchange for the reward- known as the requisite service period. No
compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the
requisite service. The grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments are
estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of
those instruments.
 
Equity instruments issued to non-employees are recorded at their fair values as determined in
accordance with ASC 718 and ASC 595, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to
Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services”, and
are periodically revalued as the stock options vest and are recognized as expense over the
related service period.
 
Basic and Diluted Loss per Share
The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Computation of
Earnings Per Share.” Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings (loss) per share gives effect to dilutive convertible securities, options, warrants and
other potential common stock outstanding during the period; only in periods in which such effect
is dilutive. For 2016 and 2015, no common equivalent shares were excluded from the calculation
and as of June 30, 2016, there are not stock equivalents existing. The ESOP shares issued
during 2012 and 2011 have also been excluded from the calculation as they were issued but not
outstanding.

Revenue Recognition
Oil and Gas Revenues and Deferred Revenue
Revenue form sales of crude oil are recorded when deliveries have occurred and legal
ownership of the commodity transfers to the customer. Title transfers for crude oil generally occur
when a tanker lifting has occurred. Oil inventory in holding tanks at the period end are recorded
as deferred revenue prior to tanker lifting.
 
Intangible Assets and Business Combinations
The Company adopted ASC 805, “Business Combinations”, and ASC 350, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”, effective June 2001 and revised in December 2007. ASC 805 requires the
use of the purchase method of accounting for any business combinations initiated after June 30,
2002, and further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill.
Under ASC 350, goodwill and indefinite−life intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are
reviewed for impairment annually.
 
Oil & Gas Inventory
The Company accounts for the oil & gas extracted from the ground and held in holding tanks
prior to pickup and sale as oil & gas inventory. It is computed using the measurement of barrels
and is multiplied with the published oil purchase price from the customer that picks up and
purchases our oil.
 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company had no oil revenues and no accounts
receivable.
 
Income Taxes
 The Company applies ASC 740 which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. The asset and liability method requires that the current or deferred tax
consequences of all events recognized in the financial statements are measured by applying the
provisions of enacted tax laws to determine the amount of taxes payable or refundable currently
or in future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and the Company records a
valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or
some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recovered.
 
The Company adopted ASC 740 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. This interpretation requires
recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” approach,
requiring the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. The adoption of ASC 740
had no material impact on the Company’s financial statements. Deferred taxes are provided on a
liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences
and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for
taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment

NOTE 7 - LEGAL ACTIONS
 
During March 2013, the Company was named in an action pertaining to the 75% working interest
in the Ownbey Lease. Subsequent to the Company’s purchase of the assets and the termination
of the operator a mechanics lien was filed against the property claiming approximately $267,000
in fees are due to the previous operator. An action is pending in the District Court of Chautauqua
County, Kansas, captioned Aesir Energy, Inc. vs. Amercian Resource Technologies, Inc.; Nancy
Ownbey Archer; Jimmy Stephen Ownbey; Robbie Faye Butts; TREE TOP INDUSTRIES, INC.;
and TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. Management intends to vigorously contest AESIR’s claims and, at this
point, settlement appears unlikely. It has been presented in the County Court that some of
ARUR’s Directors have acted without authorization in this matter, and TTII’s management is
assessing how to proceed at this time. No monetary claims have been asserted against Global
Tech or TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. The District Court of Chautauqua County, Kansas decided that the
Board of American Resource Technologies, Inc., acted improperly and set aside the Acquisition
Agreement as null and void. Management is consulting with legal counsel to evaluate the
company options.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Cautionary Statements
 
This Form 10-Q may contain “forward-looking statements,” as that term is used in federal

“expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “opines,” or similar expressions used in this Form 10-Q.
These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and
uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results
expressed or implied in those statements. The most important facts that could prevent us from
achieving our stated goals include, but are not limited to, the following:
a)volatility or decline of Global Tech’s stock price; potential fluctuation of quarterly results;
b)Potential fluctuation of quarterly results;
 
c)failure to earn revenues or profits;

manage or market our products and services, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified
executives and technology personnel, we may not be able to obtain customers for our products or
services, our products and services may become obsolete, government regulation may hinder
our business, additional dilution in outstanding stock ownership may be incurred due to the
issuance of more shares, warrants and stock options, or the exercise of outstanding warrants and
stock options, and other risks inherent in our businesses.
 
Because the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially
from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We caution you not to place
undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. The
cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection
with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our
behalf may issue. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts’ expectations
or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q, or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.

Organizational History
 
We were incorporated in 1980 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of Western
Exploration, Inc.  Western Exploration, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed on July 24, 1980.
In 1990, Western Exploration, Inc. changed its name to Nugget Exploration, Inc.  On November
10, 1999, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nugget Exploration, Inc., Nugget Holdings Corporation
merged with and into GoHealthMD, Inc., a Delaware corporation.  Shortly thereafter, Nugget
Exploration, Inc. changed its name to GoHealthMD, Inc. a Nevada corporation.
On August 18, 2004, GoHealthMD, Inc., the Nevada Corporation, changed its name to TREE
TOP INDUSTRIES, INC., and on May 26, 2016, the name was changed to GLOBAL TECH
INDUSTRIES GROUP, INC..  GoHealthMD, Inc. continues to exist as a Delaware corporation
and wholly-owned subsidiary of GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES GROUP, INC.  NetThruster, Inc.
MLN, Inc., BioEnergy Applied Technologies, Inc. (BAT”), Eye Care Centers International, Inc.,
GoHealthMD Nano Pharmaceuticals, Inc., TTI Strategic Acquisitions and Equity Group, Inc. and
TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. are also wholly-owned subsidiaries of GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES
GROUP, INC. Several of these subsidiaries have been formed by us in the anticipation of
technologies, products or services being acquired. Not all subsidiaries are currently active.
 
On December 31, 2012, the Company and its new subsidiary, TTII Oil & Gas, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, signed a binding asset purchase agreement with American Resource Technologies,
Inc. (“ARUR”), a Kansas corporation, to acquire all of the assets of ARUR for a purchase price of
$513,538, which was paid in the form of 4,668,530 shares of the Company’s common stock as
described in the asset purchase agreement. The shares were valued at $.110 per share, based
on the weighted average trading price of the common stock over the ten trading days prior to the
Closing Date. The assets purchased from ARUR include a 75% working interest in oil and gas
leases in Kansas, as well as other oil field assets, a natural gas pipeline, currently shut down that
is also located in Kansas, 25% interest in three other business entities operating in Kansas, and
accounts receivables from two companies operating in Brazil in the amounts of $3,600,000
and$3,600,000 respectively. TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. also purchased three promissory notes in the
amounts of $100,000, $100,000 and $350,000, as well an overdue contract for revenue in the
amount of $1,000,000. Finally, several gun sight patents were also acquired from ARUR. TTII Oil
& Gas, Inc. intends to pursue more opportunities in Kansas to expand the current leases, and to
aggressively continue pumping oil from the thirteen currently operating wells. At the same time,
both GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES GROUP, INC. and TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. intend to aggressively
pursue the two companies located in Brazil, who are responsible for the over $7,000,000 dollars
in monies owed to TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. All accounts and notes receivable were deemed
uncollectable due to the age and circumstances, and therefore were assessed no value in the
asset purchase. The equity ownerships were also deemed to be impaired due to the inactive
nature of the entities, and were not allocated any value. The gun sight patents was also not
readily assessable as to value and no purchase price was allocated to this asset. Also due to the
mechanics lien and lawsuit on the oil leases, as well as the absence of an official reserve report,
the oil lease was also impaired and no value was recorded for this asset.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. We monitor our estimates on an on-going basis for changes in facts and
circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in
estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on
historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other
assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
 
Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of
our financial position and results of operations and require us to apply significant judgment in
their application. As a result, these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In
applying these policies, we use our judgment in making certain assumption and estimates. Our
critical accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as
of June 30, 2016 and for the six months then ended.
 
Overview of Business
 
During the 2nd quarter 2013, the Company commenced its oil and gas operations, and have
brought 13 wells into production to date. It specializes in the utilization of modern technologies
with known resources to enhance project output.  The company has a working interest of 75% of
a lease in S.E. Kansas.  This lease has approximately 13 working wells out of a total of 30 well,
and a natural gas pipeline that is currently shut down, that is also located in Kansas.
 
 
14
 
 
In May of 2013, TTII Oil and Gas Inc. with the help of its Operator, Clark Energy, Inc., opened up
the wells on the Ownbey Lease for production. Upon opening up the lease for production, TTII Oil
& Gas, Inc.’s Operator ran into several problems with the lease. It came to the company’s
attention that the previous Operator, Aesir Energy Inc., owned and operated by Eric Oden, (son to
the previous President and CEO, Fred Oden III, of American Resource Technologies, Inc.) had
left the lease in sub-standard condition. Due to this fact, many repairs had to be made to the
equipment on the lease that kept the company from being able to get the full benefit of the lease.
During 2013 and 2014, the Company extracted oil from its Kansas oil wells, however in early
2015 with the steady decline of oil prices over the past two years, Management has determined
that the costs to extract oil would exceed the revenues generated to an extent that it was
necessary to suspend oil operations. When oil prices increase, Management would expects to
continue our oil and gas operations and formulate a plan to rework additional wells to bring them
online and generate additional monthly oil production. The Company will also assess the
potential expansion of additional oil leases in order to increase the oil production and revenue
source.
 
GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES GROUP, INC. and TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. intend to aggressively
pursue the two companies located in Brazil, who are responsible for the over $7,000,000 dollars
in monies owed to TTII Oil & Gas, Inc.
 
On February 26, 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Go Fun
Group Holdings, Ltd, (“Go Fun”) an integrated O2O (online to offline) supply-chain facilitated
company, which operates in the retail restaurant and online food service business sectors and is
based in Hong Kong, to continue discussions and work on a mutual agreeable transaction and
business plan, including a potential private placement for raising capital. Go Fun is also engaged
in the ‘Green’ food sourcing and logistics business, working with sustainable, local companies to
further the science of healthy food preparation. Go Fun’s retail entries include traditional
Chinese, Italian, and Japanese Steakhouse restaurants. The purpose of the ongoing exchange
between the Company and Go Fun is to explore possible synergies, and facilitate investment in
or acquisition of several of Go Fun’s operating units and/or assets. The Company is currently
involved in continued discussions with Go Fun and is engaged in due diligence processes with
its professionals.

Competitors
 
There are many competitors in the oil and gas industry that are larger than us and have better
resources.
 
Suppliers and Customers
 
We have hired an operator who operates and services our wells.  When our crude oil reaches a
certain level, the operator orders a pickup by our local crude oil purchaser, who pickups up and
delivers our crude oil to a refinery. We have only one company that currently purchases our crude
oil, therefore we have a concentration risk attached to our revenue stream. Because there are
several other crude oil purchasers in our region, we believe this risk will not affect our oil and gas
operations.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
Governmental authorities may in the future impose obstacles to the production and sale of oil and
gas through laws or regulations.  Recent tax and energy legislation has been enacted, the total
effect of which is not yet known.  Various types of mineral properties have come under attack in
certain areas because of their potential impact upon the surrounding environment.  Therefore,
leases or production in which we may have an interest could be adversely affected by either
governmental regulations or private litigation involving such environmental concerns.  We are not
able to predict the outcome of such controls, regulations or laws on its operations or on the
operations of the Company.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Pursuant to the ARUR acquisition, the Company acquired a 25% ownership in an Oklahoma
corporation that designed a new software for gamma ray survey interpretation.  This new
software interprets data accumulated during aerial or surface surveys and provides a 3D
blueprint of the areas with the highest concentration of hydrocarbons and/or uranium, dependent
upon the algorithm application.  This intellectual property is not a significant asset of our
business.
 
Employees
 
As of May 13, 2016 we have 1 full-time employee and one part time employee. We have not
experienced any work stoppages and we consider relations with its employees to be good.  
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016, Compared to Three Months
Ended June 30, 2015:
 
We realized revenues of $0 during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, due to our
oil pumping operations being suspended in the first quarter 2015, until oil prices improve. Our oil
operations expenses totaled $0 and $226 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our general operating expenses increased from $ 40,232 in 2015 to $228,259 in
2016. The increase was primarily the result of increased expenses paid to our professionals to
get the Company current in its filings and increased travel expenses related to due diligence.
General and administrative expenses increased from $26,410 to $62,785 or 238%.
Compensation and professional fees increased by $152,029.
 
Our net loss increased by $188,468 from $(66,661) in 2015 to a loss of $(255,129) in 2016. The
primary reason for this decrease was the increase activity in the Company with our professionals
and in relation to our due diligence travel expenses. We expect that our losses will continue to be
approximately $20,000 per month until we are able to establish a larger revenue flow from our oil
& gas leases, or other operations.
 
Results of Operations for the Six months Ended June 30, 2016, Compared to Six months Ended
June 30, 2015:
 
We realized revenues of $0 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and $1,126 during the
six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in our oil revenues were a factor of suspending
our oil pumping operations in the first quarter 2015 until oil prices improve. Our oil operations
expenses totaled $377 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $8,990 in the
comparative quarter last year. Our general operating expenses increased from $ 101,553 in 2015
to $311,097 in 2016. The increase was primarily the result of increased travel expenses
associated with out due diligence activities in Hong Kong. General and administrative expenses
increased from $54,461 to $110,618 or 200%. Compensation and professional fees increased by
$154,142, due to the increase in accounting and auditing fees associated with getting current
with our annual and quarterly filings.
 
Our net loss decreased by $130,869 from $(161,296) in 2015 to a loss of $(292,165) in 2016. The
primary reason for this decrease was the increased expenses with travel and our professionals
despite the realized gain on marketable security sales of $73,747 during the quarter. We expect
that our losses will continue to be approximately $20,000 per month until we are able to establish
a larger revenue flow from our oil & gas leases, or other operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
At June 30, 2016 we had cash on hand of $11,973 compared to $108 at December 31, 2015. We
used cash in our operations of $(210,986) in 2016 compared to cash used of $(51,882) in 2015.
We generated cash-flow from investing activities during 2016 of $74,559, compared to $0 for the
same quarter in 2015. We (paid back)/raised $(224,600) and $9,935 from related party loans in
2016 and 2015, and $3,000 and $40,700 from other notes payable, respectively. We also
collected $370,000 from the receipt of stock subscriptions during the six month period of 2016
compared to $0 in the prior year. We anticipate that we will continue to have a negative cash flow
from operations of approximately $15,000 per month for 2016. We do not have sufficient cash on
hand at June 30, 2016 to cover our negative cash flow. We will attempt to increase our revenues
from oil & gas extraction when oil prices increase, and raise capital through the sale of our
common stock or through debt financing, or engaging in other operations.
 
Some of Global Tech’s past due obligations, including $338,000 of accounts payable, and
$113,000 of notes payable and judgments, some of which are duplicative, were incurred or
obtained prior to 2005. No actions have been taken by any of the applicable creditors, and the
statute of limitations has been exceeded for the creditors to seek legal action. Global Tech
believes that these obligations will not be satisfied in the future because the statute of limitations
has been exceeded, but is not allowed to remove them from our books and records due to
accounting regulations.
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company’s working capital deficit decreased
from $(3,215,878) to $(1,939,855), a decrease of 40%, due to the extension of several long term
notes that had become current or in default. If the old payables and notes that have exceeded the
statute of limitations were removed from the calculation, the working capital deficit would be
$(1,488,855), a 54% decrease over 2015.
 
Any remedy to our current lack of liquidity must take into account all the foregoing liabilities.
Global Tech intends to continue its pursuit to increase revenues from our oil generating leases
when oil prices improve, or find other operating activities, and as necessary, raise capital in order
to monetize its business and pay all its liabilities. Capital raise plans are under consideration but
it cannot be assured that they will materialize in the current economic environment. Currently,
Global Tech is without adequate financing or assets. Because no actions have been taken on the
aforementioned past due obligations and demand has not been made by the applicable current
note holders, we are unable to accurately quantify the effect the overdue accounts have on
Global Tech’s financial condition, liquidity and capital resources. However, in the event that all of
these obligations and notes payable were required to be paid in an amount equal to the full
balance of each, Global Tech would not be able to meet the obligations based upon its current
financial status. The liquidity shortfall of $(1,939,855) would cause Global Tech to default and,
further, would put our continued viability in jeopardy.
 
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
 
None
 
Going Concern Qualification
 
The Company has incurred significant losses from operations, and such losses are expected to
continue. The Company's auditors have included a "Going Concern Qualification" in their report
for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, the Company has limited working capital.
The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. Management's plans include seeking additional capital and/or debt financing. There is
no guarantee that additional capital and/or debt financing will be available when and to the
extent required, or that if available, it will be on terms acceptable to the Company. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The "Going Concern Qualification" may make it substantially more difficult to raise capital.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
Not Applicable.
 
ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information we are required to disclose is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission. David
Reichman, our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Accounting Officer, is responsible for
establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures.
 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer has concluded that, as of June 30, 2016
these disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to ensure that all information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rule
and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. The Company’s controls are not effective due to a lack of the
segregation of duties. The Company lacks the appropriate personnel to handle all the varying
recording and reporting tasks on a timely basis.  The Company plans to address these material
weaknesses as resources become available by hiring additional professional staff, such as a
Chief Financial Officer, as funding becomes available, outsourcing certain aspects of the
recording and reporting functions, and separating responsibilities. The Company believes that it
would require approximately $250,000 per year in available funds in order to retain the qualified
personnel required for effective disclosure controls and procedures.
The term “internal control over financial reporting” is defined as a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the registrant’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the registrant’s board of directors, management and
other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
 
♦pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the registrant;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
♦
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the registrant are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the registrant; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
♦
acquisition, use or disposition of the registrant’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
 
There were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
 
Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls
 
Global Tech’s management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over
financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Global Tech have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or management override
of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of
controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with
policies or procedures.
 
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of that
our reports will be accurate. Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer
concludes that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective at that reasonable
assurance level, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our future reports shall
also indicate that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed for this reason and shall
indicate the related conclusion by the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer as
to their effectiveness.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION
 
ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
During March 2013, the Company was named in an action pertaining to the 75% working interest
in the Ownbey Lease. Subsequent to the Company’s purchase of the assets and the termination
of the operator a mechanics lien was filed against the property claiming approximately $267,000
in fees are due to the previous operator. An action is pending in the District Court of Chautauqua
County, Kansas, captioned Aesir Energy, Inc. vs. Amercian Resource Technologies, Inc.; Nancy
Ownbey Archer; Jimmy Stephen Ownbey; Robbie Faye Butts; TREE TOP INDUSTRIES, INC.;
and TTII oil & Gas, Inc. Management intends to vigorously contest AESIR’s claims and, at this
point, settlement appears unlikely. It has been presented in the County Court that some of
ARUR’s Directors have acted without authorization in this matter, and Global Tech’s
management is assessing how to proceed at this time. No monetary claims have been asserted
against Global Tech or TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. The District Court of Chautauqua County, Kansas
decided that the Board of American Resource Technologies, Inc., acted improperly and set aside
the Acquisition Agreement as null and void. Management is consulting with legal counsel to
evaluate the company options.
