Looking Back
For  a  company  to  mark  60  years  in  business  is  an  achievement  in  any  industry,  but
particularly in the ever-consolidating resource business. Silver Standard was incorporated
on December 11, 1946, as Silver Standard Mines Limited (NPL), and filed a four-page
prospectus 40 days later. Shares of Silver Standard commenced trading on January 22,
1947 and have traded continuously ever since.
The company's longevity can be attributed to three things: people, projects and discipline.
We value the people who have worked at Silver Standard over the years, as well as our other
stakeholders—shareholders,  suppliers  and  joint  venture  partners.  Our  projects,  which  we
discovered and acquired, and which have enhanced in value over time, are the core assets
that  underpin  the  company's  value.  They  have  enabled  Silver  Standard  to  grow—with  no
consistent source of revenue for almost 50 years—with minimal shareholder dilution. And it
is our discipline in maintaining our integrity and our ethics, that has been key to carrying out
our primary responsibility: the protection and maximization of shareholder value. This is the
foundation on which the company was created 60 years ago, and this is the foundation on
which we continue to build today.
The Silver Standard Mine was discovered around the turn of the 20th century. It was mined
intermittently through the 1920’s and 1930’s. In 1946, the Vancouver-based Wilson mining
family  acquired  the  Silver  Standard  claims  and  raised  money  for  mine  development.  To
establish a 50-ton-per-day mill in 1947, the company expended a total of $105,000, which
included $56,000 in mine equipment, $28,000 on mine labor and $500 in legal and audit
expenses—obviously,  this  was  before  Sarbanes-Oxley  regulations.  The  mine  was  a  small
underground  vein  operation,  but  mine  fortunes  improved  signiﬁ cantly  in  1951  when  the
downdip extension of the #6 Vein encountered ore grading 223 ounces of silver per ton, 31%
lead and 19% zinc. That year the mine produced a proﬁ t of $780,000 on gross metal value of
$1.9 million. By 1958, when the mine shut down, 7 million ounces of silver had been mined,
plus lead and zinc, for gross metal values of $13 million, of which $1.7 million or 13% of
gross revenue had been paid out as dividends—thus establishing the company’s foundation
for delivering shareholder value.
After the Silver Standard Mine was shut down, the company embarked on an exploration
program  covering  6,000  square  miles  of  unmapped  territory  in  northern  British  Columbia.
By the 1960’s, the company was known for its high quality exploration, and the names of
Ridgeway  Wilson,  Bob  Wilson,  Bill  Dunn,  Harry  Gilleland,  Alex  Ritchie,  Norm  Burmeister,
Jim McAusland and Al Potter were synonymous with professional and technical excellence.
Through the 1960’s and 1970’s, this team of professionals was involved in the discovery of
projects such as Shaft Creek, Nickel Mountain, Galore Creek, Minto Copper and the Red
Chris  deposit.  The  latter  two  projects  are  now  being  advanced  to  development,  by  other
companies, some 30 years after their discovery by Silver Standard.
During  this  time,  Silver  Standard’s  partners  included  companies  such  as:  Asarco,  Hecla,
Sumitomo  and  Teck  Corporation.  In  1969,  Teck  began  investing  in  Silver  Standard,  a
shareholder  association  that  continued  for  over  30  years.  By  the  early  1980’s,  low  metal
prices  had  led  to  a  decrease  in  exploration,  and  Silver  Standard  reduced  its  staff  and
exploration activities, leaving Alex Ritchie as president and Linda Sue as secretary. In 1985,
at  the  request  of  Teck,  I  took  over  as  president.  I  focused  on  reviewing  Silver  Standard’s
assets  in  British  Columbia,  and  on  seeking  growth  opportunities.  Through  joint  ventures
we grew the company, while looking for a strategy to differentiate Silver Standard from the
hundreds of junior mining companies in Vancouver.
In  1993,  investors  Rick  Rule  and  Jim  Blanchard  proposed  a  $2  million  ﬁ nancing  in  Silver
Standard  with  the  intent  that  we  would  live  up  to  our  namesake  and  become  “the  Silver
Standard” of the mining industry. On the face of it, this was a simple proposition. However,
implementing  the  strategy  required  discipline.  It  meant  ﬁnancing  the  exploration  and
acquisition  of  silver  resources  at  a  then  uneconomic  price  of  US$4/ounce,  and  leaving
them  undeveloped  until  higher  silver  prices  supported  proﬁ table  extraction.  We  remained
committed to our objective for over 13 years, while many others were skeptical about both
the objective and the price of silver. By maintaining our focus, we were able to grow an asset
base  of  over  one  billion  ounces  of  silver  resources,  contained  in  17  projects  around  the
globe, representing the largest silver resource of any publicly traded silver company. Since
embarking on the silver strategy, we have increased our staff from two to over 240, and our
market capitalization has increased almost a thousand fold. And now, 60 years later, we ﬁ nd
ourselves Moving Forward as we embark on a new phase in our history, the development of
our second mine, the Pirquitas mine in Argentina.

Moving Forward
2006 was an exceptional year for Silver Standard on many fronts. We made a production
decision for the Pirquitas project in Argentina and increased our silver resources by 24% and gold
resources by 160%; we encountered signiﬁ cant zones of silver and base metal mineralization at
depth at Pitarrilla; we outlined signiﬁ cant gold-silver mineralization at the San Luis joint venture;
and  we  concluded  a  successful  $171  million  equity  ﬁ nancing.  We  monetized  our  interest  in
Manantial Espejo netting $35.4 million over costs; we discovered three million ounces of gold at
the Snowﬁ eld project; we celebrated 60 years as a publicly traded company; and most importantly
for shareholders, as a measure of our consistency and discipline in delivering value, we achieved
a record share price. I would like to expand on a few of our achievements, beginning with the
production decision followed by our successful exploration programs.
PIRQUITAS
The Pirquitas project, which is scheduled to start up in late 2008, will be our ﬁ rst silver mine in
the modern era. It will be a signiﬁ cant primary silver mine, producing in the order of ten million
ounces of silver per year in its initial years, along with indium, tin and zinc. We announced
the decision to place the mine into production in October, at a mine site ceremony with local
politicians  and  employees,  followed  by  a  formal  announcement  with  the  Governor  of  the
Province of Jujuy and the Secretary of Mining for Argentina. Following the completion of a
feasibility study update for Pirquitas by Hatch Ltd. in April 2006, a successful equity ﬁ nancing
in May 2006 of $171 million provided us with the capital to develop the project. The ﬁ nancing
was underwritten by a syndicate of bankers, with Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. appointed joint book-running managers for the transaction, and Blackmont
Capital Inc. as a co-lead of a syndicate of underwriters including Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., National Bank Financial Inc. and Salman Partners Inc. We continue to seek additional
ﬁ nancing to leverage the project; provided that the ﬁ nancing terms do not involve hedging,
and recognize the merits of the project and the strength of our balance sheet.
PITARRILLA
The Pitarrilla project was the source for much of the increase in our silver resources in 2006.
Drilling has continued since our resource update announcement in August, and will continue
throughout this year with ﬁ ve drills operating. Of interest from our 2006 program were two
holes I would like to comment on: Hole 157 intersected 1,972 feet grading 2.5 ounces of silver
per ton (601m grading 86.7 g/t silver) and 2.3% combined base metals. This spectacular hole
demonstrates  the  strength  of  the  mineralizing  system  underlying  the  Pitarrilla  project  area.
Hole 152 encountered 535 feet grading 6.7 ounces of silver per ton (163m grading 230 g/t
silver), including a 33.5 foot intersection grading 70.5 ounces of silver per ton (10.2m grading
2,417 g/t silver), 8.6% zinc, 1.8% lead and 14% copper. Geologic modeling allowed us to
identify and trace the favorable ﬂ at-lying stratigraphy hosting the base metal mineralization,
in  addition  to  high-grade  epithermal  structures.  We  expect  to  have  an  updated  resource,
including base metals, during the second quarter of 2007, with a further resource update
expected  late  in  the  year.  Along  with  our  aggressive  drill  program,  metallurgical  test  work
continues at laboratories in Canada under the supervision of Dr. Martin Kuhn, in support of
our plan to move Pitarrilla into feasibility by year-end. Pitarrilla is demonstrating that it is a
world-class deposit, and we are fortunate that it is a 100%-owned, grass roots discovery.
SAN LUIS
At the San Luis joint venture project in Peru, drilling has conﬁ rmed that two of the ﬁ ve veins
identiﬁ ed are mineralized to depth. San Luis is a high-grade epithermal silver-gold project,
with the potential to be highly proﬁ table and provide shareholders with premium returns. Two
drills are operating on the property, and an initial resource estimate is planned for the third
quarter. To date, we have earned a 55% interest in the project, and can elect to increase
our  interest  to  70%  by  completing  a  feasibility  study,  and  an  80%  interest  by  placing  the
project into production. We are fortunate to have Esperanza Silver Corporation as our joint
venture partner, and its management group and exploration team led by Bill Pincus. We are
a  signiﬁ cant  shareholder  in  Esperanza,  whose  team  was  responsible  for  the  joint  venture
discovery. The joint venture plans to advance San Luis quickly, which we view as our next
development project. To date, drilling has extended the mineralized zone on the Ayelén Vein
over a strike length of 450 meters and to a depth of 100 meters below surface. Holes of
interest include SL-09, which intersected 9.5 feet grading 5.75 ounces per ton gold and 104
ounces per ton silver (2.9m grading 197 g/t gold and 3,578 g/t silver), and SL-17, which
intersected 89 feet grading 0.69 ounces per ton gold and 19.7 ounces per ton silver (274m
grading 23.7 g/t gold and 676 g/t silver). Throughout the year, shareholders can expect more
exciting results from this project.
OTHER PROJECTS
Other  exploration  successes  in  2006  included  the  Snowﬁ eld  project  in  northern  British
Columbia,  where  for  expenditures  of  $1.9  million  we  outlined  a  resource  of  three  million
ounces of gold. Our plan is to continue to drill this property in 2007, seeking additional near
surface gold resources, and porphyry-gold-copper mineralization at depth. Once we have a
better understanding of the extent of the mineralization and can assess its full potential, we
may consider monetizing our interest, for near-term shareholder beneﬁ t.
At  the  Maverick  Springs  joint  venture  in  Nevada  (the  Silver  State),  two  holes  intersected
signiﬁ cant  silver  mineralization,  and  these  intersections  are  both  open  along  strike.  Hole
166 encountered 140 feet grading 7.65 ounces of silver per ton, including a 40-foot interval
grading  25  ounces  of  silver  per  ton.  Adjacent  Hole  167  encountered  140  feet  grading
11  ounces  of  silver  per  ton,  including  15  feet  grading  89  ounces  of  silver  per  ton.  If  this

mineralized  horizon  continues  to  trend  to  the  northwest,  it  could  add  signiﬁ cantly  to  the
silver resource on this property.
At Diablillos, a review of the drill data indicates that the previous reverse circulation drilling
may have understated the gold and silver values. As a result, we are planning a 15,000-meter
diamond drill program at Diablillos, which we expect to commence in the second quarter of
2007. Most of our other projects will be kept on a care and maintenance basis while we focus
on our key projects: mine development at Pirquitas, aggressive exploration at San Luis and
Pitarrilla, and the advancement of the Snowﬁ eld and Diablillos projects.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The company is on a sound ﬁ nancial footing. We ended the year with cash of $229.6 million,
and marketable securities and silver bullion totaling another $65 million at market value, and
total working capital of $250.2 million. This is sufﬁ cient to see us through our development
needs  at  Pirquitas,  as  well  as  our  aggressive  2007  exploration  program  of  over  80,000
meters of drilling on ﬁ ve projects. We continue to hold administration costs down, relative
to the industry.
We have 2006 earnings of $16.4 million or $0.28 per share, largely as a result of a gain from
the sale of our interest in Manantial Espejo earlier this year. For a company like Silver Standard,
with no consistent source of cash ﬂ ow, having earnings is a demonstration of our efﬁ ciency in
using our balance sheet and our assets to create shareholder value.
Comparing Silver Standard's performance over the last ﬁ ve years against the silver price and
the HUI index, on which some of our silver peers trade, you can see that we were by far the
best investment, providing a return of 1,130% since 2002. In 2006, Silver Standard was up
more than 100% during the year, which was signiﬁ cantly higher than many of our silver peers.
Some of this increase results from the renewed interest in, and higher price of silver, however,
the drilling results from Pitarrilla and San Luis have contributed signiﬁ cantly to the increase in
year-over-year share price.
Even with our strong performance in 2006, an analysis of our silver peers demonstrates that
many  of  these  companies  trade  at  higher  valuation  multiples  than  Silver  Standard.  This  is
due to the fact that they are in production. We see entry into production as the logical way
for  us  to  achieve  a  higher  valuation  multiple,  which  will  allow  us  to  continue  to  add  value
for shareholders on a per-share basis without further dilution. We have taken the ﬁ rst step
with the decision to move Pirquitas into production, which will be completed over the next
two years. We will continue to drill the San Luis property during this time, and plan to fast-
track it into production once Pirquitas has started up. This will enable us to be efﬁ cient with
our  personnel  and  our  balance  sheet.  Pitarrilla  will  follow.  Our  plan  is  to  have  these  three
properties in production over the next ﬁ ve years, thereby creating the premium silver mining
company – the “Silver Standard”.
One  of  the  challenges  facing  the  mining  industry  is  attracting  well-qualiﬁ ed  people.  As  we
make  the  transition  from  an  exploration  company  to  a  producer,  Silver  Standard  will  be
augmenting its engineering staff. Our Pirquitas construction manager, David MacKerricher, is
a recent hire with 30 years experience in construction. He joins Mike Robb, our Vice-President
of Project Development dedicated to Pirquitas, and Mine Manager Fortunato Ramírez, who
has over 25 years of experience in mine construction and development. Another new team
member is Deirdre Riley, who joins us with 20 years of experience in environmental and social
responsibility,  ten  years  of  it  with  Teck  Cominco.  Paul  MacRae,  our  new  Project  Manager
in  charge  of  supervising  the  development  and  advancement  of  the  Pitarrilla  and  San  Luis
projects, has extensive international mining experience. We continue to seek a Senior Vice
President, Operations, and expect to make an announcement in the second quarter of 2007.
In  management,  and  at  the  board  level,  we  have  been  fortunate  to  attract  top  talent  that
recognizes  our  attractive  development  opportunities.  In  late  2006,  we  announced  the
appointment  of  Peter  Tomsett  to  the  Board  of  Directors.  Formerly  the  president  of  Placer
Dome, Peter brings over 25 years of global experience in mining, and we look forward to his
counsel as we make the transition to mining.

We at Silver Standard ﬁ rmly believe that our shareholders are the owners of the company, and
it is our responsibility as management and as directors to ensure that we maximize the value
of company assets for our shareholders. Silver Standard’s success is founded on our ability to
discover and acquire projects, and we have demonstrated consistently that we deliver value.
As we make the transition to producer, discovery will continue to be a driving force in creating
shareholder value, as it is at the core of any mining business.
For my part, I look forward to the opportunity to continue to communicate our strategy to
the investing public. Last year, I spent over four months in activities related to shareholder
awareness, and it is clear to me that investors are receptive to the Silver Standard story.
On behalf of the staff and the Board of Directors, I wish to thank our shareholders for their
continued support of management, and their belief that we are the best group of individuals to
manage and deliver value from the asset base that we have built up over these last 13 years
in the silver space, through the early years of silver market uncertainty, and now during this
exciting time of historic high silver prices. I look forward to meeting many of you in 2007, and
updating you on our continued successes.

Moving Forward with
Operations
There  are  three  reasons  for  Silver  Standard  to  consider
production. The ﬁ rst is to generate a return on capital invested
by shareholders. The second is to avoid the share dilution that
would be required to ﬁ nance the holding of a large property
portfolio in the years ahead without cash ﬂ ow. The third reason
is to capture for shareholders the premium in share price that
is enjoyed by cash-generating mining companies.
We have long stated that we would maintain most of our silver resources on a care and maintenance
basis, in the ground, until silver prices were consistently high enough to generate good economic
returns for our shareholders. With that constraint, we would not deplete our deposits by high-
grading during extended periods of low metals prices, nor incur debt, nor be required to hedge by
lenders in order to achieve production. Also, we would not expose our shareholders to potential
losses from the variety of risks, ﬁ nancial or political, that could jeopardize the company. So we
waited patiently for evidence that a new commodity cycle had begun in earnest.
Our decision to build the Pirquitas Mine coincides with global forces that are propelling demand
for silver. The economies of China, India, Brazil and Russia—with huge populations and strong
growth  compared  to  the  West—are  expanding  rapidly.  Some  economists  believe  the  shifts
underway in these countries are the most important developments for commodities since the
Industrial Revolution started two centuries ago.
So we have begun the transition to production with optimism that our timing is on the mark, but
tempered by the pragmatism necessary to complete the transition effectively and efﬁ ciently. Over
the last year, we have mapped the skill sets needed by our mining team. From an organizational
perspective,  these  range  from  engineering  and  logistics  to  construction  management  and
cost  controls,  computer  software  implementation  for  production  planning  and  accounting,
environmental  management  and  community  relations,  and  a  capable  and  well-trained  local
workforce. We have been able to attract exceptional talent for our head ofﬁ ce and the mine site.
The broad expansion now underway at Silver Standard is taking place under the guidance of
an  experienced  board  of  directors  that  includes  three  engineers.  Gordon  Davis  is  one  of  the
discoverers of Canada’s famous Anvil deposit and helped to ﬁ nance, build and manage a proﬁ table
operation. David Johnston is the former president of Highland Valley Copper Limited, one of the
world’s largest-tonnage copper mining and milling complexes. Peter Tomsett recently capped a
25-year engineering career at Placer Dome Inc. as president and chief executive ofﬁ cer.

Pirquitas
JUJUY PROVINCE, ARGENTINA
LOCATION AND HISTORY
Mina  Pirquitas  is  located  in  the  northern
Argentina  province  of  Jujuy.  The  property
is  accessible  by  an  all-weather  road  and  is
at  an  elevation  of  4,100  meters.  All  of  the
surface and mining rights are owned by Mina
Pirquitas, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Silver  Standard,  with  only  a  3%  provincial
mouth-of-mine royalty payable. The mine is fully
permitted  with  all  federal,  provincial  and  local
permits  issued  and  in  good  standing,  with  a
ﬁ scal stability agreement in place.
The Pirquitas deposit was discovered in 1930.
Between 1933 and 1990, some 25 million
ounces of silver and 9,100 tonnes of tin were
mined from underground silver and tin mines.
Sunshine  Mining  and  Refining  Company
purchased the property at an auction in 1995
and undertook a US$25 million feasibility study,
which  included  extensive  surface  drilling,
underground  sampling,  and  metallurgical
testing. We acquired an initial 43.4% interest
in Pirquitas in 2002 and the remaining 56.6%
interest in 2004.

2006 ANNUAL REPORT SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC.
GEOLOGY AND METALLURGY
The property is underlain by sediments comprised of shales, sandstones
and greywackes, with minor areas of conglomerate. In the vicinity of
the mineralization, the host sediments are folded into an east-plunging,
gently-folded anticline. The main mineralized veins run perpendicular
to  the  hinge  of  the  anticline  and  inﬁ ll  tension  joints  related  to  brittle
deformation. The silver occurs as silver sulﬁ des and sulfosalts. Potential
for expansion of known mineralization is considered excellent.
Extensive  metallurgical  testwork  has  been  carried  out  at  Pirquitas
establishing recoveries of 76% for silver, 57% for tin and 48% for zinc.
Silver Standard has been undertaking additional metallurgical testwork
to improve these recoveries.
PROJECT SCOPE AND PLANS
In  March  of  2006,  Hatch  Ltd.,  an  international  engineering  ﬁ rm,  in
conjunction with Mine Development Associates, Inc. of Reno, Nevada
completed  an  update  of  the  feasibility  study  prepared  by  Jacobs
Engineering  and  Winters  Group  in  1999/2000.  With  base  case
metal  prices  of  US$5.35  per  ounce  silver,  US$2.75  per  pound  tin
and  US$0.42  per  pound  zinc  (approximate  20-year  average  prices
to March 31, 2006), the project hosts proven and probable reserves
of  107.1  million  ounces  of  silver,  40,360  tonnes  of  tin  and  125,116
tonnes of zinc and is estimated to produce an average of 9.6 million
ounces of silver, 2,500 tonnes of tin and 6,600 tonnes of zinc per year
over an 8.8 year mine life. Capital costs are estimated to be US$146
million  plus  value  added  tax  which  is  recoverable  for  a  6,000  tonne
per day operation.
14
The  mine  will  be  developed  and  operated  as  a  conventional  open
pit (surface) mine and will utilize 100 tonne trucks and 12m3 (16 yd3)
loaders.  The  ore  will  be  trucked  seven  kilometers  (4.3  miles)  to  the
Victor Gamez, Pirquitas representative in Jujuy, and employees at the mine site
production decision announcement.
processing plant. At the processing plant the ore will be crushed and
treated in a conventional mineral ﬂ otation plant. The plant will produce
three  salable  products:  silver  concentrate,  tin  concentrate,  and  zinc
concentrate.  The  concentrates  will  be  shipped  to  various  smelters
around the world. The silver concentrate contains 0.11% indium, and
with indium prices at US$750 per kilogram (US$341 per pound), the
company continues to explore ways to beneﬁ t from this concentrate
by-product.
In  addition  to  the  processing  plant,  a  mine  equipment  repair  shop,
warehouse, laboratory, and power plant will be constructed. The power
plant  will  be  fueled  by  natural  gas  supplied  by  a  36  kilometer-long
(22.4 mile) natural gas pipeline to be constructed from the mine to the
existing  Trans-Andean,  Argentina/Chile  pipeline.  Design  engineering
of the pipeline is complete and pipeline materials have been ordered.
Construction of the pipeline is anticipated to start mid-year.
At full production, the mine will operate 24 hours per day, 350 days per
year and employ approximately 400 people. There is currently housing
for 200 employees on site, which will be expanded to accommodate
450. Many employees will commute from local communities while others
will be housed on site. In conjunction with the provincial government
and  equipment  vendors,  a  training  program  has  been  developed  to
assure that the members of the local communities possess the required
skills to assure a successful mining operation.
PROJECT STATUS
Since the decision in October 2006 to place Pirquitas in production,
signiﬁ cant progress has been made in advancing the project.
Silver Standard President, Robert Quartermain (left) presents commemorative plaques
of  the  Pirquitas  production  decision  on  October  18,  2006  to  Dr.  Eduardo  Fellner,
Governor of the Province of Jujuy and Jorge Mayoral, Secretary of Mining, Argentina.
Equipment
The  mining  equipment  has  been  ordered  from  CAT®  and  the  initial
equipment items have been received at the mine. The balance of the
SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC. 2006 ANNUAL REPORT
equipment deliveries will take place within the ﬁ rst three quarters of this
year. In addition, a maintenance and repair contract (MARC) is being
negotiated with the local CAT® dealer, which will provide guaranteed
availabilities and operating costs for the mining equipment.
Engineering and Construction
Techint, an international construction and engineering ﬁ rm based in
Buenos  Aires,  has  been  selected  as  the  engineering,  procurement
and  construction  management  (EPCM)  contractor  for  the  project.
Techint  commenced  work  on  basic  engineering  in  November  and
is  advancing  on  schedule.  Equipment  with  long  lead  times  has
been  identified  and  either  placed  on  order  or  acquired  from  the
used market.
Personnel
Experienced  and  highly  capable  professionals  have  been  recruited
for key positions, including General Manager, Plant Superintendent,
and  Construction  Manager.  In  addition,  a  Senior  Vice  President,
Operations,  who  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  all  mining
operations, is being hired for the Vancouver ofﬁ ce.

San Luis
ANCASH, PERU
LOCATION AND HISTORY
The San Luís Project in central Peru is a joint
venture  with  Esperanza  Silver  Corporation
where  a  high-grade  gold-silver  prospect  was
discovered in mid-2005. Silver Standard has a 55%
interest  in  the  project  and  can  earn  up  to  an  80%
interest by carrying the project through to production.
The property encompasses over 25,000 hectares of
mineral concessions with recently constructed road
access  to  the  town  of  Huarez.  The  large  open-pit
Pierina  gold  mine,  operated  by  Barrick,  is  located
less than 25 kilometers (16 miles) to the southeast of
the project.
Following  the  discovery  of  the  San  Luís  quartz  vein  system,  the
joint  venture  focused  on  securing  a  sizeable  land  position  in  the
area, applied to the local and national governments for exploration
work permits and established a work camp on the property. In the
ﬁ rst  quarter  of  2006,  systematic  trenching  and  channel  sampling
was carried out on the westernmost vein, known as the Ayelén Vein,
where the previous year’s prospecting resulted in the discovery of
high-grade gold and silver mineralization. In March 2006, the joint

venture  announced  the  ﬁ rst  results  from  the  trenching  program;
some of the more impressive channel sample results include 13.9
feet of 3.9 ounces of gold and 65.5 ounces of silver per ton (4.23
meters grading an average of 134.0 grams of gold per tonne and
2,246 grams silver per tonne); 19.7 feet of 2.3 ounces of gold and

60.7 ounces of silver per ton (5.99 meters averaging 78.4 grams of
gold per tonne and 2,082 grams of silver per tonne).
Through  the  months  of  January  to  June  the  joint  venture  made
applications  for  the  permits  to  construct  access  roads  and
complete a preliminary drill program. The permits were received in
July and road construction completed in early September. Drilling
was initiated by mid-September and the first drill results released
in late October. Drilling has confirmed the down dip continuity of
the bonanza grade mineralization found in the trenches. Significant
drill intersections to date on the Ayelén Vein include hole SL06–01
which contained 20.7 feet averaging 34.4 ounces silver per ton and
1.42 ounces gold per ton (6.3 meters averaging 1,180 grams silver
per tonne and 48.7 grams gold per tonne), hole SL06–16 which
contained 35.8 feet averaging 26.7 ounces silver per ton and 1.46
ounces gold per ton (10.9 meters averaging 914 grams silver per
tonne and 50.16 grams gold per tonne) and hole SL06–17, drilled
beneath hole SL06–16, which contained 89.9 feet averaging 0.69
ounces  per  ton  of  gold  and  19.7  ounces  per  ton  of  silver  (27.4
meters averaging 23.72 grams per tonne gold and 676 grams per
tonne silver) and included 14.7 feet averaging 2.24 ounces per ton
of  gold  and  64.6  ounces  per  ton  of  silver  (4.5  meters  averaging
76.89 grams per tonne gold and 2216 grams per tonne silver).
GEOLOGY
High-grade gold and silver quartz veins are hosted within Tertiary-
age andesitic volcanic rocks of the Calipuy Formation. Six separate,
subparallel veins have been identified so far, with individual veins
having strike lengths ranging from a few hundred meters to more
than 2,000 meters. Vein widths are also variable, ranging from less
than one meter up to more than 10 meters. Mineralization within
the  veins  is  typical  of  classic  quartz-adularia  or  low-sulfidation
epithermal systems, which include major precious metal deposits
SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC. 2006 ANNUAL REPORT
such  as  El  Peñon  in  Chile  and  the  Comstock  Lode  in  Nevada.
Channel  sampling  in  2006  defined  over  450  meters  of  bonanza
grade  mineralization  on  the  Ayelén  Vein.  Additional  sampling  on
the parallel Inés Vein, located 100 meters east of the Ayelén Vein,
has defined a 75 meter interval of 407 grams silver per tonne
and  15.5  grams  gold  per  tonne  across  an  average  width  of
2.73 meters.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
The Joint Venture is engaged in a proactive program of community
relations. A large part of this program involves regular meetings with
local  community  leaders  and  officials.  Land  access  agreements
were  successfully  negotiated  with  the  local  communities.  These
agreements  formed  an  integral  part  of  the  environmental
submissions for the work permits.
PROJECT SCOPE AND PLANS
Exploration  in  2007  will  largely  be  directed  to  the  ﬁ ve  kilometers  of
known  veins  on  the  property.   The  Ayelén  and  Ines  veins  will  be  the
focus of a 15,000 meter drill program scheduled for 2007.  The goal
of  this  program  is  to  complete  sufﬁ cient  drilling  to  begin  preliminary
engineering and environmental studies by year-end.
The  four  other  veins  identiﬁ ed  within  the  core  claim  area  to  the  east
of Ayelén and Inés will be sampled at surface and then drilled.  Also,
additional veins have been identiﬁ ed on the 25,000-hectare (95-square-
mile) property; these will be mapped in detail during 2007.
A stream sediment survey that covered the entire property has identiﬁ ed
highly anomalous areas that are located away from the main exploration
area for follow-up prospecting. A ﬁ eld crew will shortly begin initial rock
sampling up-stream from these anomalies.

Pitarrilla
STATE OF DURANGO, MEXICO
LOCATION AND HISTORY
The  Pitarrilla  project  is  located  on  the
eastern ﬂ ank of the Sierra Madre mountain
range  in  the  central  part  of  Durango  State,
Mexico. The major city of Torreon lies approximately
150  kilometers  (93  miles)  east  of  the  project.  Road
access  is  good,  with  paved  highways  extending  to
within  20  kilometers  of  the  center  of  the  property.
Silver  Standard,  through  Silver  Standard  Durango
S.A.  de  C.V.,  holds  a  100%  interest  in  the  mineral
rights  to  the  approximately  29,680-hectare  Pitarrilla
claim  block  and  has  applied  for  an  additional  claim
covering in excess of 100,000 hectares. The company
also holds signiﬁ cant surface rights in the area.
GEOLOGY
To date, five zones of economically significant silver mineralization
have  been  identified  on  the  property,  with  four  of  these  zones
being  closely  associated  with  a  rhyolite  flow-dome  complex  that
caps  a  600-meter  thick  package  of  Tertiary-age  andesite,  dacite
and  rhyolite  volcanic  rocks.  This  succession  of  volcanic  rocks
unconformably  overlies 
folded  marine  sedimentary  rocks  of
Cretaceous age, and is intruded by a complex system of rhyolite
sills and dikes. These rhyolite intrusive bodies, which can be more
than 100 meters thick, are a key rock type at Pitarrilla because most
mineralization  is  either  hosted  in  the  rhyolites  or  in  the  enclosing
brecciated host rock.

Drilling South Ridge with a view of Breccia Ridge.
There  are  now  two  types  of  mineralization  at  Pitarrilla.  The  first
is  finely  disseminated  microscopic  grains  of  silver  minerals  in
iron  stained  rhyolite  intrusive  and  volcanic  rocks.  The  second  is
disseminated  massive  sulphide  mineralization  containing  variable
amounts  of  silver,  iron,  zinc,  lead  and  copper  sulphide  minerals.
Copper values generally average between 0.2% and 0.5% but can
range up to 17% in individual samples. Lead and zinc values each
can locally exceed 20%.
Throughout  2006,  diamond  drilling  was  focused  on  defining  the
limits of the Breccia Ridge and South Ridge deposits. One of the
outcomes  of  last  year’s  program  was  the  discovery  of  massive
sulphide  mineralization  located  in  feeder  zones  below  Breccia
Ridge. Some of this mineralization is associated with the flat lying
contact between the volcanics and the underlying sediments. Other
zones  are  structurally  controlled  and  extend  well  down  into  the
sediments.
This  past  year  we  were  very  successful  in  expanding  the  known
resource  at  Pitarrilla,  and  in  improving  the  overall  quality  of  the
defined  resources.  A  resource  estimate  completed  in  July,  2006
increased  the  measured  and  indicated  resources  to  234.3  million
ounces  of  silver,  which  represents  an  increase  of  249%,  and
increased  the  inferred  resources  to  192.1  million  ounces  of  silver,
which represents an increase of 47.5%. This was achieved through
the  completion  of  over  40,000  meters  of  drilling  in  118  holes.
Highlights  from  the  South  Ridge  Zone  include  hole  PD-92  which
intersected 515 feet of 6.5 ounces silver per ton (157.0 meters of
223.0 grams silver per tonne); and PD-120 with 445.2 feet of 5.3
ounces silver per ton (135.7 meters of 183.3 grams silver per ton).
Drilling  at  Breccia  Ridge  was  equally  successful  as  demonstrated
by  hole  PD-148  which  cut  841.8  feet  averaging  6.4  ounces  silver
per  ton  (256.6  meters  averaging  220.0  grams  silver  per  tonne);
SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC. 2006 ANNUAL REPORT
including  329.0  feet  which  contained  7.5  ounces  silver  per  ton
(100.3 meters containing 258.5 grams silver per tonne), 3.45% zinc
and  1.50%  lead.  Other  significant  Breccia  Ridge  holes  included
PD-152 which intersected 534.8 feet of 6.7 ounces silver per ton
(163.0 meters of 230.1 grams silver per tonne), including 51.5 feet
of 49.8 ounces silver per ton (15.7 meters of 1,706.1 grams silver
per  tonne)  6.92%  zinc,  6.00%  lead  and  5.57%  copper;  and  hole
PD-157  which  contained  an  impressive  1,972  feet  averaging  2.5
ounces silver per ton (601.0 meters averaging 86.7 grams silver per
tonne), including 99 feet of 8.5 ounces silver per ton (30.2 meters of
291.5 grams silver per tonne), 5.85% zinc and 2.16% lead.
PROJECT SCOPE AND PLANS
The 2007 exploration program at Pitarrilla calls for the continuation of
the aggressive drilling program with 60,000 meters planned. At present
there are ﬁ ve diamond drills working on the property, which will initially
focus  on  in-ﬁ ll  and  step  out  drilling  at  Breccia  Ridge  Zone  and  then
on  South  Ridge  Zone.  Throughout  the  year,  geological  mapping  and
interpretation of the drill results will lead to the testing for new zones of
mineralization. An underground ramp is currently being contemplated
to  access  the  deep  mineralization  for  metallurgical  sampling  and
deﬁ nition drilling. Metallurgical studies will be ongoing with the objective
of designing an economically feasible ore processing ﬂ ow sheet.

Proyecto La Pitarrilla
El  proyecto  La  Pitarrilla  está  ubicado  en  el  lado  Este  de  la
cordillera  Sierra  Madre  Occidental,  a  lo  largo  del  Corredor  de
Plata  de  México,  en  el  Estado  de  Durango,  aproximadamente
150 kilómetros al Oeste de Torreón, Coahuila. Está comunicado
con  caminos  de  terracería  a  carreteras  pavimentadas  que  se
encuentran  a  menos  de  50  kilómetros  del  proyecto.  Silver
Standard  posee  una  participación  del  100%  de  los  derechos
minerales  de  un  área  aproximada  de  29,680  hectáreas  que
conforma el bloque de lotes mineros de La Pitarrilla.
El  año  pasado  la  compañía  tuvo  mucho  éxito  al  expandir  el
recurso de plata conocido en La Pitarrilla, y en mejorar la calidad
de los recursos deﬁ nidos. El estimado de recursos realizado en
Julio del 2006, incrementó los recursos medidos e indicados a
234.3 millones de onzas de plata, lo cual representa un aumento
del 249%, e incrementó los recursos inferidos a 192.1 millones
de onzas de plata, lo cual arroja un incremento del 47.5%. Esto
se  logró  a  través  de  la  perforación  de  más  de  40,000  metros
de  barrenación,  distribuidos  en  118  barrenos,  enfocándose
casi exclusivamente a las zonas conocidas como South Ridge
y Breccia Ridge.
El programa de exploración del año 2007 en la Pitarrilla incluye
planes  para  la  perforación  de  más  de  60,000  metros  de
barrenación  a  diamante.  Actualmente  existen  cinco  máquinas
de perforación a diamante trabajando en la propiedad.

Snowﬁ eld
BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA
LOCATION AND HISTORY
The  property  is  located  65  kilometers
(40 miles) north-northeast of Stewart, British
Columbia,  along  the  eastern  margin  of  the
Coast  Mountain  Range.  Access  to  the  property  is
currently  by  helicopter,  although  the  Eskay  Creek
Mine  access  road  lies  approximately  25  kilometers
to  the  northwest.  The  Snowﬁeld  project  consists
of  seven  claims  totaling  4,467  hectares  (see  claim
map page 27). Four mineralized zones were located
between 1980 and 1993, which include the Snowﬁ eld
Gold  Zone.  Ten  historical  drill  holes  in  the  Snowﬁ eld
Gold Zone indicated potential for a bulk tonnage, gold-
molybdenum resource.
20
GEOLOGY
The  property  is  underlain  by  Jurassic  volcanics,  volcanoclastics,
and  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Hazelton  Group.  The  host  rocks  of
the  mineralization  have  been  subjected  to  a  pervasive  propylitic  to
quartz-sericite alteration. During the summer of 2006, Silver Standard
completed 27 diamond drill holes totaling 6,141 meters. These deﬁ ned
a  body  of  mineralization  that  is  ﬂ at  lying,  elongate  in  an  east-west
direction  and  appears  to  have  a  keel  shape  at  depth  along  the  axis
of the body. The mineralization is consistently zoned, with the highest
grades at surface then decreasing values with depth. Low grade values
of copper and molybdenum are associated with the gold.
The mineralization has been drill tested over an area measuring 350
meters  by  450  meters.  The  high  grade  surface  zone  averages  over
2.5  grams  gold  per  tonne  and  ranges  in  thickness  between  30  and
90 meters. The entire package of mineralization averages 150 to 170
meters in thickness but can range up to 225 meters in thickness. The
zone  is  currently  open  in  all  directions.  Signiﬁ cant  drill  intersections
from the 2006 program include hole SF-04 which contained 676 feet
averaging  0.057  ounces  gold  per  ton  (206.1  meters  averaging  1.94
grams  gold  per  tonne),  including  310  feet  containing  0.089  ounces
gold per ton (94.5 meters containing 3.06 grams gold per tonne); and
hole  SF-24  which  intersected  785  feet  containing  0.05  ounces  gold
per ton (239.5 meters containing 1.63 grams gold per tonne), including
295 feet with 0.08 ounces gold per ton (90.0 meters with 2.61 grams
gold per tonne).

Oculto Zone Drilling.
Diablillos
SALTA PROVINCE, ARGENTINA
LOCATION AND HISTORY
Diablillos  is  located  160  kilometers  (99
miles)  northwest  of  Salta  on  the  altiplano
of  northern  Argentina.  The  property  is  road
accessible and is 250 kilometers south of Pirquitas.
The recent announcement by the Province of Salta
to  construct  a  natural  gas  pipeline  will  beneﬁ t  the
project if the pipeline is extended to the southwest
near Diablillos.
Discovered in the 1970’s, the property was primarily
explored  from  1988  to  2001.  Total  expenditures
by  previous  operators,  in  excess  of  US$17  million,  resulted  in
the  discovery  of  seven  mineralized  zones  with  the  Oculto  Zone,
the  largest,  containing  the  reported  resource.  Exploration  drilling
completed by prior operators and Silver Standard totals in excess of
60,000 meters in over 300 rotary, reverse circulation and diamond
drill holes.
GEOLOGY
The  property  is  underlain  by  Late  Miocene  calc-alkaline  volcanics
and  porphyry  style  intrusions  that  overlie  Ordovician  to  Cambrian
schists and gneisses. The Oculto Zone is an epithermal system with
the  silver  mineralization  structurally  controlled  in  the  volcanics  and
gold mineralization controlled by the contact between the volcanics
and schists.
Metallurgical  testwork  undertaken  for  Barrick  Gold  Corporation
by  Lakeﬁ eld  Research  determined  that  conventional  milling  gave
average  recoveries  above  75%  for  silver  and  ranged  from  80%  to
85% for gold.
PROJECT PLANS
During 2006, a geological review of the project determined that the
previous reverse circulation drilling may have understated the gold
and silver values. As a result, a 15,000 meter diamond drilling program
is planned to begin in the second quarter of 2007. The drill program
has  been  designed  to  investigate  whether  drill  results  obtained  by
the previous drilling campaigns understated values and also to test
a  number  of  gold  targets  separate  from  the  Oculto  Zone  where  a
re-interpretation of the geology indicates potential for the discovery
of new mineralization. On completion of the drill program, an updated
resource  estimate  will  be  prepared  followed  by  an  update  of  the
Barrick pre-feasibility study, which indicated that Diablillos could be
developed as an open pit mine producing approximately 7.0 million
ounces of silver and 70,000 ounces of gold per annum.

A Look at
Exploration
A  resource  company  has  two  primary  ways  to  grow.
One  is  through  acquisitions,  and  the  second  is  through
exploration. Since our focus on silver in 1993, we have
used both strategies to grow.
In 1996, we purchased our ﬁ rst project, Bowdens in Australia, for US$6 million, or 10 cents per
resource ounce of silver. The rationale was that in a period of low silver prices and increasingly
difﬁ cult  ﬁ nancing,  there  was  lower  risk  and  less  cost  with  an  acquisition  in  a  mining  friendly
country, than in grass roots exploration. During the years of favorable exchange rates (a weak
Australian  dollar)  we  continued  exploration  at  Bowdens  and  increased  the  resource  from  60
million ounces of silver to over 97 million ounces in all categories, plus lead and zinc values.
For  Silver  Standard,  the  Bowdens  acquisition  marked  the  beginning  of  a  methodical  search
for silver-dominant projects with exploration upside in geopolitically attractive countries in the
Western  Hemisphere.  Following  that  model,  we  acquired  Newhawk  Gold  Mines  by  issuing
shares in 1999, while silver prices continued to weaken. Newhawk had three principal assets:
cash, the Sulphurets underground gold-silver deposit and the Snowﬁ eld gold zone. This low-
grade zone, while potentially bulk mineable, was unattractive at the time, when gold prices were
under US$300 per ounce.
Later, we purchased the Candelaria Mine in Nevada for less than two cents (US) per resource
ounce of silver. This was followed by the acquisition of the Shafter property in Texas, at less than
two cents (US) per resources ounce, the Diablillos property in Argentina for under four cents (US)
per resource ounce, and the Berenguela project in Peru for six cents (US) per resource ounce of
silver. Each of these acquisitions, except Shafter, is large and potentially mineable by low-cost
bulk mining methods.
By the end of 2002, we had tied up many of the available, identiﬁ ed large-scale silver-dominant
projects in North and South America. As silver prices ﬁ rmed, the cost of project acquisitions
rose above 10 cents per resource ounce of silver, which we believed to be the economic limit
for acquisitions that would be accretive for our shareholders. Therefore, we turned our focus to
grass roots exploration.
Mexico and Peru are the historical leaders in global silver production. During the 25 year-long
bear market for silver, little capital had been dedicated to silver exploration in those countries,
Kenneth McNaughton
Vice President, Exploration
"Finding  Pitarrilla  was  the  result  of
highly  skilled  people  making  sure
we  were  in  the  right  place  at  the
right time."
SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC. 2006 ANNUAL REPORT
and  we  felt  that  undiscovered  opportunities  may  be  found  in  areas  where  the  geology  was
similar to known silver camps. We applied new exploration techniques such as satellite imagery
to isolate attractive areas, and then sent in geologists and ﬁ eld teams to prospect.
Our ﬁ rst efforts focused on the Central Mexican Silver Belt, where six or seven major camps
have each produced between 400 million and 1.4 billion ounces of silver over four centuries of
production. In west central Durango, we selected an area that had small-scale historic production
and showed tantalizing hints of large systems potentially capable of signiﬁ cant mineralization.
Initially, the question was whether we could discover silver mineralization of sufﬁ cient grade and
tonnage at surface to warrant further investigation. In early 2003, our ﬁ eld geologists returned
with samples from Cordon Colorado, located on the ﬂ anks of Cerro Pitarrilla, that ranged up to
ﬁ ve ounces of silver per ton (170 g/t silver).
We now have ﬁ ve drill-deﬁ ned zones at Pitarrilla, with silver resources in excess of 426 million
ounces  in  all  categories.  Diamond  drilling  with  ﬁ ve  rigs  is  ongoing  in  an  area  that  measures
approximately 3.5 square miles, which is a fraction of the 115 square mile land package for
which Silver Standard has the mineral rights.
So what is the value of this discovery? We believe Pitarrilla represents an intact classic Mexican
epithermal system with potential to rival the historic silver camps of Mexico. It is already among
the largest undeveloped silver resources in the world, and we know that at depth silver occurs
together with signiﬁ cant values in lead, zinc and copper. To date our exploration costs are under
10 cents per resource ounce of silver, for a project that has added several hundred million dollars
to the market capitalization of Silver Standard.
Encouraged by our success in Mexico, we applied a similar model in Peru. With our partner,
Esperanza Silver Corporation, we jointly funded an exploration program to examine prospective
geological formations for bulk mineable silver-gold mineralization. The ﬁ rst area we examined led
to the 2005 discovery of the San Luis project, an exceptionally high-grade epithermal gold-silver
quartz vein system. Although we have not completed sufﬁ cient drilling for a resource estimate,
we  are  sufﬁ ciently  encouraged  by  work  to  date  that  San  Luis  will  be  our  next  development
project after Pirquitas.
In British Columbia, higher commodity prices, especially gold and copper, have led to a surge
in exploration. Among the most prominent areas is Galore Creek in north central B.C., where
Silver Standard was a pioneer in helicopter exploration in the 1950s and 1960s. In 2005, our
chief geologist visited our nearby Snowﬁ eld property, a gold-molybdenum occurrence last drilled
in 1991. Based on much higher prices for the two metals, and the favorable location of the
mineralization, we drilled this property in the summer of 2006 and deﬁ ned a three million ounce
gold resource. In addition to potential for resource expansion and at depth, the Snowﬁ eld project
has evidence of a porphyry copper system below the gold zone. Using a conservative value of
US$50  per  resource  ounce  of  gold,  the  project  has  already  added  substantial  value  to  the
company. The cost to Silver Standard was less than 50 cents (US) per resource ounce of gold.
In 2004, we formed a strategic alliance with Minco Silver Corporation to explore for silver in
China. Minco Silver’s parent company, Minco Mining Corporation, has been actively exploring
in China since 1994. Minco Silver’s primary asset is the Fuwan silver deposit, a 112.9 million
ounce silver discovery located in Guangdong province in southern China. Minco Silver recently
completed  a  C$15  million  public  ﬁ nancing  and  expects  to  commence  feasibility  work  in  the
second half of 2007.
As  our  experiences  with  Pitarrilla,  San  Luis,  Snowﬁ eld  and  Fuwan  demonstrate,  successful
exploration is the ultimate form of leverage for resource companies: relatively few exploration
dollars can create exponential returns on shareholder capital. So we intend that exploration will
remain a core value for Silver Standard in 2007 and well into the future.

A main-line railway passes within ﬁ ve kilometers of the property.
Exploration since the 1960’s comprised channel sampling, 17,700
meters of underground workings, bulk sampling and diamond drilling
of  6,628  meters  in  108  holes.  In  the  1990’s,  Kappes,  Cassiday  &

Bowdens
NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA
LOCATION AND HISTORY
The  Bowdens  silver  project  is  located  200  kilometers  (124  miles)
northwest of Sydney, Australia. It is readily accessible by road; a major
power  line  is  close  by;  and  we  own  the  surface  rights  covering  the
mineralization  and  the  proposed  mine  infrastructure.  The  property
consists  of  a  single  exploration  tenement  covering  93  square
kilometers. It was discovered by stream sediment sampling in 1988 and
to date, 395 drill holes totaling 43,309 meters have been completed.
GEOLOGY
The silver mineralization is hosted in a Permian ﬂ at-lying felsic volcanic
sequence  consisting  of  rhyodacite  ignimbrites  with  tufts  and  lesser
ﬂ ows. The mineralization appears to favor the contact between a porous
tuft  and  impermeable  ignimbrites.  The  low  sulphidization  epithermal
system has minor lead and zinc, with the silver occurring in galena,
sphalerite, argentite and percite.
PROJECT SCOPE AND PLANS
Metallurgical studies will be completed in 2007 which will be included
in an update of the economic evaluation of the project.

Candelaria Mine
NEVADA, USA
LOCATION AND HISTORY
Candelaria is located in west central Nevada, 90
kilometers (55 miles) southeast of Hawthorne. It is
accessible by paved road. Critical infrastructure, power lines and water
supply installed during previous operations are being maintained.
Candelaria was intermittently mined by underground methods from its
discovery in 1863 up to the mid-1960’s; open pit mining began in the
late 1970’s and ceased in 1999. Silver production totaled approximately
68 million ounces. Exploration by Kinross Gold Corporation, the former
owner, outlined the Diablo and Northern Belle resources.
GEOLOGY AND METALLURGY
The silver mineralization originally formed a continuous, tabular-shaped
zone with approximate dimensions of 6,100 meters along strike, 760
meters down-dip and thicknesses of one meter to over 30 meters within
regional  thrust  faults,  principally  the  Lower  Candelaria  Shear.  Later
faulting  disrupted  the  continuous  zone  into  structural  blocks  hosting
the current deposits. All of the measured and indicated resources and
40% of the inferred resource is as in-situ material beneath the Diablo
and  Northern  Belle  pits,  with  57%  of  inferred  resources  in  the  leach
pads  and  3%  in  low-grade  stockpiles.  Testwork  indicates  a  process

We  hold  the  rights  to  the  silver  resource  while  Vista  Gold  holds
the  rights  to  the  gold  resource.  A  total  of  190  holes  have  been
drilled on the property, including 54 holes totaling 15,263 meters
on behalf of the joint venture.
GEOLOGY AND METALLURGY
The  silver-gold  mineralization  occurs  as  a  Carlin-type,  sediment/
carbonate-hosted  disseminated  deposit  measuring  about  1,250
meters  in  length,  with  a  width  of  670  meters  and  a  thickness  of
approximately 60 meters. Mineralization is open to the south and
north-northwest.  Preliminary  metallurgical  testwork  indicates  a
process using conventional milling will yield 63% to 97% recoveries
for silver.

of milling followed by ﬂ otation, roasting and leaching will yield a 75%
recovery of silver.
PROJECT SCOPE AND PLANS
A scoping study prepared by Kappes, Cassidy & Associates suggests
the  project  could  be  advanced  as  a  milling  operation  followed  by
leaching at two million tons per year, once appropriate silver prices are
achieved.  This  year  we  will  further  investigate  resource  values  in  the
leach pads.

PROJECT SCOPE AND PLANS
Maverick  Springs  hosts  a  large  silver-rich  system  that  may  be
amenable to low unit cost bulk mining, similar to other Carlin-type
deposits.
Further  drilling  to  explore  the  extent  of  the  higher  grade  silver
mineralization discovered in 2006 will be undertaken in 2007.

Shafter
TEXAS, USA
LOCATION AND HISTORY
Shafter  is  located  in  southwest  Texas,  29
kilometers (18 miles) north of Presidio. Highway 67
and  a  major  power  line  cross  the  property.  Discovered  in  1880  and
mined until 1942, production totaled 35 million ounces of silver from
the original Presidio mine.
In  1977,  Gold  Fields  Mining  discovered  an  eastern  extension  of  the
Presidio mine, the Shafter deposit. Exploration by Rio Grande Mining
and previous operators comprises 891 drill holes, a 320-meter shaft
and 1,555 meters of underground development.
In  2003,  the  company  transported  a  used  800  ton-per-day  mill
to Shafter.
GEOLOGY AND METALLURGY
Silver mineralization at Shafter and the historic Presidio mine is manto-
type replacement associated with karst development in Mina Grande
Formation limestone over approximately a three-mile length.
Test work indicates the highest recoveries for silver will be by in-tank
leaching followed by production of a silver-gold doré. Silver recoveries
are expected to be similar to historical values, 86% to 87%.

Challacollo
CHILE
LOCATION AND HISTORY
Challacollo  is  located  130  kilometers  (80  miles)
southeast  of  Iquique,  a  major  port  in  northern  Chile.
Access is good, with the Pan American Highway passing 30 kilometers
(19  miles)  west  of  the  property.  A  main  power  grid  is  located  15
kilometers (9 miles) north of the property.
GEOLOGY AND METALLURGY
Silver Standard began exploration at Challacollo in 2001 and prepared
a  resource  estimate  in  2003.  Based  on  the  resource  estimate,  a
scoping  study  was  prepared  by  Kappes,  Cassiday  &  Associates,
which, though requiring updating, contemplates a mine plan producing
3.1 million ounces of silver and 3,200 ounces of gold per year over a
10-year mine life.
PROJECT SCOPE AND PLANS
Geologically, Challacollo is located along a strong north-south lineament
that includes a number of copper deposits to the north, with a possible
east-west  lineament  postulated  between  major  copper  deposits  to
the east and Challacollo. As a result, Challacollo is considered highly
prospective  for  the  discovery  of  additional  mineralization  and  further
exploration drilling is planned for 2007 prior to moving forward with the
planned scoping study update.
PROJECT SCOPE AND PLANS
A scoping study by Kappes, Cassiday & Associates suggests mining at
the rate of 324,000 tons per year to initially produce 3.2 million ounces
of silver per year. Silver production would average 2.6 million ounces
over the seven-year mine life. The company plans to renew permits as
they come up for renewal.

LONG SECTION AND POLYGONAL RESOURCE
Veta Colorada
STATE OF CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO
The project comprises three separate properties,
Veta Colorada, La Palmilla and San Patricio, which
lie within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the city of Parral in
southern Chihuahua State, Mexico. The Veta Colorada vein system is
a siliciﬁ ed fault breccia that follows a major east-dipping fault for more
than 10 kilometers. Historical silver ore chutes have strike lengths of
about  500  meters,  dip  extents  reaching  500  meters  and  widths  up
to  30  meters.  Intermittent  underground  mining  at  La  Palmilla  came
from a large, subvertical quartz vein having a maximum length of 150
meters, a vertical height of about 70 meters and a maximum thickness
of 30 meters. We plan to compile historic data and undertake a limited
diamond drill program.
San Marcial
STATE OF SINALOA, MEXICO
(56  miles)  east  of
The  property  is  located  in  the  Sierra  Madre
mountains,  90  kilometers 
Mazatlan in Mexico. It consists of a single claim totaling
1,250 hectares in a district which has produced silver, gold, lead and
zinc. The property is underlain by basal conglomerates, rhyolites, and
dacites  of  the  Upper  Volcanic  Group,  with  Lower  Volcanic  Group
andesites and dacites underneath. The known silver veins are steeply
dipping to the north east and are hosted in the Lower Volcanic Group.
The mineralization forms quartz-sulphide veins and breccias up to 21
meters in width. The project is currently considered a non-core asset
and as such the company will seek to monetize it.
Sulphurets
BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA
This high-grade, gold-silver project is adjacent to
our Snowﬁ eld project, approximately 62 kilometers
(39 miles) northwest of Stewart, British Columbia. Since
1986 over $40 million has been spent on exploration and development,
including  78,300  meters  of  surface  and  underground  drilling,  5.2
kilometers  (3.3  miles)  of  underground  development  and  completion
of a feasibility study for a 350 ton per day operation. Of the seven
mineralized zones explored to date, the West Zone hosts the majority
of the gold and silver resources and is comprised of ten steeply-dipping
veins of up to 40 metres (130 feet) strike length and 280 metres (920
feet) vertical extent. Due to its proximate location, the project may be
advanced in conjunction with the Snowﬁ eld project.

Silvertip
BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA
The project is located in northern British Columbia,
approximately  85  kilometers  (53  miles)  southwest
of Watson Lake, Yukon Territory, and is accessed by a
25-kilometer gravel road from the Alaska Highway. Exploration work by
previous operators has included 71,472 meters of drilling in 491 holes
and 2.67 kilometers of underground development, and expenditures
have exceeded $23 million. Silvertip is among the highest grade silver-
lead-zinc carbonate replacement deposits in North America, with 11
ounces of silver per ton and combined grades of 17% lead and zinc.
The sulphide deposits form gently dipping mantos of 20 to 30 metres
thickness that extend for up to 200 metres. As the project is not a core
asset, we will seek to monetize the asset.
Sunrise Lake
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA
28
Sunrise Lake is located in the Northwest Territories
130 kilometers (81 miles) northeast of Yellowknife. It
is accessible by aircraft in the summer and by road in
the winter. Discovered in 1987, a resource was subsequently outlined
with  21,774  meters  of  diamond  drilling.  It  is  a  typical  volcanogenic
polymetallic  massive  sulphide  deposit  comprising  a  steeply  dipping
massive  lens  three  to  four  meters  thick  that  extends  120  meters  to
190 meters along strike and is open to depth. Underlying the massive
mineralization is lower grade disseminated and stringer mineralization
that extends for approximately 320 metres along strike and is up to
50  meters  thick.  As  the  project  is  not  a  core  asset,  we  will  seek  to
monetize it.
San Agustin
STATE OF DURANGO, MEXICO
San  Agustin  is  located  85  kilometers  (52  miles)
north  of  Durango  City  in  Durango  State,  Mexico.
The  property  is  underlain  by  a  dacite  volcanic  dome
complex resting on ﬁ ne siltstones and sandstones. The entire package
was  structurally  brecciated  and  mineralized  with  gold  and  silver  on
surface  and  base  metal  mineralization  at  depth.  We  acquired  the
property in 2003 by staking and completed 3,890 meters of drilling in
24 drill holes. This program along with 10,400 meters of drilling by a
prior property holder deﬁ ned several zones of low-grade mineralization.
In 2006, Geologix Explorations Inc. optioned the project and is required
to  complete  a  15,000  meter  drill  program.  We  will  receive  future
consideration based on the deﬁ ned resource.

Cautionary note to U.S. investors concerning disclosure of
contained ounces and estimates of measured, indicated and
inferred  mineral  resources:  The  terms  "measured  mineral
resource",  "indicated  mineral  resource",  and  "inferred
mineral resource" used in the Annual Report are Canadian
geological and mining terms as deﬁ ned in accordance with
National  Instrument  43-101,  Standards  of  Disclosure  for
Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101") under the guidelines set out in
the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum
(the  "CIM")  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral
Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council on August 20, 2000
as  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time  by  the  CIM.  We
advise U.S. investors that while such terms are recognized
and required under Canadian regulations, the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") does not recognize
them. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any
part or all of the mineral deposits in the "measured mineral
resource"  and  "indicated  mineral  resource"  categories  will
ever be converted into reserves. "Inferred mineral resources"
have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and
great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It
cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral
resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under
Canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may
not  form  the  basis  of  feasibility  or  other  economic  studies.
U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of
all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically
or legally mineable. Disclosure of contained silver expressed
in  ounces  is  in  compliance  with  NI  43-101,  but  does  not
meet the requirements of Industry Guide 7 of the SEC, which
will  only  accept  the  disclosure  of  tonnage  and  grade  esti-
mates for non-reserve mineralization.
Silver Market
Update
Based on a 46% price increase, 2006 was a good year for
silver. Total annual demand is now approaching one billion
ounces. As dynamic as the silver market is, the complete
picture  is  quite  complex.  To  keep  you  current  we  have
assembled a synopsis of global demand and supply issues,
and a look to the future.
SILVER MARKET DRIVERS
For  the  ﬁ rst  time  in  several  decades,  investment  demand  emerged  as  a  signiﬁ cant  growth
component (9% of total demand). This growth is illustrated by the success of the iShares Silver
Trust which commenced trading in the U.S. in April 2006. For many years silver market observers
focused  primarily  on  estimates  of  fabrication  demand,  together  with  mine  supply  and  scrap
recycling, to determine market balance. But with the success of the silver exchange-traded fund
(ETF) attracting increasing investor interest, and Barclay's application to double the size of trust,
further growth in investment demand may be expected.
Industrial  demand,  which  includes  electronic  and  electrical  applications,  accounts  for  46%  of
global silver demand. 2006 likely surpassed 2005’s record of over 409 million ounces of silver.
Demand continues for semiconductors and a variety of consumer products such as ﬂ at screen
displays.  Silver  use  in  applications  including  solders,  bearings,  chemical  catalysts  used  in
polyethylene, mirrors, medical equipment and dental alloys, remained strong. Photographic use of
silver comprised 16% of demand in 2006, down 2% from 2005.
Silver supply was met through mining (70%), scrap recycling (21%), and government sales (9%).
So far, higher silver prices have not resulted in a signiﬁ cant production increase. Production growth
is estimated at four million ounces (0.6%) globally. Measured by source, silver by-production in
lead-zinc, copper and gold mines grew by 2%, while production in primary silver mines fell by
nearly 3%. Government sales were estimated at less than 80 million ounces, the majority from
China and Russia. India supplied approximately 30 million ounces to its domestic market.
Jewelry  and  silverware  (24%  of  total  demand)  declined  by  almost  20  million  ounces,  led  by  a
demand  slump  in  India,  which  was  caused  by  central  government  sales  into  the  local  market,
high  prices  denominated  in  rupees,  and  2005  inventory  build-up  that  was  sold  in  2006.  The
use of silver in photography (16%) declined by approximately 17 million ounces, reﬂ ecting the
new dominance of digital photography. This decline is offset by the drop in silver recovered from
photographic related recycling. Levels of Indian scrap, a major source of recycled silver, did not
grow in 2006 and silver prices are still not high enough to stimulate large scale scrapping of jewelry

and silverware. In summary, overall fabrication demand in 2006 likely declined by approximately
3%, though investment demand has grown rapidly since 2002, reaching approximately 80 million
ounces in 2006.
OUTLOOK FOR 2007
GFMS believes that the main driver in the outlook for silver prices is investment demand. Many
investors think that silver’s unique qualities give it price inelasticity in industrial applications and,
from a monetary perspective, they anticipate that a continued decline in the relative value of
the U.S. dollar will be beneﬁ cial for silver. Both views are supported in the strong correlation
in 2006 of silver to copper prices, and an even stronger correlation between silver and gold
prices. Silver has actually outperformed gold as shown in the decline in the gold: silver ratio
since 2003.
On the global economic front, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
reported  in  November  2006  that  real  GDP  growth  among  its  30  members  (which  include
Western Europe, North America, Japan, Korea and Australia) would average 3.2% for the year.
In  2007  and  2008,  growth  rates  are  forecast  at  2.5%  and  2.7%  respectively,  reﬂ ecting  the
impact of monetary tightening.
Growth in India and China—the major producers of electronics and electrical goods—is forecast
at greater than 7% and 10% respectively in 2007 and 2008. This continued economic growth
favors growth in industrial uses of silver, though likely at a slower pace than 2006. New silver
production in 2007, GFMS notes, could total 16 million ounces, and total planned expansions
between  2007  and  2010  are  expected  to  add  “much  less”  than  the  100  million  ounces  of
annual production that were added in the latter half of the 1990s. This would imply a growth in
mine supplies of silver close to OECD growth rates over the next several years.
Data Source: These estimates are based on GFMS’ commentary in their silver market update,
provided for the Silver Institute in mid-November 2006.
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN SILVER APPLICATIONS
New  applications  that  take  advantage  of  silver’s  anti-microbial  properties  reached  North
American  markets  in  2006.  Motorola  introduced  cell  phones  (Models  i870,  i835  and  i880)
featuring  an  antimicrobial  coating  developed  by  AgION  Technologies  (www.agion-tech.com).
Keyboard  manufacturer  Logitech  (www.logitech.com)  offers  a  wireless  keyboard  and  mouse
(Model MX 3200) that uses silver to eliminate germs. Skilcraft’s EconoGard ballpoint pens (www.
inb.org) employ a silver-based antimicrobial material, joining Paper Mate’s FlexGrip Elite pens.
Canadian  paper  maker  Domtar  Inc.  (www.domtar.com)  has  launched  a  line  of  silver-treated
papers that show over 90% bacteria reduction on the paper surface.
The European Union’s recent ban on the use of lead-tin solders in canned goods and electronics,
means the replacement silver-tin solders should increase silver demand up to 100 million ounces
annually, according to a paper presented at the 5th annual China International Silver Conference
held last fall.
Another development is the superconducting wire market, which the U.S. Department of Energy
estimates could reach 50 million ounces per year within a decade. Silver reduces resistance
losses compared to copper. Applications include motors and generators, medical diagnostic
technology and electricity transmission in power lines.
Wood preservatives are a developing market, since copper arsenides were banned from use in
fence posts in the U. S. and Japan. Research published in 2006 showed several commercial
silver-based  products  to  be  effective  in  preventing  fungal  decay  in  certain  conditions.  The
research is supported by the Silver Research Consortium, funded in part by The Silver Institute.

Concern  about  deteriorating  water  quality  due  to  copper-based  biocides  has  led  preserved
wood  manufacturers  to  shift  toward  silver  biocides.  The  worldwide  market  is  estimated  at
120 million ounces of silver annually, and product authorities believe silver biocides will in time
capture the entire market.

Management Discussion
&Analysis
MANAGEMENT  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL
POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS
We  are  a  company  focused  on  the  acquisition,  exploration  and
development  of  silver-dominant  projects,  with  a  portfolio  of  core
properties  in  Argentina,  Australia,  Canada,  Chile,  Mexico,  Peru  and
the United States. Our strategy is to acquire, hold and advance high
quality  geopolitically  diverse  silver  projects  with  deﬁ ned  resources  in
anticipation  of  higher  silver  prices.  In  October  2006,  we  announced
the  production  decision  on  our  Pirquitas  property  in  Argentina.  Our
common  stock  is  quoted  on  the  Nasdaq  Global  Market  under  the
trading  symbol  SSRI  and  on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange  under  the
symbol SSO.
This  management  discussion  and  analysis  (MD&A)  of  the  ﬁnancial
position and operating results of the company for the twelve months
ended  December  31,  2006  and  2005  is  prepared  as  of  March  1,
2007 and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
ﬁ nancial  statements  and  the  related  notes  thereto,  which  have  been
prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles. All dollar amounts referred to in this discussion and analysis

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR 2006
•
•
•
•
•
•
In April we closed the sale of our 50% interest in the Manantial
Espejo property in Argentina for a gain of $35.4 million.
In May we closed a public offering of 7.2 million common shares
for net proceeds of $171.1 million.
We completed a feasibility study update on our Pirquitas
property in Argentina and in October we announced the
production decision for this property.
We completed the acquisition of the Berenguela property in Peru
and the Veta Colorada property in Mexico.
We had record earnings of $16.4 million or $0.28 per share and
ended the year with a record $250.2 million in working capital,
including $229.6 million of cash with no debt.
We had record cash exploration investment of $39.4 million on
our various mineral properties with signiﬁ cant results reported at
our San Luis joint venture property in Peru, our Pitarrilla property
in Mexico and our Snowﬁ eld property in Canada.
PIRQUITAS PRODUCTION DECISION
In  October  2006,  we  made  a  production  decision  on  our  Pirquitas
property. This property is located in the province of Jujuy in northwest
Argentina and is expected to produce in excess of nine million ounces
of silver per year over a nine- year mine life. The mine is also estimated
to produce in excess of 2,500 tonnes of tin and 6,600 tonnes of zinc
annually. The mine is estimated to require 21-24 months to construct
at  an  estimated  cost  of  US$146  million,  plus  value  added  tax  that  is
recoverable.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2006,  engineering  commenced
and  equipment  purchases  were  made  including  the  purchase  of  the
ball mill.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
We  had  net  earnings  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006  of
$16,382,000, or $0.28 per share, compared to a net loss of $5,870,000
or $0.11 per share in 2005.
33
The net earnings in 2006 included a $35,390,000 gain on disposal of
our  joint  venture  interest  in  the  Manantial  Espejo  property.  Offsetting
some of the impact of this gain were higher expenses and higher non-
cash stock-based compensation expenses.
Financial Results from Operations

We  incurred  $267,000  in  property  examination  and  exploration
expenditures  in  2006  compared  to  $434,000  in  2005.  As  our  focus
turned to the advancement and development of our existing properties,
less emphasis was placed on grass roots exploration during 2006. In
2006, $136,000 of the amount spent on exploration was in Peru and
$90,000 in Mexico. In 2006, we wrote-off $101,000 in mineral property
costs  compared  to  write-offs  of  $372,000  in  2005.  One  property  in
Mexico and one property in Argentina were written off in 2006.
2006 ANNUAL REPORT SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC.
(a development stage company)
Reclamation and accretion expense in 2006 amounted to $2,131,000
compared  to  $507,000  in  2005.  The  various  components  of  the
expense were: $243,000 of accretion in 2006 compared to $44,000
of accretion in 2005, $77,000 of cash site restoration and clean-up
costs  in  2006  compared  to  $63,000  of  cash  site  restoration  and
clean-up costs in 2005 and $1,811,000 of changes in estimates of the
amount or timing of underlying future cash ﬂ ows in 2006 compared to
$400,000 of changes in estimates of the amount or timing of underlying
future cash ﬂ ows in 2005. The increase in expense in 2006 relates to
a  revised  provision  at  the  Silver  Standard  Mine  property  in  northern
British Columbia. During the second quarter of 2006, we submitted to
the regulatory authorities a report from our environmental consultants
outlining conceptual plans for reclamation of this site. From this report
we had sufﬁ cient information to re-estimate and record the value of
the liability associated with this property.

Salaries and employee beneﬁ ts for 2006 were $2,160,000 compared to
$1,031,000 in 2005. The $1,129,000 increase in salaries and beneﬁ ts
over 2005 is the result of a number of factors including the impact of
salary  adjustments  that  were  effective  at  the  beginning  of  2006  and
higher  bonus  payments.  In  May  2006,  we  made  a  non-recurring
$500,000 bonus payment to certain employees following the successful
closing of our public offering where net proceeds of $171 million were
raised. In December 2006, the bonus payments were $286,000 higher
than the payments made in 2005.
Depreciation expense during 2006 was $142,000 compared to $74,000
recorded  in  2005.  The  increase  is  mainly  due  to  the  depreciation
and  amortization  of  equipment  and  leasehold  improvements  in  our
Vancouver corporate ofﬁ ce.
We incurred $363,000 in internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting costs
during 2006 compared to $226,000 in 2005. We established this cost
category in 2005 to record both internal and external costs associated
with  compliance  with  Section  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  in  the
United  States  and  Multilateral  Instruments  52-109  and  52-111  in
Canada. Our costs to date are broken down into $137,000 compared
to $89,000 in 2005 for allocations of our staff time and expenses and
$226,000 for services of external consultants and auditors compared
to $137,000 in 2005.
Professional  fees  include  fees  for  the  annual  audit,  accounting,  tax
and legal services. Total costs for 2006 were $614,000 compared to
$176,000 in 2005. The $438,000 increase in expenses in 2006 over the
prior year relates to higher accounting, tax and legal fees. These higher
costs are expected to continue as we grow and develop our properties
into producing mines.
General  and  administrative  expenses  for  2006  were  $3,762,000
compared to $2,172,000 in 2005. The large $1,590,000 increase over
2005  relates  to  several  areas,  a  number  of  which  are  non-recurring.
During  the  year  we  commenced  discussions  with  lenders  relating  to
project ﬁ nancing of the Pirquitas property. We have maintained in the
discussions  that  we  wanted  a  nominal  amount  of  silver  hedging  in
order to maximize our exposure to the price of silver. Late in 2006, we
terminated our project ﬁ nancing discussions with one lender and wrote
off $498,000 in lender fees and due diligence costs. We are continuing
ﬁ nancing  discussions  with  various  lenders  but  these  discussions  will
not affect our construction timetable for the Pirquitas property as we
have sufﬁ cient liquidity already in place. In 2006, we made $351,000 in
donations compared to $23,000 in 2005. In 2006, we made donations
totaling $230,000 to the University of New Brunswick and the University
of British Columbia to further mineral exploration and mining education.
As a company with a long history in the advancement of mineral projects,
we understand the need for exploration and engineering excellence in
the mining industry. These donations will help ensure our prominence
in the minds of the best and brightest. Consulting fees in 2006 have
increased in the areas of public relations and in the hiring costs of new
technical staff as we move towards production. During 2006, we used a
placement agency for the search of a Senior Vice President, Operations
and  a  Manager  of  Environmental  and  Community  Relations.  We
continue our search for a Senior Vice President, Operations and expect
to announce a hiring by the second quarter of 2007. Other areas where
we  experienced  higher  general  and  administrative  costs  were  in  the
areas of insurance, listing and ﬁ ling fees, travel, director expenses and
an event in recognition of our 60th anniversary celebration. Expenditures
in these areas, other than the 60th anniversary, are expected to continue
to increase as we grow.
Stock-based  compensation  expense  for  2006  was  $12,935,000
compared to $4,035,000 in 2005. Due to the intense competition for
skilled employees currently existing in the mining business and, in order
to  ensure  we  remain  competitive  within  our  peer  group,  in  2006  we
employed a compensation consultant to assist us in our remuneration
policies.  Their  report  resulted  in  a  greater  number  of  options  being
granted  in  2006  compared  to  2005.  Of  the  current  year’s  expense,
$2,981,000,  compared  to  $567,000  in  2005,  related  to  general  and
administration for directors and consultants and $9,954,000, compared
to $3,468,000 in 2005, related to employee salaries and beneﬁ ts. We
value  stock  options  granted  to  employees,  directors  and  consultants
using  the  Black-Scholes  pricing  model.  An  additional  $751,000  in
stock-based compensation was assigned to mineral property costs in
2006 compared to $159,000 in 2005.

Investment income was $5,984,000 for 2006 compared to $881,000
in 2005. The large increase in investment income results from interest
earned on the larger cash balances from the closing of the $171,067,000
public offering in May and the sale of marketable securities in the last
quarter of 2006.
In April 2006, we closed the sale of our 50% interest in the Manantial
Espejo property to our joint venture partner, Pan American Silver Corp.
We  received  1,950,000  common  shares  of  Pan  American  valued  at
$55,056,000 recording a gain on sale of $35,390,000. During the last
quarter of 2006, we sold all our Pan American shares for proceeds of
$51,955,000. A $3,101,000 loss on sale of marketable securities was
recorded with the result that the net gain relating to our joint venture
interest sale was $32,289,000. Gains of $434,000 were recorded on
the sale of other marketable securities and this compares to gains of
$2,289,000 recorded in 2005.
In 2006, we sold a number of mineral properties for a gain of $173,000
compared to gains of $20,000 in 2005.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY
Operating Activities
Cash  ﬂow  from  operations  was  a  usage  of  $3,827,000  in  2006,
compared to a usage of $2,951,000 in 2005. This increase is due to
increases in salaries, professional fees, general and administrative costs
and charges to non-cash working capital items offset partially by higher
investment income.

We  spent  a  record  $39,379,000  on  our  various  mineral  properties
compared  to  our  previous  year  record  of  $20,933,000.  The
preceding  table  shows  the  allocation  of  cash  expenditures  by  our
main  properties.  In  2006,  by  far  the  most  active  property  was  the
Pitarrilla  property  in  Mexico.  A  total  of  $21,083,000  or  a  little  over
half  of  our  total  mineral  property  expenditures  was  spent  on  this
property  and  of  this  amount,  $9,473,000  was  on  exploration  with
the  remainder  on  land  acquisitions.  This  compares  to  $5,789,000
spent  in  2005.  We  continued  our  exploration  of  this  property  in
2006 with the completion of over 40,000 meters of diamond drilling
in  118  holes.  We  also  continued  our  acquisition  of  land  underlying
to  our  mineral  rights.  The  second  most  active  property  was  at  our
Pirquitas property, where $5,046,000 was spent in 2006 compared
to $4,271,000 in 2005. We completed the update of the feasibility
study  in  the  ﬁ rst  quarter  of  2006  and  work  continued  advancing
the  property  leading  to  the  production  decision  in  October  2006.
Also in 2006, we completed our acquisition of both the Berenguela
property  in  Peru  and  the  Veta  Colorada  property  in  Mexico.  A
further  $1,911,000  was  spent  at  our  Snowﬁ eld  property  in  British
Columbia and $1,402,000 was spent at the San Luis property. We
funded  the  initial  US$500,000  of  exploration  expenditures  on  the
San  Luis  property,  thereby  earning  a  55%  interest.  Our  agreement
with Esperanza Silver Corporation calls for the next US$1,500,000
of  exploration  expenditures  in  our  respective  interests.  To  the  end
of  2006,  US$1,355,000  of  this  amount  had  been  spent.  Once  we
reach  the  US$1,500,000,  we  can  elect  to  increase  our  interest  to
70% by paying all cost required to complete a feasibility study and
this interest can be increased to 80% by paying all costs required to
place the property into commercial production. We expect to make
our  election  to  earn  70%  interest  in  the  ﬁ rst  half  of  2007.  We  also
have a signiﬁ cant equity interest in Esperanza.
Construction in Progress
We spent $1,826,000 during the year relating to the construction of
the  Pirquitas  property.  The  main  expenditures  include  engineering
and  the  purchase  of  pipe  for  the  gas  pipeline  that  will  be  used  to
produce the power at the mine site.
Property, Plant and Equipment
We spent $1,782,000 on property, plant and equipment in 2006 and
this compares to $1,202,000 spent in 2005. Of the amount spent in
2006, $1,298,000 relates to the ball mill and mobile equipment for
the Pirquitas property and the balance relates to furniture, equipment
and leasehold improvements relating to an expansion of our corporate
head ofﬁ ce in Vancouver.
Proceeds on Sale of Marketable Securities
We  received  $52,410,000  in  proceeds  on  the  sale  of  marketable
securities in 2006 compared with $3,077,000 in 2005. Of the amount
received in 2006, $51,955,000 related to the sale of Pan American
Silver  Corp.  shares  and  $455,000  related  to  sales  of  various  other
marketable securities.
Liquidity
With  our  cash  position  and  market  value  of  our  silver  bullion  and
marketable securities, we have slightly under $295 million of liquidity
at December 31, 2006 and no debt. This strong position will provide
us  with  sufﬁcient  funds  to  meet  all  our  corporate,  development,
administrative  and  mineral  property  obligations  for  2007.  We  will
continue to have discussions with project lenders for a portion of the
construction costs of the Pirquitas mine but funds are in place now
to complete this construction over the next two years.
Cash
At  December  31,  2006,  we  had  a  cash  balance  of  $229,616,000
and  no  debt.  This  compares  to  a  cash  balance  of  $23,030,000  at
December 31, 2005, also with no debt.
Silver Bullion
We hold 1,953,985 ounces of silver valued at $15,787,000 at the end
of the year. The average cost of our silver bullion is $8.08 (US$5.85)
per ounce. Our silver bullion is carried on the balance sheet at the
lower of cost or net realizable value. The market value of our silver
bullion  was  $29,373,000  for  an  unrealized  gain  of  $13,586,000  at
December  31,  2006  compared  to  a  market  value  of  $20,093,000
for  an  unrealized  gain  of  $4,306,000  at  December  31,  2005.  The
purchase of silver bullion was made, in part, to recognize that silver
is  an  investment  alternative  for  our  cash  reserves  and  to  provide
maximum  exposure  to  silver.  Our  silver  bullion  is  a  highly  liquid
asset.
Marketable Securities
Our marketable securities at December 31, 2006 have a carried cost
of $5,817,000 and a market value of $35,617,000 for an unrealized
gain of $29,800,000 compared to a carried cost of $4,985,000 and a
market value of $15,087,000 for an unrealized gain of $10,102,000 at
December 31, 2005. These investments were made in various mineral
exploration companies and are considered to be liquid.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Control and Procedures
Our  management,  with  the  participation  of  the  President  and  Vice
President, Finance, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as deﬁ ned in the rules of the CSA and the SEC)
as at December 31, 2006, and have concluded that such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.
Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial
Reporting
The following report is provided by management in respect of internal
control over ﬁ nancial reporting (as deﬁ ned in the rules of the CSA and
the SEC):
(1) Management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining
adequate  internal  control  over  ﬁ nancial  reporting.  All  internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations  and  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide  only  reasonable  assurance  with  respect  to  ﬁ nancial
statement  preparation  and  presentation.  Also,  projections  of
any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
(2) Our  management  has  used  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework
to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over ﬁ nancial
reporting.
(3) As  at  December  31,  2006,  management  assessed  the
effectiveness of our internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting and
concluded  that  such  internal  control  over  ﬁ nancial  reporting
is effective and that there are no material weaknesses in our
internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There  have  been  no  changes  in  our  internal  control  over  ﬁnancial
reporting  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006,  that  have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect our internal control
over ﬁ nancial reporting.
Related Party Transactions
During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006,  we  recorded  expense
reimbursements  of  $363,000,  compared  to  $277,000  in  2005,  from
companies related by common directors or ofﬁ cers. At December 31,
2006,  accounts  receivable  include  $49,000,  compared  to  $77,000
in  2005  from  these  related  parties.  Any  amounts  due  to/from  related
parties are non-interest bearing and without speciﬁ c terms of repayment.
Any transactions for expense reimbursement with related parties are at
normal business terms.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The  preparation  of  our  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  requires
management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as revenues and expenses. Our
accounting policies are set out in full in note 2 of the annual ﬁ nancial
statements.
Mineral Property Costs
We regularly review the net carrying value of each mineral property for
conditions  that  suggest  impairment.  This  review  requires  signiﬁ cant
judgment  where  we  do  not  have  any  proven  and  probable  reserves
that  would  enable  us  to  estimate  future  cash  ﬂ ows  to  be  compared
to the carrying values. Factors considered in the assessment of asset
impairment  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  whether  there  has  been  a
signiﬁ cant decrease in the market price of the property; whether there has
been a signiﬁ cant adverse change in the legal, regulatory, accessibility,
title,  environmental  or  political  factors  that  could  affect  the  property’s
value; whether there has been an accumulation of costs signiﬁ cantly in
excess of the amounts originally expected for the property’s acquisition,
development or cost of holding; whether exploration activities produced
results that are not promising such that no more work is being planned
in the foreseeable future and whether the company has signiﬁ cant funds
to be able to maintain its interest in the mineral property.
Where we do have proven and probable reserves, as is now the case
at our Pirquitas property, the expected undiscounted future cash ﬂ ows
from  an  asset  are  compared  to  its  carrying  value.  These  future  cash
ﬂ ows are developed into models using assumptions that reﬂ ect the long-
term operating plans for an asset given our best estimate of the most
probable  set  of  economic  conditions.  Commodity  prices  used  reﬂ ect
market conditions at the time the models are developed. These models
are updated from time to time, and lower prices are used should market
conditions  deteriorate.  Inherent  in  these  assumptions  are  signiﬁ cant
risks and uncertainties.
In 2006, two properties were written-off and a $101,000 expense was
recorded. Changes in market conditions, reserve estimates and other
assumptions used in these estimates may result in future writedowns.

consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements

December 31, 2006, has also issued a report on our ﬁ nancial
statements  and  internal  controls  under  the  standards  of  the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
for
Stock-based compensation
We provide compensation beneﬁ ts to its employees, directors, ofﬁ cers
and  consultants  through  a  share  option  plan.  The  fair  value  of  each
option  award  is  estimated  on  the  date  of  the  grant  using  the  Black-
Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical
2006 ANNUAL REPORT SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC.
(a development stage company)
volatility of the company’s stock. The company utilizes historical data to
estimate option exercises and termination behaviour with the valuation
model. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based
on the Government of Canada yield curve in effect at the time of the
grant. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates based
on these assumptions.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The amounts recorded for asset retirement costs are based on estimates
included in closure and remediation plans. These estimates are based
on  engineering  studies  of  the  work  that  is  required  by  environmental
laws or public statements by management which results in an obligation.
These estimates include an assumption on the rate at which costs may
inﬂ ate  in  future  periods.  Actual  costs  and  the  timing  of  expenditures
could differ from these estimates.
Income and Resource Taxes
The  determination  of  our  future  tax  liabilities  and  assets  involves
signiﬁ cant management estimation and judgment involving a number of
assumptions. In determining these amounts we interpret tax legislation
in a variety of jurisdictions and make estimates of the expected timing of
the reversal of future tax assets and liabilities. We also make estimates
of the future earnings which affect the extent to which potential future
tax  beneﬁ ts  may  be  used.  We  are  subject  to  assessment  by  various
taxation  authorities,  which  may  interpret  tax  legislation  in  a  manner
different from our view. These differences may affect the ﬁ nal amount
or the timing of the payment of taxes. When such differences arise we
make provision for such items based on our best estimate of the ﬁ nal
outcome of these matters.

Changes in Accounting Policies
Recent Canadian accounting pronouncements
Financial Instruments
Effective January 1, 2007, we have adopted CICA Handbook Section
3855  Financial  Instruments—Recognition  and  Measurement,  CICA
Handbook Section 3865 Hedges and CICA Handbook Section 1530
Comprehensive  Income  (the  “Financial  Instrument  Standards”).  As
we  have  not  previously  undertaken  hedging  activities,  adoption  of
Section 3865 will have no impact on us. Prior to January 1, 2007, the
principal accounting policies affecting our ﬁ nancial instruments related
to marketable securities that were valued at the lower of original cost
and quoted market value.
The  adoption  of  the  Financial  Instrument  Standards  will  result  in  our
classifying marketable securities and cash equivalents as available for sale
investments and all derivative and other ﬁ nancial instruments as held for
trading assets or liabilities measured at fair value. We have no derivative
ﬁnancial  instruments  or  other  ﬁnancial  instruments  held  for  trading  at
December 31, 2006. Transitional adjustments in respect of these available
for sale assets will be recorded to the opening investment balances and
accumulated other comprehensive income on January 1, 2007.
As  a  consequence  of  adopting  the  Financial  Instrument  Standards
on  January  1,  2007,  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  will
increase by approximately $29,800,000 with a corresponding increase
of approximately $29,800,000 in investments. As a result of the adoption
of  this  standard,  the  carrying  value  of  this  investment  is  increased  by
$29,800,000, with a corresponding increase, net of tax, to accumulated
comprehensive income. This represents the net gain on measuring the
fair value of available for sale investments, which has been not recognized
on a fair value basis prior to January 1, 2007.
Upon  adoption  of  the  ﬁ nancial  instrument  standards,  all  regular-way
purchases of ﬁ nancial assets are accounted for at the settlement date.
Transaction costs on ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities classiﬁ ed other than
as held for trading will be treated as part of the investment cost.
Gains or losses associated with items designated as held for trading
are  recorded  in  the  income  statement,  separate  from  any  interest  or
dividends  earned  on  these  investments.  Gains  or  losses  associated
with items classiﬁ ed as available for sale will be separately recorded as
unrealized within our other comprehensive income until such time the
investment is disposed of or incurs a decline in fair value that is on an
other-than-temporary basis, at which time any gains or losses will then
be realized and reclassiﬁ ed to the income statement. We have elected
to designate cash equivalents (consisting of mainly commercial paper
and banker’s acceptances) and marketable securities (all of which are
investments in common shares), as available for sale.
Financial Instruments and Other Instruments
Our ﬁ nancial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, silver
bullion,  marketable  securities,  accounts  receivable  and  accounts
payable.  It  is  management’s  opinion  that  we  are  not  exposed  to
signiﬁ cant  interest,  currency  or  credit  risks  arising  from  our  cash  and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable.
Marketable securities and silver bullion are, by their nature, subject to
market price and exchange rate ﬂ uctuations. We value our marketable
securities and silver bullion at the lower of cost and market. There were
unrealized gains of $29,800,000 relating to marketable securities and
$13,586,000 relating to silver bullion at December 31, 2006 compared
to unrealized gains of $10,102,000 relating to marketable securities and
$4,306,000 relating to silver bullion at December 31, 2005.
We  are  exposed  to  currency  risk  on  the  acquisition  and  exploration
expenditures  on  our  properties  since  we  have  to  settle  expenditures
either in local currency or U.S. dollars. Our expenditures are negatively
impacted by increases in value of either the U.S. dollar or local currencies
versus the Canadian dollar.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We  do  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  that  have  or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our ﬁ nancial
condition, changes in ﬁ nancial condition, revenues or expenses, results
of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to investors.
Outstanding Share Data
The authorized capital consists of unlimited common shares without par

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Pirquitas property is our only mineral property under development
and we may not be able to successfully establish mining operations.
The  Pirquitas  property  is  our  only  mineral  property  currently  under
development. The development of our Pirquitas property and the future
development of any other properties found to be economically feasible
and approved by the board will require the construction and operation
of mines, processing plants and related infrastructure. As a result, we
are and will be subject to all of the risks associated with establishing
new mining operations including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the timing and cost, which can be considerable, of the
construction of mining and processing facilities;
the availability and cost of skilled labor and mining equipment;
the availability and cost of appropriate smelting and reﬁ ning
arrangements;
the need to obtain necessary environmental and other
governmental approvals and permits and the timing of the receipt
of those approvals and permits;
the availability of funds to ﬁ nance construction and development
activities;
potential opposition from non-governmental organizations,
environmental groups or local groups which may delay or prevent
development activities; and
potential increases in construction and operating costs due to
changes in the cost of fuel, power materials and supplies.
The  costs,  timing  and  complexities  of  mine  construction  and
development  for  our  Pirquitas  property  and  our  other  projects  may
be  greater  than  we  anticipate  because  the  majority  of  our  property
interests are not located in developed areas and as a result may not
be served by appropriate road access, water and power supply, and
other support infrastructure, and cost estimates may increase as more
detailed engineering work is completed on a project. It is common in
new  mining  operations  to  experience  unexpected  costs,  problems
and  delays  during  construction,  development  and  mine  start-up.  In
addition,  delays  in  the  commencement  of  mineral  production  often
occur. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our activities will result in
proﬁ table mining operations at the Pirquitas property or any of our other
mineral properties.
We have no revenue from operations and no ongoing mining operations
of any kind.
We  are  a  mineral  exploration  and  development  company  and  have
no  revenue  from  operations  and  no  ongoing  mining  operations  of
any  kind.  Our  properties  are  in  the  exploration  stage,  and  we  have
not  deﬁ ned  or  delineated  any  proven  or  probable  reserves  on  any  of
our  properties,  other  than  the  Pirquitas  property.  Mineral  exploration
involves signiﬁ cant risk because few properties that are explored contain
bodies  of  ore  that  would  be  commercially  economic  to  develop  into
producing mines. If our current exploration programs do not result in the
discovery of commercial ore, we may need to write-off part or all of our
investment in our existing properties and we will be required to acquire
additional properties.

environmental protection.
We may not have sufﬁ cient funds to develop our mineral properties or
to complete further exploration programs.
We  have  limited  ﬁnancial  resources  (cash  and  cash  equivalents  of
$229,616,000, silver bullion of $15,787,000 and marketable securities
of $5,817,000 as of December 31, 2006), do not generate operating
revenue, and must ﬁ nance our exploration activity and the development
of  our  mineral  properties  by  other  means.  We  intend  to  fund  our
immediate  plan  of  operations  and  the  development  of  our  Pirquitas
property from our working capital. In the future, our ability to continue
our exploration and development activities, if any, will depend on our
ability to develop the Pirquitas property and generate operating revenue
or obtain additional external ﬁ nancing.
The sources of external ﬁ nancing that we may use for these purposes
include  public  or  private  offerings  of  equity  and  debt.  In  addition,  we
may  enter  into  one  or  more  strategic  alliances  or  joint  ventures,  or
may  decide  to  sell  certain  property  interests,  and  may  utilize  one  or
a  combination  of  all  of  these  alternatives.  The  ﬁnancing  alternative
chosen by us may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at
all. If additional ﬁ nancing is not available, we may have to postpone the
development of, or sell, properties.
We  have  a  history  of  losses  and  expect  to  incur  losses  for  the
foreseeable future.
We recorded a proﬁ t of $16,382,000 for the year ended December 31,
2006, but have incurred losses during each of the following periods:
•
•
$5,870,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005; and
$1,518,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004.
We  expect  to  continue  to  incur  losses  unless  and  until  such  time  as
the Pirquitas property enters into commercial production and generates
sufﬁ cient revenues to fund continuing operations. The development of
the  Pirquitas  property  and  any  other  mineral  property  will  require  the
commitment of substantial ﬁ nancial resources.
The  amount  and  timing  of  expenditures  will  depend  on  a  number  of
factors, including the progress of ongoing exploration and development,
the results of consultants’ analyses and recommendations, the rate at
which operating losses are incurred, the execution of any joint venture
agreements  with  strategic  partners,  and  our  acquisition  of  additional
property interests, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot
assure you that we will ever achieve proﬁ tability.
There  are  differences  in  U.S.  and  Canadian  practices  for  reporting
mineral resources.
The determination of whether any mineral deposits on our properties
are  economic  is  affected  by  numerous  factors  beyond  our  control.
These factors include:
Our resource estimates are not directly comparable to those made in
ﬁ lings  subject  to  SEC  reporting  and  disclosure  requirements,  as  we
generally  report  resources  in  accordance  with  Canadian  practices.
39
2006 ANNUAL REPORT SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC.
(a development stage company)
These practices are different from the practices used to report resource
estimates  in  reports  and  other  materials  ﬁ led  with  the  SEC  in  that
the  Canadian  practice  is  to  report  measured,  indicated  and  inferred
resources. In the United States, mineralization may not be classiﬁ ed as a
‘‘reserve’’ unless the determination has been made that the mineralization
could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the
reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned
not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources
will ever be converted into reserves. Further, ‘‘inferred resources’’ have
a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether
they  can  be  mined  legally  or  economically.  Disclosure  of  ‘‘contained
ounces’’ is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however,
the SEC only permits issuers to report ‘‘resources’’ as in place tonnage
and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information
concerning  descriptions  of  mineralization  and  resources  contained  in
this prospectus, or in the documents incorporated herein by reference,
may not be comparable to information made public by United States
companies  subject  to  the  reporting  and  disclosure  requirements
of the SEC.
Our  reserve  and  resource  estimates  are  based  on  interpretation  and
assumptions  and  may  yield  less  mineral  production  under  actual
conditions than is currently estimated.
In making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects
to development, we must rely upon estimated calculations as to the
mineral reserves and grades of mineralization on our properties. Until
ore  is  actually  mined  and  processed,  mineral  reserves  and  grades
of  mineralization  must  be  considered  as  estimates  only.  These
estimates are imprecise and depend upon geological interpretation
and  statistical  inferences  drawn  from  drilling  and  sampling  which
may prove to be unreliable. We cannot assure you that:
40
•
•
reserve, resource or other mineralization estimates will be
accurate; or
mineralization can be mined or processed proﬁ tably.
Any  material  changes  in  mineral  reserve  estimates  and  grades  of
mineralization will affect the economic viability of placing a property
into  production  and  a  property’s  return  on  capital.  Our  reserve
and  resource  estimates  have  been  determined  and  valued  based
on assumed future prices, cut-off grades and operating costs that
may prove to be inaccurate. Extended declines in market prices for
silver,  gold,  tin  and  zinc  may  render  portions  of  our  mineralization
uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineral reserves.
Any  material  reductions  in  estimates  of  mineralization,  or  of  our
ability  to  extract  this  mineralization,  could  have  a  material  adverse
effect on our results of operations or ﬁ nancial condition. We cannot
assure you that mineral recovery rates achieved in small scale tests
will be duplicated in large scale tests under on-site conditions or in
production scale.
Mining is inherently dangerous and subject to conditions or events
beyond our control.
The  development  and  operation  of  a  mine  or  mine  property  is
inherently dangerous and involves many risks that even a combination
of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to
overcome. These risks include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
unusual or unexpected geological formations;
metallurgical and other processing problems;
metal losses;
environmental hazards;
power outages;
labor disruptions;
industrial accidents;
periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather
conditions;
ﬂ ooding, explosions, ﬁ re, rockbursts, cave-ins and landslides;
and
the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment
or labor.
These  risks  could  result  in  damage  to,  or  destruction  of,  mineral
properties,  production  facilities  or  other  properties,  personal  injury,
environmental damage, delays in mining, increased production costs,
monetary losses and possible legal liability. We may not be able to obtain
insurance  to  cover  these  risks  at  economically  feasible  premiums,  or
at all. Insurance against certain environmental risks, including potential
liability  for  pollution  and  other  hazards  as  a  result  of  the  disposal  of
waste products occurring from production, is not generally available to
companies within the mining industry. We may suffer a material adverse
effect on our business if we incur losses related to any signiﬁ cant events
that are not covered by our insurance policies.
Changes in the market price of silver and other metals, which in the past
have ﬂ uctuated widely, will affect our operations.
Our  proﬁ tability  and  long-term  viability  will  depend,  in  large  part,  on
the market price of silver, gold, tin, zinc, lead and copper. The market
prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors
beyond our control, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
global or regional consumption patterns;
he supply of, and demand for, these metals;
speculative activities;
the availability and costs of metal substitutes;
expectations for inﬂ ation; and
political and economic conditions, including interest rates and
currency values.
We cannot predict the effect of these factors on metal prices. A decrease
in the market price of silver and other metals would affect the proﬁ tability
of  the  Pirquitas  property  and  could  affect  our  ability  to  ﬁ nance  the
exploration  and  development  of  any  of  our  other  mineral  properties.
The market price of silver and other metals may not remain at current
levels. In particular, an increase in worldwide supply, and consequent
downward  pressure  on  prices,  may  result  over  the  longer  term  from
increased  silver  production  from  mines  developed  or  expanded  as  a
result of current metal price levels.
We are subject to signiﬁ cant governmental regulations.
Our  exploration  activities  are,  and  the  development  of  the  Pirquitas
property is, subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, territorial and

•
•
the management of natural resources;
the exploration of mineral properties;

Failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  may  result  in
civil  or  criminal  ﬁ nes  or  penalties  or  enforcement  actions,  including
orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining or curtailing
operations  or  requiring  corrective  measures,  installation  of  additional
equipment  or  remedial  actions,  or  the  imposition  of  additional  local
or  foreign  parties  as  joint  venture  partners,  any  of  which  could  result
in  signiﬁ cant  expenditures.  We  may  also  be  required  to  compensate
private  parties  suffering  loss  or  damage  by  reason  of  a  breach  of
such  laws,  regulations  or  permitting  requirements.  It  is  also  possible
that  future  laws  and  regulations,  or  more  stringent  enforcement  of
current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause
additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions
of our activities and delays in the exploration and development of our
properties.
We  require  further  permits  in  order  to  conduct  our  current  and
anticipated  future  operations,  and  delays  or  a  failure  to  obtain  such
permits, or a failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that
we have obtained, would adversely affect our business.
Our  current  and  anticipated  future  operations,  including  further
exploration, development activities and commencement of production
on  our  mineral  properties,  require  permits  from  various  governmental
authorities.
We cannot assure you that all permits that we require for our operations,
including any construction of mining facilities or conduct of mining, will
be  obtainable  or  renewable  on  reasonable  terms,  or  at  all.  Delays  or
a  failure  to  obtain  such  required  permits,  or  the  expiry,  revocation  or
failure by us to comply with the terms of any such permits that we have
obtained, would adversely affect our business.
Our  activities  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations  that
may increase our costs and restrict our operations.
All  of  our  exploration  and  potential  development  and  production
activities in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru and the
United States are subject to regulation by governmental agencies under
various environmental laws. To the extent that we conduct exploration
activities  or  undertake  new  mining  activities  in  other  countries,  we
will  also  be  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations  in  those
jurisdictions. These laws address emissions into the air, discharges into
water, management of waste, management of hazardous substances,
protection of natural resources, antiquities and endangered species and
reclamation  of  lands  disturbed  by  mining  operations.  Environmental
legislation in many countries is evolving and the trend has been towards
stricter  standards  and  enforcement,  increased  ﬁnes  and  penalties
for  non-compliance,  more  stringent  environmental  assessments  of
proposed projects and increasing responsibility for companies and their
ofﬁ cers, directors and employees. Compliance with environmental laws
and regulations may require signiﬁ cant capital outlays on our behalf and
SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC. 2006 ANNUAL REPORT
(a development stage company)
may cause material changes or delays in our intended activities. Future
changes in these laws or regulations could have a signiﬁ cant adverse
impact  on  some  portion  of  our  business,  causing  us  to  re-evaluate
those activities at that time.
Land reclamation requirements for our exploration properties may be
burdensome.
Although variable depending on location and the governing authority,
land  reclamation  requirements  are  generally  imposed  on  mineral
exploration companies (as well as companies with mining operations)
in order to minimize long term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation
may include requirements to:
•
•
control dispersion of potentially deleterious efﬂ uents; and
reasonably re-establish pre-disturbance land forms and
vegetation.
In order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection
with  our  exploration  and  potential  development  activities,  we  must
allocate  ﬁ nancial  resources  that  might  otherwise  be  spent  on  further
exploration  and  development  programs.  Certain  of  our  projects  have
been subject to historic mining operations and certain of the properties
that were historically mined by us are subject to remediation obligations.
We have set up a provision for our reclamation bonds but this provision
may  not  be  adequate.  If  we  are  required  to  carry  out  unanticipated
reclamation work, our ﬁ nancial position could be adversely affected.
Our properties may be subject to uncertain title.
We own, lease or have under option, unpatented and patented mining
claims,  mineral  claims  or  concessions  which  constitute  our  property
holdings.  The  ownership  and  validity,  or  title,  of  unpatented  mining
claims and concessions are often uncertain and may be contested. We
also may not have, or may not be able to obtain, all necessary surface
rights to develop a property. We have not conducted surveys of all of
the  claims  in  which  we  hold  direct  or  indirect  interests.  A  successful
claim contesting our title to a property will cause us to lose our rights
to  explore  and,  if  warranted,  develop  that  property.  This  could  result
in  our  not  being  compensated  for  our  prior  expenditures  relating  to
the property.
Political or economic instability or unexpected regulatory change in the
countries where our properties are located could adversely affect our
business.
Certain  of  our  properties  are  located  in  countries,  provinces  and
states more likely to be subject to political and economic instability, or
unexpected legislative change, than is usually the case in certain other
countries,  provinces  and  states.  Our  mineral  exploration  or  potential
development activities could be adversely affected by:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
political instability and violence;
war and civil disturbance;
labor unrest;
expropriation or nationalization;
changing ﬁ scal regimes and uncertain regulatory environments;
ﬂ uctuations in currency exchange rates;
high rates of inﬂ ation;
changes to royalty and tax regimes;
41
2006 ANNUAL REPORT SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC.
(a development stage company)
•
•
underdeveloped industrial and economic infrastructure; and
the unenforceability of contractual rights and judgments.
There can be no assurance that we will successfully acquire additional
commercially mineable mineral rights.
Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially
mineable ore deposits and no assurance can be given that any anticipated
level of recovery of ore reserves will be realized or that any identiﬁ ed
mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable)
ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. Estimates of
reserves, resources, mineral deposits and production costs can also be
affected  by  such  factors  as  environmental  permitting  regulations  and
requirements,  weather,  environmental  factors,  unforeseen  technical
difﬁculties,  unusual  or  unexpected  geological  formations  and  work
interruptions.
Material changes in ore reserves, grades, stripping ratios or recovery
rates may affect the economic viability of any project. Our future growth
and productivity will depend, in part, on our ability to identify and acquire
additional commercially mineable mineral rights, and on the costs and
results of continued exploration and potential development programs.
Mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and is frequently non-
productive. Substantial expenditures are required to:
•
•
•
establish ore reserves through drilling and metallurgical and other
testing techniques;
determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to
extract metal from the ore; and
construct, renovate or expand mining and processing facilities.
In  addition,  if  we  discover  ore,  it  would  take  several  years  from  the
initial  phases  of  exploration  until  production  is  possible.  During  this
time, the economic feasibility of production may change. As a result of
these uncertainties, there can be no assurance that we will successfully
acquire additional commercially mineable (or viable) mineral rights.
We  may  be  adversely  affected  by  ﬂ uctuations  in  foreign  exchange
rates.
We maintain our bank accounts primarily in Canadian and U.S. dollars.
We expect that our revenue, if any, will be in U.S. dollars while certain of
our costs are incurred in other currencies. In particular, any appreciation
in the currencies of Argentina, Australia, Chile, Mexico or other countries
where  we  carry  out  exploration  or  development  activities  against  the
Canadian or U.S. dollar will increase our costs of carrying on operations
in  such  countries.  With  the  development  of  our  Pirquitas  property,
our  costs  denominated  in  the  currency  of  Argentina  have  increased
signiﬁ cantly over past levels and we have signiﬁ cantly greater exposure
to Argentinean currency ﬂ uctuations. In addition, any decrease in the
U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar will result in a loss on our books
to the extent we hold funds in U.S. dollars.
We face industry competition in the acquisition of exploration properties
and the recruitment and retention of qualiﬁ ed personnel.
We  compete  with  other  exploration  companies,  many  of  which
have greater ﬁ nancial resources than us or are further advanced in
their development, for the acquisition of mineral claims, leases and
other mineral interests as well as for the recruitment and retention of
qualiﬁ ed employees and other personnel. Competition for exploration
resources at all levels is currently very intense, particularly affecting
the  availability  of  manpower,  drill  rigs  and  supplies.  In  particular,
we  face  competition  for  qualiﬁed  personnel  and  equipment  for
our  Pirquitas  property,  which  may  increase  our  estimated  costs  of
developing the project or result in delays. We expect that a signiﬁ cant
number of expatriate employees will be required in the early stages of
the development of the Pirquitas property to hire and train the local
workforce. If we require and are unsuccessful in acquiring additional
mineral properties or qualiﬁ ed personnel, we will not be able to grow
at the rate we desire or at all.
Some of our directors and ofﬁ cers have conﬂ icts of interest as a result
of their involvement with other natural resource companies.
Some  of  our  directors  and  ofﬁ cers  are  directors  or  ofﬁ cers  of  other
natural resource or mining-related companies such as, at present, our
President, Robert Quartermain, who serves as a director and ofﬁ cer
of  Radiant  Resources  Inc.  and  as  a  director  of  Canplats  Resources
Corporation,  Vista  Gold  Corporation,  and  Minco  Silver  Corporation
(with  which  we  have  a  strategic  alliance  to  jointly  pursue  silver
opportunities in China). In addition, our Senior Vice President, Joseph
J. Ovsenek, is a director of Esperanza Silver Corporation (with which
we have an agreement for the exploration of silver projects in Peru).
These  associations  may  give  rise  to  conﬂ icts  of  interest  from  time
to  time.  As  a  result  of  these  conﬂ icts  of  interest,  we  may  miss  the
opportunity to participate in certain transactions, which may have a
material adverse effect on our ﬁ nancial position.
We  may  experience  difﬁculty  attracting  and  retaining  qualiﬁed
management  to  grow  our  business,  which  could  have  a  material
adverse effect on our business and ﬁ nancial condition.
We  are  dependent  on  the  services  of  key  executives,  including  Mr.
Quartermain, and other highly skilled and experienced executives and
personnel focused on advancing our corporate objectives as well as
the identiﬁ cation of new opportunities for growth and funding. Due to
our relatively small size, the loss of these persons or our inability to
attract and retain additional highly skilled employees required for the
development of the Pirquitas property and our other activities may have
a material adverse effect on our business and ﬁ nancial condition.
Enforcement  of  judgments  or  bringing  actions  outside  the  United
States against us and our directors and ofﬁ cers may be difﬁ cult.
We  are  organized  under  the  law  of,  and  headquartered  in,  British
Columbia, Canada, and none of our directors and ofﬁ cers are citizens
or residents of the United States, other than our Vice President, Project
Development. In addition, a substantial part of our assets are located
outside the United States and Canada. As a result, it may be difﬁ cult
or impossible for an investor to (i) enforce in courts outside the United
States judgments against us and our directors and ofﬁ cers obtained in
United States courts based upon the civil liability provisions of United
States federal securities laws or (ii) bring in courts outside the United
States an original action against us and our directors and ofﬁ cers to
enforce liabilities based upon such United States securities laws.
Under U.S. federal tax rules, we may be classiﬁ ed as a passive foreign
investment company (a PFIC), which may result in special and generally
unfavorable U.S. federal tax consequences to our U.S. shareholders.

resource  companies;  and  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualiﬁed
personnel and management.
This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of our forward-
looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements about
the  future  and  are  inherently  uncertain,  and  our  actual  achievements
or  other  future  events  or  conditions  may  differ  materially  from  those
reﬂ ected  in  the  forward-looking  statements  due  to  a  variety  of  risks,
uncertainties  and  other  factors,  including,  without  limitation,  those
referred to in this MD&A under the heading ‘‘Risks and Uncertainties”.
Our forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, expectations
and opinions of management on the date the statements are made, and
we do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements
if  circumstances  or  management’s  beliefs,  expectations  or  opinions
should change. For the reasons set forth above, you should not place
undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

As  a  non-U.S.  corporation,  we  may  be  a  PFIC  depending  on  the
percentage of our gross income which is “passive”, within the meaning
of  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended,  or  the
percentage of our assets that produce or are held to produce passive
income. We were a PFIC in our 2006 taxable year, and we may be a
PFIC in subsequent taxable years. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year
during a U.S. shareholder’s holding period in our common stock, such
U.S. shareholder may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax
liability on the sale of common shares or on the receipt of dividends.
The PFIC rules are complex and may be unfamiliar to U.S. shareholders.
Accordingly,  U.S.  shareholders  are  urged  to  consult  their  own  tax
advisors concerning the application of the PFIC rules to their investment
in our common shares.
CAUTION ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The MD&A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and
Canadian securities laws concerning the anticipated developments in
our operations in future periods, our planned exploration activities, the
adequacy of our ﬁ nancial resources and other events or conditions that
may occur in the future. These statements relate to analyses and other
information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of
amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.
Statements  concerning  mineral  reserve  and  resource  estimates  may
also be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements to the extent
that they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered
if  the  property  is  developed.  Any  statements  that  express  or  involve
discussions  with  respect  to  predictions,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,
projections,  objectives,  assumptions  or  future  events  or  performance
(often,  but  not  always,  using  words  or  phrases  such  as  ‘‘expects’’,
‘‘anticipates’’,  ‘‘plans’’,  ‘‘projects’’,  ‘‘estimates’’,  ‘‘assumes’’,  ‘‘intends’’,
‘‘strategy’’,  ‘‘goals’’,  ‘‘objectives’’,  ‘‘potential’’  or  variations  thereof,  or
stating that certain actions, events or results ‘‘may’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘would’’,
‘‘might’’  or  ‘‘will’’  be  taken,  occur  or  be  achieved,  or  the  negative  of
any  of  these  terms  and  similar  expressions)  are  not  statements  of
historical  fact  and  may  be  ‘‘forward-looking  statements’’.  Forward-
looking  statements  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  known  and  unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or
results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements, including, without limitation: uncertainty of production at our
mineral exploration properties; risks and uncertainties associated with
new mining operations; risks related to our ability to obtain adequate
ﬁnancing  for  our  planned  development  activities  and  to  complete
further exploration programs; our history of losses and expectation of
future losses; differences in U.S. and Canadian practices for reporting
resources;  risks  and  uncertainties  relating  to  the  interpretation  of  drill
results and the geology, grade and continuity of our mineral deposits;
unpredictable risks and hazards related to the development and operation
of a mine or mine property; commodity price ﬂ uctuations; risks related
to governmental regulations, including environmental regulations; risks
related to delay or failure to obtain required permits, or non-compliance;
increased  costs  and  restrictions  on  operations  due  to  compliance
with  environmental  laws  and  regulations;  risks  related  to  reclamation
activities on our properties; uncertainties related to title to our mineral
properties; risks related to political instability and unexpected regulatory
change;  our  ability  to  successfully  acquire  additional  commercially
mineable mineral rights; currency ﬂ uctuations; increased competition in
the mining industry for properties and qualiﬁ ed personnel; risks related
to some of our directors’ and ofﬁ cers’ involvement with other natural

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The preparation and presentation of the accompanying consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and all
ﬁ nancial information in the Annual Report are the responsibility of management and have been approved by the Board of Directors.
The  consolidated  ﬁ nancial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Financial
statements, by nature, are not precise since they include certain amounts based upon estimates and judgments. When alternative methods exist,
management has chosen those it deems to be the most appropriate in the circumstances. The ﬁ nancial information presented elsewhere in the
Annual Report is consistent with that in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Management, under the supervision of and the participation of the President and Vice President, Finance, have a process in place to evaluate
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting as required by Canadian and U.S. securities regulations. We, as
President and Vice President Finance, will certify our annual ﬁ lings with the CSA and SEC as required in Canada by Multilateral Instrument 52-109
and in the United States as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulﬁ lls its responsibilities for ﬁ nancial reporting and is ultimately responsible for
reviewing and approving the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. The Board carries out this responsibility principally through its Audit Committee which
is independent from management.
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors and reviews the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and MD&A; considers the report of
the external auditors; assesses our adequacy of the internal controls, including management’s assessment described below; examines the fees and
expenses for audit services; and recommends to the Board the independent auditors for appointment by the shareholders. The independent auditors
have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with it to discuss their audit work, our internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting and ﬁ nancial
reporting matters. The Audit Committee reports its ﬁ ndings to the Board for consideration when approving the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements for
issuance to the shareholders and management’s assessment of the internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
44
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting as of December 31, 2006 using criteria established
in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this
evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our auditors, has audited management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting
as of December 31, 2006 as stated in their report which appears herein.

Independent Auditors’ Report
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC.
We have completed an integrated audit of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting of Silver Standard Resources
Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and audits of the Company’s December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. Our opinions,
based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Silver Standard Resources Inc. as at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
and the related consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and deﬁ cit and cash ﬂ ows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006.
These ﬁ nancial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁ nancial statements
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of the Company’s ﬁ nancial statements as at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and for the three years in the period ended December
31, 2006 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁ nancial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of ﬁ nancial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁ nancial statements. A ﬁ nancial statement audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and signiﬁ cant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall ﬁ nancial statement presentation.
In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁ nancial position of the Company as
at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash ﬂ ows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting
We have also audited management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting based on our audit.
45
We conducted our audit of internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
ﬁ nancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over ﬁ nancial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁ nancial reporting
and the preparation of ﬁ nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over ﬁ nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reﬂ ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to  permit  preparation  of  ﬁ nancial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
ﬁ nancial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting as at December 31, 2006 is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Furthermore, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated)
1. Nature Of  Operations
We are in the business of acquiring, exploring, holding and developing
silver mineral properties, with a portfolio of core properties in Argentina,
Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru and the United States. We plan to
ultimately develop the properties to bring them to production, structure
joint ventures with others, option or lease properties to third parties, or
sell  the  properties  outright.  In  October  2006,  we  made  a  production
decision  for  the  Pirquitas  property  that  is  located  in  the  province  of
Jujuy in northwest Argentina. The mine is estimated to require 21 to 24
months to construct at an estimated cost of US $146 million.
Management  has  estimated  that  we  will  have  adequate  funds
from  existing  working  capital  to  meet  our  corporate,  development,
administrative and property obligations for the coming year, including the
construction of the Pirquitas property. We will periodically need to obtain
additional ﬁ nancing, and while we have been successful in the past, there
can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.
The  recoverability  of  the  amounts  shown  for  mineral  properties  and
related deferred costs is dependent upon the existence of economically
recoverable  reserves,  our  ability  to  obtain  necessary  ﬁnancing  to
complete the development, and upon future proﬁ table production. The
amounts shown as deferred expenditures and property acquisition costs
represent net costs to date, less amounts amortized and/or written-off,
and do not necessarily represent present or future values.
Although  we  have  taken  steps  to  verify  title  to  mineral  properties  in
which we have an interest, in accordance with industry standards for
the current stage of exploration of such properties, these procedures do
not guarantee our title. Property title may be subject to unregistered prior
agreements or transfers and may be affected by undetected defects.
2. Significant Accounting Policies
GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
These  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements  have  been  prepared  in
accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
(Canadian GAAP). The signiﬁ cant differences between these principles
and  those  that  would  be  applied  under  US  generally  accepted
accounting principles and requirements promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (collectively US GAAP), as they affect the
company, are disclosed in note 20.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the most signiﬁ cant of which are

We have entered into a number of joint venture agreements, the most signiﬁ cant of which relate to the Maverick Springs and San Luis properties. We
have a 55% interest in each of these two joint ventures. We recognize our proportionate share of exploration costs of each joint venture.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and related notes. Signiﬁ cant areas where management’s
judgment is applied are asset impairment, stock-based compensation, future income tax valuation reserves, ore reserve determinations and asset
retirement obligations. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. Significant Accounting Policies, continued
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain  reclassiﬁ cations  of  prior  year  balances  have  been  made  to
conform to the current year presentation. These reclassiﬁ cations have
had no impact on previously reported total current assets, total assets,
working  capital  position  or  results  of  operations,  and  does  not  affect
previously reported cash ﬂ ows from operating or ﬁ nancing activities.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Our functional currency is considered to be the Canadian dollar.
Our subsidiaries are integrated foreign operations which are translated
into Canadian dollars using the temporal method. Monetary items are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date; non
monetary  items  are  translated  at  historical  exchange  rates.  Income
and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the
period.  Translation  gains  and  losses  are  reﬂ ected  in  the  consolidated
statements  of  earnings  (loss)  unless  they  relate  to  a  speciﬁ c  mineral
property in which case they are capitalized.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank balances and short-term
investments  with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  and  are
stated at cost, which approximates market value.
SILVER BULLION
Silver  bullion  is  valued  at  the  lower  of  original  cost  or  net  realizable
value.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Marketable securities are carried at the lower of original cost and quoted
market value.
MINERAL  PROPERTY  COSTS  AND  PROPERTY,  PLANT  AND
EQUIPMENT
Mineral property costs
We  record  our  interests  in  mineral  properties  at  cost.  Costs  include
the  costs  of  acquiring  mineral  properties  and  related  exploration  and
development  expenditures,  interest  expense  allocable  to  the  cost  of
developing  mining  properties  and  to  construct  new  facilities,  holding
costs  to  maintain  a  property  and  related  foreign  exchange  amounts
are deferred. These costs are amortized using the units-of-production
method  against 
following  commencement  of
commercial  production  or  are  written-off  if  the  properties  are  sold,
allowed to lapse or abandoned. General exploration is expensed in the
period incurred.
future  production
Option  payments  received  are  treated  as  a  reduction  of  the  carrying
value  of  the  related  mineral  property  and  deferred  costs  until  the
payments are in excess of costs incurred, at which time they are then
credited  to  income.  Options  payments  are  at  the  discretion  of  the
optionee, and accordingly, are accounted for on a cash basis or when
receipt is reasonably assured.
Our  management  regularly  reviews  the  recoverability  of  the  carrying
value  of  each  mineral  property.  Where  information  and  conditions
suggest impairment, estimated future cash ﬂ ows are calculated using
estimated  future  prices,  proven  and  probable  reserves,  weighted
probable outcomes and operating capital and reclamation costs on an
undiscounted  basis.  If  it  is  determined  that  the  future  cash  ﬂ ows  are
less than the carrying value, a write-down to the estimated fair value
is expensed for the period. Where estimates of future net cash ﬂ ows
are  not  available  and  where  other  conditions  suggest  impairment,
management  assesses  if  carrying  values  can  be  recovered.  If  the
carrying values exceed estimated recoverable values, then the costs are
written-down to fair values with the write-down expensed in the year.
Management’s estimates of future mineral prices, recoverable resources,
initial and operating capital and reclamation costs are subject to certain
risks  and  uncertainties  that  may  affect  the  recoverability  of  mineral
property  costs.  Although  management  has  made  its  best  estimate
of  these  factors,  it  is  possible  that  changes  could  occur  that  could
adversely  affect  management’s  estimate  of  the  net  cash  ﬂ ows  to  be
generated from its properties.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated
depreciation  and  include  plant  and  equipment  related  to  mineral
properties  and  property  and  equipment  related  to  corporate  ofﬁ ces.
Depreciation is calculated over the useful life of the asset at rates ranging
from 10% to 30% per annum once the asset is put in service. Leasehold
improvements  are  amortized  over  the  shorter  of  their  economic  lives
and the lease term plus lease renewals, if any, only when such renewals
are reasonably assured. Depreciation charges on assets that are directly
related  to  mineral  properties  are  allocated  to  that  mineral  property.
We  assess  if  an  impairment  loss  exists  when  events  or  changes  in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount
of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash ﬂ ows
expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The amount of
the loss is measured as the amount by which long-lived asset’s carrying
value exceeds its fair value.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
We  recognize  a  liability  for  our  legal  obligations  associated  with  the
retirement of property, plant and equipment when the liability is incurred.
A liability is recognized initially at fair value and the resulting amount is
capitalized  as  part  of  the  asset’s  carrying  value  unless  the  asset  has
been  previously  written-off,  in  which  case  the  amount  is  expensed.
The liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings
where the assets have previously been written-off or to mineral property
costs where the assets are in the pre-production stage. In subsequent
periods, we adjust the carrying amounts of the asset and the liability
for changes in estimates of the amount or timing of underlying future
cash ﬂ ows. The fair value of the legal obligation for asset retirement is
assessed each reporting period.
It is reasonably possible that our estimates of our ultimate reclamation
and  site  restoration  liability  could  change  as  a  result  of  changes  in
regulations or cost estimates. The effect of changes in estimated costs
is recognized on a prospective basis.

SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES INC. 2006 ANNUAL REPORT
(a development stage company)
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Compensation  expense  for  stock  options  granted  to  employees  or
non-employees  is  measured  at  the  fair  value  at  the  grant  date  using
the Black-Scholes valuation model and is recognized over the vesting
period  of  the  options  granted.  In  situations  where  stock  options  are
granted in exchange for services related to speciﬁ c mineral properties,
the  expense  is  capitalized  against  that  mineral  property.  The  value
assigned to stock options shown on the balance sheet is subsequently
reduced if the options are exercised and the amount so reduced is then
credited  to  share  capital.  Any  values  assigned  to  stock  options  that
have expired are credited to contributed surplus.
RECENT CANADIAN ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Financial Instruments
Effective January 1, 2007, we have adopted CICA Handbook Section
3855  Financial  Instruments—Recognition  and  Measurement,  CICA
Handbook Section 3865 Hedges and CICA Handbook Section 1530
Comprehensive  Income  (the  “Financial  Instrument  Standards”).  As
we  have  not  previously  undertaken  hedging  activities,  adoption  of
Section 3865 will have no impact on us. Prior to January 1, 2007, the
principal accounting policies affecting our ﬁ nancial instruments related
to marketable securities that were valued at the lower of original cost
and quoted market value.
INCOME TAXES
The liability method of income tax allocation is used and is based on
differences  between  ﬁ nancial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and
liabilities. Temporary differences arising from the difference between the
tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the balance
sheet  are  used  to  calculate  future  income  tax  liabilities  or  assets.
Future income tax liabilities or assets are calculated using the tax rates
anticipated to apply in the periods that the temporary differences are
expected to reverse. Future tax assets are recognized to the extent that
they are considered more likely than not to be realized.
EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE
Earnings (loss) per share is calculated based on the weighted average
number  of  common  shares  issued  and  outstanding  during  the  year.
We  follow  the  treasury  stock  method  in  the  calculation  of  diluted
earnings per share. Under this method, the weighted average number
of shares includes the potential net issuances of common shares for
“in-the-money” options and warrants assuming the proceeds are used
to repurchase common shares at the average market price during the
period,  if  dilutive.  The  effect  of  potential  issuances  of  shares  under
options  and  warrants  would  be  anti-dilutive  if  a  loss  is  reported,  and
therefore basic and diluted losses per share are the same.
3. Changes in Accounting Policies
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Effective January 1, 2004, the company adopted the Canadian Institute
of  Chartered  Accountants  (CICA)  amendments  to  Section  3870,
“Stock-Based  Compensation  and  Other  Stock-Based  Payments”,
which requires an expense to be recognized in the ﬁ nancial statements
for all forms of employee stock-based compensation, including stock
options, as well as for other stock-based payments made in exchange
for goods and services. The adoption of the fair value method resulted
in a cumulative increase of $4,504,000 to the opening deﬁ cit at January
1, 2004 and increases of $335,000 to share capital and $4,169,000 to
value assigned to stock options, at January 1, 2004.
The adoption of the Financial Instrument Standards will result in our
classifying marketable securities and cash equivalents as available for
sale investments and all derivative and other ﬁ nancial instruments as
held for trading assets or liabilities measured at fair value. We have
no derivative ﬁ nancial instruments or other ﬁ nancial instruments held
for trading at December 31, 2006. Transitional adjustments in respect
of  these  available  for  sale  assets  will  be  recorded  to  the  opening
investment balances and accumulated other comprehensive income
on January 1, 2007.
As  a  consequence  of  adopting  the  Financial  Instrument  Standards
on  January  1,  2007,  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income
will  increase  by  approximately  $29,800,000  with  a  corresponding
increase of approximately $29,800,000 in investments. As a result of
the adoption of this standard, the carrying value of this investment is
increased by $29,800,000, with a corresponding increase, net of tax,
to accumulated comprehensive income. This represents the net gain
on measuring the fair value of available for sale investments, which has
been not recognized on a fair value basis prior to January 1, 2007.
Upon adoption of the ﬁ nancial instrument standards, all regular-way
purchases of ﬁ nancial assets are accounted for at the settlement date.
Transaction  costs  on  ﬁ nancial  assets  and  liabilities  classiﬁ ed  other
than as held for trading will be treated as part of the investment cost.
Gains or losses associated with items designated as held for trading
are recorded in the income statement, separate from any interest or
dividends earned on these investments. Gains or losses associated
with items classiﬁ ed as available for sale will be separately recorded
as unrealized within our other comprehensive income until such time
the investment is disposed of or incurs a decline in fair value that is
on an other-than-temporary basis, at which time any gains or losses
will  then  be  realized  and  reclassiﬁ ed  to  the  income  statement.  We
have  elected  to  designate  cash  equivalents  (consisting  of  mainly
commercial  paper  and  banker’s  acceptances)  and  marketable
securities  (all  of  which  are  investments  in  common  shares),  as
available for sale.

5. Sale of  Joint Venture Interest and
Marketable Securities
On April 10, 2006, the agreement for the sale of our 50% interest in the
Manantial Espejo property to our joint venture partner, Pan American
Silver Corp., closed for a gain on sale of $35,390,000. The fair value
of the 1,950,000 common shares of Pan American received at closing
was $55,056,000. During the fourth quarter of 2006, all our shares in
Pan American were sold for net proceeds of $51,995,000. A loss on
sale of marketable securities of $3,101,000 has been recorded to give
us a net gain of $32,289,000 from the sale of this interest. This loss on
sale of marketable securities was offset by gains of $434,000 on the
sale of other marketable securities in 2006.

At  December  31,  2005,  we  had  lodged  a  US$1,679,000  bank  letter
of  credit  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior,  Bureau  of  Land
Management relating to reclamation obligations on the Candelaria silver
mine  in  Nevada  (note  9(o)).  Under  the  terms  and  conditions  with  our
banker,  we  have  the  right  to  lodge  collateral  in  Canadian  dollars,  US
dollars or silver bullion. We had lodged silver bullion as collateral such
that it had a coverage ratio value of 110% (US$1,847,000) of the letter
of credit amount. As at December 31, 2005, 209,454 (2004—284,650)
ounces of silver bullion were lodged as collateral. In 2006, the reclamation
obligation was reduced to US $1,637,000 and we lodged this amount
in U.S. dollars, thereby releasing our bullion collateral.

In 2005, we held 171,000 share purchase warrants of Vista Gold Corp. which were exercised in 2006. We hold no share purchase warrants in any company as at
December 31, 2006.
8. Value Added Tax Recoverable
We  have  recorded  the  value  added  tax  (VAT)  paid  in  Argentina  and
related  to  the  Pirquitas  property  as  a  recoverable  asset.  Argentinean
law  states  that  VAT  paid  prior  to  production  is  recoverable  once  the
company  reaches  the  production  stage.  In  October  2006,  we  made
a production decision on this property and any VAT paid in Argentina
related to Pirquitas is expected to be recoverable through production
from the proven and probable reserves from this property. The amount
recoverable  at  December  31,  2006  is  estimated  to  be  $1,327,000
(2005—nil).
In countries where we have paid VAT and where there is uncertainty
of the recoverability, the VAT payments have either been deferred with
mineral property costs relating to the property or expensed if it relates
to  mineral  exploration.  If  we  ultimately  recover  amounts  that  have
been deferred, the amount received will be applied to reduce mineral
property costs.

10. Asset Retirement Obligations
During 
the  year  ended  December  31,  2006,  we  expensed
$2,131,000 (2005—$507,000; 2004—$252,000) in on-going, non-
legally  required  environmental  and  reclamation  costs,  accretion  of
asset retirement obligations and changes in the provision for asset
retirement obligations.
At December 31, 2006, $3,409,000 (2005—$1,481,000) was recorded
by us as a provision for future asset retirement obligation expenses for
its various mineral properties, of which $1,073,000 (2005—$722,000)
is considered current.
Our asset retirement obligations relate to legal obligations associated
with site restoration and clean-up costs of our various mineral properties.
The three properties that comprise the majority of the obligations are the
Duthie and Silver Standard Mine properties located in British Columbia,
Canada and the Veta Colorada property located in Mexico.

an additional $751,000 (2005—$159,000; 2004 - $67,000) value deferred as mineral property costs. Of the amount charged to the statements of
loss and deﬁ cit in 2006, $2,981,000 (2005—$567,000; 2004—$668,000) was allocated to general and administration relating to consultants and
directors and $9,954,000 (2005—$3,468,000; 2004—$1,783,000) was allocated to employee salaries and beneﬁ ts. The assigned value of options
exercised during the year that have been credited to share capital was $2,583,000 (2005—$583,000; 2004—$691,000). At December 31, 2006, the
non-vested stock option expense not yet recognized was $17,861,000 and this expense is expected to be recognized over the next 2.5 years. The
intrinsic value of options exercised (the market value less the exercise price value on the date of exercise) was $9,884,000 in 2006.
The fair value of stock options for all options issued, repriced or extended was estimated at the grant date based on the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, using the following weighted average assumptions:
Expected dividend yield (%)
Average risk-free interest rate (%)
Expected life (years)

Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The expected life of the options considered such factors as the average
length  of  time  similar  option  grants  in  the  past  have  remained  outstanding  prior  to  exercise  and  the  vesting  period  of  the  grants.  Volatility  was
estimated based upon historical price observations over the expected term. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
estimated fair value of the options.

a)
Fair value
receivable,
restricted  cash,  value  added
The  estimated  fair  values  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,
accounts 
tax
recoverable,  and  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities
represent their fair value unless otherwise disclosed. The fair
value of marketable securities is disclosed in note 7 and the fair
value of silver bullion is disclosed in note 6.
b)
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from changes in foreign currency
ﬂuctuations.  We  do  not  use  any  derivative  instruments  to
reduce  our  exposure  to  ﬂuctuations  in  foreign  currency
exchange rates.
c)  Credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to
credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. We deposit cash and cash equivalents in high credit
quality ﬁ nancial instruments. We have no security or collateral
for funds held in these ﬁ nancial instruments.
63
a) We  prepare  our  consolidated  ﬁnancial  statements
in
accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted
in Canada (Canadian GAAP), which differ in certain respects
from  those  principles  that  we  would  have  followed  had  our
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements been prepared in accordance
with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United
States  and  requirements  promulgated  by  the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  (collectively  U.S.  GAAP).  The
major differences between Canadian and U.S. GAAP and their
effect on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are summarized
below:
i)
Under  Canadian  GAAP,  the  costs  of  acquiring  mineral
properties  and  related  exploration  and  development
expenditures  are  deferred.  SEC  staff  have  interpreted
U.S.  GAAP  to  require  that  mineral  property  exploration
and  land  use  costs  must  be  expensed  as  incurred,
until  commercially  mineable  deposits  are  determined  to
exist  within  a  particular  property,  as  cash  ﬂ ows  cannot
be  reasonably  estimated  prior  to  such  determination.
Accordingly,  for  U.S.  GAAP  purposes,  for  all  periods
presented, we have expensed all land use costs for mineral
properties and deferred exploration costs that have been
incurred by us, for which commercially mineable revenues
do  not  exist.  When  proven  and  probable  reserves  are
determined  for  a  property  and  a  ﬁnal  feasibility  study

(a development stage company)
20. Material Differences Between Canadian and United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), continued
v)
prepared, any subsequent exploration and development
costs  of  the  property  would  be  capitalized.  Once  in
production,  any  subsequent  development  costs  would
be  treated  as  production  costs  charged  to  production.
In  early  April  2006,  a  Feasibility  Study  Update  for  our
Pirquitas  property  was  completed.  This  study  deﬁned
proven  and  probable  reserves  and,  as  a  consequence,
exploration  and  development  costs  relating  to  this
property from March 31, 2006 have been deferred under
U.S. GAAP.
For  Canadian  GAAP,  cash  ﬂows  relating  to  mineral
property exploration and land use costs are reported as
investing activities. For U.S. GAAP, these costs would be
characterized as operating activities.
Under  U.S.  GAAP,  securities  that  are  available  for  sale
are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses
are  included  as  part  of  comprehensive  income.  An
impairment  on  available-for-sale  securities  is  recorded
in  income  if  such  loss  is  determined  to  be  other  than
temporary. Under Canadian GAAP, marketable securities
are valued at the lower of cost and market with any write-
down recorded as a charge to earnings.
Under  Canadian  GAAP,  before  the  introduction  of
Canadian  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  (CICA)
1581, “Business Combinations”, the fair value of shares
issued  by  an  acquirer  to  effect  a  business  combination
was based on the quoted market price of shares at the
date  of  acquisition.  Under  U.S.  GAAP,  the  fair  value  of
shares issued is based on the market price surrounding
the date the business combination agreement is agreed
to and announced.
ii)
iii)
investments
iv) Canadian  GAAP  provides  for  investments  in  jointly
controlled entities to be accounted for using proportionate
consolidation.  Under  U.S.  GAAP, 
in
incorporated  joint  ventures  are  to  be  accounted  for
using  the  equity  method.  Under  an  accommodation  of
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission,
the accounting for joint ventures need not be reconciled
from  Canadian  to  U.S.  GAAP.  The  different  accounting
treatment  affects  only  the  display  and  classiﬁcation
of  ﬁnancial  statement  items  and  not  net  income  or
shareholders’ equity.
64
the
intrinsic  value  method  prescribed
For U.S. GAAP purposes, we previously accounted for
employee  stock-based  compensation  arrangements
using 
in
Accounting  Principles  Board  (APB)  Opinion  No.  25,
“Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees”  and
related interpretations. Accordingly, since stock options
are granted at exercise prices that are at or above the
quoted market value of our common shares at the date
of grant, there is no compensation cost recognized by
the  company  for  options  granted  to  employees.  We
adopted  the  fair  value  based  method  of  accounting
for  employee  stock-based  compensation  under  U.S.
GAAP  effective  January  1,  2005  using  the  modiﬁ ed
prospective  transition  method.  Under  this  method,
we  recognized  employee  stock-based  compensation
beginning January 1, 2005 as if the fair value method
had  been  used  to  account  for  all  employee  awards
granted,  modiﬁ ed,  or  settled  in  ﬁ scal  years  beginning
after December 15, 1994. Results of prior years have
not been restated.
For  Canadian  GAAP  purposes,  we  adopted,  as  of
January  1,  2004,  the  CICA’s  amendments  to  Section
3870,  “Stock-Based  Compensation  and  other  Stock-
Based  Payments”,  which  required  the 
fair  value
method  to  be  applied  to  employee  stock-based
compensation.
Effective  January  1,  2006,  we  adopted  Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standard  (SFAS)  No.  123R,
“Share Based Payment” for all employee stock-based
awards granted, modiﬁ ed or settled after the effective
date  using  the 
fair  value  measurement  method.
Compensation cost is recognized over the period during
which  an  employee  is  required  to  provide  service  in
exchange for the award—the requisite service period.
For  unvested  awards  outstanding  as  of  the  effective
date,  compensation  will  be  recognized  based  upon
the  grant-date  fair  value  determined  under  SFAS  No.
123  “Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation”.
Upon  adoption  of  SFAS  123R  using  the  modiﬁed
prospective  method, 
there  was  no  cumulative
affect  adjustment  required  and  no  differences  exist
between  the  accounting  for  employee  stock-based
compensation  expense  in  2006  between  Canadian
and U.S. GAAP.

The total rent expense charged to the statement of earnings (loss) in 2006 was $266,000 (2005—$244,000; 2004—$141,000).
f)
Impact of recently issued accounting standards
i)
ii)
iii)
Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 04-06, “Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry”. The consensus concluded
that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs
of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. This consensus is effective in 2006 and had no effect
on our results of operations or ﬁ nancial position.
In June 2006 FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes- an interpretation of SFAS Statement
No. 109”. This interpretation provides guidance on recognition and measurement of uncertainties in income taxes and is effective for
our 2007 ﬁ scal year end. We do not have a signiﬁ cant effect on our results of operations or ﬁ nancial position.
In September 2006 FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurement” to deﬁ ne fair value, establish a framework for measuring
fair value and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement only applies to fair value measurements that are
already required or permitted under current accounting standards and is effective for ﬁ scal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
We do not expect the adoption of this Interpretation to have a signiﬁ cant effect on the company’s results of operations or ﬁ nancial
position.
