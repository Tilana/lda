</p>
<p>1. At the nineteenth session of the Working Group, Costa Rica made an oral 
</p>
<p>presentation of its report under the universal periodic review, as this was the second time 
</p>
<p>that it had submitted such a report. Since the submission of its first report, Costa Rica had 
</p>
<p>submitted an additional document in 2010 presenting its positions on the recommendations, 
</p>
<p>and in 2012 an intermediary report on the specific progress made and implementation of 
</p>
<p>some of the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>2. During the discussion of the report for the universal periodic review, 193 
</p>
<p>recommendations were made by the delegations in attendance. During the meeting of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group it was announced that five recommendations were supported by Costa Rica 
</p>
<p>and were considered to have been implemented. Costa Rica postponed taking a decision on 
</p>
<p>the remaining 188 recommendations. The Government regularly addresses many of these 
</p>
<p>recommendations in its capacity as defender of human rights. Many of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations, moreover, reiterate the same idea and are generally intended to 
</p>
<p>encourage the Government of Costa Rica to persevere with its mission and endeavour to 
</p>
<p>promote and ensure respect for human rights.  
</p>
<p>3. Of the 188 recommendations for which Costa Rica deferred a decision, 173 are 
</p>
<p>supported by Costa Rica, which is to say that they have been accepted. Of these, four have 
</p>
<p>been accepted partially and six are considered as implemented. In addition, Costa Rica has 
</p>
<p>taken note of the remaining 15 recommendations. The table presented in this document 
</p>
<p>contains additional information concerning those recommendations that are not supported 
</p>
<p>by Costa Rica and those for which it is not possible to take up a position at present, owing 
</p>
<p>to the recent change of Government, and the new positions that may be adopted on the 
</p>
<p>various subjects, which need analysing with all the seriousness and commitment required 
</p>
<p>by human rights. The 178 recommendations supported by Costa Rica mostly correspond to 
</p>
<p>decisions and policies that Costa Rica was already implementing prior to the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review process.  
</p>
<p>4. Costa Rica attaches great importance to this exercise, which has been very useful for 
</p>
<p>the formulation and implementation of public policies and actions in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights. We consider that such recommendations should be timely and specific. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>as we explained during the previous review, we think it is important to develop clearer 
</p>
<p>formulations if the recommendations are to be really useful. This would require the troika 
</p>
<p>and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to improve 
</p>
<p>their performance, especially with regard to the clustering and screening of 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>5. Costa Rica will refer to each of the recommendations included in the report of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group as follows:

<p>Costa Rica takes note. It considers that the Convention 
reflects exclusively the interests of countries of origin of 
major migration flows and not those of the countries 
receiving migrants, that have to deal with their needs. 
</p>
<p>In any event, the same principles as those of the Convention 
are enshrined in the country&#8217;s legislation and case law, so 
that the full rights of migrant workers and their families are 
guaranteed.

</p>
<p>  Subparagraph (a) stipulates that the penalty is more severe if the victim is under 18 years old.  
</p>
<p>  Article 383 of the Criminal Code on smuggling of minors.  
</p>
<p>  Article 73 of Act No. 9095 on human trafficking defines civil action for damages.

</p>
<p>  The protection of trafficking victims is initially provided by the various police forces and the rapid 
</p>
<p>response teams (ERIs). There is also Act No. 8720, the Act on the Protection of Victims, Witnesses 
</p>
<p>and Other Parties Involved in Criminal Proceedings.  
</p>
<p>  Article 26 of Act No. 9095 includes a confidentiality clause and contains a full chapter on protection 
</p>
<p>of information and privacy.  
</p>
<p>  Various bodies are involved in victim assistance. If the victims are minors, the National Child 
</p>
<p>Welfare Agency (PANI); for older persons, assistance is provided by the National Council for Older 
</p>
<p>Persons (CONAPAM) (and if they are women, the National Institute for Women (INAMU) as well). 
</p>
<p>For cases involving disabilities, the National Council on Rehabilitation and Special Education 
</p>
<p>(CNREE). 
</p>
<p> 13 Since 2011, children, migrants and foreign children born in our country have been documented as part 
</p>
<p>of the migration procedure in the Los Santos region. 
</p>
<p> 14 In view of the importance of human rights in affective matters and sexuality, the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Education has placed human rights at the centre of education, underscoring the importance of the 
</p>
<p>person, his or her identity and rights, and emphasizing that with every right comes the obligation to 
</p>
<p>respect the rights of others. 
</p>
<p> 15 The bill on the autonomous development of indigenous peoples is currently under consideration for 
</p>
<p>adoption and will undergo the appropriate procedure. 
</p>
<p> 16 The restitution of land to indigenous communities is under way. In the Salitre area the land has been 
</p>
<p>demarcated and land improvement has begun. In other areas delimitation and demarcation have 
</p>
<p>begun. 
</p>
<p> 17 The constitutional framework and the current legislation reflect the standards of Costa Rican society 
</p>
<p>for the protection of human life. The recommendations go beyond the provisions of the current 
</p>
<p>legislation governing abortion; they involve other branches of government, such as the legislative 
</p>
<p>branch, in keeping with the political and electoral mandate of legislators. From the point of view of 
</p>
<p>the Government, in accordance with the principle of legality, the executive branch is only permitted 
</p>
<p>to regulate the legislation in force, relating to therapeutic abortion, covered by article 121 of the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p> 18 In addition to the prisons of the Ministry of Justice and Peace and the cells of the law enforcement 
</p>
<p>services, the national preventive mechanism also monitors cells run by the Judicial Investigation 
</p>
<p>Agency of the judicial branch, the National Psychiatric Hospital, the Hospital for Persons with 
</p>
<p>Psychiatric Disorders in Conflict with the Law, the Centre for Undocumented Migrants and the 
</p>
<p>detention facility at Juan Santamar&#237;a International Airport. 
</p>
<p> 19 The national preventive mechanism carries out periodic visits to the prison facilities of the juvenile 
</p>
<p>detention programme. It jointly conducts investigations with the Directorate for Children and 
</p>
<p>Adolescents of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office regarding serious cases of violence occurring in such 
</p>
<p>facilities. 
</p>
<p> 20 It is considered that deprivation of liberty should be the exception and not the rule and that alternative 
</p>
<p>solutions to detention should be made available.  
</p>
<p>  For example, support is given to local governments, civil society and the National Youth Programme 
</p>
<p>to provide employment grants to young people who are deprived of liberty. Assistance is also 
</p>
<p>provided for drug dependent persons. 
</p>
<p> 21 The plan of action of the National Disability Policy (PONADIS) 2012&#8211;2014 is currently being revised 
</p>
<p>to take stock of the progress made and set new objectives for the period from 2015 to 2018. 
</p>
<p> 22 Decree No. 38140-RE-PLAN, of 20 February 2014: National Policy for a society free from racism, 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination and xenophobia, published in the Official Gazette. 
</p>
<p> 23 On 22 May 2014 the board of directors of the Social Insurance Fund of Costa Rica agreed to amend 
</p>
<p>two articles so as to allow same-sex couples to be insured. It also approved unrestricted visits to 
</p>
<p>health centres when one member of such a couple is hospitalized. Similarly, Decision No. 2013-22-
</p>
<p>0041a of the Constitutional Chamber ordered the Bar Association to give same-sex couples passes for 
</p>
<p>access to and the use of its facilities and, when the proper applications were filed, to handle their 
</p>
<p>cases so that they could be included as beneficiaries of life insurance and voluntary insurance 
</p>
<p>policies.
