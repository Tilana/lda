Heron Announces June 2016 Quarterly Update on the High Grade Woodlawn Zinc-
Copper Project 
 
July 29, 2016 – Sydney, Australia – Heron Resources Ltd. (TSX: HER; ASX: HRR) ("Heron" or the "Company") 
announces its quarterly activities for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Details of the Company's results 
are contained in the filing “Heron Resources Limited Quarterly Report June 2016” which is available on SEDAR 
at www.sedar.com and the Company's website www.heronresources.com.au 
 
June Quarter 2016 Highlights
•  Cash and Cash Equivalents – At June 30, 2016 Heron held A$22.8M in cash (including A$0.2M in
bonds) and A$1.7M in investments
•  Commodity market - fundamentals continue to strengthen for zinc, with zinc prices hitting a 12 month
high in July
•  Woodlawn Zinc-Copper Project:
Feasibility Study: on 29 June 2016 the Company announced the results of the Woodlawn Feasibility Study 
(FS). The complete NI 43-101 Technical Report in support of the FS study was published on Heron’s 
website and lodged on SEDAR www.sedar.com (TSX:HER) on 26 July 2016. The key outcomes of this 
study include:  
Attractive project characteristics
o
Initial 9.3 year mine life based upon the combined underground and tailings Mineral Reserves 
(“Starter Case”)
o  Campaign processing rate of up to 1.0Mtpa from underground mining, and up to 1.5Mtpa from
reclaiming tailings, processed through a standard single-sulphide flotation facility
o  Steady-state (2020-2023) annual Production Target  of  40kt Zn, 10kt Cu,  12kt Pb, 900koz Ag
and 4koz Au contained within zinc, copper, and lead concentrates
o  Project  is  totally  contained  upon  granted  Special  Mining  Lease  SML20  –  Woodlawn  is  fully
‘permitted’ and ‘mine ready’
o  Utilising  existing  local  and  regional  infrastructure  to  achieve  significant  reductions  in
development costs
o  Close  proximity  to  large  service  and  employment  centres  (Sydney,  Wollongong,  Canberra,
Goulburn)
o  Strong local community and regulator support
o
Inferred Mineral Resources defined in both the underground and tailings projects demonstrate 
excellent potential to extend mine life to more than 11.5 years
Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves
o  Underground mine plan focused on the shallower areas of the deposit reflecting the success of 
the  recent  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (PEA)  &  FS  drilling  programs.  There  is  a  high 
level  of  confidence  based  on  historic  data  for  extensions  to  this  mineralisation  both  at-depth 
and along strike
o  Two separate production sources, mining from underground and reclaiming of tailings, provides
operational flexibility and reduces risk

o  20 years of historical operational data removes ‘greenfield’ unknowns
Robust economics
o  C1 costs of US$-0.05/lb zinc and C3 of US$0.34/lb expected to place Woodlawn firmly in the
lower half of the cost curve
o  Attractive capital cost metrics based on annual metal Production Targets and Reserves-based
mine life
o  Life  extension  case  (PEA  equivalent  mine  plan)  shows  excellent  consistency  with  previously
published PEA
o  Significant leverage to the price outlook for zinc, which comprises approximately 48% of total
payable metal value
Expedited development and financing pathway to meet market opportunity
•  The Company has commenced a structured project funding process with the assistance of Azure
Capital and is targeting finalisation in the later part of 2016
•  A  number  of  optimisation  opportunities  that  have  the  potential  to  further  enhance  the  project 
outcomes  were  identified  during  the  FS  program.  A  number  of  these  options  will  be  pursued  in 
parallel to the funding and include aspects such as equipment sourcing alternatives and additional 
shallow mineralised positions
•  Rapid development schedule of 15 months from commencement of construction until completion of
wet commissioning
•  First production targeted early 2018 to meet projected favourable zinc market conditions
Phase III Exploration Drill Program Commenced
•  A step-out drill program commenced in early July, with the first hole (WNDD0105) intersecting 1.2m 
of  polymetallic  massive  sulphides  in  a  4.5m  zone  of  sulphidic  mineralisation  from  538m  depth  – 
assays  are  pending.  Down  hole  electro-magentics  (DHEM)  is  planned  to  delineate  potential 
conductors prior  to  further drilling.  This  intercept  confirms  the extension of  the  B  Lens  horizon  in 
this northerly direction, and lends support to the potential for further discovery.
•  A number of holes are also planned to test for, and in-fill, shallow mineralised positions which could
add to the Mineral Reserves for the early years of the production schedule
Woodlawn Zinc-Copper Project 
Heron’s primary development project is the high grade Woodlawn Zinc-Copper Project located 250km 
southwest of Sydney, New South Wales. The project consists of both a high grade underground and a large 
medium grade tailings resource. The development approach envisages the construction of a single 1.5Mtpa 
processing plant capable of treating material from both sources. Planned production will see the generation of 
three separate base metal concentrates (zinc, copper and lead) with associated precious metal credits. In 
addition, the project is very well supported by excellent infrastructure, an existing mining lease and state 
government development approvals. 
 
Woodlawn is expected to become an important Australian near term zinc producer delivering concentrates into 
a market with strong supply and demand fundamentals underpinning a strong commodity price.
