<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 22 February to 4 March 2011, the independent expert on the issue of human 
rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de 
Albuquerque, undertook an official country visit to the United States of America to assess 
the way in which the United States is implementing the rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert thanks the Government of the United States of America for 
the cooperation extended in the preparation of and during the mission, especially the 
Department of State for coordinating the visit. Additionally, she thanks the representatives 
of the following federal government agencies: the Department of Justice; the Department of 
Interior; the Environmental Protection Agency; the United States Agency for International 
Development; the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for 
Disease Control; the White House Council on Environmental Quality; the Department of 
Agriculture; and the Interagency Council on Homelessness. The independent expert also 
had the honour of participating in a hearing convened by the Congressional Tom Lantos 
Human Rights Commission on the right to water.  
</p>
<p>3. During the mission, the independent expert visited Washington DC; Boston and 
Falmouth in Massachusetts; Sacramento, Redding, including the Winnemen Wintu tribe, 
Seville and other communities in the San Joaquin Valley in California; and Edmonston, 
Maryland. In each of these locations, she had the occasion to meet with state and local 
authorities. The independent expert thanks them also for their time and engagement.  
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert convened seven public hearings in the various locations she 
visited, and had the honour of receiving personal testimony from all across the United 
States &#8211; including from Alabama, Alaska, Michigan, Puerto Rico and West Virginia. She 
especially thanks all those individuals who travelled long distances to share their stories 
with her. Numerous other testimonies were submitted in writing, reflecting the experiences 
of other individuals and communities from other regions of the United States. 
</p>
<p>5. During the mission, the independent expert was particularly struck by the vibrant 
and active engagement of civil society working on human rights, water and sanitation 
issues. She is especially grateful for their initiative to connect her with affected 
communities and victims. She extends a special word of thanks to all those who shared 
their personal stories with her. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International and domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. At the international level, the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
derives from the right to an adequate standard of living which is protected under, inter alia, 
article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and article 11 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This right was also recently recognized 
by the General Assembly and reaffirmed by the Human Rights Council, with the support of 
the United States of America, which the independent expert welcomes1. States obligation 
with regard to the right to safe drinking water and sanitation requires that water and 
sanitation be available, accessible, affordable, acceptable and of good quality for everyone 
without discrimination. This obligation must be progressively realized to the maximum of 
available resources, meaning that a State must take concrete and targeted steps towards 
ensuring universal access to water and sanitation. Any retrogressive measure &#8211; such as in a 
period of economic crisis &#8211; is presumed to be a violation of the human right unless fully 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.4 
 
</b></p>
<p>justified by the State.2 There must be opportunities for meaningful participation in decision-
making; there must be transparency and access to information; and accountability 
mechanisms must be established to address cases where these rights are violated. Ensuring 
the rights to water and sanitation is closely related to the enjoyment of other human rights, 
including the rights to education, work, health, housing and food, among others.  
</p>
<p>7. The legal framework governing access to water and sanitation in the United States of 
America is a complex amalgam of federal and state statutes and common law principles. 
This multi-tiered system, coupled with an array of variances available to states and private 
actors, make generalizations about the capacity of the United States legal framework to 
reflect access to safe drinking water and sanitation as human rights particularly difficult. 
The United States has not ratified many of the relevant treaties from which these rights are 
derived, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. The independent expert, nevertheless, notes that the United States has signed 
these instruments (in 1977, 1980, 1995 and 2009, respectively) and reminds the 
Government that upon signing, it assumed the obligation to refrain from acts that would 
defeat the object and purpose of these treaties, pending decision on ratification. She 
encourages the United States to take steps towards ratifying these instruments without 
reservations.  
</p>
<p>8. Existing federal laws generally focus on maintaining water quality rather than 
ensuring access for all citizens. Constitutional and statutory provisions that pertain to non-
discrimination and equal protection of the law create a framework that allows citizens to 
enforce the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation indirectly, but without the ability to 
ground such claims as an explicit right, the success of such claims remain uncertain. 
</p>
<p>9. While there is no federally recognized right to safe drinking water and sanitation, 
individual states have taken the initiative to consecrate this right. For instance, the states of 
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have already recognized the right to water (though not to 
sanitation) in their constitutions.3 In California, a bill package has been introduced that 
recognizes the human right to water.4  
</p>
<p>10. The two primary federal statutes governing water in the United States are the Clean 
Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, a number of federal agencies 
play a role in regulating water, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the 
Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior.5
</p>
<p>11. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) leads in establishing minimum 
standards for regulating pollution and water quality, as well as monitoring and enforcing 
these standards in federal waterways. The states are free to adopt their own regulations 
insofar as they meet, at a minimum, federal standards. For instance, states are responsible 
for monitoring and enforcing water quality standards at local sources, developing 
infrastructure and managing wastewater treatment.

</p>
<p>Department of Justice, play a role in preventing discrimination in terms of access to water and 
sanitation services. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.4 
 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Clean Water Act of 1972 is a broad initiative aimed at controlling pollution in 
all surface waters. Among other things, the Clean Water Act bans the discharge of 
pollutants into navigable waters and sets water quality standards for contaminants in all 
surface waters. The Water Quality Standards Regulation accompanies the Clean Water Act 
and authorizes EPA to establish water quality standards. EPA publishes recommended 
criteria for various designated uses, and plans to propose amendments to its water quality 
standards in summer 2011. Although clear water quality standards are set, a complex 
system of exceptions means that often these standards are legally disregarded. Each state is 
responsible for reviewing, establishing and revising water quality standards for waters 
within its borders, within the minimum standards set by EPA. EPA has review powers over 
state regulations. Federally recognized American Indian tribes may also apply for eligibility 
to develop their own water quality standards 
</p>
<p>13. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 sets maximum levels for contaminants in 
drinking water and its sources, and requires water systems to test regularly for 
contaminants. These standards apply to every public water system in the United States. The 
1996 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act allot federal funds to states to develop 
programmes to protect groundwater. The majority of regulations related to water quality, 
modelled on those promulgated by EPA, can be found in state statutes, and are enforced 
through state environmental agencies.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The right to water and sanitation in the United States of 
America 
</b></p>
<p>14. People living in the United States enjoy near universal access to safe water. 
Nationwide, there are an estimated 161,000 public water systems6, which may be publicly 
or privately owned. Community water systems are public water systems that serve people 
year-round in their homes. The majority of people in the United States (268 million) receive 
their water from a community water system (54,000 systems).7 Approximately 15 per cent 
(46 million) of Americans rely on their own private drinking water supplies, and these 
supplies are not subject to EPA standards, although some state and local governments set 
rules to protect users of these wells. With no regular monitoring, the burden is on 
households with private systems to take precautions to ensure the protection and 
maintenance of their drinking water supplies. 8  Additionally, over 53,000 rural water 
utilities exist, 90 per cent of which serve communities of 10,000 people or less. These 
figures highlight the fragmentation of the sector, which presents enormous challenges when 
trying to regulate, monitor and find solutions for universal access.  
</p>
<p>15. Twenty-five percent of all households in the U.S. have on-site wastewater treatment 
systems, and most others are connected to sewerage networks and wastewater treatment 
facilities. But according to EPA, in general, states and communities have not established 
adequate management programmes to assure proper functioning of onsite systems for 
wastewater treatment.  
</p>
<p>16. The United States has aging water and wastewater systems, with decreasing 
investment in research and development, coupled with an increase in the population. By the 
</p>
<p>  
 6  The Safe Drinking Water Act defines a public water system as one that serves piped water to at least 
</p>
<p>25 persons or 15 service connections for at least 60 days each year.

</b></p>
<p>year 2020, the population will likely be over 325 million and systems will need to increase 
capacity. Furthermore, the population is shifting geographically, requiring rapid increases 
in system capacity in some parts of the country, and maintenance of aging systems in other 
parts of the country with diminishing populations (and a diminishing rate base). 
</p>
<p>17. In the last 20 years, communities have spent one trillion dollars on drinking water 
treatment and supply and wastewater treatment and disposal. Ninety per cent of these costs 
are financed by consumers. However, this may not be sufficient to keep pace with 
infrastructure needs of the future. Hence, EPA estimates that over the next 20 years, $200 
billion to $400 billion will be required to ensure the sustainability of water and wastewater 
systems. In a time of scarce financial resources, the United States needs greater efforts to 
ensure that available funding, including loans and grants provided through the Safe Water 
and Clean Water State Revolving Fund, prioritizes those who are in the most precarious 
situations. While acknowledging that states must provide a minimum of 15 per cent of the 
available funds for loans to small communities, which enables them to address the 
challenges faced by poor and marginalized communities to a certain extent, the possibility 
for a state to provide up to 30 per cent of the grant received to provide additional assistance 
to disadvantaged communities remains a mere &#8220;option.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>18. The independent expert welcomes the fact that there is near universal access to water 
and sanitation in the United States and commends the Government for its achievements in 
this regard. By its nature, a human rights analysis focuses on the situation of the most 
marginalized and excluded. Thus, this report especially concentrates on the situation of 
these groups with regard to their access to water and sanitation. While these groups 
comprise a small proportion of the population, the independent expert emphasizes that they 
require priority attention. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the United States, it is often the poorest and the most marginalized groups that 
lack access to sanitation. Without proper sanitation, human excreta contaminate drinking 
water sources, with severe public health implications. Ensuring access to adequate 
sanitation for all is not only fundamental for human dignity and privacy, but is also key to 
protecting water quality. States must progressively extend safe sanitation services, 
particularly to rural and deprived urban areas, taking into account the needs of 
disadvantaged groups.9
</p>
<p>20. The independent expert received testimony concerning the wastewater situation in 
Lowndes County, Alabama. The County has a population of 12,293, of which 70.1 per cent 
is Black, with an annual median household income of $30,225 and 25.4 per cent living 
below the poverty line.10 As a mostly rural county, about 18 per cent of the population are 
served by conventional municipal sewer systems. The remaining 82 per cent rely on on-site 
wastewater systems, typically septic tanks and in-ground dispersal fields (trenches). The 
Alabama Department of Public Health estimates that the number of households in Lowndes 
County with inadequate or no septic systems range from 40 to 90 per cent; it has reported 
that 50 per cent of the conventional, on-site septic systems are currently failing or are 
expected to fail in the future. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>6</b>  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.4 
 
</b></p>
<p>21. In 1999, the Alabama Department of Public Health initiated legal action (litigations 
and arrests) against 41 sites for releasing raw sewage into the ground surface, despite 
repeated violation notices in an attempt to oblige wastewater management to meet 
minimum environmental and health standards. Many individuals, who could not afford to 
take remedial action, were arrested. They now have arrest records for not having been able 
to afford the costly remedy. More recently in 2008, following complaints from a neighbour, 
the Department of Public Health initiated steps towards the arrest of a 27-year-old single 
mother, who lived in a mobile home with her autistic child, for not maintaining her septic 
system according to applicable health standards. The septic system replacement cost was 
higher than her annual income of $12,000, and she did not have the means to access 
funding. 
</p>
<p>22. Key to understanding the serious need for adequate wastewater systems and 
management in Lowndes County is the nature of the native soils, which consist principally 
of heavy clay material that does not transmit water well and results subsequently in 
significant effluent run-off problems. The most common on-site wastewater alternative 
ranges in price from $6,000 to as much as $30,000 &#8211; money that most residents of Lowndes 
County do not have. As such, the right to sanitation is inaccessible for a substantial 
proportion of Lowndes County residents.  
</p>
<p>23. The independent expert welcomes recent news that EPA has issued a $575,000 grant 
to the Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise to develop a master plan to address the need for 
access to sanitation services in Lowndes County.  
</p>
<p>24. The central Appalachian region of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West 
Virginia faces similar challenges in realizing the right to sanitation. This rural region is 
populated by many communities without basic water and sewer infrastructure, and which 
face some of the highest poverty and lowest education attainment rates in the United States. 
The independent expert received testimony from communities that were forced to directly 
discharge untreated sewage into streams and ground surfaces, and she was informed that in 
West Virginia and southern Virginia, as many as two-thirds of homes were discharging raw 
sewage. 
</p>
<p>25. In Falmouth, Massachusetts, the surrounding bays and estuaries are increasingly 
contaminated with nitrates, and a centralized sewage system is being proposed as a 
solution. Should such a project move forward, those living in the community would be 
required to pay an estimated $50,000 to $60,000 to implement it. In Falmouth, however, the 
median annual income for over 60 per cent of the residents is $20,000.11  
</p>
<p>26. Falmouth is emblematic of situations occurring all around the country. Repairing 
aging infrastructure in cities and building new water and sewer systems in rural areas in 
traditional ways is increasingly untenable and federal funding for water and sanitation tends 
to be structured around conventional centralized systems, resulting in per-household costs 
that are too high and discouraging investment in rural systems.  
</p>
<p>27. Consideration should be given to decentralized water and wastewater systems in 
rural communities. Multiple benefits could be realized with decentralized systems, 
including fulfilling the rights to access water and sanitation services; reaping economic and 
environmental savings; and providing opportunities to expand businesses that develop 
decentralized systems that could be used globally. Pilot projects in rural communities could

 11  This figure was reported to the independent expert by a former Massachusetts State representative. 
</p>
<p>While official census figures for 2009 indicate a median annual household income of $30,913, the 
lower figure refers to the lower income portion of the population. Census figures are available at

<p>test innovative technology and compile information on construction costs, performance, 
and operation and maintenance costs. In this context, the independent expert recalls that the 
Government has well-developed programmes to assist rural communities through the Rural 
Utilities Program of the United States Department of Agriculture, among others. 
Nevertheless, poor, disadvantaged, minority and indigenous communities are often unable 
to access federal, state and local funding sources due to technical, managerial and financial 
capacity requirements, among others. The independent expert calls on federal, state and 
local governments to consider innovative and ecologically-friendly solutions to ensure 
sustainable systems that are affordable for the community, while recalling the need to 
establish adequate programmes to assure proper functioning and maintenance of on-site 
systems for wastewater treatment.  
</p>
<p>28. The independent expert notes that EPA has articulated the Clean Water and Drinking 
Water Infrastructure Sustainability Policy, which aims to work with states and local 
governments to develop guidance, provide technical assistance, and target the federal Clean 
Water State Revolving Fund capitalization assistance to support the increase in the 
sustainability of water infrastructure in the United States and the communities it serves. She 
also acknowledges the Alaska Native Villages and the US&#8211;Mexico Border water 
infrastructure programmes that are designed to address urgent infrastructure needs in two 
areas that are economically disadvantaged and had documented examples of untreated 
sewage discharges. 
</p>
<p>29. This is a positive development, and the gains of such policies and programmes 
would be enhanced if brought in line with human rights norms.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Safety 
</b></p>
<p>30. Water and sanitation must be safe and of good quality, and must not pose a threat to 
human health. According to a report by the Environmental Working Group, since 2004, 
water-quality testing by utilities has found 315 pollutants in tap water; EPA has set 
enforceable standards for 114 pollutants. For those pollutants subject to regulation, 49 were 
found in one place or another at levels above EPA guidelines, exposing some 53 million 
people to polluted tap water.12 Moreover, drinking-water quality analysis conducted by the 
Environmental Working Group found that utilities achieved 92 per cent compliance with 
EPA mandatory health standards for the 114 regulated contaminants, demonstrating that 
utilities can and do comply with regulatory standards when they exist. This finding 
comports with EPA&#8217;s own annual performance assessment for 2010, which reported that 92 
per cent of people were served by community water systems that met applicable health-
based drinking water standards.13 Nevertheless, the goal of universal access to clean and 
safe water has yet to be attained. Infants, older persons, persons with certain medical 
conditions and other vulnerable groups remain at risk from exposure to water that does not 
meet federal standards. Moreover, hundreds of substances found in water remain 
unregulated, and some sources of water, namely private drinking-water supplies, are also 
unregulated.  
</p>
<p>31. In addition, the independent expert received worrying testimony regarding lead 
contamination of water in Washington DC. The presence of lead in drinking water can

<p>cause adverse health effects. From 2001 to 2004, the District of Columbia experienced 
elevated lead levels in its drinking water system, triggered by a change in disinfectant. 
Although the change in disinfectant brought the water quality in line with EPA regulations 
concerning the concentration of potential carcinogens (a by-product of chlorine 
disinfection), it altered the chemistry of the water, causing lead to leach from pipes and 
elevating water lead levels in homes throughout the city.  
</p>
<p>32. The Water and Sewer Authority (now known as DC Water) did not notify the public 
until 2003. The notices were unclear and thousands were exposed to harmful lead levels. 
Following a story published in <i>The Washington Post</i> in 2004, the city made efforts to 
replace thousands of lead pipes (on public property) servicing 17,600 homes. Homeowners 
were responsible for authorizing and paying for the work on their property, but many did 
not have the financial means to do so. On the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and 
EPA, however, the programme was suspended in late 2008 as partial pipe replacements 
were found to cause spikes in water lead levels in homes.  
</p>
<p>33. Residents have been advised to completely replace all lead service lines, the cost of 
which may be prohibitively expensive for low-income residents, therefore leaving them 
without safe water. In this context, the independent expert notes that DC Water has offered 
to replace the public portion of a lead service line if a homeowner voluntarily replaces the 
private portion. Also, the DC Department of Housing and Community Development offers 
a grant programme to income-qualified property owners who are interested in replacing the 
private portion of their lead service line. Nevertheless, concerns remain for those 
households that, even with financial support from such programmes, are unable to afford 
lead service line replacements.    
</p>
<p>34. The San Joaquin Valley in central California is also experiencing enormous 
challenges, particularly nitrate contamination, with regard to drinking water, The Valley 
represents around 10 per cent of the total population of California, with a population of 3.8 
million people, 20 per cent of whom live below the poverty line, and 46 per cent of whom 
are Latino.14 While nitrates occur naturally at low levels, crop fertilizers, animal manure or 
septic systems can elevate nitrate levels in drinking water sources. Because it is difficult to 
assign responsibility for this type of pollution (non-point source pollution), no one is 
obliged to pay for the clean-up costs. In these circumstances, the affected community 
inevitably bears these costs.  
</p>
<p>35. The San Joaquin Valley accounts for over half of the agricultural production of 
California. It is populated by numerous concentrated animal feeding operations, with an 
estimated 1.6 million dairy cows and 161,000 beef cattle in 2008; a typical cow produces 
over 30 tonnes of solid manure per year.15
</p>
<p>36. It is vulnerable to nitrate contamination because groundwater serves as the primary 
source of drinking water for almost 90 per cent of its residents.16 According to the United 
States Geological Survey, millions of pounds of nitrate (in fertilizers and manure) and 
pesticides are applied to cropland annually, with some of these chemicals filtering into the 
groundwater and thereby threatening public health.17 During the mission, the Department of 
Agriculture acknowledged the need to address the challenges posed by targeting the small

<p>and disadvantaged water systems and noted some initiatives in this regard (see para. 26 
above).  
</p>
<p>37. The independent expert visited Tulare County, the poorest county in California, 
where minorities comprise the majority of the local population (58.3 per cent Latino, 3.8 
per cent Asian and Pacific Islander, 2.1 per cent Black, 1.9 per cent American Indian)18. 
One of the top three agricultural producing counties in California,19  Tulare County has 
many public water systems with nitrate levels over the maximum contaminant level (MCL) 
of 45 parts per million. Approximately 20 per cent of Tulare County&#8217;s small public water 
systems (defined as 5 to 199 service connections/homes) are unable to meet the nitrate 
MCL on a regular basis, and another 20 per cent are over half the nitrate MCL.20
</p>
<p>38. The independent expert received testimony from various rural communities in 
Tulare County, representing Alpaugh, Cutler, East Orosi, Orosi, Seville and Tooleville, 
among others. These communities suffer from drinking water contaminated by nitrates, 
arsenic, banned pesticides and disinfectant by-products. Seville, a small, low-income 
community, is illustrative of the broader problems plaguing Tulare County.  
</p>
<p>39. For Seville residents, the reliance on groundwater means that when it becomes 
contaminated, there are no alternative water supplies. Besides paying the regular water bill, 
families are forced to purchase bottled water to ensure safe and clean water for drinking and 
cooking. The cost of bottled water thus becomes the de facto water rate, which is not 
including the cost of transport to the store. With a median household income of $14,000 per 
year, households, in total, are devoting approximately 20 per cent of their income to water 
and sanitation.21 Households who are unable to afford alternative solutions, such as buying 
bottled water, uninformed about the water quality or forced to make difficult trade-offs, 
such as forgoing other basic needs, fall into a protection gap.  
</p>
<p>40. Research conducted by the University of California at Berkeley found that in smaller 
water systems, communities with larger percentages of Latinos and renters are potentially 
exposed to drinking water with higher nitrate levels, compared to communities with higher 
proportions of White residents and homeowners. 22  The independent expert expresses 
concerns about such racial disparities, and urges the Government to take concerted action to 
eliminate discrimination in practice, as well as to ensure country-wide regulation and 
monitoring of private drinking water supplies.  
</p>
<p>41. The independent expert received concerning reports on hydraulic fracturing and its 
impact on water. New technological developments have allowed the oil and gas industry to 
extract natural gas from shale resources previously believed too expensive and difficult to 
tap. Hydraulic fracturing has been used in the industry for over 60 years and is now utilized

<p>in around 90 per cent of the country&#8217;s oil and gas wells.23 Projections suggest that shale gas 
will comprise over 20 per cent of total gas supply in the United States by 2020.24
</p>
<p>42. Hydraulic fracturing is a well-stimulation process used to extract underground 
resources, such as oil, natural gas and geothermal energy. In 2005 the Congress exempted 
this practice from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act,25 making this the only 
industry allowed to inject known pollutants into the ground near water sources without 
federal oversight. In 2010, EPA was tasked with studying the potential adverse impacts of 
hydraulic fracturing on drinking water.26
</p>
<p>43. Residents in regions where hydraulic fracturing occurs have reported drinking water 
contamination. In some cases, reports have been received of flammable tap water in a 
severe incident causing a home to explode.27 Federal and state agencies have determined 
the drinking water in several rural towns, such as Dimock, Pennsylvania, and Pavilion, 
Wyoming, non-potable due to chemical contaminants used in nearby hydraulic fracturing 
operations. 
</p>
<p>44. Natural-gas extraction in rural areas increases the likelihood that water 
contamination will go undetected, as rural water supplies are difficult to monitor. The 1996 
amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act permit variances for rural utilities (less than 
10,000 connections) to provide lower quality water. Moreover, as already highlighted, EPA 
does not have the authority to regulate private wells, which are the primary source of 
drinking water in many rural areas.  
</p>
<p>45. Large urban cities are better equipped to withstand pressure from the natural gas 
industry. For example, the Marcellus Shale &#8211; cutting across New York and Pennsylvania &#8211; 
is believed to contain valuable natural gas resources. This notwithstanding, the New York 
City Department of Environmental Protection has asserted that &#8220;hydraulic fracturing poses 
an unacceptable threat to the unfiltered water supply of nine million New Yorkers and 
cannot safely be permitted within the New York City watershed.&#8221;28
</p>
<p>46. A policy disconnect seems to exist between polluting activities and their ultimate 
impact on the safety of drinking water sources. The absence of integrated thinking has 
generated enormous burdens, including increased costs to public water systems to monitor 
and treat water to remove regulated contaminants29, and detrimental health outcomes for 
individuals and communities. The independent expert recommends a holistic consideration 
of the right to water by factoring it into policies having an impact on water quality, ranging 
from agriculture to chemical use in products to energy production activities.

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.4 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>47. Another element of the human rights to water and sanitation is affordability, 
meaning that direct and indirect costs and charges associated with securing water and 
sanitation must not compromise the ability to pay for other essential needs guaranteed by 
other human rights such as the rights to food, housing, education and health.  
</p>
<p>48. The cost of drinking water is rising, as suppliers need to service aging infrastructure, 
comply with ever-stringent public health standards and expand access. In most cases, 
increasing costs have caused water suppliers to increase rates, or otherwise charge users for 
repairing and upgrading the network as described above. Nevertheless, water is generally 
still inexpensive compared to other utilities, such as electricity and phone service. In the 
United States, combined water and sewer bills average only about 0.5 per cent of household 
income. 30  EPA has elaborated voluntary affordability guidelines, suggesting that a 
maximum of two per cent of household income should be allocated to water services.31
</p>
<p>49. Nonetheless, for lower income households, the rates for water and sanitation 
services fall outside the above-mentioned average and above the two per cent ceiling. These 
households are often faced with difficult financial choices (e.g., late or non-payment of 
bills, reduced service levels, etc.) in meeting basic service needs. Moreover, lower-income 
households often occupy substandard housing with inadequate and leaking plumbing 
fixtures, which contribute to costly wasted water.  
</p>
<p>50. The relationship between affordability of services and patterns of water shut-off 
policies is another concern. The independent expert received information that water shut-off 
policies disproportionately impact marginalized persons along race, class and gender. For 
example, a study by Massachusetts Global Action examined the racial impact of the water 
pricing and shut-off policies of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission, and found that 
for every one per cent increase in the city ward&#8217;s percentage of people of colour, the 
number of threatened cut-offs increases by four per cent.32
</p>
<p>51. She also received information about situations where children were separated from 
parents and placed into custodial care, based on applicable child protection laws that seek to 
safeguard the best interest of the child, because the household water supply was shut off. 
Water utilities must be able to collect payment for services from customers, but regarding 
shut-off for non-payment, the independent expert emphasizes the need for due process. The 
authorities should address the underlying causes of the inability to pay, instead of merely its 
symptoms. The principle of the best interest of the child should guide decision-making in 
these cases. The independent expert expresses concern about the discriminatory impact of 
water shut-off policies, particularly for low-income children and older persons.  
</p>
<p>52. In some states, legal protections are provided against water shut-offs. For example, 
investor-owned utilities in Massachusetts are not allowed to shut off water to households 
with children under 12 months, persons over 65 years or persons with certain medical 
conditions; unfortunately, the same does not apply to public utilities. In Rhode Island, the 
protection with regard to children extends to two years of age, and covers public and 
private utilities. In the view of the independent expert, a federal standard should be 
established to provide protections against water shut-offs for vulnerable and marginalized 
groups.

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.4 
 
</b></p>
<p>53. From the observations of the independent expert, it is clear that EPA voluntary 
guidelines on affordability are insufficient to ensure the right to water for all without 
discrimination. Currently, there is no federal legislation, either directly by statute or through 
a regulatory agency, mandating affordability standards for water and sanitation. The Federal 
Government has used its power in other areas to legislate minimum standards &#8211; this has 
been the case of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The Federal  
Government has also set minimum standards in relation to water quality and minimum 
wage standards, deriving its authority from the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. 
While these laws place ultimate responsibility on the Federal Government, legislation aims 
to build a regulatory foundation on which states may enact additional rules and take 
primary responsibility for monitoring and enforcing standards.  
</p>
<p>54. In this regard, the independent expert calls on the Government to adopt a mandatory 
federal standard on affordability for water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Excluded groups 
</b></p>
<p>55. The independent expert met with numerous communities and groups who face 
challenges in accessing safe water and sanitation. The situations of homeless people and 
indigenous persons have particular features that warrant a specific human rights analysis.   
</p>
<p><b>  Homeless people  
</b></p>
<p>56. As a part of her mission, the independent expert examined the situation of the 
homeless with regard to access to water and sanitation. Up to 3.5 million people experience 
homelessness in the United States every year, and on any given night over 800,000 people 
are homeless. In some cities, homelessness is being increasingly criminalized. 
Criminalization includes fines, arrests and severance of social protection benefits or even 
access to employment. Local statutes prohibiting public urination and defecation &#8211; which 
can constitute a sexual offence in some cases &#8211;, while facially constitutional to protect 
public health, are often discriminatory in their effects. Such discrimination often occurs 
because such statutes are enforced against homeless individuals who often have no access 
to public restrooms and are given no alternatives. Furthermore, there is an increasing trend 
in local governments to limit opening hours or close entirely public restrooms. Such 
decisions are contrary to the need to create an enabling environment so homeless 
individuals can realize their rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>57. The independent expert notes that in 2010 the Inter-Agency Council on 
Homelessness published the first federal plan to end homelessness. The plan includes 
constructive alternatives to the criminalization of homelessness.  
</p>
<p>58. Because evacuation of the bowels and bladder is a necessary biological function and 
because denial of opportunities to do so in a lawful and dignified manner can both 
compromise human dignity and cause suffering, such denial could, in some cases (e.g., 
where it results from deliberate actions or clear neglect) amount to cruel, inhumane or 
degrading treatment. Individuals are sometimes compelled to go to extraordinary lengths to 
prevent such suffering., The independent expert visited a community of homeless people in 
Sacramento, California, where she met a man who called himself the &#8220;sanitation 
technician&#8221; for the community. He engineered a sanitation system that consists of a seat 
with a two-layered plastic bag underneath. Every week Tim collects the bags full of human 
waste, which vary in weight between 130 to 230 pounds, and hauls them on his bicycle a 
few miles to a local public restroom. Once a toilet becomes available, he empties the 
content of the bags; packs the plastic bags with leftover residue inside a third plastic bag; 
ties it securely and disposes of them in the garbage; then sanitizes his hands with water and 
</p>
<p> <b>13 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.4 
 
</b></p>
<p>lemon. He said that even though this job is difficult, he does it for the community, 
especially the women.  
</p>
<p>59. The fact that private citizens are compelled to provide such services is an indication 
of failure by the State to meet its responsibilities to ensure the provision of the most 
fundamental of services. The remarkable contribution of this single human rights defender 
to assume such a burden in defence of human dignity and the human right to sanitation in 
no way reduces the responsibility of public authorities to correct this and similar situations 
elsewhere in the country.  
</p>
<p>60. The United States, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, must ensure that 
everyone, without discrimination, has physical and economic access, in all spheres of life, 
to sanitation which is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable, and which 
provides privacy and ensures dignity. An immediate, interim solution is to ensure access to 
restrooms facilities in public places, including during the night. The long-term solution to 
homelessness must be to ensure adequate housing. 
</p>
<p><b>  Indigenous people 
</b></p>
<p>61. There are roughly 2.7 million indigenous people, including American Indians, 
Alaska Natives and and Native Hawaiians, living in the United States. This number rises to 
4.9 million when those who identify themselves as American Indian in combination with 
another race are included.33 The vast majority of these belong to one of 565 recognized 
tribes. Approximately 50 per cent of American Indians live west of the Mississippi River 
and about 40 per cent live on reservations.34 Many more belong to federally unrecognized 
tribes. In California alone, there are over 300,000 American Indians who belong to 
federally unrecognized tribes.  
</p>
<p>62. Roughly 25 per cent of American Indians live below the poverty line.35 On some 
reservations, however, the number can be as high as 63 per cent.36  The United States 
Census Bureau also reports that educational attainment and life expectancy in American 
Indian communities continue to lag behind national averages.37
</p>
<p>63. American Indian communities lack access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation 
in disproportionate numbers. Thirteen per cent of American Indian households do not have 
access to safe water and/or wastewater disposal. In non-native households, this number is 
0.6 per cent.38 This disparity is particularly pronounced in Interior and Western Alaska 
communities and Navajo Nation. EPA estimates that 54,000 members of Navajo Nation 
lack access to a public water system. Around 30 per cent of Navajo households report 
having to haul water, which, in addition to being time-consuming and frequently 
unsanitary, costs them $550 more per year than Navajo households with a connection to the

<p>Tribal Utility Authority. Alaska natives frequently transport human waste in 5-gallon 
&#8220;honeybuckets&#8221; from their homes to local water sources for dumping.39
</p>
<p>64. The independent expert notes that in 2004 several federal agencies, including the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Agriculture and the Indian Health 
Service, formed the US Tribal Water Access Partnership. The Partnership aims to improve 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation for American Indian households by 50 per cent 
by 2015. It cautions, however, that improving access in these communities is particularly 
costly because many live in rural or isolated areas, and that they will not meet this goal 
without additional funding. Additionally, EPA runs an independent Tribal Water Plan that 
provides financial and logistical support for small drinking-water systems on tribal lands.40
</p>
<p>65. The independent expert welcomes the decision by the United States to support the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Besides being entitled to 
the rights to water and sanitation like everyone, indigenous people possess broader rights to 
water which emanate from their relationship with traditional lands and the natural resources 
thereof. The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms that indigenous 
peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources that they have traditionally 
owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired (art. 26.1); that indigenous peoples also 
have a right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their 
traditionally owned lands, territories, water and coastal seas (art. 25).  
</p>
<p>66. The independent expert visited the Winnemen Wintu in Redding, California, a tribe 
facing challenges in accessing safe drinking water and sanitation. This tribe is not 
recognized by the Federal Government. Winneman means &#8220;middle water people,&#8221; and 
water is core to their identity. The tribe inhabits ancestral territory from Mount Shasta down 
to the McCloud River watershed.  
</p>
<p>67. Tribal existence and identity do not depend on federal recognition or 
acknowledgment of the tribe. Federal recognition does not create tribes, but rather 
recognizes social/political entities that predate the United States. It creates a trust 
relationship between the tribe and the Federal Government, entitles tribes and their 
members to certain federal benefits, and activates a body of domestic law involving respect 
for tribal sovereignty. In practical terms, it allows tribes to make claims under federal law 
for example to develop gaming and other forms of economic development that take 
advantage of the sovereign status of the tribes. In addition, tribes can receive start-up funds 
and continuing federal support for their tribal governments, including law enforcement, 
courts and health services. Federal recognition introduces federal authority and also enables 
tribes to gain control over their affairs. 
</p>
<p>68. The Winnemen Wintu tribe currently occupies a 42-acre plot of land, on which a 
number of families live. This area is not within the boundaries of Redding, and thus is not 
connected to any public water system; it is not feasible to drill a private well. As such, the 
tribe must partner with the City of Redding or the county to obtain access to water. In these 
situations, individual households find alternative means of connecting to water sources and 
often rely on individual septic systems. As they are categorized as individual households 
(and not as a tribe), they are ineligible for virtually any financial assistance. The 
independent expert is concerned that unrecognized tribes fall into a protection gap, 
particularly with regard to the realization of the rights to water and sanitation. She is also 
concerned about the enjoyment of cultural rights of this tribe, particularly with regard to use

<p>or access to water for different traditional and cultural uses, such as fisheries and religious 
ceremonies such as the puberty ceremony.41  Federally recognized tribes also encounter 
difficulties in exercising their right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual 
relationship with their traditionally owned lands and water, as is the case for the Pit River 
tribe.42  
</p>
<p>69. The situation of Winnemen Wintu resembles that of other tribes. For example, the 
independent expert received information about concerns about the Acoma and Laguna 
Pueblos, Chickaloon Native Village, Navajo Nation and Oglala Lakota People, among 
others, relating to access to safe drinking water and sanitation due to mining activities. 
Mining activities are reportedly leading to contamination and depletion of surrounding 
groundwater and surface-water resources, not only affecting access to clean drinking water, 
but also threatening the wildlife and plants used as traditional food sources and vital to 
traditional cultural practices. Additionally, the absence of accountability for pollution and 
clean-up harms use by future generations. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Prioritization of personal and domestic uses 
</b></p>
<p>70. The latest available estimates from 2005 of water use in the United States indicated 
that approximately 1,552 billion litres (410 billion gallons) per day are withdrawn for eight 
categories of uses (public supply, domestic, irrigation, livestock, aquaculture, industrial, 
mining and thermoelectric power), of which freshwater withdrawals comprised 85 per cent 
of the total.43 Thermoelectric power (49 per cent) was the largest category of water use, 
followed by irrigation (31 per cent) and public supply (11 per cent). The remaining 
categories of water uses together were less than ten per cent of total water withdrawals, 
with domestic water use comprising just one per cent of the total. 44  Unfortunately, no 
complete nationwide mapping of available water &#8211; for surface and groundwater &#8211; exists in 
the United States. The independent expert, however, notes that the United States Geological 
Survey is currently undertaking such a mapping and she hopes it will continue to receive 
the necessary funding to finish such a crucial endeavour.  
</p>
<p>71. The average per capita residential water use is about 340 litres of water per day. For 
the most part, water treated to meet drinking water standards is used to flush toilets, water 
lawns, and wash dishes, clothes and cars. Nearly 14 percent of the water a typical 
homeowner pays for is never even used, mostly due to leaky pipes and faucets.45
</p>
<p>72. There are ever-increasing demands for water for energy, agriculture, industry and 
recreation, and the effects of climate change exacerbate these competing demands. While 
water for the realisation of the human right, represents a small percentage of total water use 
in the United States, the absence of clear legal standards to give priority to water for 
personal and domestic use threatens to undermine the realization of the human rights to 
water and sanitation for all. 
</p>
<p>73. An area of potential conflict between water for personal and domestic use and other 
uses is that of bottled water, Americans being the largest consumers of bottled water

<p>globally (33.4 billion litres). The landscape concerning the impact of water-bottling 
operations on local water sources, democratic governance of local water resources and how 
communities have responded to these impacts has many contours. A range of concerns has 
been expressed, including about water availability for future generations in a context of 
overextraction. Moreover, there are also transparency and accountability concerns about the 
lack of information on the process of obtaining permits to operate and the attendant rights 
acquired, and the marketing practices that promote bottled water as inherently safer than tap 
water.  
</p>
<p>74. Corporate Accountability International estimates that, in the past decade, there have 
been new water-bottling sites &#8211; proposed or operational &#8211; in at least 11 states and in more 
than two dozen communities. Most operations that have raised concerns deal with bottled 
spring water or groundwater. The independent expert received testimony from individuals 
in California, Maine and Michigan who expressed concern about the impact and process.  
</p>
<p>75. Regarding impacts, concerns have been voiced about future water availability and 
quality, where the conditions under which a company enters a community would prioritize 
the rights of the company over those of the community to meet personal and domestic 
needs. Communities have also pointed to problems related to environmental and 
sustainability issues.  
</p>
<p>76. Regarding process, complaints regarding inadequate information and consultation 
were heard. The independent expert expresses concern that in some cases communities 
have allegedly learned about proposed deals near completion point or ex-post facto. 
Everyone has a right to seek, receive and impart information concerning water issues;  
authorities must take decisions in a transparent and fair manner, involving local populations 
in the process.  
</p>
<p>77. Another key matter concerns accountability and decision-making mechanisms that 
communities can use or employ to address their grievances. For example, in Mecosta, 
Michigan, issues were raised with the closed-door proceedings between Nestl&#233; and public 
officials to issue a permit to access the watershed. Local grassroots organizations filed a 
lawsuit against Nestl&#233;, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement after several years of 
litigation, with Nestl&#233; agreeing to reduce water withdrawal rates and to an adjustment for 
seasonal environmental conditions.  
</p>
<p>78. As a consequence of opposition by some local communities to new water-bottling 
plants, in 2008, Nestl&#233; committed to working with stakeholders on a framework to better 
manage their siting process and make it more transparent. The framework includes 
principles and specific commitments to help guide its conduct in local communities during 
the process of identifying sites, and to ensure better communication, dialogue and 
engagement with local communities.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>79. Although the vast majority of the population in the United States enjoys regular 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation, the above analysis reveals categories of people 
who are excluded. Individuals who do not have regular access, who face obstacles in access 
or are otherwise deprived of the same level of access as the general population, also 
generally face discrimination in society more broadly. The people with whom the 
independent expert met and who are facing obstacles in their enjoyment of the rights to 
water and sanitation were disproportionately Black, Latino, American Indian, homeless or 
otherwise disadvantaged.  
</p>
<p> <b>17 </b></p>

</b></p>
<p>80. Human rights require a focus on the most vulnerable, those who are most often 
excluded from progress. Often, these people are the most difficult to reach, but this cannot 
be justification for neglecting them &#8211; on the contrary. Human rights require that there be 
universal access. Hence, merely addressing formal or direct discrimination will not ensure 
substantive equality. To eliminate discrimination in practice, special attention must be paid, 
and priority must be given, to groups of individuals who suffer historical or persistent 
prejudice, instead of merely comparing the formal treatment of individuals in similar 
situations.  
</p>
<p>81. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States 
is a party, states that all persons are equal before the law, and that the law shall prohibit any 
discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against 
discrimination on any prohibited ground (art. 26). 46  In this regard, the Human Rights 
Committee has noted that article 26 does not merely duplicate the guarantee already 
provided for in article 2 (general guarantee against non-discrimination in the exercise of 
Covenant rights) but provides, in itself, an autonomous right. It prohibits discrimination in 
law or in fact in any field regulated and protected by public authorities. Article 26 therefore 
is concerned with the obligations imposed on States parties with regard to their legislation 
and the application thereof. Moreover, the application of the principle of non-discrimination 
contained in article 26 is not limited to those rights that are provided for in the Covenant, 
but extends to economic, social and cultural rights.47
</p>
<p>82. In the view of the independent expert, the United States has achieved significant 
gains in eliminating formal or direct discrimination in law. Nevertheless, she remains 
concerned that several laws, policies and practices, while appearing neutral, 
disproportionately affect the enjoyment of human rights by certain groups, or are enforced 
without attention to specific circumstances. Moreover, the independent expert notes that 
there is a lack of data regarding who does and who does not have access to water and 
sanitation. Availability of accurate and disaggregated data is fundamental in the design of 
appropriate and efficient policies and programmes to address the many outstanding 
challenges related to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Official development assistance 
</b></p>
<p>83. International cooperation is a fundamental principle of human rights law. 48  
Countries that provide official development assistance (ODA) must ensure that it is 
consistent with human rights norms. 
</p>
<p>84. Both the development and the implementation of development cooperation policy 
should incorporate principles of non-discrimination, participation and accountability. This 
is reflected in, inter alia, the Accra Agenda for Action, which declares that &#8220;developing 
countries and donors will ensure that their respective development practices and 
programmes are designed and implemented in ways consistent with the agreed international 
commitments on &#8230; human rights&#8230;.&#8221;49
</p>
<p>  
 46  The United States is also a State party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, which prohibits racial discrimination.

<p>85. First and foremost, donors must not negatively affect the human rights situation in 
their partner countries.50 Moreover, they should ensure that their assistance facilitates the 
ability of each developing country to comply with its own human rights obligations.51 They 
should take positive action to work with partner governments to identify how development 
assistance can best support that government&#8217;s own efforts to realize human rights. Finally, 
donors have an obligation to ensure that third parties involved in the delivery and 
implementation of their development assistance (e.g. private contractors and technical 
advisers) do not interfere with the enjoyment and realization of human rights in partner 
countries.52
</p>
<p>86. The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act (2005) sets United States foreign 
appropriations policy for the water sector. It is the first instance where United States water 
policy reflects the normative content of the human right to water, which the independent 
expert welcomes. The Act establishes as the policy of the United States that foreign aid for 
water and sanitation will &#8220;further ensure affordability and equity in the provision of access 
to safe water and sanitation for the very poor.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>87. The independent expert is concerned about the implementation of the Act, 
particularly regarding criteria used to identify recipient countries, target poor communities, 
and decide on funding envelopes. The United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) acknowledged difficulties in reaching the poorest of the poor, and the need for 
greater policy guidance in this regard. She notes that USAID is in the process of developing 
a strategy and criteria to target countries and communities in greatest need. In this context, 
she draws attention to her recent report on the Millennium Development Goals (A/65/254) 
and calls on the Department of State/USAID to ensure that funding of water and sanitation 
projects reaches those most in need, and is guided by the normative content of the rights to 
water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>88. With the introduction of centralized water and sanitation systems in the 19th 
century, the United States achieved enormous public health gains through the 20th 
century, resulting in the vast majority of people living in the United States acquiring 
access to clean and safe drinking water and sanitation. Aging and deteriorating water 
and sanitation infrastructure forces the question of whether 19th and 20th century 
technology &#8211; appropriate at the time &#8211; will carry the country into the 21st century. 
Estimates indicate an annual $4 billion to $6 billion funding gap for infrastructure in 
the sector. The United States needs to develop a national water policy and plan of 
action guided by the normative content of the rights to water and sanitation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>89. More concerted efforts are required to ensure targeting of policies and 
programmes to reach the hidden and poorest segments of the population. Problems of 
discrimination in the United States water and sanitation services may intensify in the 
coming years with climate change and competing demands for ever scarce water 
resources. Ensuring the rights to water and sanitation for all requires a paradigm shift 
towards new designs and approaches that promote human rights, that are affordable 
and that create more value in terms of public health improvements, community 
development, and global ecosystem protection.

<p><b>90. A holistic, systemic approach is required, whereby the water sector is not 
viewed in isolation from the agricultural, chemical, industrial and energy sectors. 
From agricultural pollution to industrial waste to pollution stemming from urban 
runoff, the absence of political will inevitably means poor planning and scarce 
funding, and ultimately leads to pollution that jeopardizes water quality and increases 
costs. Accordingly, a stronger regulatory system should be put in place to prevent 
pollution of surface and groundwater, and to ensure affordability. Already 
communities such Edmonston, Maryland, are undertaking low-cost and innovative 
initiatives (&#8220;green streets&#8221;) to address challenges in the area of water and sanitation. 
The independent expert welcomes these and hopes they can be further replicated 
across the country. 
</b></p>
<p><b>91. Such a paradigm shift for the water and sanitation sector entails policy 
changes, including support for research, pilot projects and incentives, changes in 
engineering practices, such as integrated water management (e.g. wastewater, storm 
water, recycled water) and decentralized systems, and community education and 
empowerment. 
</b></p>
<p><b>92. Placing the human rights to water and sanitation at the centre of policy 
formulation for both domestic and international aid policies is crucial to ensure that 
all people in the United States, as well as those benefiting from its development 
assistance, have access to affordable, accessible, acceptable and safe water and 
sanitation in sufficient amounts to protect human health and human dignity. In this 
regard, the independent expert offers the following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the Optional Protocol thereto, as well as the other core international 
human rights treaties it has not ratified thus far. To this end, the Government should 
reconvene the Interagency Working Group on Human Rights (Executive Order 
13107); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Adopt a comprehensive federal law on water and sanitation 
guaranteeing the rights to safe water and sanitation without discrimination and 
clearly delineating the responsibilities of public officials at the federal, state and local 
levels. Such a law must prioritize water for personal and domestic use and set 
affordability standards, among others. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Formulate a national water and sanitation policy and plan of action, 
guided by the normative content of the rights to water and sanitation, that devote 
priority attention to improving aging infrastructure, as well as innovative designs and 
approaches that promote human rights, are affordable and create more value in terms 
of public health improvements, community development and sustainability; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure proper regulation and monitoring of the water quality of private 
drinking water systems; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Exemptions under the Safe Drinking Water Act, including for the oil and 
gas industry,  must be re-assessed and repealed if resulting in a negative impact on the 
enjoyment of the right to water; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Strengthen the regulatory system on water and sanitation to prevent 
upstream pollution (agricultural, industrial, chemical, including pharmaceutical, 
stormwater run-offs, etc.) as well as ensure adequate regulation of the bottled water 
industry; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Engage in public education and information campaigns about water 
quality in the languages spoken by the community to assure people of the safety of 
drinking tap water; 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.4 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Evaluate the extent to which people living in poverty face challenges in 
paying for water and sanitation services, and adopt, at the federal level, a national 
minimum standard on affordability of water and sanitation, as well as due process 
guarantees in relation to disconnections; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Ensure that all municipalities provide access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation to homeless people, including through ensuring the opening and regular 
maintenance and upkeep of public restrooms, as well as availability of public water 
fountains, including during the night; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Engage in dialogue with homeless communities to assist these individuals 
to find more secure housing solutions, including stable access to adequate water and 
sanitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Enact the necessary legal action to change the status of unrecognized and 
terminated tribes to enable them to realize their rights to water and sanitation, as well 
as express religious and cultural rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Ensure adequate consultation and prior and informed consent of 
indigenous communities regarding activities affecting their access to water; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Guide the ODA by human rights principles, including the rights to water 
and sanitation, and devote larger proportion of aid to ensuring the human rights to 
water and sanitation to those who do not yet have access. Ensure that affected 
communities have access to information and opportunities to participate in the 
formulation, implementation and evaluation of projects.
