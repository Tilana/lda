<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of Guatemala, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances visited the country from 19 to 21 September 2006.  The Working 
Group was represented by its Chairman-Rapporteur, Santiago Corcuera, and Working Group 
member Darko G&#246;ttlicher.  The purpose of the visit was to discuss the efforts to address past 
disappearances in Guatemala in the light of international human rights standards, especially the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, adopted by 
General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992.  The mission was requested as part 
of a regional visit planned to four Central American countries with significant numbers of cases 
which have been outstanding for many years.  The Working Group is grateful to the Government 
of Guatemala for its prompt positive response to the request. 
</p>
<p> The delegation held meetings with the Vice-President of the Republic, the President of 
the Supreme Court of Justice, the President of the Constitutional Court, the General Attorney of 
the Nation, the President of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights (Comisi&#243;n 
Presidencial Coordinadora de la Pol&#237;tica del Ejecutivo en Materia de Derechos Humanos, 
COPREDEH), who at the same time is the President of the Commission of the executive branch 
for the search of persons disappeared during the internal armed conflict, the Vice Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, the Human Rights Ombudsman, the President of the Human Rights Commission 
of the Congress of the Republic, the Director of the Institute for Criminal Public Defense, the 
Director of the National Reparations Programme and representatives of many non-governmental 
human rights organizations, relatives of the disappeared, the International Committee of the 
Red Cross and representatives of the international community in Guatemala.  At the end of the 
visit, the delegation held a press conference. 
</p>
<p> The present report provides a general description of the constitutional and legal 
provisions regarding enforced disappearances in Guatemala, including the numerous 
international human rights treaties to which Guatemala is a party.  It analyses the provisions of 
the Criminal Code which define the crime of enforced disappearance, in the light of the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (the &#8220;Declaration&#8221;). 
</p>
<p> The report then reviews the institutional steps to address disappearances and the 
measures adopted by Guatemala to guarantee victims&#8217; rights under the Declaration. 
</p>
<p> With respect to the right to justice and with the aim of ending impunity, the report refers 
to a broad gap between the advanced legal framework and expressions of political will to bring 
to justice cases of disappearances, versus the low level of or lack of practical results.  Reports 
received by the Working Group confirm that, in fact, up to the date of this report, there has not 
been one person convicted for the commission of the crime of enforced disappearance.  There are 
only two cases which have made their way to the stage of the filing of a criminal accusation, and 
only one of those has gone to trial. 
</p>
<p> In connection with the right to know the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons, 
the Working Group welcomes the establishment by the executive branch of a Commission for </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>the Search for Persons Disappeared during the Internal Armed Conflict and that a parallel 
preparatory commission is in place to work on the establishment of an equivalent body through 
an act of legislation.  In the meantime, the Working Group hopes that the establishment of the 
Search Commission of the executive branch will render the best results within its power to 
clarify the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons that are before the Working Group, as 
well as any others. 
</p>
<p> The report also refers to the National Reparations Programme and the National Plan 
(2006-2016) for the Search for Persons Disappeared during the Internal Armed Conflict, 
proposed by the Search Committee, which are in line with the Declaration.  However, in the 
reports the Working Group endeavoured to explain that those principles should be applied in 
practice in a complete manner, and not be restricted to the delivery of money, as some sources 
reported occurs in the majority of cases. 
 Based on the findings of the Working Group, the report contains a number of matters of 
concern and several recommendations that the Working Group respectfully submits for the 
consideration of the Guatemalan State and for implementation. 
</p>
<p> Among the recommendations contained in this report, the Working Group highlights the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A law to create an independent National Commission for the Search for Victims of 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, along the lines of a draft law to be prepared 
by the High-Level Preparatory Commission for Promoting Proposed Legislation for 
the Creation of the National Commission for the Search for Victims of Forced or 
Involuntary Disappearance, should be adopted; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Courts should apply international standards in their decisions regarding cases of 
enforced disappearances, including the non-applicability of the statute of limitations, 
the continuing nature of the crime and the fact that civilian courts should be the only 
competent courts to hear enforced disappearances cases; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The 10 programmes of the National Plan (2006-2016) for the Search for Persons 
Disappeared during the Internal Armed Conflict proposed by the Search Committee 
should be put into practice without further delay, within an atmosphere of mutual 
cooperation amongst all relevant actors; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Additionally, necessary resources should be supplied for the realization of activities 
of those institutions and actors involved in the process of investigation and 
punishment of enforced disappearances; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Habeas corpus procedures that have been suspended in contradiction to the 
Declaration should be reopened and investigations should be effortlessly continued 
in order to endeavour to clarify past cases of enforced disappearances; </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Effective measures should be taken to prevent the repetition of acts of intimidation 
and other forms of attacks on witnesses, and human rights defenders involved in the 
investigation of cases of enforced disappearance, so that the above-mentioned actors 
are able to carry out their functions without coercion of any kind; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Working Group strongly recommends the comprehensive application of the 
National Reparations Programme, which should not be limited to the payment of 
monetary compensation; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Working Group delegation hereby reiterates its request that the Government of 
Guatemala and others with relevant information provide it to the Working Group for 
the clarification of the more than 2,000 remaining cases of disappeared persons still 
pending with it. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Guatemala, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances visited the country from 19 to 21 September 2006.  The Working 
Group was represented by its Chairman-Rapporteur, Santiago Corcuera, and Working Group 
member Darko G&#246;ttlicher.  In 1987, the Working Group undertook a visit to the country.  The 
report on that mission (E/CN.4/1988/19/Add.1) included a recommendation that efforts should 
be made to improve the functioning of habeas corpus procedures, to protect the life of witnesses, 
as well as of individuals and members of organizations reporting cases, and to adopt effective 
measures to prevent and clarify disappearances.  The purpose of the current visit was to discuss 
the efforts to address past disappearances in Guatemala in the light of international human rights 
standards, especially the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, adopted by General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992.  The 
mission was requested as part of a regional visit planned to four Central American countries with 
significant numbers of cases which have been outstanding for many years.  The Working Group 
is grateful to the Government of Guatemala for its prompt positive response to the request. 
</p>
<p>2. The delegation held meetings with the Vice-President of the Republic, the President of 
the Supreme Court of Justice, the President of the Constitutional Court, the General Attorney of 
the Nation, the President of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights (COPREDEH), who 
at the same time is the President of the Commission of the executive branch for the search of 
persons disappeared during the internal armed conflict, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, the 
Human Rights Ombudsman, the President of the Human Rights Commission of the Congress of 
the Republic, the Director of the Institute for Criminal Public Defense, the Director of the 
National Reparations Programme and representatives of many non-governmental human rights 
organizations, relatives of the disappeared, the International Committee of the Red Cross and 
representatives of the international community in Guatemala.  At the end of the visit, the 
delegation held a press conference. 
</p>
<p>3. The delegation expressed its gratitude and recognition of the full cooperation of the 
Guatemalan authorities in ensuring that all meetings requested were held, and that all discussions 
took place in an open and constructive manner.  The delegation expressed its interest that the 
Government of Guatemala would provide information towards the clarification of cases.  The 
delegation expresses also its deep appreciation for the assistance and support provided by the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Purpose of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>4. Following the invitation of the Government of Guatemala, the Working Group decided to 
conduct a mission to the country from 19 to 21 September 2006.  The purpose of the mission was 
to support processes being put forward by the present administration in order to clarify past cases 
of disappearances which occurred in the context of the internal armed conflict between 1979 
and 1986.  According to the 1999 report of the Commission for Historical Clarification, during 
that period of time, there might have been as many as 45,000 victims of enforced 
disappearances. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group only received 3,152 cases of forced disappearances, of which 2,896 
are still pending clarification with respect to the whereabouts or the fate of the victims.  
Between 1996 and 2005, the Working Group only received one new case of enforced 
disappearance, which shows the progress achieved following the Agreement on a Firm and 
Lasting Peace of 1996, which formally concluded the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>6. The members of the Working Group who participated in this mission wish to express 
their deep gratitude for the great support given by the Government of Guatemala to ensure the 
success of this mission.  It should be mentioned that the Working Group intended to include this 
mission to Guatemala in a regional visit to Central America at the beginning of 2007 to countries 
with large numbers of outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p>7. The members of the Working Group who participated in this mission stressed during the 
mission the humanitarian character of their mandate, with the main objective of assisting the 
families of disappeared persons in determining the fate or whereabouts of their relatives.  
Furthermore, the Working Group members highlighted that, in addition to its central mandate, 
they are entrusted to monitor States&#8217; compliance with their obligations deriving from the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and to provide to 
Governments assistance in its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>8. Guatemala is situated in the north of Central America.  The total area is 108,890 sq. km 
and the population is 14,655,189.  According to the United Nations Human Development Index, 
Guatemala ranks near the bottom among the countries that have an intermediate development 
level.  The wealth of the country is reportedly distributed very unequally. 
</p>
<p>9. The conflict from which disappearances arose in Guatemala began in 1960 when a small 
group of young army officers rebelled against the military Government, accusing it of 
corruption.  The rebellion was put down, and the young officers fled to the mountains of eastern 
Guatemala where they began a guerrilla war.  These guerrillas soon turned into a Marxist 
movement whose objective was to overthrow the Government and take power.  It is important to 
highlight that the Guatemalan armed conflict did not originate as a result of inter-ethnic conflict.  
It was a conflict that occurred in the framework of the Cold War.  The Mayan population was 
especially affected by harsh treatment of the army. 
</p>
<p>10. Disappearances started to occur in the mid-1960s, in areas where there was organized 
armed opposition to the Government, but then spread to all parts of the country, affecting all 
segments of the population. 
</p>
<p>11. The internal conflict in Guatemala came to an end on 29 December 1996 when the 
Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) 
signed the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace.  The agreement brought into effect a 
number of previous agreements negotiated over a period of six years under United Nations 
auspices. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>12. Separate agreements signed in 1995 and 1996 referred to the rights of Guatemala&#8217;s 
majority indigenous population; socio-economic and land issues; demilitarization; constitutional 
reform; the legalization of the URNG; a partial amnesty for crimes committed during the 
conflict; a formal ceasefire; and a timetable for implementing the peace commitments.  In 
January 1997 a Consultative Group of international donor countries and financing institutions 
was established, principally the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the 
Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE), the United States of America, the 
European Union, Spain and Germany. 
</p>
<p>13. Early successes of the peace process included the demobilization of the guerrillas - whose 
numbers are estimated to have peaked at around 4,000 in 1978-1980 - and the reduction in size 
of the armed forces by one third to 31,000.  However, implementation in other areas was slow 
and progress was undermined by the rejection of a package of 47 constitutional reforms (13 of 
which corresponded to the Peace Agreements in the Agreement on Constitutional Reforms) that 
was put to a referendum in May 1999. 
</p>
<p>14. The United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), set up to monitor 
human rights conditions and the implementation of the peace accords, closed in December 2004 
after 10 years in Guatemala.  Its human rights verification functions were transferred to the 
Human Rights Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, but financial constraints have reportedly complicated these 
tasks. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Political context 
</b></p>
<p>15. Guatemala is a constitutional democratic republic.  The executive consists of a 
president and vice-president elected by universal suffrage.  Congress is unicameral, comprising 
158 deputies.  The highest judicial authority is the Supreme Court, but the Constitutional Court 
takes precedence in issues of constitutionality.  Oscar Berger, the current President, was elected 
in December 2003.  He has brought the Peace Accords back to the government agenda.  On 
25 February 2004, President Berger held a ceremony at the National Palace at which he 
symbolically &#8220;relaunched&#8221; the peace accords as Guatemala&#8217;s national agenda, pledging to 
reinvigorate implementation with the support of a new National Peace Accords Commission 
composed of representatives of the three branches of State, political party delegates and 
respected civic leaders.  The President sent to Congress a draft Law on the Peace Agreements, 
which was adopted, and consequently the Agreements became law. 
</p>
<p>16. The subject of enforced disappearances in Guatemala was included in the Comprehensive 
Agreement on Human Rights signed on 29 March 1994, under Commitment III, Commitment 
against Impunity, in which the State undertook to promote the legal amendments to the Criminal 
Code to describe enforced disappearance as a crime of particular gravity.  The Government 
likewise undertook to support recognition in the international community of the definition of 
systematic enforced disappearances as a crime against humanity. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>III. CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
ON DISAPPEARANCES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Guatemalan Constitution contains a complete catalogue of human rights.  Although, 
like most constitutions, it does not make a specific reference to the act of enforced 
disappearance, it does protect all of the basic rights that are violated by the commission of this 
offence.  These rights are enumerated in the Declaration, where it is stated that &#8220;any act of 
enforced disappearance places the persons subjected thereto outside the protection of the law 
and &#8230; constitutes a violation of &#8230; inter alia, the right to recognition as a person before the law, 
the right to liberty and security of the person and the right not to be subjected to torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  It also violates or constitutes a grave 
threat to the right to life&#8221; (art. 1, para. 2). 
</p>
<p>18. Indeed, the Guatemalan Constitution protects persons from arbitrary detention, provides 
for the right to be informed of the causes of a detention and of the rights assisting the detained 
person, the right to be detained in public and official places of detention, with which clandestine 
places of detention are forbidden by the Constitution.  The Constitution also provides for basic 
safeguards in cases of detention or any form of deprivation of liberty or threat thereof, including 
the guarantee of habeas corpus or personal exhibition before the courts.  The Constitution 
provides that any officer who orders the hiding of a detainee or refuses to present him to a court 
of law or that in any manner evade this guarantee, shall be responsible for the crime of abduction 
and shall be sanctioned according to the law.  In the event that the person is not found, the courts 
are mandated by the Constitution to order an immediate investigation until there is complete 
clarification of the location of the person.  Additionally, the Constitution sets out the basic rights 
to adequate defence, presumption of innocence and public legal proceedings.  Furthermore, the 
Constitution provides that prisoners must be treated as human beings, and therefore must not be 
subject to physical or moral torture or other cruel treatment or other actions contrary to human 
dignity.  Moreover, the Constitution protects the right to life, whereby arbitrary and extrajudicial 
executions are contrary to the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>19. The above provisions ensure constitutional protection of persons against enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>20. The Constitution also enshrines the legal guarantee of <i>amparo</i>, which can be initiated 
against any threat of violation of human rights or to restore the enjoyment of the same, in case 
the violation has already occurred. 
</p>
<p>21. The Constitution stipulates the establishment of a commission on human rights of the 
Congress, and the institution of the ombudsman for human rights as a commissioner of 
Congress, which secures its autonomy by the Constitution of Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International human rights treaties 
</b></p>
<p>22. Guatemala has assumed a range of obligations as a State party to, or through ratification 
of, the major international human rights instruments, notably those contained in the International </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the first Optional Protocol to that Covenant, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and its two Optional Protocols.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Guatemala has also signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.  Guatemala is also a party 
to a number of international labour conventions.<b>2</b>  Guatemala has also ratified the International 
Labour Organization&#8217;s Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169). 
</p>
<p>24. However, Guatemala has yet to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court, which renders enforced disappearances a crime against humanity, when committed as part 
of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population and with knowledge 
of the attack. 
</p>
<p>25. At the regional level, Guatemala is party to the American Convention on Human Rights 
(Pact of San Jos&#233;), the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the 
area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Protocol of San Salvador), the Inter-American 
Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture, and the Inter-American Convention on the 
Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women. 
</p>
<p>26. It should be underlined that Guatemala ratified the Inter-American Convention on the 
Forced Disappearance of Persons which coincides in all essential concepts with the provisions of 
the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>27. The fact that the Constitution establishes &#8220;the general principle that international treaties 
and conventions on human rights accepted and ratified by Guatemala have pre-eminence over 
domestic law&#8221; places the Guatemalan Constitution in a leading progressive position among 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Note that Guatemala has not lodged any reservation to these instruments.  However, 
</p>
<p>Guatemala has not made the declarations under article 14 of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and article 22 of the Convention against 
Torture recognizing the competence of the respective treaty-monitoring bodies to receive and 
consider communications from individuals or groups. 
<b>2
</b>  Including the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), the Abolition of Forced Labour 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1957 (No. 105), the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) and the Worst 
Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), as well as the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize 
Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 
1948 (No. 98). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>constitutions.  It should be noted, however, that the Constitutional Court has stated that there can 
be no change to the Constitution arising from provisions of an international human rights treaty 
if it results in an effective amendment to the Constitution, due to the constitutional guarantee of 
the permanence and superiority of the Constitution.  The decision provides that the Constitution 
may only be amended by a constitutional assembly or popular referendum (<i>Gaceta</i> No. 18, 
dossier No. 280-90, p. 99, sentence 19-10-90). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Enforced disappearance in the Criminal Code 
</b></p>
<p>28. On 14 July 1995, Legislative Decree 48-1995 was enacted, whereby article 201 ter was 
added to the Criminal Code, thereby criminalizing the conduct of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>29. In general terms, the definition of enforced disappearance coincides with the notion of 
this crime provided for by the Declaration.  However, there are some elements that differ, and 
this should be highlighted. 
</p>
<p>30. The main aspect of the definition of enforced disappearance contained in the Criminal 
Code that is not in accordance with the Declaration is that the Criminal Code includes the 
possibility of acts being characterized as a disappearance even when committed by non-State 
actors (members of organized groups with terrorist, insurgent, subversive or any other criminal 
aim, when they commit kidnapping or abduction as members or collaborators of these groups) 
without the support, consent or acquiescence of the State. 
</p>
<p>31. The definition in the preamble of the Declaration, however, refers only to acts perpetrated 
&#8220;by officials of different branches or levels of Government, or by organized groups or private 
individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of 
the Government&#8221;.  The definition in the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of 
Persons is similar. 
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group has previously noted that, although the inclusion of non-State actors 
acting without the support or consent of the Government may appear to advance the law, in the 
sense that it covers a wider area than the Declaration (i.e., abductions), the position and mandate 
of the Working Group is that enforced disappearance is restricted to a &#8220;State crime&#8221;.  Some may 
consider that in other areas of human rights, the inclusion of non-State actors as perpetrators 
could offer more protection to the victims (i.e. in the case of discrimination or labour or 
environmental human rights). 
</p>
<p>33. The penalty provided for in the Criminal Code of 25 to 40 years of imprisonment seems 
concurrent with the Declaration, which provides that &#8220;all acts of enforced disappearance shall be 
offences under criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties which shall take into account 
their extreme seriousness&#8221; (art. 4, para. 1). 
</p>
<p>34. However, it should be noted that the Declaration has &#8220;regard&#8221; to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The fact that the Criminal Code provides that the death 
penalty shall be imposed in cases &#8220;where at the time of the crime or during the crime, the victim </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>is seriously or very seriously injured, or suffers psychological trauma, or permanent 
psychological damage, or dies&#8221; is excessive.  The position adopted by the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its second Protocol are clearly oriented to the 
progressive abolition of the death penalty in all cases.  Thus, the application of the death penalty, 
even for those found guilty of the extremely serious crime of enforced disappearance, is 
excessive. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. INSTITUTIONAL STEPS TO ADDRESS DISAPPEARANCES AND 
 MEASURES TO GUARANTEE VICTIMS&#8217; RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The right to justice and to end impunity 
</b>35. The Declaration provides that &#8220;all States should take any lawful and appropriate action 
available to them to bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for an act of enforced 
disappearance, which are found to be within their jurisdiction or under their control&#8221; (art. 14). 
36. The Criminal Code is in line with the Declaration with respect to the provision that 
enforced disappearance is a crime of a continuing nature.  It should also be stressed that, under 
article 8 of the Law of National Reconciliation of 27 December 1996, extinction of criminal 
responsibility was not given to the crime of enforced disappearance, which is in accordance with 
article 18 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>37. The Guatemalan legal framework establishes a sophisticated set of rules for establishing 
its prosecution and justice systems and institutions. 
</p><p>38. Chapter VI of the Constitution deals with the institutions for Public Prosecution 
Institution (Ministerio P&#250;blico) and the General Attorney of the Nation (Procuradur&#237;a General de 
la Naci&#243;n). 
</p>
<p>39. The Public Prosecution Institution is under the authority of the General Prosecutor 
(Fiscal General de la Rep&#250;blica) and has the power to initiate public criminal proceedings.  
The General Prosecutor is appointed by the President of the Republic, out of a group of 
six candidates proposed by a commission made up of the President of the Supreme Court of 
Justice, the deans of the law schools of the universities of the country, the President of the Board 
of Directors of the Bar Association, and the President of the Honour Tribunal of that bar 
association. 
</p>
<p>40. Investigating and fighting criminal offences is the responsibility of the National Civilian 
Police, created in 1997 by the Law of the National Civilian Police.  In accordance with this law, 
the National Civilian Police is not under the command of the General Prosecutor, but under the 
President of the Republic through the Ministry of the Interior.  The National Civilian Police is 
also in charge of the prevention of crime and the protection of the population in general. 
</p>
<p>41. Those accused of criminal offences are brought by the Public Prosecution Institution 
before the Judicial Body (Organismo Judicial) for trial and judgement. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>42. The Criminal Procedure Code was amended in 1994 and is seen as one of the major 
reforms that predate the Peace Accords.  It did away with the inquisitorial system and introduced 
to Guatemala the common-law adversarial system.  It provides for the presumption of innocence, 
the right to be present at trial, the right to counsel, plea bargaining, and the possibility of release 
on bail. 
</p>
<p>43. The reform also changed the roles of important actors, placing control over investigation 
and prosecution of cases in the hands of prosecutors.  The Public Prosecution Institution, as 
mentioned above, may initiate criminal proceedings on its own volition or in response to a 
complaint.  The Code also stipulates the responsibilities of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, 
including the direction of criminal investigation in coordination with the National Civilian 
Police, the gathering of evidence at the pretrial stage, and the presentation of its findings and 
petitions to the judge. 
</p><p>44. The provisions relating to an independent judiciary and to the general administration of 
justice are detailed, and guarantee its independence, from the budgetary and functional point of 
view. 
</p>
<p>45. The judiciary is composed of a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court, appellate courts, 
lower courts and courts of special jurisdiction. 
</p><p>46. The above legal configuration would, in principle, appear to be synchronized with the 
Declaration where it provides that &#8220;each State shall ensure that the competent authority shall 
have the necessary powers and resources to conduct the investigation effectively, including 
powers to compel attendance of witnesses and production of relevant documents and to make 
immediate on-site visits&#8221; (art. 13, para. 2). 
</p>
<p>47. The Declaration refers not only to &#8220;powers&#8221;, which are sufficiently granted to the 
authorities under Guatemalan law, but also to &#8220;resources&#8221; to conduct the investigation 
effectively.  During the various meetings held by the Working Group with both official and civil 
society players, a constant cause of deep concern was expressed by all parties regarding the lack 
of personnel and material resources to address the cases of disappearances which occurred 
during the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>48. The General Prosecutor and his team explained that a significant obstacle to the success 
of the Public Prosecution Institution&#8217;s role to effectively accuse and charge presumed criminals 
in general, including those presumably responsible for disappearances, is the fact that the Public 
Prosecution Institution has no direct control over the police officials who are empowered to 
conduct criminal investigations and arrests (under the command of the Ministry of the Interior).  
The Working Group was informed that the office of the General Prosecutor is, in fact, 
establishing a body of investigators that does not belong to the National Civil Police, although 
this is not strictly under its area of authority.  Moreover, the General Prosecutor himself and all 
other players interviewed by the Working Group admitted that the investigatory police agents 
and the attorneys of the Public Prosecution Institution in most of the rural and suburban areas of 
the country, and even those working in the cities, lack the minimum technical training needed to 
conduct their functions effectively.  On top of the lack of technical capabilities, all actors </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>interviewed expressed that the number of police agents and attorneys of the Public Prosecution 
Institution is absolutely insufficient to cope with the immense number of cases that have to be 
dealt with by them and that are occurring at the present, not considering the massive number of 
crimes that occurred during the internal armed conflict.  This area of concern was also expressed 
by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice.  She indicated that the judiciary is also 
incapable of coping with the number of cases before it, as a result of insufficient training of the 
judges and the small number of courts and limited legal staff. 
</p><p>49. Other sources expressed great concern about the lack of sufficient and effective 
guarantees of independence of the bodies in charge of conducting investigations of crimes 
perpetrated by State officials, including disappearances.  It was indicated that investigations were 
not carried out directly by the office of the General Prosecutor, but by the National Civilian 
Police, which, despite the fact that the law provides that they should not be related to any 
political activity (article 2 of the Law of the National Civil Police), carries out its activities under 
the direct command of a Director General who is &#8220;under the immediate and exclusive authority 
of the Minister of the Interior&#8221; (article 3 of the Law of the National Civil Police).  It would seem 
advisable that officials charged with carrying out investigations leading to the arrest of those 
responsible for crimes committed by State agents be chosen directly by the legislative authority 
and that they have budgetary and managerial independence similar to that enjoyed by the 
Defensor del Pueblo. 
</p>
<p>50. All the above factors result in a broad gap between an advanced legal framework and 
expressions of political will to bring to justice cases of disappearances, as against practical 
results.  Reports received by the Working Group affirm that, in fact, up to the date of this report, 
there has not been a single person arrested or tried for the commission of the crime of enforced 
disappearance.  There are only two cases which have made their way up to the stage of 
formulating an accusation, and one of them is in the arguments stage of the trial. 
</p>
<p>51. In this regard, and as a result of the continuing nature of the crime of enforced 
disappearance, it should be reiterated that the persons responsible for this crime can and must be 
subject to legal proceedings and sanctions even if the law creating the crime was adopted after 
the initial act causing the disappearance, or if after the enactment of the law the whereabouts or 
fate of the victim is still unknown.  During the Working Group&#8217;s meeting with the President of 
the Constitutional Court, the Working Group addressed this important issue, and was made 
aware that the Constitutional Court was due to decide on this key legal interpretation in the 
case known as <i>Choatulum</i>, regarding the enforced disappearance of six persons between 1982 
and 1984 in the village of Chimaltenango. 
</p>
<p>52. Pursuant to the Declaration, &#8220;persons who have or are alleged to have committed 
[enforced disappearances] shall not benefit from any special amnesty law or similar measures 
that might have the effect of exempting them from any criminal proceedings or sanction&#8221;.  As 
mentioned above, the Working Group is aware of the fact that the peace accords and the Law of 
National Reconciliation exclude the possibility of amnesties to persons having committed crimes 
against humanity, including enforced disappearances that occurred during the internal armed 
conflict.  However, certain similar measures are contrary to the Declaration even if not contained 
in a law, if such situations in fact lead to impunity.  That is to say, impunity could be understood </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>as a &#8220;de facto amnesty&#8221;, contrary to the Declaration.  Therefore, the situation above (regarding 
lack of resources, lack of sufficient investigators, and police agents without appropriate 
professional training and the perceived lack of will of some actors, to investigate, arrest, bring 
to justice and punish persons responsible for gross violations of human rights, including 
disappearances) gives rise to an atmosphere of impunity, which is unacceptable in the light of 
the Declaration.  The Working Group is very concerned by reports referring to the fact that 
impunity leads to a situation where perpetrators of gross violations of human rights, including 
disappearances, committed during the armed conflict, live close to the victims of such violations.  
This leads to an atmosphere of fear and community distrust. 
</p>
<p>53. An atmosphere of impunity is also contrary to the appropriate measures that States must 
adopt in order to prevent acts of enforced disappearance, as provided for in article 3 of the 
Declaration, and therefore to comply with the guarantee of &#8220;no repetition&#8221;.  The Human Rights 
Ombudsman delivered to the Working Group a report where it is indicated that the impunity that 
has prevailed with respect to the phenomenon of enforced disappearance during the internal 
armed conflict, is probably one of the causes that this phenomenon has reappeared recently and 
is in its initial phase; so that the efforts that governmental authorities may put into practice to 
combat these practices will be decisive to avoid that they become common practice.  Their report 
asserts that the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman received 9 reports of disappearances in 
2004 and 23 reports of the same crime in 2005.  During the mission which is the subject matter 
of this report, the Working Group received five new reports of cases of enforced disappearances 
which purportedly occurred in recent years.  The Working Group will analyse these cases in 
accordance with its methods of work to check whether they comply with admissibility 
requirements and, if so, transmit them to Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>54. One essential element of the right to justice is the right of the complainant, counsel, 
witnesses and those conducting the investigation of cases of enforced disappearances, to be 
protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal, as provided under article 13 of the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group received a detailed report prepared by several human rights 
organizations, which refers to cases of attacks, acts of intimidation, threats and reprisals to 
several organizations and individuals, which include at least five organizations working on the 
filing of legal actions and investigation of cases of enforced disappearances, including activities 
of exhumations, searches for disappeared persons, and related actions.  The Working Group was 
also informed by the Human Rights Ombudsman of acts of such a nature against regional and 
central agencies of his Office, in connection with cases related to enforced disappearances, 
including the protection of documentation of the archives of the National Police, with which this 
report deals below. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group wishes to express its deep concern regarding such acts of 
intimidation and reprisal since, as mentioned above, they are contrary to the Declaration.  
Therefore, they should be prevented and punished in accordance with the Declaration in order to 
reduce the present atmosphere of impunity which was noted by the persons involved in the 
protection and promotion of human rights who were interviewed by the Working Group. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>57. In this connection, the Working Group welcomes the fact that, in April 2005, the Office 
of the General Prosecutor created a Human Rights Office to investigate crimes committed by 
members of illegal clandestine groups and attacks against human rights defenders.  The Office 
merged and superseded three <i>fiscal&#237;as especiales</i>, or Special Offices, for human rights defenders, 
journalists and trade unionists, and administrators of justice.  The Working Group was informed 
by the General Prosecutor that this new branch within his office was aimed at reducing attacks 
on human rights defenders, bringing those responsible to justice and investigating past and 
present human rights violations.  The Working Group respectfully expressed to the Fiscal 
General, based on the above-mentioned reports of intimidation and attacks on human rights 
defenders, that this recently created office should measure progress not simply by its 
establishment, but by delivering concrete results. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Right to know the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons 
</b></p>
<p>58. Article 9 of the Declaration provides that &#8220;the right to a prompt and effective judicial 
remedy as a means of determining the whereabouts or state of health of persons deprived of their 
liberty and/or identifying the authority ordering or carrying out the deprivation of liberty is 
required to prevent enforced disappearances under all circumstances, including those referred to 
in article 7&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>59. Furthermore, article 13 of the Declaration states that &#8220;each State shall ensure that any 
person having knowledge or a legitimate interest who alleges that a person has been subjected to 
enforced disappearance has the right to complain to a competent and independent State authority 
and to have that complaint promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated by that authority.  
Whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that an enforced disappearance has been 
committed, the State shall promptly refer the matter to that authority for such an investigation, 
even if there has been no formal complaint.  No measure shall be taken to curtail or impede the 
investigation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>60. The Guatemalan legal framework contemplates rights and remedies that are concurrent 
with the above provisions of the Declaration.  Specifically, as mentioned before in this report, 
the Constitution provides for basic safeguards such as the guarantee of habeas corpus or personal 
presence before the courts.  The Constitution provides that any officer who orders the hiding of a 
detainee or refuses to present him to a court of law or in any manner evades this guarantee, shall 
be responsible for the crime of abduction and sanctioned according to the law.  In the event that 
the person is not found, the courts are mandated by the Constitution to order the immediate 
investigation until its total clarification. 
</p>
<p>61. However, this is another area where legal provisions and actual results are very distinct.  
The Working Group was informed that thousands of habeas corpus applications had been 
initiated with the competent authorities before and after the end of the internal armed conflict, 
which were all declared null and void (<i>sin lugar</i>), and were sent to the archives. 
</p>
<p>62. Before the amendment of the Criminal Procedural Code in 1994, investigations were 
carried out by the criminal courts.  Such functions were assigned to the Public Prosecution 
Institution, as mentioned above.  As a result of that, the Working Group was informed that the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>relevant documentation regarding all habeas corpus petitions initiated before 1994 were 
transferred en masse to the Public Prosecution Institution.  However, according to the Human 
Rights Ombudsman, there is no information available in order to learn the status of such 
proceedings and the identity of the agents of the Public Prosecution Institution in charge of their 
review. 
</p>
<p>63. This situation is contrary to article 13 of the Declaration, which provides that an 
investigation should be conducted for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance 
remains unknown. 
</p>
<p>64. As a result of the above, the Working Group sees as a positive sign that, in the absence of 
an agreement in the Congress, a presidential decree was issued to create a Commission for the 
Search for Persons Disappeared during the Internal Armed Conflict (Search Commission) and 
that a parallel preparatory commission is in place to work on the establishment of an equivalent 
body through an act of legislation.  The latter would establish stronger institutional autonomy, 
both financially and legally, and would more strongly secure its stability.  This preparatory 
commission works in an integrated way with representation from the Government, the Human 
Rights Ombudsman and civil society.  The Working Group respectfully calls on the different 
parliamentary factions of Congress to continue efforts to achieve consensus in order to enact the 
necessary legislation. 
</p>
<p>65. In the meantime, the Working Group hopes that the establishment of the Search 
Commission of the executive branch will render the best results within its power to clarify the 
fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons that are before the Working Group, as well as any 
others. 
</p>
<p>66. The Search Commission was established as a temporary body, for a period of one year 
that may be extended, by means of Governmental Decree 264-2006, dated 26 May 2006.  The 
Search Commission is made up of five high officers of the executive branch, including the 
President of the National Reparations Programme.  The Commission is chaired by the 
Presidential Commission for the Coordination of Human Rights Policies (Comisi&#243;n Presidencial 
Coordinadora de la Pol&#237;tica del Ejecutivo en Materia de Derechos Humanos, COPREDEH). 
</p><p>67. Along with a copy of the governmental decree, the Working Group received from 
COPREDEH a copy of a document called the National Plan (2006-2016) for the Search of 
Persons Disappeared during the Internal Armed Conflict proposed by the Search Committee.  
This Plan is lengthy and comprehensive.  It refers to 11 ruling principles that include the rights to 
information, truth, justice, legal aid, and integral reparation, among other principles.  
Additionally, the Plan refers to 10 programmes intended to search for disappeared persons, carry 
out exhumations and inhumations, assist and accompany families of the victims, protect victims, 
witnesses and defenders, ensure reparations are carried out, keep records and documentation, 
among other things. 
</p>
<p>68. The governmental decree provides that the Human Rights Ombudsman, the General 
Prosecutor of the Nation and a representative of the judiciary may participate in the respective 
meetings, but without voting rights.  Furthermore, the Search Commission may receive technical </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>assistance from international organizations, such as the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and/or the International Committee of the Red Cross.  
Finally, the Search Commission has the power (but not the obligation) to call for the 
establishment of a Support Board made up of representatives of civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>69. Some representatives of non-governmental organizations questioned the establishment of 
the Search Commission, since, in their view, it lacks sufficient guarantees of independence, as a 
result of the fact that the Human Rights Ombudsman has no voting privileges and that members 
of civil society were not included as active members of the same.  However, the President of the 
Commission informed the Working Group that members of civil society organizations were not 
included as formal members of the Commission because they declined to participate. 
</p>
<p>70. Based on the foregoing, the Working Group calls on all those involved (executive branch, 
Human Rights Ombudsman and civil society) to keep channels of frank and transparent 
communication open to ensure constructive co-participation in a common goal, which should be 
finding victims of enforced disappearances or their fate and the integral reparation to them and 
their loved ones.  In accordance with international law and specifically with the Declaration on 
the Protection of Persons against Enforced Disappearances the State has the primary 
responsibility to comply with international obligations.  However, the Working Group considers 
it essential to recognize and emphasize that civil society also has a responsibility to address the 
resolution of enforced disappearances, including providing information to the Working Group to 
clarify cases that are still pending. 
</p>
<p>71. In connection with the search of disappeared persons, the Working Group wishes to 
commend the establishment, work and results of the National Commission for the Search for 
Disappeared Children, established by the International Research Centre on Human Rights, the 
Office of Human Rights of the Archbishop of Guatemala, the association &#8220;Where are the 
children?&#8221;, the association Casa Alianza, the Mutual Support Group, Rigoberta Mench&#250; Tum 
and the Human Rights Ombudsman.  We were informed of the achievements of this 
organization, such as 1,280 documented cases, 324 clarified cases, 131 family reunions, 
108 exhumations, 1,000 persons receiving some kind of psychosocial treatment, and 600 persons 
receiving permanent psychosocial treatment.  The Working Group wishes that similar results 
could be achieved with respect to the pending cases before it, as well as any others. 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group wishes to remind all those persons involved in the possible 
clarification of cases before it that, under its methods of work, the Working Group may consider 
a case clarified when the competent authority specified in the relevant national law pronounces, 
with the concurrence of the relatives and other interested parties, on the presumption of death of 
a person reported missing.  In this connection the Working Group learned that a draft law on the 
declaration of death as a result of enforced disappearance is under consideration by the National 
Congress.  The Working Group wishes to encourage the Congress to advance in the review of 
this law, in light of the principles of the Declaration.  That is to say, the declaration of death as a 
result of enforced disappearance should be a measure aimed to enable the families of the victims 
to carry out legal proceedings regarding estate transfers and facilitate inheritance issues, 
guardianship of minors, family affairs and other civil and commercial matters, without prejudice 
to the rights of the victims to truth, justice and reparations, and therefore, without prejudice to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>the State&#8217;s obligations to continue with the investigations of pending cases, to uphold the 
prosecution and punishment of those responsible of the crime, and to adopt the necessary 
measures to satisfy the rights of victims and their loved ones. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The right to integral reparation 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Declaration, for which the Working Group has a mandate to monitor the 
implementation, refers to the fundamental right of integral reparation.  This includes the right to 
truth, to justice, to moral reparation and psychosocial rehabilitation, as well as to appropriate 
monetary compensation.  These principles are fully contemplated in the basic documents of the 
Guatemala National Reparations Programme and the proposed National Plan (2006-2016) for the 
Search for Persons Disappeared during the Internal Armed Conflict, proposed by the Search 
Committee. 
</p>
<p>74. Chapter 5 of the Programme lists the following measures of reparation:  (a) material 
reparation (including restitution of land, legal title over land, housing restitution, and productive 
investments); (b) economic indemnification; (c) rehabilitation and psychosocial reparation 
(including rehabilitation of persons with disabilities, recovery of cultural identity, education, 
attention to disappeared children and attention to the elderly); and (d) dignifying of victims 
(including the establishment of the Day for Dignifying Victims, broadcast and promotion of the 
programme, museums, monuments, fortification of a culture for peace and exhumations). 
</p>
<p>75. The entire conceptual framework was explained in detail to the Working Group by the 
director of the programme.  The Working Group endeavoured to explain that those principles 
should be applied in practice in a comprehensive manner, and not be restricted to the delivery of 
money, as some sources reported occurs in the majority of cases at the present time.  This 
incomplete application of the right to reparation has apparently sometimes led to the 
disintegration of families of victims of disappearance.  The Working Group respectfully 
requested the Director of the programme to provide it with a report on the actual and integral 
application of the programme, including, but not limited to, the payment of monetary 
compensation.  No such information had yet been received to date by the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>76. The Declaration refers to the right to truth and information from the results of 
investigations.  This right forms an integral part of the right to reparation. 
</p>
<p>77. As regards clarification of its recent history, Guatemala took important steps to advance 
knowledge of the past and the objective interpretation of what really occurred during the long 
internal armed conflict.  The two essential documents in this regard are &#8220;Guatemala - Memory of 
Silence&#8221; (<i>Informe Guatemala Memoria del Silencio</i>) issued by the Commission for Historical 
Clarification, and &#8220;Guatemala, Never Again&#8221; (<i>Guatemala Nunca M&#225;s</i>) issued by the 
Inter-diocese Project for Historic Recovery (REMHI). 
78. In addition, the National Plan (2006-2016) proposed by the Search Committee includes 
two programmes to the right to truth and information.  One of them, of course, is related to the 
search of disappeared persons; the other refers to the right to habeas corpus, keeping of records, 
documentation and archives related to the phenomenon of enforced disappearances. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>79. With respect to the first programme, connected to the search for disappeared persons, it is 
essential that all those persons involved in the Search Commission and with actual or potential 
participation in the High-Level Preparatory Commission for Promoting Proposed Legislation for 
the Creation of the National Commission for the Search for Victims of Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearance (e.g. governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the Office of 
the Human Rights Ombudsman) collaborate with each other, to share all information that they 
may have available related to the disappeared persons, so that a single national registry of 
disappeared persons can be put together as soon as possible.  It is evident that, in order to adopt 
effective measures for the search of persons that may lead to clarification of cases, the first 
element that has to be present is the information regarding the persons that are being searched for 
and the actual circumstances of the disappearance. 
</p>
<p>80. This is why it is of the utmost importance that archives and official documents, both from 
the National Police and the Armed Forces, which may contain essential information for the 
investigation and potential clarification of disappearances committed during the internal armed 
conflict, be preserved and cared for scrupulously.  Preferably this will be done by a body granted 
with acting and budgetary autonomy, in order to guarantee that such preservation is not at stake 
as a result of political factors, such as changes of Government or similar circumstances.  In this 
sense the Working Group welcomes the finding and safekeeping of the above-mentioned 
archives related to the activities of the National Police during the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>81. In addition, it would be very positive if the Congress of the Republic issued a law on 
transparency and effective access to information to guarantee the availability of such information 
to researchers and families of the disappeared, as well as to the general public, except in cases 
where secrecy is justified or confidentially is required.  Adequate legislation in this area would 
secure effective implementation of the programme of documentation and archives referred to in 
the National Plan (2006-2016) proposed by the Search Committee. 
</p>
<p>82. Also, the Working Group welcomes the enactment of the law that created the Institute of 
Forensic Anthropology, which should surely play an essential role in the identification of bodies 
of disappeared persons, contribute to the clarification of cases and fulfil the right of families to 
mourn and give the bodies of their loved ones the treatment that may be in accordance with their 
cultural convictions. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS, CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions and concerns 
</b></p>
<p>83. The report of the Working Group on the Guatemala mission encompasses an overview of 
the present constitutional, legal and institutional framework established by the authorities of 
Guatemala aimed at dealing with the great number of cases of enforced disappearances 
committed during the internal armed conflict from 1960 to 1996. 
</p>
<p>84. Although enforced disappearances are no longer a systematic practice in the policy of 
the democratic Government of Guatemala, the problem of the thousands of unresolved cases 
remains one of the most serious issues in the country and represents a priority for the State </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>to resolve.  According to the assessment of the Commission for Historic Clarification, 
among the 200,000 people killed during the internal armed conflict there were 
approximately 45,000 persons forcibly disappeared. 
</p>
<p>85. The Working Group hereby reiterates its gratitude to the Government of Guatemala for 
its invitation to visit the country and discuss the progress in various activities undertaken on all 
relevant levels facing the problem of enforced disappearances.  The Working Group also wishes 
to express its gratitude for the wonderful hospitality of the State and for the excellent cooperation 
of all officials with whom the Working Group met during the mission. 
</p>
<p>86. The Working Group previously visited Guatemala in 1988.  Its members visiting 
Guatemala in September 2006 could assess the current progress in the State efforts in 
comparison with the previous report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>87. The Working Group considers that the extent of the problem is so great that it needs a 
highly unified and well coordinated effort by all relevant institutions of the executive, legislative 
and judicial authorities, including relevant civil society institutions, working together, to 
ascertain the fate or whereabouts of the victims. 
</p>
<p>88. While the Working Group recognizes the good intentions of the State actors, it also 
expresses its concern at the lack of coordination in the realization of various programmes and 
activities between non-governmental organizations and State actors because of lack of mutual 
trust and consensus among them. 
</p>
<p>89. The Working Group is concerned about the lack of economic and material resources and 
investigators, judges, and police agents with appropriate professional training and in some cases 
about the lack of will of some actors to investigate, arrest, process and punish persons 
responsible for gross violations of human rights, including enforced disappearances.  The 
Working Group is concerned about the lack of resources for the relevant State institutions 
(judiciary, police, ombudsman, etc.) with regard to their activities to investigate and address 
enforced disappearances, and also about the lack of resources for the implementation of various 
programmes dealing with enforced disappearances.  The lack of resources is a very considerable 
obstacle to the effectiveness of the State in undertaking measures related to enforced 
disappearances. 
</p>
<p>90. The Working Group is also concerned about the lack of sufficient and effective 
guarantees of the independence of the institution in charge of conducting investigations of the 
crimes of disappearance perpetrated by State officials. 
</p>
<p>91. Impunity is of particular concern to the Working Group.  It considers that impunity is 
contrary to the appropriate measures that States must adopt in order to prevent acts of enforced 
disappearance, as provided for in article 3 of the Declaration, and therefore comply with the 
guarantee of &#8220;no repetition&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>92. While the Working Group noted the good will of the State to implement international 
human rights standards on the national level, and in spite of the relatively good progress the State 
has achieved in the realization of human rights compared to the previous period, especially </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>regarding the establishment of the national institutions and bodies addressing the problem of 
enforced disappearances, the Working Group expresses its deep concern about many obstacles 
that seriously hinder any real results. 
</p>
<p>93. The Working Group wishes to reiterate and emphasize again the existing gap between the 
advanced legal framework and good political will to bring to justice cases of disappearances, 
versus the actual results.  The Working Group took note with great concern that, to date, there 
has not been one person convicted for the commission of the crime of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>94. The Working Group is concerned about reports of thousands of habeas corpus 
applications regarding cases of disappearances during the internal armed conflict being declared 
null and void (<i>sin lugar</i>) and investigations on those cases were therefore suspended by the 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>95. The Working Group expresses its concern for the safety and preservation of the archives 
of the National Police and the Armed Forces, which are of the utmost importance and which may 
contain essential information for the investigation and potential clarification of enforced 
disappearances committed during the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>96. Intimidation is closely connected to the situation of impunity.  The Working Group 
expresses its deep concern about recurring attacks and other acts of intimidation against 
members of civil society organizations, members of the judiciary, officers of the Human Rights 
Ombudsman, lawyers, human rights activists, members of victims&#8217; families, among others 
involved in cases of enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>97. It is also a matter of concern to the Working Group that the definition of enforced 
disappearance contained in the Guatemala Criminal Code, is not in line with the definition in the 
Declaration, inasmuch as acts committed by non-State actors and without the support, consent or 
acquiescence of the State are also considered enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>98. The Working Group is deeply concerned about the fact that the Criminal Code provides 
for the death penalty in the cases of enforced disappearances &#8220;where at the time of the crime or 
during the crime, the victim is seriously or very seriously injured, or suffers psychological 
trauma, or permanent psychological damage, or dies&#8221;.  The Working Group reiterates that the 
application of the death penalty in all cases, even for those persons found guilty of the crime of 
enforced disappearances, is not in accordance with the accepted development of international 
law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The Working Group recommends that the State undertake all necessary measures 
to harmonize domestic laws with international human rights instruments, especially with 
the Declaration for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and to 
ensure the full implementation of international law in practice.  Particularly, the Working 
Group recommends that the element of non-State actors as potential perpetrators of 
enforced disappearance be eliminated from the legal definition of the crime.  Also, the 
death penalty should be eliminated for enforced disappearance. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/41/Add.1

</p>
<p>100. <b>Other legislative measures should include: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The adoption of a law to create an independent National Commission for the 
Search for Victims of Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, along the lines of a draft 
law to be prepared by the High-Level Preparatory Commission for Promoting Proposed 
Legislation for the Creation of the National Commission for the Search for Victims of 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Adoption of a law on access to public information, which in turn could 
serve as the legal protection for the Armed Forces and National Police Archives (with its 
50 million documents).  This law should provide for the establishment of a body granted 
with acting and budgetary autonomy, in order to guarantee that preservation of such 
archives is not at jeopardy as a result of political factors, such as changes of Government or 
similar circumstances; and 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Approval of a law on the declaration of death as a result of enforced 
disappearance, without prejudice to the rights of the victims to truth, justice and 
reparations, and therefore, without prejudice to the State&#8217;s obligations to continue with the 
investigations of pending cases, to uphold the prosecution and punishment of those 
responsible for the crime, and to adopt the necessary measures to satisfy the rights of 
victims and their loved ones. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Other measures should include: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Training justice officials, especially prosecutors and judges, in aspects of the 
crime of enforced disappearance under international law, as well as in techniques for 
effective investigation and criminal prosecution for enforced disappearances; and 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The application by courts of international standards in their decisions 
regarding cases of enforced disappearances, including the non-applicability of statutes of 
limitation, the continuing nature of the crime and the fact that civilian courts should be the 
competent courts to hear enforced-disappearance cases. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Good cooperation and coordination between all State institutions and other 
non-governmental actors is crucial in order to create a systematic approach to the complex 
problem of addressing the cases and legacy of enforced disappearance in Guatemala.  The 
10 programmes of the National Plan (2006-2016) for the Search of Persons Disappeared 
during the Internal Armed Conflict, proposed by the Search Committee should 
comprehensively be put into practice without further delay, within an atmosphere of 
mutual cooperation amongst all relevant actors. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The National Plan (2006-2016) proposed by the Search Committee should be 
reviewed and approved by Congress. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>An annual report on the implementation of the National Plan (2006-2016) should be 
prepared by all participants and submitted for consideration by Congress.  Thereafter, the 
annual report should be made available to the general public. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/41/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>105. <b>In a cooperative environment among all players, a single and unified Public 
National Registry of Victims of Enforced Disappearance should be established. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Additionally, necessary resources should be supplied for the realization of all 
activities of all those institutions and actors involved in the process of the investigation and 
punishment of enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Along with the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Committee 
(CCPR/CO/72/GTM), the Working Group calls on the State to &#8220;give special priority to 
investigating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of the human rights violations, 
including police and military personnel&#8221; (para. 13). 
</b>108. <b>Habeas corpus procedures that have been suspended in contradiction with the 
Declaration should be reopened and investigations should be effortlessly continued in order 
to endeavour to clarify past cases of enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Working Group urges the State to take effective measures to prevent the 
repetition of acts of intimidation and other forms of attacks on witnesses and on human 
rights defenders involved in the investigation of cases of enforced disappearance, so that 
the above-mentioned actors are able to carry out their functions without persecution of any 
kind. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>In spite of the National Reparations Programme, which has existed since the 
beginning of 2003, reparation measures have still not been applied for most of the victims.  
The Working Group strongly recommends the comprehensive application of the 
Programme, which should not be limited to the payment of monetary compensation. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Working Group reiterates its request that the Government of Guatemala and 
others with relevant information provide it to the Working Group for the clarification of 
the nearly 3,000 remaining cases of disappeared persons still pending with the Working 
Group. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Guatemala is encouraged to seek the advice and technical assistance of the various 
bodies of the United Nations, in particular the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, in the effective implementation of the above recommendations.
