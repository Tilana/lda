<p><b>OPINION No. 32/2006 (QATAR) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 10 March 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Amar Ali Ahmed Al Kurdi. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State has not ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by the Commission on 
Human Rights in its resolution 1991/42. The mandate of the Working Group was clarified and 
extended by the Commission in resolution 1997/50. It was reconfirmed by the Commission in 
resolution 2003/31, by the General Assembly in resolution 60/251 and the Human Rights 
Council in decision 1/102. Acting in accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group 
forwarded the above-mentioned communication to the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having provided the 
requested information. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group regards deprivation of liberty as arbitrary in the following cases: 
</p>
<p>I. When it manifestly cannot be justified on any legal basis (such as continued 
detention after the sentence has been served or despite an applicable amnesty act) 
(Category I); 
</p>
<p>II. When the deprivation of liberty is the result of a judgement or sentence for the 
exercise of the rights and freedoms proclaimed in articles 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and also, in respect of States parties, 
by articles 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (Category II); 
</p>
<p>III. When the complete or partial non-observance of the relevant international standards 
set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the relevant 
international instruments accepted by the States concerned relating to the right to a 
fair trial is of such gravity as to confer on the deprivation of liberty, of whatever 
kind, an arbitrary character (Category III). 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group already considered the case of Mr. Amar Ali Ahmed Al Kurdi during 
its forty-sixth session. However, it did not take into account the information received from the 
Government. During its forty-seventh session the Working Group took knowledge of the 
Government&#8217;s response to the allegations submitted by the source. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group further notes that the Government concerned has informed the 
Working Group that Mr. Al Kurdi was released on 2 January 2006 and is, therefore, no longer in 
detention. This fact has been confirmed by the source. 
</p>
<p>6. Having examined all the information submitted to it and without prejudging the arbitrary 
nature of the detention, the Working Group, on the basis of paragraph 17 (a) of its methods of 
work, decides to file the case. 
</p>
<p>Adopted on 16 November 2006. </p>

<p><b>OPINION No. 33/2006 (IRAQ and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA) 
Communication: addressed to the Governments on 17 January 2005. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Tariq Aziz. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Both States are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. On 30 November 2005, the Working Group adopted Opinion No. 45/2005 concerning the 
communication addressed to the Governments of Iraq and the United States of America on 
behalf of Mr. Tariq Aziz. The Working Group stated its views on certain legal questions raised 
by the source and the Governments, in particular with regard to its mandate and the principles 
governing the responsibility of the Iraqi and United States Governments for the facts alleged by 
the source. 
</p>
<p>3. Firstly, the Working Group decided that in accordance with paragraphs 16 of its 
methods of work and 14 of its revised methods of work,<b>1</b> it will not assess the lawfulness of 
Mr. Tariq Aziz&#8217;s detention for the period from 24 April 2003 to 30 June 2004, as it occurred 
during an ongoing international armed conflict and the United States Government recognized 
that the Geneva Conventions applied to individuals captured in the conflict in Iraq. According to 
the source, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was allowed to visit Tariq Aziz 
and communicate two letters to his family. 
</p>
<p>4. Secondly, the Working Group decided that until 1 July 2004 Tariq Aziz was detained 
under the sole responsibility of the Coalition members as occupying powers or, to be more 
precise, under the responsibility of the United States Government. Since then, as Mr. Aziz 
appeared on 1 July 2004 before the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal (&#8220;the Tribunal&#8221;), a court of 
the sovereign State of Iraq, in order to enter a plea, his pretrial detention on charges pending 
before the Tribunal is within the responsibility of Iraq. The Working Group also found that, 
considering that Tariq Aziz is in the physical custody of the United States authorities, any 
possible conclusion as to the arbitrary nature of his deprivation of liberty may involve the 
international responsibility of the United States Government as well. 
</p>
<p>5. Finally, with regard to the alleged violations affecting the right to a fair trial, the Working 
Group considered that it was premature to take a stance on the allegations of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty, because the procedural flaws amounting to the violation of the right to a 
fair trial could, in principle, be redressed during the subsequent stages of the ongoing criminal 
proceedings. Therefore, the Working Group decided that it would follow the development of the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  &#8220;The Working Group will not deal with situations of international armed conflict insofar as 
</p>
<p>they are covered by the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and their Additional Protocols, 
particularly when the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has competence.&#8221; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>process and would request more information from both Governments concerned and from the 
source. In the meantime, the Working Group decided to keep the case pending until further 
information was received, as provided in paragraph 17 (c) of its methods of work. 
</p>
<p>6. On 14 December 2005 the Working Group notified its opinion to the two Governments and 
on 12 January 2006 to the source. The Working Group subsequently received new allegations 
from the source. On 3 May 2006, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group transmitted 
them to the Governments of Iraq and of the United States of America through their respective 
Permanent Representatives in Geneva and requested their comments and observations. Since no 
reply was received, on 28 June 2006 the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group sent a 
letter informing the Permanent Representatives of the two Governments that the Working 
Group will consider the case during its forthcoming forty-sixth session from 28 August to 
1 September 2006. While no reply was received from the Government of the United States, the 
Iraqi Government sent a reply on 14 July 2006. At its forty-sixth session the Working Group 
decided to write again to the Government of Iraq seeking clarification of its reply of 
14 July 2006. No reply to this request was received. The Working Group also transmitted the 
Iraqi Government&#8217;s reply of 14 July 2006 to the source, which on 11 August 2006 sent its 
observations. On 12 November 2006, the source informed the Working Group that there were no 
further developments in the case. 
</p>
<p>7. The source alleges multiple violations of Tariq Aziz&#8217;s right to a fair trial. According to the 
source, Tariq Aziz was taken into custody by United States military forces on 24 April 2003. On 
1 July 2004, he was taken to a military prison in Baghdad where he appeared at a hearing in his 
case. He had not been previously informed of the charges brought against him and was not 
assisted by a lawyer.  
</p>
<p>8. Since then, Tariq Aziz has had sporadic meetings with his defence counsel, 
Mr. Badie Arief Izzat. These meetings take place under circumstances which render the effective 
preparation of a defence case very difficult. The defence counsel is not allowed to see his client 
at dates he requests. Instead, he is informed at very short notice (never more than a day) by the 
United States authorities of a meeting date. A United States official always remains present 
during the meetings between Tariq Aziz and his lawyer who are not allowed to exchange any 
written documents. This not only seriously hampers their ability to prepare a defence case, it also 
makes it impossible to give formal power of attorney to the additional lawyers his family has 
retained for him. 
</p>
<p>9. Moreover, according to the source neither Tariq Aziz nor his counsel have ever received 
any formal act about the charges or any official communication from the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
office or from the Tribunal. The few times Tariq Aziz was interrogated in presence of his lawyer, 
this was carried out by officers of the United States administration, instead of the prosecutor or 
judges of the Tribunal. 
</p><p>10. In its submission of 14 July 2006, the Iraqi Government states that Tariq Aziz was detained 
on 1 July 2004 to be brought to justice with regard to four criminal cases in which he is a 
defendant and that are currently being investigated and prepared for trial before the Tribunal. 
The four cases are (1) the events of 1991, (2) Kuwait, (3) human rights violations and (4) waste 
of national wealth. The Government adds that Tariq Aziz has been interrogated and witnesses 
and co-defendants have been heard. As far as the Kuwait case is concerned, the Government </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>states that the Government of Kuwait has submitted a complaint against Tariq Aziz on the basis 
of which the Tribunal has opened a case. It is being investigated and prepared for trial as 
provided for by law. With regard to the charges of human rights violations and criminal waste of 
national wealth, the Government states that Tariq Aziz and his co-defendants as well as the 
witnesses have been heard, but the outcome of the case (in the words of the Government &#8220;his 
fate&#8221;) has not been determined yet. Finally, the Government states that Tariq Aziz is enjoying all 
his rights and that he is being questioned in the presence of his lawyer Badia Aref Izzat. 
</p>
<p>11. In reply to the Government&#8217;s observations, the source reiterates its allegations. It stresses 
particularly that Tariq Aziz and his lawyers are not aware of the official complaint presented by 
the Kuwaiti Government before the Tribunal and that they have never received any formal act 
about the charges or any official communication from the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office or from the 
Tribunal. 
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group notes with appreciation the cooperation of the Iraqi Government. It 
regrets, however, that neither the Government of Iraq nor the Government of the United States 
have submitted observations specifically addressing the allegations of the source. Nonetheless, 
the Working Group believes that it is in a position to consider the case again and render an 
opinion. 
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group also considered whether, in view of the fact that the trial against 
Tariq Aziz has not begun, it should again postpone stating its opinion on the case. However, 
already in its Opinion of 30 November 2005 (paragraph 30), the Working Group had expressed 
its concern about the violation of Tariq Aziz&#8217;s rights as a defendant when it stated that: 
&#8220;[a]lready at the preparatory stage of the trial against him, some serious procedural flaws can be 
identified, above all in respect of his full and unlimited access to his defence counsel to prepare 
his defence out of the hearing distance of the prison staff and any other officials&#8221;. Nearly two 
years have elapsed since the case was presented to the Working Group and more than a year 
since the Working Group decided to &#8220;keep the case pending&#8221;. As found below, during these two 
years, Tariq Aziz has not been presented to a judge, or even been heard a single time by the 
prosecution which is allegedly investigating the charges against him. The Working Group 
therefore considers that it cannot further delay issuing its opinion. 
</p>
<p>14. The Working Group observes that the United States Government has not submitted any 
reply on the merits of the allegations of the source, while the Government of Iraq has not in fact 
challenged the serious allegations of the source, particularly those regarding the right to be 
assisted by defence counsel in the preparation of his defence. The Working Group therefore 
considers it to be established that Tariq Aziz can only meet with his lawyer at the whim of the 
United States authorities; that a United States official always remains present during the 
meetings between Tariq Aziz and his lawyer; that the frequency and time allocated to these 
meetings make the adequate preparation of a defence utterly impossible; that the prohibition on 
the exchange of written documents further impedes the preparation of a defence case and the 
appointment of lawyers of the defendant&#8217;s own choosing; that the only hearing Tariq Aziz has 
had in connection with his case took place on 1 July 2004; that he was neither given an 
opportunity to prepare for that hearing nor assisted by a lawyer; and that in the two years and 
five months since then Tariq Aziz has not been brought before a judge. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>15. As for the information provided by the Government of Iraq with regard to the criminal 
charges against Tariq Aziz and the proceedings based on them, the Working Group notes that 
two years and five months have passed since the initial hearing at which Tariq Aziz was asked to 
enter a plea with regard to some charges. The Government has not challenged the source&#8217;s 
assertion that, whatever charges are being investigated and prepared for trial and whatever 
evidence is being collected, not a single document concerning these proceedings has been 
notified to Tariq Aziz or to his lawyers. The Government states that Tariq Aziz has been 
interrogated, but it does not dispute that he was interrogated by United States officials and not 
prosecutors or judges of the Tribunal. The Working Group finds the charges against Tariq Aziz 
as set forth in the Government&#8217;s observations (e.g. &#8220;the events of 1991&#8221;, &#8220;Kuwait&#8221; or &#8220;human 
rights violations&#8221;) rather vague. In any event, as long as they are not brought to the attention of 
the defendant and his lawyers, it is irrelevant whether the charges are clearly defined or not. The 
Government has not submitted any document which would show that formal procedural steps 
have been taken and that the defendant has been informed of them. 
</p>
<p>16. Two years and five months after his status changed, at least in theory, from prisoner of war 
to criminal defendant, Tariq Aziz has only had one perfunctory hearing. He may have been 
informed at the time of some charges against him (no details have been brought to the Working 
Group&#8217;s attention), as required by article 9 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), but the 14 July 2006 submission of the Government of Iraq does not 
suggest that the charges which the Government now mentions to the Working Group were 
brought to his attention on that day. Those charges have never been notified to the defendant, 
who in fact has no tangible indication of the fact that he is detained in the context of criminal 
proceedings (except for the Government&#8217;s statements to the Working Group). While Tariq Aziz 
was &#8220;brought promptly before a judge&#8221; once responsibility for his detention was transferred from 
the United States to Iraq on 1 July 2004, since then there does not appear to have been any 
judicial review of his detention. Under the circumstances of the case, also his right to take 
proceedings before a court to have that court rule on the lawfulness of his detention, as enshrined 
in article 9 (4) ICCPR, appears purely hypothetical. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group is fully aware that the investigation of cases against senior political 
and military leaders for war crimes or crimes against humanity, committed in the context of a 
major military campaign or over an extended period of time, is extremely complex and 
time-consuming. The experience of international tribunals established by the United Nations 
shows that in many instances years pass between the arrest of the defendant and the actual start 
of his trial. What is extraordinary and unacceptable about the case of Tariq Aziz, however, is that 
during the two years and five months elapsed since 1 July 2004 there has not been any 
procedural step marking progress in his case of which he has been made aware. The right to 
&#8220;trial within a reasonable time or to release&#8221; (article 9 (3) ICCPR), a centrepiece of the 
protection against arbitrary detention, is therefore violated. 
</p>
<p>18. Insofar as important procedural steps have taken place, such as the questioning of 
witnesses and co-defendants mentioned by the Government, they remain shrouded in mystery for 
the defendant and his lawyer. Who are these witnesses and co-defendants? In relation to which 
of the four cases allegedly being investigated were they heard? Who questioned them? What did </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>they say? Article 7 (f) of the Statute of the Tribunal provides that &#8220;the Chief Tribunal 
Investigative Judge shall assign cases to individual tribunal investigative judges&#8221;, but Tariq Aziz 
has not been informed of the assignation of the cases concerning him. Under article 18 (d) of the 
Statute &#8220;the Tribunal Investigative Judge shall prepare an indictment containing a concise 
statement of the facts and the crime or crimes with which the accused is charged under the 
Statute&#8221;. No such indictment has ever been notified to Tariq Aziz. On the other hand, 
article 21 (a) of the Statute, providing that &#8220;[a] person against whom an indictment has been 
issued shall, pursuant to an order or an arrest warrant of the Tribunal Investigative Judge, be 
taken into custody&#8221;, would appear to suggest that indeed such an indictment exists, as Tariq Aziz 
has been in custody for 29 months. To sum up, if there are indeed criminal proceedings under the 
Statute of the Tribunal in course against Tariq Aziz, they are being kept completely secret to the 
defendant and his lawyer. This secrecy over such an extended period of time is incompatible 
with the right to a fair trial, particularly when the defendant is detained. 
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group further considers that insofar as Tariq Aziz is currently subjected to 
&#8220;the determination of a criminal charge against him&#8221; (article 14 (1) ICCPR), irrespective of 
whether the trial against him has begun or not, he is entitled to the minimum guarantees afforded 
by article 14 (3) ICCPR. These include &#8220;to be tried without undue delay&#8221; (article 14 (3) (c) 
ICCPR). Also the right to &#8220;communicate with counsel of his own choosing&#8221; enshrined in 
article 14 (3) (b) ICCPR is seriously undermined, as the meetings take place at unforeseeable 
intervals as dictated by the United States authorities, no documents can be exchanged between 
the lawyer and his client and a United States official always remains present, denying the privacy 
which is essential between a defendant and his counsel. Moreover, article 18 (c) of the Statute 
dictates that &#8220;[t]he suspect is entitled to have non-Iraqi legal representation&#8221;, but for Tariq Aziz 
exercise of this right is made impossible in practice. 
</p>
<p>20. As to the right to be tried by an &#8220;independent and impartial tribunal&#8221;, the Working Group 
has expressed its grave misgivings about the current situation of the Tribunal in its Opinion 
No. 31/2006, paragraph 22. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government of Iraq, as the Government asserting legal responsibility for the detention 
and trial of Tariq Aziz, and the Government of the United States, as his de facto custodian and 
the power whose officials are currently interrogating him, are both responsible for this situation. 
</p>
<p>22. As the Working Group stated in its Opinion No. 31/2006, paragraph 26, it is firmly 
convinced that &#8220;also from the perspective of the victims, who under international law enjoy the 
right to reparation, truth and justice, it is particularly important that the investigation of the gross 
violation of human rights and the trial of their alleged perpetrators are conducted in a legitimate 
and transparent legal process. For them as well, it is essential that justice is not only fair but also 
be seen to be fair&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>23. It would not appear that it is too late to remedy the ongoing violations of Tariq Aziz&#8217;s 
rights as a criminal defendant. The Working Group expresses its hope that the Government of 
Iraq, if it indeed intends to pursue criminal charges against Tariq Aziz, will take the steps 
necessary to afford him a fair trial. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>24. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Tariq Aziz is arbitrary, being in contravention of 
articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Iraq 
and the United States are parties, and falls within category III of the categories applicable 
to the consideration of the cases submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p> As a consequence of the opinion rendered, the Working Group requests the 
Governments of Iraq and the United States to take the necessary steps to remedy the 
situation of Mr. Tariq Aziz, and bring it into conformity with the principles set forth in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.

<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Abdelmohsen Abdelkhaleq Hamed Al-Hindi. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State has not signed or ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group regrets that the Government did not provide it, despite repeated 
invitation to this effect, with the requested information. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group believes that it is in a position to 
render an opinion, notwithstanding that the Government has failed to offer its version of facts 
and explanation on the circumstances of the case. 
</p>
<p>5. According to the source Mr.<b> </b>Abdelmohsen Abdelkhaleq Hamed Al-Hindi, a citizen of 
Saudi Arabia, is a professor in a public institution of Al Qasim, Al Bureida, currently detained in 
Ras Tenoura prison (Al Manteqa Acharquia).  
</p>
<p>6. It is contended that on 6 July 2003, members of the intelligence services arrested 
Mr. Al-Hindi at his home. No arrest warrant was shown at the moment of his arrest. He was 
ill-treated while he was interrogated by intelligence officers, who reproached him to have 
expressed &#8220;subversive ideas&#8221;. No precision was given to him about the time or the circumstances 
in which he would have expressed such opinions.  
</p>
<p>7. For more than three years now, Mr. Al-Hindi has neither been formally charged with any 
offence, nor been informed of the duration of his custodial order. He has not been brought before 
a judicial officer, nor been allowed to name a defence lawyer on his behalf, nor otherwise been 
provided the possibility to challenge the legality of his detention.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>8. The source alleges that the detention of Mr. Al-Hindi is arbitrary because it is devoid of 
any legal basis. The authorities have so far failed to provide any decision justifying his arrest and 
detention.  
</p>
<p>9. According to the source, the alleged reason for detention: &#8220;the diffusion of subversive 
ideas&#8221; is without any merit. His detention would be seen as a reprisal for the exercise of his right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, guaranteed by article 19 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>10. The source further argues that Mr. Al-Hindi has been denied the right to an effective 
remedy by the competent national tribunals for his arbitrary detention and the right to a fair and 
public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. Mr. Al-Hindi has not been informed of 
the charges against him, has been denied access to a lawyer, and has not been brought before a 
judge.  
</p><p>11. Lastly, the source argues that the detention of Mr. Al-Hindi is also in violation of 
Saudi domestic law, in particular articles 2 and 4 of the Royal Decree No. M.39. These articles 
provide that persons shall only be deprived of their liberty in cases provided for by law, shall be 
detained only for the duration decided by the authorities, shall not be subjected to ill-treatment, 
and shall have the right to seek the assistance of a lawyer during the investigation phase and at 
trial. 
</p>
<p>12. The Chairperson-Rapporteur brought the allegations of the source to the attention of the 
Government on 9 June 2006, in which she requested the Government to provide the Working 
Group not later than within 90 days with its explanation on the facts alleged as well as 
concerning the applicable legislation. Since no reply was received within the imparted 
deadline, the secretariat of the Working Group informed the Government, in a letter dated 
23 October 2006, that the Working Group would consider this communication at its forthcoming 
forty-seventh session, held from 15 to 24 November 2006. No reaction has been received to this 
reminder, either. 
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group had to start from the hypothesis that the lack of any comment from the 
Government cannot be interpreted otherwise than as the factual acknowledgment of the 
allegations of the source concerning the arrest and detention of Mr. Al-Hindi. This means that 
Mr. Al-Hindi was taken into custody in July 2003, that he is in detention ever since, and that no 
legal ground or judicial order has been put forward to justify his deprivation of liberty. Therefore 
the Working Group concludes that his deprivation of liberty is arbitrary.  
</p>
<p>14. The source also argued that in addition the detention of Mr. Al-Hindi was a reprisal for the 
exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression; the authorities allegedly qualified his 
activities as imparting subversive ideas. It was also contended that he was denied due process of 
law. Since however these latter allegations are not sufficiently substantiated and supported by 
reliable arguments, the Working Group founded its opinion on the sole and not refuted allegation 
that the detention of Mr. Al-Hindi was and is devoid of any legal basis. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>15. In the light of the foregoing the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Abdelmohsen Abdelkhaleq Hamed Al-Hindi is 
arbitrary being in contravention of article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and falls under category I of the categories applicable to the consideration of cases 
submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>16. Consequent upon the opinion rendered, the Working Group requests the Government to 
remedy the situation and to bring it into conformity with the provisions of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. The Working Group believes that under the circumstances and 
bearing in mind the long period of time spent in detention the adequate remedy would be the 
immediate release of Mr. Al-Hindi.

<p><b>OPINION No. 37/2006 (SAUDI ARABIA) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 22 June 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Chalaane bin Sa&#239;d Saoud Al-Chahrani Al-Khodri. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State has not signed or ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the Government in having provided it 
with the requested information. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group forwarded to the source the reply of the Government. The source 
submitted its comments on the information given by the Government. In the light of the 
allegations made, the reply of the Government and the comments of the source thereon the 
Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion. 
</p>
<p>5. According to the information submitted by the source, Mr. Chaalane bin Sa&#239;d Saoud 
Al-Chahrani Al-Khodri, a citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, born on 27 May 1979 and 
resident in Iskane Al-Azizia, Al-Khobar, is currently held in detention at Dammam in a detention 
centre under the authority of the Saudi Intelligence Services. 
</p>
<p>6. It was reported that Mr. Al-Khodri went to Iraq in 2003. In June 2003, he was arrested by 
United States military forces reportedly because of his Saudi nationality and under suspicion of 
trying to contact armed opposition forces. He was allegedly tortured during his interrogation. 
Later he was transferred to Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. In April 2004, after 10 months in 
detention, he was released and immediately returned to his country. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>7. Upon his return, Mr. Al-Khodri learnt that all persons who had been in Iraq and then 
returned to Saudi Arabia were systematically arrested. After a Royal Amnesty Decree had been 
issued, on 18 June 2004, Mr. Al-Khodri, who was living at liberty, decided to present himself to 
a police station, being immediately arrested. No reason was given to him for his arrest and no 
arrest warrant was shown. He was interrogated about his stay in Iraq and suffered from acts of 
ill-treatment. Later, he was transferred to Dammam detention centre, run under the authority of 
the Intelligence Services. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the source, for more than two years at present, Mr. Al-Khodri has neither 
been formally charged with any offence, nor informed of the eventual duration of his detention. 
He has not been brought before a judicial officer, nor has he been provided the possibility to 
challenge the legality of his detention. 
</p>
<p>9. The source alleges that the detention of Mr. Al-Khodri is arbitrary because it is devoid of 
any legal basis. The authorities have so far failed to provide any decision justifying his arrest and 
detention, which constitutes a violation not only of international norms but also of Saudi 
domestic law, in particular articles 2 and 4 of the Royal Decree No. M.39 of 19 October 2001. 
According to the source, these norms establish that a person shall only be deprived of his liberty 
in cases provided for by law, shall be detained only for the duration decided by the authorities, 
shall not be subjected to ill-treatment, and shall have the right to seek the assistance of a lawyer 
during the investigation phase and at trial. 
</p>
<p>10. Mr. Al-Khodri has also been denied the right to an effective remedy by the competent 
national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted to him by the Constitution or 
by law and the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. 
</p>
<p>11. In its reply, the Government alleges that Mr. Al-Khodri was detained on 30 June 2004 for 
illegally entering Saudi Arabia across Iraqi borders. After interrogation he has been accused of 
illegally entering Iraq with the intention to engage in fighting there and convicted accordingly. 
According to the Government Mr. Al-Khodri is now being imprisoned as a result of his trial and 
verdict. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government further referred the Working Group to the fact that the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, in its endeavour to combat terror and secure its border, is, like other members of 
the international community, determined to fight all forms of terror in a manner consistent with 
its obligations pursuant to international conventions. 
</p>
<p>13. According to the comments of source, the Saudi Government&#8217;s response is merely 
restricted to confirming that Mr. Al-Khodri was arrested for illegally entering Saudi Arabia on 
30 June 2004, that during his interrogation he confessed to having illegally adjourned to Iraq 
with the intention to engage in fighting, and that he is being detained in conformity with legal 
procedures. However, the response of the Government does not explain which judicial authority 
convicted Mr. Al-Khodri, by virtue of what kind of legal procedure he is currently detained, 
subject to which jurisdiction he was judged, and what kind of punishment was announced 
pursuant to which legal provision. 
</p>
<p>14. The Working Group starts to point out that the presentation of the facts and the explanation 
of the source and the Government are on major points contradictory. Yet, the allegations of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>parties coincide in that Mr Al-Khodri was detained in June 2004 and that since then he is in 
detention. The Government contended, and the source admitted - at least impliedly - that the 
deprivation of liberty of Mr Al-Khodri is linked to his alleged involvement in the hostilities in 
Iraq. It is also admitted that the Saudi authorities, in their legitimate attempt to fight against 
international terrorism, detain anyone who returns from Iraq by illegally crossing the border. 
</p>
<p>15. According to the opinion of the Working Group, the Government did not put forward 
convincing arguments justifying the holding in detention of Mr Al-Khodri for almost two and a 
half years. It does not transpire from the information of the Government either, whether the 
criminal proceeding is ongoing, and if so, it is in the investigation or trial against him phase, 
already convicted. The Government did not contest either the allegation of the source that the 
proceedings were unfair, in particular that Mr Al-Khodri was not given the opportunity to have, 
and to consult with, defence counsels. 
</p>
<p>16. Assessing all the information before it the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr Chalaane bin Sa&#239;d Saoud Al-Chahrani Al-Khodri is 
arbitrary being in contravention of article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and falls under category III of the categories applicable to the consideration of cases 
submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>17. Consequent upon the opinion rendered the Working Group requests the Government to 
remedy the situation of Mr Al-Khodri and to bring it into conformity with the provisions of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

<p><b>OPINION No. 38/2006 (ALGERIA) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 29 September 2005. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. M&#8217;hamed Benyamina and Mr. Mourad Ikhlef. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having provided the 
requested information in a timely manner. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government. It has transmitted the reply provided by the Government to the source, which 
provided the Working Group with its comments. The Working Group believes that it is in a 
position to render an opinion on the facts and circumstances of the case, in the context of the 
allegations made and the response of the Government thereto. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>5. According to the information from the source: M&#8217;hamed Benyamina is an Algerian 
national domiciled in France since 1997 and married to a French national since 1999. They have 
two children, and his wife is now pregnant with twins. He works as a butcher in the town of 
Trappes, in France. 
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Benyamina and his nephew, Madjid Benyamina, were arrested on 9 September 2005 at 
Oran airport in Algeria, by plain-clothes policemen. The two men were about to leave their 
country of origin after a family visit. They were immediately separated once their identities were 
confirmed. 
</p>
<p>7. Madjid Benyamina was released after four days of detention, and returned to France. He 
claims that the Algerian security forces informed him that his uncle had been arrested at the 
request of the French Government, and that the French Department for the Supervision of Alien 
Activity in France had provided the information on his presence in Algeria. During his four days 
in detention, officers reportedly questioned Madjid Benyamina about his uncle&#8217;s activities in 
France, as his uncle was suspected of belonging to a terrorist organization. 
</p>
<p>8. Neither the family of M&#8217;hamed Benyamina nor his lawyer received any information on his 
status or his place of detention. According to the judicial register, he was not brought before any 
Algerian court. Six months after his arrest, his place of detention was still unknown. 
Mr. Benyamina was released in March 2006 following a presidential amnesty decree concerning 
the implementation of the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation of 27 February 2006. 
</p>
<p>9. At 6 p.m. on 2 April 2006, he was again arrested by plain-clothes policemen from the 
Department of Intelligence and Security (<i>D&#233;partement du Renseignement et de la S&#233;curit&#233;</i> 
(DRS)) while he was staying with his family at their house in Tiaret, in western Algeria. He was 
brought to DRS premises in Tiaret, where he was detained all night. On the morning of 3 April, 
his brother attempted to obtain information from officers at those premises, and was informed 
that M&#8217;hamed Benyamina had been interrogated and released the following morning. However, 
in reality, instead of being released, M&#8217;hamed Benyamina was transferred on 3 April to the 
capital, Algiers, probably to other DRS premises, before being transferred again, on 5 April, to 
Serkadj prison in Algiers. He reportedly never had the opportunity to see a lawyer, nor was he 
informed of the reasons for his rearrest. Furthermore, it is unclear whether he was formally 
charged. 
</p>
<p>10. Mourad Ikhlef was arrested on 28 February 2003 after being extradited from Canada to 
Algeria. He had been detained in Canada for alleged ties with Ahmed Ressam, suspected of 
having attempted to enter the United States of America in 1999 with explosives. Mr. Ikhlef was 
held incommunicado for 10 days by DRS and was subsequently sentenced, during a trial that 
was qualified as unfair, to seven years&#8217; imprisonment for membership of a terrorist group 
operating abroad and for acting against the interests of Algeria. Mr. Ikhlef was released on 
26 March 2006 under the presidential decree implementing the Charter for Peace and National 
Reconciliation of 27 February 2006, and prosecution for the other crimes of which he was 
suspected was terminated. 
</p>
<p>11. On 3 April 2006 at 1 a.m., Mr. Mourad Ikhlef was again arrested at his home in Algiers, in 
the El Harrach district, by 10 plain-clothes DRS officers, accompanied by uniformed policemen. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>The officers presented no warrant or other legal document justifying the arrest, nor did they even 
state the reasons for the arrest. Mr. Ikhlef&#8217;s family is still unaware of the grounds for the arrest. 
</p>
<p>12. According to the Government&#8217;s observations, on 6 February 2006 
Mr. M&#8217;hamed Benyamina was placed in pretrial detention by the examining magistrate of the 
second chamber of the Sidi M&#8217;hamed court in Aligers; he was charged with membership of a 
terrorist organization active in Algeria and abroad. 
</p>
<p>13. On 7 March 2006, the indictment division of the Algiers court issued a decision 
terminating criminal proceedings against Mr. Benyamina and ordering his release, in application 
of articles 4 to 11 of Order No. 06/01 of 27 February 2006 implementing the Charter for Peace 
and National Reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>14. In reality, Mr. Benyamina, who had been implicated in extremely serious acts of terrorism, 
could not benefit from the termination of criminal proceedings but only from a commutation or 
remission of the sentence after the verdict, in application of articles 18 to 20 of the 
aforementioned Order. 
</p>
<p>15. After bringing the case before the indictment division, the Procurator-General once again 
placed Mr. Benyamina in detention, in application of article 3 of Order No. 06-01 implementing 
the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation. The article stipulates that &#8220;the indictment 
division shall be competent to rule on incidental matters that may arise in the application of the 
provisions of this chapter&#8221; of the Order in question. 
</p>
<p>16. It should be noted that Mr. Benyamina was the subject of an international letter rogatory 
issued by the Italian judicial authorities on 18 April 2006, relating to two investigations under 
way in Italy involving charges of membership of a terrorist organization; Mr. Benyamina is 
implicated in those investigations. 
</p>
<p>17. Mr. Benyamina is also the subject of an international letter rogatory issued by the French 
authorities in a case involving Mr. Benyamina that is being investigated by the examining 
magistrate of the Paris court. Mr. Benyamina is accused of criminal association with the 
intention of preparing terrorist acts, financing terrorism, extortion, possession of false documents 
and possession of illegal weapons. 
</p>
<p>18. Mr. Yekhlef Mourad [<i>sic</i>], the subject of an international arrest warrant issued 
on 7 March 1993 by the examining magistrate of the Sidi M&#8217;hamed court in Algiers, was 
arrested on 1 March 2003 by the Oran airport police while entering Algeria from Canada. 
</p>
<p>19. He was transferred to Algiers and brought before the judge who had issued the arrest 
warrant. He was charged by the judge with membership of a terrorist organization operating 
abroad. 
</p>
<p>20. On 7 March 2006, the indictment division of the Algiers court issued a decision 
terminating criminal proceedings against Yekhlef Mourad [<i>sic</i>] and ordering his release, in 
application of articles 4 to 11 of Order No. 06/01 of 27 February 2006 implementing the Charter 
for Peace and National Reconciliation. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>21. In reality, Mr. Mourad, who had been implicated in extremely serious acts of terrorism, 
could not benefit from the termination of criminal proceedings but only from a commutation or a 
remission of the sentence after the verdict, in application of articles 18 to 20 of the 
aforementioned Order. 
</p>
<p>22. After bringing the case before the indictment division, the Procurator-General once again 
placed Mr. Mourad in detention, in application of article 3 of Order No. 06-01 implementing the 
Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation. The article stipulates that &#8220;the indictment division 
shall be competent to rule on incidental matters that may arise in the application of the 
provisions of this chapter&#8221; of the Order in question. 
</p>
<p>23. In response to the communication sent by the Government on 15 August 2006, the source 
raised two important points: first, the Government failed to address the question of the legality of 
Mr. Benyamina&#8217;s detention during his five months of imprisonment, which was not authorized 
by a court decision, on DRS premises. What is more, according to the source, the procedures for 
reviewing the improper application of the amnesty law in respect of the aforementioned 
detainees - which subsequently led to their rearrest - were unlawful. Specifically, the adversarial 
principle was not respected, insofar as the defendants did not have an opportunity to challenge 
the warrant for their rearrest. 
</p>
<p>24. According to the Government&#8217;s observations, Mr. Benyamina and Mr. Ikhlef were arrested 
in accordance with two arrest warrants issued by the competent judicial authorities. They were 
tried in two separate proceedings for their respective implication in terrorist activities. The 
criminal proceedings brought against them were under way when the two detainees were 
released under the amnesty law proclaimed by the Charter for Peace and National 
Reconciliation. However, following the release of Mr. Benyamina and Mr. Ikhlef, the authorities 
concluded that the release had been the result of a misapplication of that amnesty law. In fact, for 
similar cases, the law provided that, on the contrary, criminal proceedings, once begun, should 
not be terminated. On the other hand, it they had been convicted, Mr. Benyamina and Mr. Ikhlef 
would have benefited from the application of article 18 of the Charter, which deals with the 
commutation or remission of the sentences of persons not covered by measures to terminate 
criminal proceedings, and with pardons. Consequently, two arrest warrants were reissued. 
</p>
<p>25. While welcoming the steps taken by Algeria for national reconciliation, the Working 
Group considers that the procedures established for the application of the amnesty law should 
also respect the principles and requirements of a fair and equitable trial, in particular the 
adversarial principle, which is fundamental to criminal procedure. The Government contends 
that the termination of criminal proceedings against Mr. Benyamina and Mr. Ikhlef was decided 
by the indictment division. In other words, that means that the competent judicial body handed 
down a decision that terminated criminal proceedings against these persons. 
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group is by no means challenging the fact that any misapplication of the 
amnesty law should be corrected. It regrets, however, that the Procurator-General&#8217;s application, 
which called into question the initial decision of the indictment division, was not considered in 
an adversarial procedure that would have allowed the defence to contest it by presenting its own </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>arguments. Furthermore, and bearing in mind that the Procurator-General&#8217;s application was 
prejudicial to Mr. Benyamina and Mr. Ikhlef, the principle of equality of arms between the 
prosecution and the defence was seriously undermined. This constitutes a violation of article 14 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Algeria is a party. 
</p>
<p>27. Having concluded that such a violation took place, the Working Group did not deem it 
necessary to consider the other allegations put forward by the source, in particular those relating 
to the illegality of Mr. Benyamina&#8217;s five months of detention by DRS. 
</p>
<p>28. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. M&#8217;hamed Benyamina and Mr. Mourad Ikhlef is 
arbitrary, being in contravention of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and falls within category III of the categories applicable to the 
consideration of the cases submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>29. The Working Group requests the Government of the People&#8217;s Democratic Republic of 
Algeria to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and bring it into conformity with the 
principles set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p><b>OPINION No. 39/2006 (TAJIKISTAN) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 3 August 2004.

<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having provided the 
requested information. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government. The Working Group transmitted the reply provided by the Government to the 
source. The Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and 
circumstances of the case, in the context of the allegations made and the response of the 
Government thereto. 
</p>
<p>5. The allegation of the source that Mr. Iskandarov was and is being the victim of arbitrary 
detention can be summarized as follows. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Mahmadruzi Iskandarov, born on 3 May 1954, of Tajik nationality, temporarily living 
in Moscow, taken away in Korolyov district in Moscow on 15 April 2005 by unidentified forces 
and brought back to Tajikistan by force, currently detained in the pretrial detention centre of the 
Ministry of Security of Tajikistan in Dushanbe. 
</p><p>7. It is reported that Mr. Iskandarov is the general director of the State unitary company 
Tadjikgaz as well as being the Chairman of the Democratic Party of Tajikistan, one of the main 
opposition parties. Mr. Iskandarov had left Tajikistan and was living in Moscow, where he had 
applied for refugee status. 
</p>
<p>8. It is further reported that Mr. Iskandarov was accused by the Tajik authorities of 
embezzlement in his capacity as the general director of the State company Tadjikgaz, and also of 
terrorism, illegal use of personal bodyguards as well as illegal possession of firearms and 
ammunitions. 
</p>
<p>9. The source mentions that in 2004 the Tajik authorities applied to the Russian Federation to 
extradite Mr. Iskandarov for the above-mentioned accusations on the basis of an existing arrest 
order. The Russian police arrested Mr. Iskandarov in December 2004 and requested the Tajik 
authorities to provide supporting documents in order to decide the issue of extradition. It is 
alleged that the Russian Prosecutor in charge of this matter concluded that Mr. Iskandarov was 
not guilty of the accusations presented against him, and in April 2005, he was released. 
</p>
<p>10. The source reports that on 15 April 2005, Mr. Iskandarov was apprehended in the 
Korolyov district in Moscow by unknown persons who did not identify themselves nor show him 
an arrest warrant or any other judicial order. From 15 April to the evening of 16 April, he was 
kept incommunicado in a bathhouse and later in a forest. He was then brought to Dushanbe, 
Tajikistan, by plane against his will and without his identity documents since these had been left 
in Moscow. 
</p>
<p>11. It is alleged that Mr. Iskandarov&#8217;s whereabouts were found when he was located at the 
pretrial detention centre (investigatory jail) under the authority of the Ministry of Security of 
Tajikistan. He is being charged for the offences mentioned above and awaiting trial. 
</p><p>12. According to the source, the arrest and detention of the above-mentioned person is 
arbitrary because of his illegal abduction in a foreign country and forced transfer back to 
Tajikistan, whereas the Russian authorities had examined the request for extradition presented by 
the Tajik authorities and concluded that he was not guilty of the accusations, and released him. It 
is also mentioned that the detention and the charges held against Mr. Iskandarov are related to 
his political activities as a leader of an opposition party critical to the Tajik Government. 
13. In its observations, the Government informs that: in 2003 the prosecution authorities 
opened and carried out an inspection at Tadjikgaz, an enterprise under the direction of 
Mr. Iskandarov. The inspection revealed serious irregularities in the financial management 
giving rise to suspicion that a considerable amount of money has been embezzled. On this 
ground a criminal investigation was opened. Mr. Iskandarov was heard by the authorities (it is 
unclear, whether as a witness or a person charged). The hearing went on through several days in 
August 2004. While the hearing by the investigation authorities was still going on, he informed 
the authorities that he had to travel to Moscow for an urgent family matter. The authorities </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>consented on condition that he undertakes to come back in September, but he did not return. The 
Tajik authorities sought his extradition from the Russian Federation. He was first arrested by the 
Russian authorities pending extradition, but later released. Before a final decision was taken 
concerning his extradition, he disappeared from his flat in Moscow and some days later showed 
up in a prison in the Tajik capital Dushanbe. The Government emphasizes that he &#8220;(&#8230;) was 
officially handed over to the Tajik side by the law enforcement authorities of the 
Russian Federation&#8221;. Upon his reappearance in Tajikistan he was placed in pretrial detention in 
April 2005. 
</p>
<p>14. The investigations into the charges against Mr. Iskandarov have been continuously carried 
out and were completed in July 2005. The prosecution indicted him and some of his accomplices 
with serious offences. These were: terrorism, banditry, unlawful acquisition, transfer, supply, 
storage and transportation of large quantities of firearms, ammunition, explosive substances and 
devices by a group of persons in prior conspiracy, embezzlement or fraudulent use of especially 
large amounts of others&#8217; property and illegal engagement in private protection (bodyguardship). 
Mr. Iskandarov was found guilty and sentenced to 23 years&#8217; imprisonment by the Supreme 
Court. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government emphasized that the trial against Mr. Iskandarov was fair; he had the 
assistance of defence lawyers and all his allegations asserting that he made confession before the 
investigation authorities under duress were examined in court and declared unfounded. The 
Government also stressed that Mr. Iskandarov had been given all the means to defend himself. 
</p>
<p>16. The source, in a letter dated 17 November 2006, informed the Working Group that the 
lawyers of Mr. Iskandarov have not produced any material to comment on the observations of 
the Government. Instead, the source submitted a copy of a letter written by the brother of 
Mr. Iskandarov. The content of this letter however does not clarify the position of the source, as 
to the reply of the Government. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group considers deprivation of liberty arbitrary, when (a) it manifestly lacks 
any legal basis, (b) it punishes the peaceful exercise of one&#8217;s fundamental freedoms like freedom 
of expression or opinion, or (c) the establishment of guilt is the result of an unfair trial. 
</p>
<p>18. In the present case the two first grounds for arbitrary detention are obviously irrelevant. On 
the one hand, the Government provided the Working Group not only with information 
concerning the offences for which Mr. Iskandarov was prosecuted against and found guilty but 
also with the relevant text of the Tajik criminal legislation. On the other hand, however, the 
source argues that the charges against him were motivated by his being a political opponent to 
the Government, not even the source contended that Mr. Iskandarov is punished for the peaceful 
exercise of his fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group observed that the principal complaint raised in the communication is 
Mr. Iskandarov&#8217;s alleged abduction from the Russian Federation to Tajikistan. Since the 
allegations of the source and the Government are completely contradictory in this regard, and the 
Russian Federation, under whose jurisdiction the alleged abduction was carried out, does not 
take part in the present proceeding, the Working Group is not in a position to take a stand in the 
matter of this allegation of the source. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group also noted that the source did not raise the issue of alleged procedural 
unfairness in the trial against Mr. Iskandarov. This might be explained by the fact that the 
communication was submitted on 20 May 2005, shortly after he reappeared in Tajikistan, but 
well before the trial against him began. 
</p>
<p>21. Yet, the Working Group felt duty-bound to analyse the material at its disposal from the 
aspect of procedural fairness. In the available material before it, however, it could not identify 
any such serious lack of observance of the international standards relating to a fair trial as to 
confer on the deprivation of liberty of Mr. Iskandarov an arbitrary character. 
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group delivers the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> On the basis of the material before it, the Working Group could not conclude 
whether or not the deprivation of liberty of Mahmudruzi Iskandarov is arbitrary.

<p><b>OPINION No. 40/2006 (ALGERIA) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 18 July 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Abdelmadjid Touati. 
The State is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having provided the 
requested information in a timely manner. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government. It has transmitted the reply provided by the Government to the source. The 
Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and 
circumstances of the case, in the context of the allegations made and the response of the 
Government thereto. 
</p>
<p>5. Abdelmadjid Touati, a native of Tiaret, is a mason who at the time of his arrest was 
working at a construction site in the Bachdjarah district of Algiers. He was arrested with several 
other persons in Algiers on 18 March 2006 by agents of the intelligence and security service and 
was reportedly taken to the Ben Aknoun military barracks, which is used by the Algerian 
intelligence service, the Department of Intelligence and Security (<i>D&#233;partement du 
Renseignement et de la S&#233;curit&#233;</i>, DRS). </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>6. It was reported that, a few weeks after his arrest, there was a wave of arrests in the town of 
Tiaret. Several people were charged with offences under the anti-terrorism legislation and 
accused of planning to go to Iraq to support several armed organizations operating in that 
country. 
</p>
<p>7. Mr. Touati is reportedly being held incommunicado. His family has not been informed of 
his place of detention and has had no news of him for over five months. The 12-day period of 
police custody authorized by article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has long since lapsed. 
According to information from the source, Mr. Touati has still not appeared before an examining 
magistrate or a representative of the prosecution, and no charges have been filed against him. 
</p>
<p>8. Fears have been expressed regarding the lengthy period of incommunicado detention, 
which facilitates the use of torture and in itself constitutes a form of cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment. The fears expressed by the source refer specifically to Mr. Touati&#8217;s physical 
and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>9. According to the source, Mr. Touati should have been permitted to contact his family and 
receive visits. What is more, there has been infringement of his right to the services of a lawyer 
in order to prepare his full answer and defence. 
</p>
<p>10. According to the Government&#8217;s observations: &#8220;On 6 April 2006, the judicial police 
proceeded to arrest a terrorist group of which the person known as Abdelmadjid Touati, alias 
&#8216;Abou Moutna&#8217;, was a member. This group included foreign nationals (particularly Tunisians) 
who were also under investigation for terrorist activities. Considering that the activities of the 
person known as Abdelmadjid Touati, alias &#8216;Abou Moutna&#8217;, constitute a breach of the peace 
under Algerian law, on 18 June 2006 the Ministry of the Interior and Local Communities issued 
an arrest warrant (<i>mesure d&#8217;assignation</i>) for him, in accordance with the legislation on the state 
of emergency.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>11. The Government considers that the rules for police custody have been scrupulously 
observed. In short, the situation of the person known as Abdelmadjid Touati, alias 
&#8220;Abou Moutna&#8221;, does not constitute arbitrary detention, and his physical integrity has in no way 
been threatened. 
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group does not contest the legitimate right of any State to combat terrorism. 
However, it points out that efforts to combat terrorism must respect human rights and that, in all 
circumstances, any measure involving deprivation of liberty must be in conformity with the 
standards of international law. The Security Council and the General Assembly, recognizing the 
importance of combating terrorism, recall the commitment of States to ensure that any measure 
taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular 
international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>13. In the present case, the Government has not presented any convincing arguments to refute 
the source&#8217;s allegations, particularly those that claim that Mr. Touati did not have the benefit of a 
fair and just trial allowing him to contest the charges brought against him, which implicated him 
in terrorist activities. The Working Group notes that, in its reply, the Government does not 
dispute the fact that Mr. Touati has not appeared before a judge and has not been in a position to 
instruct counsel for his defence. Nor has it disputed the fact that Mr. Touati has been held 
incommunicado for seven months, without being able to communicate with his family and 
without his family being informed of his arrest and place of detention. 
</p>
<p>14. To justify this situation, the Government points out that, on 18 April 2006, the Ministry of 
the Interior and Local Communities issued an arrest warrant (<i>mesure d&#8217;assignation</i>) for him in 
accordance with the legislation on the state of emergency. The Working Group notes that the 
Government does not specify what it means by <i>assignation</i>. If what is meant is &#8220;house arrest&#8221; 
(<i>assignation &#224; r&#233;sidence</i>), Mr. Touati is not currently under house arrest, but is being held 
incommunicado, since his family is unaware of his whereabouts. If he is being held in preventive 
detention (<i>d&#233;tention administrative</i>), the Government does not specify the legal framework that 
authorizes such detention and the guarantees that would be applicable. Under international law, 
any deprivation of liberty is subject to the provisions of article 9 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, to which Algeria is a party. 
</p>
<p>15. In its general comment No. 8 (1982) on article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (right to liberty and security of persons), the Human Rights Committee 
stipulated that: &#8220;Also if so-called preventive detention is used, for reasons of public security, it 
must be controlled by these same provisions, i.e. it must not be arbitrary, and must be based on 
grounds and procedures established by law (para. 1), information of the reasons must be given 
(para. 2) and court control of the detention must be available (para. 4) as well as compensation in 
the case of a breach (para. 5). And if, in addition, criminal charges are brought in such cases, the 
full protection of article 9 (2) and (3), as well as article 14, must also be granted.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. In its reply, the Government refers to the state of emergency in force in Algeria, without 
specifying whether a legislative measure authorizing the Minister of the Interior to take steps to 
restrict liberty is in force in Algeria. In any event, and even if such a measure exists, the 
Working Group considers that deprivation of liberty ordered by an administrative authority 
without judicial supervision and all the necessary guarantees is not in keeping with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Algeria is a party. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group further recalls that Mr. Touati has been deprived of his liberty because 
of his presumed participation in an offence and that a number of guarantees and specific rights 
are therefore applicable to him under international human rights law. Such guarantees are 
applicable regardless of whether the suspicions against him have been formulated in criminal 
charges. The Working Group considers that, when &#8220;administrative detention&#8221; (<i>internement 
administratif</i>) is applied under public safety legislation in order to circumvent judicial guarantees 
and detain persons suspected of participation in terrorist activities or other crimes, it is also in 
contravention of the provisions of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which Algeria is a party. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>18. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p>  The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Touati is arbitrary, being in contravention of 
articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and falls 
within category III of the categories applicable to the consideration of the cases submitted 
to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group requests the Government of the People&#8217;s Democratic Republic of 
Algeria to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and bring it into conformity with the 
principles set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having provided the 
requested information. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government. The Working Group transmitted the reply provided by the Government to the 
source and received its comments. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and 
circumstances of the case, in the context of the allegations made and the response of the 
Government thereto, as well as the observations by the source. 
</p>
<p>6. According to the information received, Daisuke Mori, a Japanese citizen and a convicted 
murderer, born on 28 April 1971, resident in Miyagi-ken, worked as an assistant nurse at the 
Hokuryo Clinic, located in Sendai City, Miyagi-ken, which was closed down on 10 March 2001. 
On 6 January 2001, around 8 a.m., Mr. Mori was visited at his house by several officers from the 
Miyagi Prefecture Police Department. They were guided by the head nurse of the Hokuryo 
Clinic. Mr. Mori was requested to voluntarily appear at the Miyagi Prefectural Police 
Headquarters, Izumi Station, in order to speak about an 11-year-old female patient of the clinic. 
The police officers did not inform Mr. Mori of the possibility to be arrested later or about his 
right to contact a lawyer or his right to remain silent. 
</p>
<p>7. At the police station, Mr. Mori was interrogated by a police officer who threatened him 
and slandered against his father, who was also a police officer. Further, the officer made 
insulting remarks about Mr. Mori&#8217;s girlfriend. Mr. Mori was neither provided with breakfast nor 
lunch. At midnight, exhausted and without the presence of legal counsel, he signed a confession 
statement admitting his responsibility. Thereafter, he was arrested. The police officers showed an 
arrest warrant issued by the Sendai District Court. Mr. Mori was later transferred to the Miyagi 
Prefecture Headquarters in Sendai City. 
</p>
<p>8. On 9 January 2001, Mr. Mori withdrew his confession and admission of responsibility and 
denied all allegations made against him. As a consequence, the interrogation was conducted in a 
more severe manner. From 9 January 2001 to 31 March 2001, Mr. Mori was interrogated during 
10 hours every day. Both the police officers and the Public Prosecutor used abusive language 
against him including phrases such as &#8220;you should be executed&#8221;, &#8220;you are nothing but garbage 
among human beings&#8221; and the like. They were pounding the desk in the interrogation room 
repeatedly and forced him to confess his alleged crimes. 
</p>
<p>9. From 10 to 15 January 2001, Mr. Mori did not feel well and ran a fever of 38 centigrade. 
During that period he was subjected to continued interrogation during 12 hours each day, 
finishing at 11 p.m. The Public Prosecutor and the policemen replaced a back-supported chair 
with a stool although Mr. Mori told them that he chronically suffers from a herniated disc. 
</p>
<p>10. According to the source, on 20 January 2001, the Public Prosecutor became furious with 
Mr. Mori because he refused to write the confession statement. He violently kicked the front 
board of the desk, on the other side of which Mr. Mori&#8217;s shins were pressed hard in the sitting 
position. The violent kick caused Mr. Mori great pain on his right knee. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>11. Mr. Mori was later charged with destruction of evidence and attempted murder, according 
to article 199 of the Criminal Procedure Law of Japan. He was accused of &#8220;having mixed a 
muscle relaxant in a then 11-year-old patient&#8217;s intravenous drip on 31 October 2000, turning her 
into a vegetative state&#8221;. Subsequently, he was indicted with an alleged case of homicide and four 
alleged cases of attempted murder. 
</p>
<p>12. According to the source, the sudden death of the patient did not result from the muscle 
relaxants administered to her. The police made up a fictitious case of attempted murder. 
</p>
<p>13. The source adds that in criminal trials in Japan, the courts as well as the police tend to be 
overly dependent upon confessions as evidence. Some jurists even submit that in Japan 
&#8220;confession is the king of evidence&#8221;. False confessions obtained under pressure eventually lead 
to false charges. 
</p>
<p>14. Since the time of his arrest, Mr. Mori was prohibited to meet with his family members 
except for two occasions. On 25 August 2003, his mother was allowed to see him. On 
26 September 2003, his father was granted a meeting with him for 10 minutes. Even today, he is 
not allowed to see or communicate with people other than his family members or his defence 
counsels. 
</p>
<p>15. According to the source, although Mr. Mori was requested to appear at the police station 
voluntarily, he was the victim of violent interrogatories conducted behind locked doors. The 
police conducted his investigation in an unjust way. He was induced to make a false initial 
confession simply because he was exhausted and could not bear the examination any further. 
Interrogatories were conducted for a long period of time each day, accompanied by threats, 
insults and violence. 
</p>
<p>16. The source adds that in Japan, once charged, the rate of being convicted 
reaches 99.9 per cent. Mr. Mori was a victim of false charges which were the result of a 
confession obtained by means of threats and tricks; taking advantage of starvation and lack of 
sufficient sleep caused by the long time questioning. Though he later denied his responsibility, 
he was charged on the basis of the initial false confession made without counsel of a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>17. In its response, the Government points out that Mr. Mori committed the murder of one 
patient and attempted four more cases of murder through asphyxiation by putting muscle 
relaxation medicine into the patients&#8217; intravenous drips, specifically, vecuronium bromide, a 
neuromuscular blocking agent which causes cardiovascular effects. 
</p>
<p>18. According to the Government, Mr. Mori was prosecuted for murder and attempted murder 
on 6 and 26 January, 16 February, 9 and 30 March and 20 April 2001. Except for the latter date 
he was arrested on each of the days. During the trial of first instance, Mr. Mori pleaded that it 
was not true that he had administered muscle relaxation medicine. These incidents had been 
contrived by the clinic. He added that the confession which he made soon after his arrest had 
been forced by the police. However, these claims were not substantiated. On 30 March 2004, the 
court of first instance sentenced him to life imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government reports that Mr. Mori&#8217;s arrest was effected in accordance with article 199 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure and upon a warrant issued by a judge. His detention was </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>carried out in conformity with article 60 of the above-mentioned Code. The prohibition of 
interviews during the period of detention was imposed by the judges in conformity with 
article 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which establishes the possibility of pretrial 
detention if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the defendant will escape or that he will 
destroy or conceal evidence. 
</p>
<p>20. In its comments and observations to the Government&#8217;s reply, the source points out that it 
neglects the fundamental rule of the law that &#8220;anyone is presumed innocent unless he is proved 
otherwise&#8221;. The Japanese Government couched its &#8220;Summary of the Facts&#8221; not in terms of &#8220;the 
suspected facts&#8221; but in terms of &#8220;the committed crime&#8221;. The Government has no evidence to 
conclude that Mr. Mori &#8220;committed murder&#8221; and &#8220;attempted four more murders&#8221; since he has 
completely denied the suspicion and is contending with it. 
</p>
<p>21. It is not fair to state that the defendant&#8217;s &#8220;claims were not substantiated&#8221;, because the 
burden of proof rests with the public prosecutor. Only when the public prosecutor proved 
without any reasonable doubt that a suspect has committed a crime, he or she can be convicted of 
that crime. In Japan, however, this basic principle of criminal procedure is not being respected. 
In general, the legal proceedings are carried out as if the defendant carries the burden of proof 
regarding his or her innocence. The reply by the Government indicates that the defendant bears 
the responsibility of proving his innocence, when it states that &#8220;these claims were not 
substantiated in the trial&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. The source points out that it had questioned how the law is put into practice. However, the 
Government merely elaborates about what the regulations are. The real issues, however, to 
which the Government has not replied, were in fact the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) The defendant was asked to go to the police station without being told the reason and 
without being provided with the notice of the right to remain silent; 
</p>
<p> (b) The defendant was provided with false facts (e.g. that there was the result of a 
polygraph test which he failed) and was interrogated threateningly; 
</p>
<p> (c) After the defendant had withdrawn his confession, he was interrogated for 10 hours a 
day for 26 days. During the interrogation he was made to sit on a stool without a backrest and he 
was subjected to indirect violence (e.g. hitting the desk and kicking against the wall). 
</p><p>23. The Working Group, after having received the comments from the source on 7 July 2006, 
addressed the Government again, asking for more information about the circumstances 
surrounding the trial of first instance in which Daisuke Mori was declared the author of a murder 
in addition to four attempted murders. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government in essence responded the following on 22 August 2006: The judgement 
of the court of first instance, running up to 426 pages, meticulously assessed the evidence 
produced by both the Prosecutor and the defence counsel. The Court determined the delinquency 
of Mr. Mori without actually resorting to his confession, which merely served as corroboration. 
Concerning the voluntariness of his confession the Court decided that the procedure of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>investigation including the interrogation was in fact conducted legally, since the defendant was 
appropriately informed, as prescribed by law, of his right to remain silent at the beginning of the 
interrogation. There were no established facts that police officers unjustifiably and forcibly 
compelled him to confess during the course of the interrogation or at any other time. 
</p>
<p>25. The source observes in its comments to the second Government&#8217;s reply that Japanese 
Regional and High Courts do not respect the principle of <i>in dubio pro reo</i>, whereas this is one of 
the fundamental principles to be applied in criminal procedures. In this connection, the source 
raises serious doubts in law and in fact with respect to the reliability of expert opinions 
introduced in court concerning sample material taken from the victims. 
</p>
<p>26. The source disagrees with the Court&#8217;s interpretation of evidence as no witness testified 
against Mr. Mori and the expert evidence carried many inexactitudes with respect to the amount 
of vecuronium found in the patient&#8217;s intravenous drip. 
</p>
<p>27. The source reiterates, in spite of the Government&#8217;s allegations to the contrary, that while 
Mr. Mori was present in the police station on 6 January 2001, he was not informed of his right to 
remain silent and of his right to consult a lawyer. The source further reiterated that Mr. Mori was 
threatened and not provided with any food during the day of his interrogation. Finally, the source 
refers to the fact that neither the defendant nor his lawyers were informed about the date of his 
appeal in court. 
</p>
<p>28. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group notes at the outset that the 
Government denies that it did not inform Mr. Mori of his right to remain silent at the police 
station; however, it affirms in line with the source that Mr. Mori withdrew his confession 
statement and declared himself innocent after consulting with his lawyer. Moreover, Mr. Mori 
remained merely 24 hours without access to a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>29. Although article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereinafter 
ICCPR) does not explicitly state that all accused persons shall be assisted by a lawyer when 
interrogated at a police station, the Working Group has consistently construed this provision to 
that effect as part of the right of defence and considers the presence of a lawyer desirable in such 
situations. However, we do not consider it to be an infraction of the right to fair trial if, as has 
occurred in the present case, the defendant is initially interrogated without the benefit of a 
lawyer, but is able to consult one on the following day whereupon he withdraws his initial 
confession statement. 
</p>
<p>30. The possible mistreatment of Mr. Mori at the police station by not providing him with any 
food during one day and the rude and inappropriate behaviour of the Prosecutor when the 
defendant withdrew his confession is not serious enough to consider the trial as being unfair. 
</p>
<p>31. Both the source and the Government recognize that during the trial complicated expert 
evidence was presented and assessed by the Court. 
</p>
<p>32. Moreover, the source concedes that the evidence is insufficient to merit a declaration of 
annulment on the basis of a violation of the principle of presumption of innocence and the 
Working Group does not elaborate on such issues. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group is not an appellate court with the competence to review the evaluation 
of evidence presented in Japanese courts. It is merely competent to test whether, as declared in 
article 14 of ICCPR, the defendant has not been compelled to testify against himself or to 
confess guilt, whether he has enjoyed the opportunity to present all necessary evidence and the 
assistance of a lawyer, and whether he has been able to examine, or have examined, the 
witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf 
under the same conditions as witnesses against him.  
</p>
<p>34. The principle of <i>in dubio pro reo</i> forms a criterion for interpretation of evidence. Since this 
principle is not protected by the right to fair trial as defined in article 14 of ICCPR, it is not 
applicable in this case. 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group considers detention to be arbitrary if there has been a total or impartial 
inobservance of applicable international human rights norms on fair trial of such seriousness as 
to give the deprivation of liberty an arbitrary character. 
</p>
<p>36. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion:  
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Daisuke Mori is not arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>Adopted on 21 November 2006.

<p><b>OPINION No. 43/2006 (UNITED STATES OF AMERICA) 
Communication: addressed to the Government of the United States of America. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Ali Saleh Kahlah Al-Marri. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the Government, which provided the 
Working Group with information concerning the allegations of the source. The reply of the 
Government was brought to the attention of the source, which made observations in reply. 
</p>
<p>4. According to the information received, Ali Saleh Kahlah Al-Marri, 37 years old, a Qatari 
national, was arrested on 12 December 2001 by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, at 
the direction of the Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Al-Marri had 
entered the United States of America legally on 10 September 2001, with his wife and five 
children, to pursue postgraduate studies. 
</p>
<p>5. Mr. Al-Marri was held as a material witness in the investigation into 
the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the Ministry of Defense and the World Trade Center. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>On 28 January 2002, he was formally arrested and charged with &#8220;possessing unauthorized 
counterfeit access devices with intent to defraud&#8221;. Other charges of credit card fraud and making 
false statements to the FBI were subsequently added. 
</p>
<p>6. In June 2003, less than a month before he was due to stand trial, the President of the 
United States designated him as an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221;. The criminal charges were dropped. 
Mr. Al-Marri was then transferred to military custody in the Naval Consolidated Brig in 
Charleston, South Carolina. There, he was repeatedly interrogated. On one occasion, 
interrogators threatened to send him to Egypt or Saudi Arabia where, they told him, he would be 
tortured and sodomized, and his wife would be raped in front of him. Interrogators are also said 
to have falsely told him that some of his brothers and his father were in jail because of him, and 
promised that they would be released if he cooperated. Interrogations continued until 
approximately autumn 2005, but during the year 2006 Mr. Al-Marri has not been interrogated. 
</p>
<p>7. Mr. Al-Marri is the first non-United States national to be held as an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; on 
United States soil. He was held incommunicado from June 2003 to August 2004, when he was 
allowed a first visit from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). He has now had 
three visits from delegates of ICRC. 
</p>
<p>8. Since 23 June 2003, Mr. Al-Marri has been held, shackled, in a cell measuring 
approximately three by two metres. His cell is often made extremely cold. The water supply is 
sometimes turned off, forcing Mr. Al-Marri to defecate on his food tray in order to ensure that 
the faeces do not remain for days in the cell. The small cell window is covered with plastic, so 
that he is not able to see the outside world. A portable industrial fan is left on 24 hours a day near 
the door of his cell, making it difficult for him to sleep. It is reportedly turned up high when he is 
deemed to be &#8220;non-compliant&#8221;. Sometimes when he is sleeping, guards wake him by shaking 
him, or by banging constantly on his cell door. Mr. Al-Marri is allowed only brief periods 
outside his cell for exercise.  
</p>
<p>9. As a direct result of his prolonged isolation and other inhumane treatment, Mr. Al-Marri 
has experienced a number of symptoms that demonstrate severe damage to his mental and 
emotional well-being, including hypersensitivity to external stimuli, manic behaviour, difficulty 
concentrating and thinking, obsessive thinking, difficulty with impulse control, difficulty 
sleeping, difficulty keeping track of time and agitation.  
</p>
<p>10. Moreover, the source notes that, as a result of these conditions of detention, he has 
developed a number of medical problems including sharp and debilitating tingling pains in his 
legs, vision problems, including seeing flickering lights and white spots, constant headaches, 
back pain, dizziness, uncontrollable tremors and ringing in his ears.  
</p>
<p>11. Mr. Al-Marri has not received adequate medical treatment for his declining mental and 
physical health. The prison doctors who have seen him have refused to deal adequately with his 
complaints. A medical doctor recommended that a special X-ray was needed to assess nerve 
damage, but his request was denied. Further medical recommendations that he be given a chair 
with a good cushion and a thicker mattress were also denied. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>12. Finally, the source reports that Mr. Al-Marri has been denied a prayer rug and has not been 
given a clock, making it impossible for him to know when to pray. It is also reported that prison 
officers mistreated and disrespectfully handled his copy of the Koran, discouraging free religious 
practice. 
</p>
<p>13. In its reply dated 11 May 2006, the United States Government confirms that 
on 23 June 2003, Mr. Al-Marri was designated as an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; by President Bush and 
that he is currently being held in military custody in the Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston, 
South Carolina. The Government also informs that it is involved in pending litigation concerning 
Mr. Al-Marri, and refers the Working Group to two briefs for the United States Government 
filed with the District Court of South Carolina and two recent judicial decisions concerning 
Mr. Al-Marri, which it encloses. According to the Government the documents referred to 
provide the background information requested by the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>14. On the basis of the four documents attached to the United States reply, the Government&#8217;s 
arguments before the domestic courts can be summarized as follows. 
</p>
<p>15. Mr. Al-Marri has been given the opportunity to contest the legality of his detention, as 
well as his conditions of detention. On 8 July 2003, his lawyer filed a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus in the Central District of Illinois. On 1 August 2003, the Court dismissed the 
petition on the ground that the petition had been filed in an improper venue. On 8 July 2004, 
Mr. Al-Marri filed a habeas corpus action before the District Court of South Carolina raising five 
claims: that he is a civilian and not an enemy combatant; that he has the right to counsel; that his 
detention is illegal because military cannot detain an individual seized within the United States 
without charge; that he has not been allowed to contest the President&#8217;s decision designating him 
as an enemy combatant; and that his indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is 
unlawful under the Constitution and the laws of the United States. 
</p>
<p>16. On 9 September 2004 the Government filed an answer and attached the President&#8217;s order 
declaring the petitioner an enemy combatant, an unclassified declaration of Mr. Jeffrey N. Rapp, 
Director Joint Intelligence Task Force for Combating Terrorism, and a classified secret 
declaration of Mr. Rapp. The Government argued that Mr. Al-Marri is properly detained as an 
enemy combatant, because the President exercised his constitutionally and congressionally 
authorized war powers. The authority to capture and hold enemy combatants for the duration of 
the conflict without charges is part and parcel of those war powers, especially when they are 
aliens. According to the Government, this assertion is well established in several judicial 
precedents, including <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</i> and other rulings regarding the detention of hundreds 
of thousands of aliens within the United States during the Second World War. Therefore, alien 
enemy combatants are afforded more limited process rights than citizens and the court&#8217;s factual 
review of the basis of the detention is very limited.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government also considered that Mr. Al-Marri is lawfully detained by the military, 
because his detention allows armed forces to gather military intelligence and prevents him from 
returning to the commission of hostile acts against the United States. Moreover, according to the 
Government&#8217;s answer, as stated in <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</i>, the executive is best prepared to exercise 
the military judgement attending the capture of alleged combatants and the judiciary must not </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>interfere in military operations. Furthermore, the President&#8217;s decision to designate Mr. Al-Marri 
as an enemy combatant rests on a strong intelligence foundation.<b>3</b> The Government also 
considered that the fact that Mr. Al-Marri was taken into custody within the United States does 
not place him outside the scope of Congress&#8217;s authorization to use force. 
</p>
<p>18. Finally, regarding petitions concerning aspects other than the legality of Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s 
detention, the Government considered that the military has granted him access to counsel, that he 
had the opportunity to contest the President&#8217;s decision designating him as an enemy combatant 
through the habeas corpus action, and contested his request regarding the ceasing of all 
interrogation while this litigation is pending, since interrogation is permissible under the laws of 
war. 
</p>
<p>19. On 8 July 2005, the judge issued an order dismissing the petition insofar as it was related 
to the question whether the President of the United States is authorized to detain a non-citizen as 
an enemy combatant. The judge also stated that Mr. Al-Marri could not rely on a precedent 
(<i>Padilla v. Hanft</i>) in favour of a person detained as an enemy combatant on United States soil, 
because - as opposed to Mr. Padilla - he is not an American citizen. The District Court Judge 
found that, firstly, citizens and aliens do not have the same constitutional protections. Secondly, 
the authority to detain enemy aliens in times of war is not a novel concept. Thirdly, the 
Authorization to Use of Military Force (AUMF), which was enacted to allow the President to use 
all necessary and appropriate force to protect the United States, also encompasses alien Al-Qaida 
operatives who entered the country to commit hostile and warlike acts, as Mr. Al-Marri. 
Therefore, Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s detention was legal. 
</p>
<p>20. On 8 August 2005, Mr. Al-Marri filed a complaint alleging that he was being subjected to 
unlawful and unconstitutional conditions of confinement in the naval brig. The Government 
answered on 27 October 2005, arguing sovereign immunity. The Government stated that the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, international treaties and other sources of international 
law referred to by Mr. Al-Marri in his petition did not create privately enforceable rights. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Director of the Joint Intelligence Task Force for combating terrorism dated 9 September 2004. 
</p>
<p>According to the unclassified declaration of Mr. Rapp, Mr. Al-Marri is an Al-Qaida &#8220;sleeper&#8221; 
agent sent to the United States for the purpose of engaging in and facilitating terrorist activities 
subsequent to 11 September 2001, and exploring ways to hack into the computer systems of 
United States banks and otherwise disrupt the United States financial system. According to the 
same declaration, Mr. Al-Marri attended an Al-Qaida training camp and was trained in the use of 
poisons. The analysis of his laptop revealed files containing lectures by Bin Laden and his 
associates on the importance of Jihad and martyrdom, lists of websites related to Al-Qaida 
activities, coded messages in his e-mail, pictures of the 11 September attacks, an animated 
cartoon of an airplane flying into the World Trade Center and a map of Afghanistan. The 
declaration also states that his computer contained a list of approximately 36 credit card numbers 
with the names of holders and dates of expiration, which would be used to achieve fraudulent 
operations, including opening bank accounts under a false name. None of these credit cards was 
held by Mr. Al-Marri. Finally, according to the declaration Mr. Al-Marri allegedly tried to call 
several times an Al-Qaida financer, Mr. Mustafa Ahmed Al-Hawsawi, in the United Arab 
Emirates. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p>Regarding the conditions of the detention, the Government affirmed that conditions of detention 
by military had always been a matter left to the discretion of military and executive branch 
officials, subject only to international obligations which are not enforceable. The Government 
also asserted that Mr. Al-Marri failed to allege facts that could establish that the detention 
&#8220;substantially burdened&#8221; the practice of his religion. Regarding the complaints related to library 
materials and correspondence with family and others, the Government stated that captured 
enemy combatants, in particular alien enemy combatants, during wartime do not have broad 
First Amendment (freedom of speech) rights. Moreover, the Government considered that alien 
enemy combatants do not have the rights consecrated in the Fourth Amendment (to be free of 
monitoring or observation during the detention) and the Eighth Amendment (prohibition of cruel 
and unusual punishment). Finally, the Government stated that there has not been any violation of 
the rights to due process consecrated in the Fifth Amendment, because Mr. Al-Marri has had the 
opportunity to contest the alleged violations through the habeas corpus action. 
</p>
<p>21. On 8 May 2006, Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s habeas corpus action filed on 8 July 2004 was rejected by 
the District Court of South Carolina. The Court found that, as stated in the Supreme Court&#8217;s 
decision in <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</i>, the burden of proof at all times remains on the Government to 
show by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner is an enemy combatant. The standard 
of review is thus limited to determining who is more persuasive on the issue of whether the 
petitioner falls outside the enemy combatant criteria, the Government or the petitioner. The 
Court found the Government to be more persuasive than the petitioner, because the petitioner 
only presented a general denial to the Government&#8217;s assertion of facts. The Court considered that 
Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s refusal to assume the burden of proving his own innocence was in fact a refusal 
to present any evidence and participate in a meaningful way in the proceedings.  
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group forwarded the observations of the Government to the source. In its 
submission in reply of 17 August 2006, the source reaffirmed that Mr. Al-Marri continues to be 
held indefinitely in United States military custody without charge or trial, pursuant to the 
executive order designating him as an enemy combatant signed by President Bush in June 2003. 
The source alleges that Mr. Al-Marri is entitled to full protection under both United States and 
international human rights law, including his right to not be arbitrarily detained, which cannot be 
derogated even in time of war or national emergency.  
</p>
<p>23. According to the source, United States lower court rulings which determined that the 
detained person must receive a notification of the factual basis for the classification as enemy 
combatant and must have a meaningful opportunity to rebut the Government&#8217;s assertions before 
a neutral decision maker, are not sufficient to fulfil the State&#8217;s international obligation to protect 
the right to not be arbitrarily detained. The source considers that Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s case can only be 
met by an adversarial proceeding through trial or preliminary hearing in the United States 
criminal courts, meeting all the guarantees of article 14 of ICCPR.  
</p>
<p>24. The source states that the habeas corpus proceeding, in which the burden was on 
Mr. Al-Marri to rebut the largely hearsay-based information presented by the Government, in no 
way satisfies the due process requirements under international law. 
</p>
<p>25. Furthermore, the source argues that Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s right to equal protection consecrated by 
article 26 of ICCPR has been violated, because individuals accused of similar acts and detained 
within United States territory have been tried or have trials pending in United States criminal </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>courts. The source also notes that the Committee against Torture in its concluding observations 
on the United States affirmed that detaining people indefinitely without charge constitutes per se 
a violation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment.<b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>26. Regarding the conditions of detention, the source affirms that the Government&#8217;s response 
arguing sovereign immunity and military discretion is not compatible with the State&#8217;s 
international human rights obligations. The source states that it is preoccupying that the 
Government has sought to foreclose judicial review of Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s conditions of detention, 
stating that its international obligations are not judicially enforceable in United States courts. 
This is worsened by the fact that Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s mental and physical health has been seriously 
affected by the conditions of his detention. 
</p>
<p>27. At the outset, the Working Group would like to stress that, in its observations, the 
Government of the United States did not comment on the arguments of the source and limited 
itself to affirming that Mr. Al-Marri was designated by President Bush as an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; 
on 23 June 2003 and that since then he is being held in military custody. The Government further 
enclosed four documents to provide background information. These documents address the 
legality of Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s detention under domestic law, but do not speak to its compatibility 
with the United States&#8217; international obligations. 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group notes that, in order not to be arbitrary, it is not sufficient that 
Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s detention is in accordance with United States domestic laws. Those laws and the 
way they are applied in the specific case must also be compatible with the international law 
binding for the United States. 
</p>
<p>29. The analysis of the documents provided by the Government confirms that Mr. Al-Marri, 
who legally entered the United States on 10 September 2001, was arrested by the FBI on 
12 December 2001 in the investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and kept in detention 
until 28 January 2002 under a federal law permitting the arrest and brief detention of &#8220;material 
witnesses&#8221;, i.e. persons who have important information about a crime, if they might otherwise 
flee to avoid testifying before a grand jury or in court. Although federal officials suspected 
Mr. Al-Marri of involvement in terrorism and were investigating him as a suspect of most 
serious crimes, they held him as a material witness, not as a criminal suspect. This was already 
an abuse of the law and a violation of the basic rights of a person suspected of involvement in a 
crime, i.e. the right to silence, the right to be assisted by a lawyer, the right to communicate with 
family and the right to be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to 
exercise judicial power.  
</p><p>30. It is also undisputed that Mr Al-Marri was formally charged on 28 January 2002 with 
credit card fraud and later on with other similar charges. He entered a plea of not guilty and was 
about to be tried before a grand jury (a pretrial conference was set for 2 July 2003), when on 
23 June 2003 the President designated him as an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; and directed that he be 
transferred to the control of the Defense Department for detention. The prosecution apparently 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  CAT/C/USA/CO/2, para. 17. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p>dropped the charges on which Mr. Al-Marri had been kept in pretrial detention for close to 
15 months. As a result, Mr. Al-Marri was transferred from United States criminal jurisdiction to 
military custody in South Carolina, where he was held incommunicado. In August 2004, 
i.e. more than a year later, he was allowed a visit from the ICRC and in October 2004 he was for 
the first time authorized to meet with his lawyers.<b>5</b> It is also not contested that as of to date he is 
not allowed any visits or telephone communication with his family and continues to be held 
under conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>31. As far as the term &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; is concerned, the Working Group recalls that it does 
not constitute a category recognized and defined under international law and therefore does not 
provide a ground for deprivation of liberty.<b>6</b> Concerning the case under consideration, the 
Working Group notes that Mr. Al-Marri, who is suspected of involvement in terrorist acts, was 
not captured on the battlefield of an armed conflict as defined by international humanitarian law. 
The Working Group considers that the struggle against international terrorism cannot be 
characterized as an armed conflict within the meaning that contemporary international law gives 
to that concept.<b>7</b> Therefore, the legal provision that could allow the United States to hold 
belligerents without charges for the duration of hostilities cannot be invoked to justify 
Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s indefinite detention. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  This would appear to be a consequence of the decision of the Supreme Court of the 
</p>
<p>United States of 28 June 2004 that the persons being held in Guant&#225;namo Bay as enemy 
combatants are entitled to legal counsel and to challenge the legality of their detention 
(United States (No. 03-343) 2004, <i>Rasul v. Bush</i> (No. 03-334) 2004).

<p>para. 21, and the Official Statement of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
dated 21 July 2005, regarding &#8220;The relevance of IHL in the context of terrorism&#8221; (available at 
&lt;http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/terrorism-ihl-210705?OpenDocument&gt;): 
&#8220;International humanitarian law (the law of armed conflict) recognizes two categories of armed 
conflict: international and non-international. International armed conflict involves the use of 
armed force by one State against another. Non-international armed conflict involves hostilities 
between government armed forces and organized armed groups or between such groups within a 
State. When and where the &#8216;global war on terror&#8217; manifests itself in either of these forms of 
armed conflict, international humanitarian law applies, as do aspects of international human 
rights and domestic law. For example, the armed hostilities that started in Afghanistan in 
October 2001 or in Iraq in March 2003 are armed conflicts. When armed violence is used outside 
the context of an armed conflict in the legal sense or when a person suspected of terrorist 
activities is not detained in connection with any armed conflict, humanitarian law does not apply. 
Instead, domestic laws, as well as international criminal law and human rights govern. [&#8230;] The 
designation &#8216;global war on terror&#8217; does not extend the applicability of humanitarian law to all 
events included in this notion, but only to those which involve armed conflict.&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>32. For these reasons, the Working Group considers that the detention of Mr. Al-Marri is 
governed by human rights law, specifically articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is party and which it did not 
derogate from in accordance with ICCPR article 4, paragraph 1.  
</p>
<p>33. Article 9, paragraph 1, ICCPR guarantees to everyone &#8220;the right to liberty and security of 
person&#8221;, prohibits &#8220;arbitrary arrest or detention&#8221; and states that &#8220;no one shall be deprived of his 
liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by 
law&#8221;. The prohibition of arbitrariness mentioned in paragraph 1 serves to ensure that the law 
itself is not arbitrary, i.e. that the deprivation of liberty permitted by law is not &#8220;manifestly 
unproportional, unjust or unpredictable, and that the specific manner in which an arrest is made 
must not be discriminatory and must be able to be deemed appropriate and proportional in view 
of the circumstances of the case&#8221;.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>34. In paragraph 4 of its general comment No. 8 (1982) concerning article 9 (right to liberty 
and security of persons), the Human Rights Committee lays down the elements that must be 
tested in determining the legality of so-called &#8220;preventive detention&#8221; (which the Working Group 
generally refers to as administrative detention): &#8220;&#8230; if so-called preventive detention is used, for 
reasons of public security, it must be controlled by these same provisions, i.e. it must not be 
arbitrary, and must be based on grounds and procedures established by law (para. 1), information 
of the reasons must be given (para. 2) and court control of the detention must be available 
(para. 4) as well as compensation in the case of a breach (para. 5). And if, in addition, criminal 
charges are brought in such cases, the full protection of article 9, paragraphs 2 and 3, as well as 
article 14, must be granted&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group recalls that Mr. Al-Marri was first deprived of his liberty as a material 
witness and in this capacity interrogated without the guarantees of a criminal defendant. Then he 
was charged and detained on remand for 15 months on charges which, though not light, are very 
minor in relation to the grounds on which the Government has been holding him since 
June 2004. When the moment for him to be able to challenge these charges was close, when his 
&#8220;day in court&#8221; was finally approaching after a year and a half, the President designated him as

</b>  The Human Rights Committee has considered, in the framework of a temporary or pretrial

<p>detention of a judicial nature, that: &#8220;The drafting history of article 9, paragraph 1, confirms that 
&#8216;arbitrariness&#8217; is not to be equated with &#8216;against the law&#8217;, but must be interpreted more broadly

<p>in custody of the United States Government on United States territory for a year and a half, was 
transformed by executive decree from criminal defendant into a person apprehended in the 
course of an armed conflict, and thus indefinitely deprived of the right to challenge his detention 
and defend himself against the accusations levelled against him. The Working Group concludes 
that this course of events strongly indicates that the Government intended (and in fact did) 
circumvent the guarantees afforded to Mr. Al-Marri in the criminal process, both under 
United States law and international law binding on the United States. 
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group stresses that under international human rights law deprivation of 
liberty is subject to certain conditions and, even if initially lawful, becomes arbitrary if it is not 
subject to periodic review. The Human Rights Committee has considered that the habeas corpus 
remedy has to be maintained at all times and in all circumstances, concerning any modality of 
deprivation of liberty, because it offers a protection against serious human rights violations such 
as torture.<b>9</b> Indefinite and prolonged detention &#8220;beyond the period for which the State can 
provide appropriate justification are incompatible with article 9&#8221;<b>10</b> of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights to which the United States is party.  
</p>
<p>37. Furthermore, the Working Group recalls that international human rights law provides for a 
number of rights specific to persons deprived of their liberty on the ground of suspicion that they 
were involved in an offence. These guarantees apply whether such suspicions have been 
formalized in criminal charges or not. The Working Group notes that according to the 
information provided by the Government, Mr. Al-Marri was involved in a range of activities 
which, if proven, would constitute serious criminal offences. While this information was 
presented as the basis for his detention, Mr. Al-Marri remains uncharged and therefore has no 
opportunity to contest or respond to these assertions in accordance with the international legal 
requirements of due process which would be available to him under the criminal law. 
</p>
<p>38. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Ali Saleh Kahlah Al-Marri is arbitrary, being in 
contravention of article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
falls within category III of the categories applicable to the consideration of the cases 
submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>39. Consequent upon the opinion rendered, the Working Group requests the Government to 
take the necessary steps to rectify the situation and bring it into conformity with the standards 
and principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p><b>OPINION No. 44/2006 (SAUDI ARABIA) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 2 August 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Syed Asad Humayun. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State has not signed or ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the Government, which provided it with 
the requested information. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group forwarded to the source the reply of the Government. The source 
submitted its comments on the information given by the Government. In the light of the 
allegations made, the reply of the Government and the comments of the source thereon the 
Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion. 
</p>
<p>5. According to the information submitted by the source, Syed Asad Humayun is a citizen of 
Pakistan and married to a United States national. Both Mr. Humayun and his parents are 
residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Humayun was arrested on or around 25 March 2006. He was apparently detained at 
Thukbah for most of the first 30 days of his detention, although he may as well have been moved 
from one detention centre to another. He is currently being held in Khobar Central Jail. 
Mr. Humayun is allowed to receive visits only by his parents and his lawyer. 
</p>
<p>7. According to the information received, Mr. Humayun has neither been charged with any 
offence nor been otherwise informed of the reasons for his detention. He has neither been 
brought before a judicial officer, nor otherwise been provided with the possibility to challenge 
the legality of his detention. Mr. Humayun has been forced to sign certain papers written in the 
Arabic language which he does not read or understand. He does not know whether he has 
thereby signed a confession. The Saudi Arabian authorities have menaced him and threatened to 
arrest also his parents unless he confesses. They have seized the passport of Mr. Humayun&#8217;s 
father in order to exercise additional pressure on the family. 
</p>
<p>8. The source alleges that the detention of Mr. Humayun is arbitrary because it is devoid of 
any legal basis. As far as the source is aware, the authorities have so far failed to provide any 
decision justifying the arrest and detention. 
</p><p>9. The source further argues that, insofar as Mr. Humayun is accused of a crime, the 
deprivation of liberty is arbitrary because he is being denied the right to a &#8220;fair and public 
hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of any criminal charge 
against him&#8221; (article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). As stated above, he has </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 39 
 
</p>
<p>not been informed of the charges against him, is not provided with an interpreter who would 
assist him in understanding papers written in Arabic which he was required to sign, he may have 
been forced to sign statements incriminating himself, and he has not been brought before a judge 
during the months since his arrest. 
</p>
<p>10. The allegations of the source have been brought to the attention of the Government. In a 
statement dated 11 October 2006 the Government alleges that Mr. Humayun was arrested on 
31 March 2006 on the charge of counterfeiting ATM cards and using them to fraudulently 
withdraw more than 1,200,000 riyals from bank accounts of about 320 card holders. The 
Government alleges that Mr. Humayun&#8217;s father assisted another accomplice of Mr. Humayun, a 
Pakistani national, to escape to Pakistan with the fraudulently acquired funds. An investigation 
conducted by the competent Saudi Arabian authorities established the validity of the charges 
brought against the persons concerned and that confessions were made according to the law. 
Charges against Mr. Humayun and his father were referred to the Public Investigation and 
Prosecution Department in the district of Al-Khobar in accordance with a letter from the 
Governor dated 13 August 2006 in order to enable the Department to take the requisite action 
within the scope of its jurisdiction. The matter relating to the counterfeited cards was referred to 
the Board of Grievances in the Eastern Province in accordance with a communication of 
26 August 2006 from the Control and Investigation Board so that it could be submitted to the 
competent criminal court for adjudication. The issue concerning an application for extradition of 
the Pakistani fugitive was also transferred to the Department by the Governor on 3 August 2006.  
</p>
<p>11. The source, in its reply to the statement by the Government, did not contest the substance 
of the Government&#8217;s allegations. 
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group starts by pointing out that several of the allegations of the source are 
slightly contradictory in themselves. It is unrealistic to argue, for example, that Mr. Humayun 
was unaware of the charges against him. Namely the source itself admits that he was able to 
receive the visits of his lawyer, who, being familiar with legal questions could obviously assist 
his client in the communication with the authorities and to understand the charges against him. 
</p>
<p>13. In contrast, the presentation of the Government was consistent and reliable. The suspicion 
against him - the fraudulent tampering with ATM cards and the financial damage caused to 
card-users - is a serious charge worldwide, which gives rise to criminal prosecution in every 
country. The criminal investigation is still ongoing, therefore procedural flaws, if any, like the 
alleged lack of satisfactory interpretation can, and if proved true, and in the view of the Working 
Group, shall be corrected in the course of the forthcoming investigation and trial of the case. For 
that reason, bearing also in mind that Mr. Humayun is in custody since March 2006, a period of 
time, which cannot be held at this stage unreasonably long, it would be premature to take a stand 
concerning the alleged unfairness of the proceedings conducted against him. 
</p>
<p>14. Assessing all the information before it the Working Group delivers the following opinion. 
</p>
<p>  The deprivation of liberty of Syed Asad Humayun is not arbitrary.

AND NORTHERN IRELAND) 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication: addressed to the Government on 9 February 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Mustafa Abdi. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having forwarded the 
requisite information. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government. The Working Group transmitted the reply provided by the Government to the 
source and received its comments. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and 
circumstances of the case, in the context of the allegations made, the response of the Government 
thereto and the observations by the source. 
</p>
<p>6. The case summarized below was reported to the Working Group as follows: Mustafa Abdi 
is a citizen of Somalia born on 8 December 1975. He arrived in the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland on 7 May 1995 with a false Kenyan passport. On 24 May 1995 he 
applied for asylum. On 14 February 1996 the Home Office refused the asylum claim but granted 
him exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom for a year. On 21 January 1997, 
Mr. Abdi was granted further exceptional leave to remain until 14 February 2000.  
</p>
<p>7. On 9 March 1998 Mr. Abdi was arrested in London. On 23 July 1998 he was convicted at 
Southwark Crown Court of rape and indecency on a child and sentenced to eight years and two 
years imprisonment to run concurrently. On 28 May 2002 Mr. Abdi completed his custodial 
sentence. 
</p>
<p>8. Already on 21 May 2002, Mr. Abdi had been served with a Notice of decision to make a 
deportation order and reasons for deportation letter. Accordingly, when his custodial sentence 
came to an end on 28 May 2002 his detention was continued under immigration powers.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  He is detained under Schedule 3 of the Immigration Act 1971. Paragraph 2 (2) of Schedule 3 
</p>
<p>provides that the Secretary of State may detain a non-British national pending the making of a 
deportation order against him. Paragraph 2 (3) of the same Schedule authorizes the Secretary of 
State to detain a person against whom a deportation order has been made pending his removal or 
departure from the United Kingdom.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 41 
 
</p>
<p>9. On 2 July 2002, Mr. Abdi filed an appeal against the decision to make a deportation order 
and sought asylum again. An asylum interview was conducted on 12 September 2002, but the 
asylum claim was refused on 26 June 2003. On 28 July 2003, Mr. Abdi appealed against the 
refusal of the asylum claim. On 25 November 2003, both the appeal against the refusal of the 
asylum claim and the appeal against the deportation were dismissed. 
</p>
<p>10. On 19 April 2004, a deportation order was served on Mr. Abdi. Proceedings since then 
have mainly concerned the authorities&#8217; attempts to issue Mr. Abdi an emergency travel 
document (ETD) and to obtain a &#8220;disclaimer&#8221; from him. In order to be returned to Somalia 
Mr. Abdi requires an ETD as he does not have a valid Somali passport (apparently, obtaining a 
new Somali passport is not an option). However, Mr. Abdi has refused to cooperate with the 
authorities in this matter. Furthermore, the authorities are insisting that Mr. Abdi signs a 
&#8220;disclaimer&#8221;, a document that would serve as evidence that Mr. Abdi left the United Kingdom 
voluntarily and would thus allow the Secretary of State for the Home Department (SSHD) to 
order Mr. Abdi&#8217;s deportation despite the human rights situation in Somalia. Mr. Abdi refuses to 
sign such a disclaimer. 
</p>
<p>11. Bail was refused on 20 December 2004 and again on 11 October 2005. On the latter 
occasion, the immigration judge accepted that the Home Office had resumed enforced removal 
action of failed Somali asylum-seekers to Somalia. The judge therefore considered detention 
necessary as removal was imminent. However, Mr. Abdi remains in immigration detention, 
currently at Her Majesty&#8217;s Prison (HMP) Bedford (after stays at HMP Wandsworth and HMP 
Hull). 
</p>
<p>12. The source alleges that the continued detention of Mr. Abdi is arbitrary. He completed his 
criminal sentence on 28 May 2002, more than four years ago. Since then he has been deprived of 
liberty under immigration powers pending removal. But as there is no clear timetable for 
removal, the human rights situation in Somalia remaining very preoccupying, his continued 
detention amounts to a violation of his basic human rights. Moreover, it also violates the SSHD&#8217;s 
own Operational Guidance Manual on length of detention. 
</p>
<p>13. In its reply the Government to a great extent confirmed the allegations ascertained by the 
source and added that Mr. Abdi&#8217;s appeal against both the refusal of his asylum claim and the 
decision to make a deportation order against him were dismissed on 25 November 2003 and that, 
as he did not seek to appeal further, he had exhausted all his available avenues of appeal on 
4 December 2003. Therefore, on 19 April 2004 a Deportation Order was served on him and 
since 21 May 2004, several arrangements were made so that a travel document could be 
produced for Mr. Abdi, but he refused to cooperate.  
</p>
<p>14. The Government also states that Mr. Abdi is to be removed to Somalia on a 
European Union Letter, which requires that removals to Somalia can only take place if the 
person concerned has signed a disclaimer indicating his voluntary return. According to the 
Government this is a requirement of the airlines used to carry the returnees. Mr. Abdi refuses to 
sign a disclaimer. Otherwise he would be immediately deported to Somalia after having been 
served with the deportation order on 19 April 2004. The Government also ascertains that </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdi could, at any time, apply to the administrative court for a statutory review, or he could 
seek a writ of habeas corpus, as a means to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. Neither he 
nor his lawyers have made any application to the court to challenge his detention. The 
Government concludes that Mr. Abdi&#8217;s continued detention is justified. He is to be deported as a 
result of his having committed a very serious sexual assault on a child and he has been assessed 
as being at high risk to reoffending. His deportation remains an imminent and realistic prospect 
and his detention has been maintained in view of this. According to the Government, Mr. Abdi 
has, himself, prolonged his detention by refusing to sign the disclaimer. 
</p>
<p>15. The reply of the Government was forwarded to the source. In its comments the source, at 
the outset, states that, contrary to the assertion of the Government, there are court proceedings 
afoot seeking to challenge the legality of Mr. Abdi&#8217;s detention. His lawyers have lodged an 
application for judicial review at the beginning of July 2006. Following a permission hearing on 
25 September 2006 the High Court granted permission to apply for judicial review and the 
matter is to be heard before the High Court on 6 and 7 December 2006. However, the source 
confirms the assertion of the Government that Mr. Abdi&#8217;s asylum claim was refused and that 
there are presently no outstanding representations before the Government to challenge his 
removal. 
</p>
<p>16. Further, an issue has arisen during the proceedings in the High Court as to the exact period 
of time for which Mr. Abdi has in fact been detained under immigration powers. Even though it 
has always been the understanding of both the Government and the source that immigration 
detention commenced on 28 May 2002 it is possible that it is not as long as believed. The source 
notes that this date is based on the assumption that Mr. Abdi would have been granted parole on 
28 May 2002, however, it may be that it was not. On any view, Mr. Abdi has been detained 
under administrative powers for at least three years. 
</p>
<p>17. Furthermore, the source submits that there is a fundamental contradiction in the 
submissions of the Government which attempts to blur the distinction between voluntary 
departure to Somalia and forcible removal. According to the source &#8220;removal&#8221; and &#8220;voluntary 
return&#8221; are fundamentally different concepts and in seeking to meld the two into the 
contradictory concept of &#8220;voluntary removal&#8221; the Government seeks to obscure the true issue in 
the present case.  
</p>
<p>18. The source suggests that involuntary removal to Somalia was an impossibility at all 
material times because the State has entirely disintegrated. This is clear from parliamentary 
debates in the House of Commons on 3 May 2006 and from the practise of the Government. 
Although the Government hopes to recommence removals to Somalia soon such removals were 
not taking place as of 25 September 2006, the date of the permission hearing in the High Court. 
It was referred to in open court that it became possible to remove a &#8220;small number&#8221; of Somalis 
only between March and May 2004 to South-Central Somalia, but no returns to Somaliland. It is 
because of logistical difficulties and security concerns that the source remains unconvinced that 
any alleged failure to cooperate has contributed to the inability of the Government to remove 
Mr. Abdi to his home country. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 43 
 
</p>
<p>19. Even assuming that voluntary return would have been possible, this case, in the opinion of 
the source, raises in stark terms the question whether or not the State is entitled to detain an 
individual indefinitely if he refuses to return &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; to a conflict zone. In any event it is 
questionable whether a return to Somalia made under threat of indefinite detention could be said 
to be &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; in any real sense.  
</p>
<p>20. Finally, turning to the refusal of Mr. Abdi&#8217;s application for bail by the Immigration Judge 
on 11 October 2005, the source alleges that the judge was materially misled by a representative 
of the Government as to the likelihood of removal. It was explained to the judge that removal 
was &#8220;imminent&#8221; and that this was one of three reasons given by the judge to refuse the 
application. Imminence of removal is always a highly material factor in immigration bail 
applications. Since it simply was not true that removal was imminent in the present case, the 
outcome of that application might have been different. 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group notes that it is not a matter of dispute that Mr. Abdi served his 
criminal sentence in full on 28 May 2002, that the Government bases his detention since that (or 
around that) date on immigration powers and that there are currently no ongoing legal 
proceedings with respect to Mr. Abdi&#8217;s refused asylum claim and concerning his removal. The 
Working Group, however, takes notice of the fact that, contrary to the assertions of the 
Government, the legality of Mr. Abdi&#8217;s current detention is being challenged in High Court and a 
hearing has been scheduled for 6 and 7 December 2006 accordingly.  
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group recalls that the Commission on Human Rights, in its 
resolution 1997/50, extended the mandate of the Group so as to include situations of 
asylum-seekers and migrants in detention. Of course, the Working Group&#8217;s mandate in that 
respect is to give its opinion as to whether deprivation of liberty is compatible with the 
Government&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law, in particular article 9 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and not with regard to the asylum 
claim or migration status, or the question whether removal is justified.  
</p><p>23. On the basis of the submissions of the Government and of the source, the Working Group 
considers that Mr. Abdi&#8217;s detention does indeed have a basis in the United Kingdom migration 
laws. He also enjoys the right to judicial review of his continued detention, as required by 
article 9, paragraph 4, of ICCPR, although some reservations can be expressed as to the 
frequency of and delays in the judicial review process.  
24. This does not, however, settle the question whether or not Mr. Abdi is arbitrarily detained. 
The Working Group has two sets of concerns in this respect, the first relating to the duration of 
Mr. Abdi&#8217;s detention, the second to the actual purpose pursued by the use of immigration 
detention in this case. 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to duration, the Working Group notes that Mr. Abdi has been detained for 
four-and-a-half years as of today. The Working Group finds it difficult to think of circumstances 
under which this duration would not be excessive. It certainly is in the present case, where the 
prospects of Mr. Abdi&#8217;s removal actually taking place were dim from the beginning and have </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>been deteriorating since then, particularly since 2004.<b>12</b> Where the chances of removal within a 
reasonable delay are remote, the Government&#8217;s obligation to seek for alternatives to detention 
becomes all the more pressing. Looking forward, the possibility of Mr. Abdi&#8217;s removal would 
appear to be currently as remote as it was ever before. His continued detention therefore has 
assumed an indefinite character. 
</p>
<p>26. The circumstance that the asserted purpose of detention, i.e. removal, cannot in fact justify 
the detention because it is entirely unrealistic points to a second issue in this case. The history of 
Mr. Abdi&#8217;s case and the Government&#8217;s arguments strongly suggest that the Government&#8217;s 
concern that - if released in the United Kingdom - he might reoffend is not only the reason the 
Government is formally pursuing his removal, but also the reason why he is kept in detention 
notwithstanding the practical impossibility of removal. In other words, Mr. Abdi is in fact 
detained as a security measure to protect the public in the United Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>27. This situation renders his detention arbitrary for two reasons. Firstly, the Government is 
thereby circumventing the procedures available under domestic law to impose security measures 
against dangerous offenders who the court believes are likely to reoffend in the same way. For 
this purpose, public protection sentences were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. They 
are issued by the sentencing court and continued dangerousness is reviewed by the parole board. 
This procedure (which is not applicable to Mr. Abdi, because he was sentenced before the entry 
into force of the 2003 Act) would require the Government to show that there is indeed such a 
high and continued risk in Mr. Abdi&#8217;s specific case and would involve considerable procedural 
safeguards. In the immigration proceedings, the Government appears to be able to maintain 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  In view of the appalling situation in Somalia the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reconfirmed its first call upon all Governments 
from January 2004 to refrain from forced removals of Somali nationals to the country. In its 
Advisory from November 2005 the UNHCR referred to breakouts of fighting on a regular basis 
and inter-clan conflicts in central and southern Somalia as well as a high level of violent crime, 
particularly in the city of Mogadishu. The situation was further aggravated by food insecurity, 
lack of access to basic services and livelihood opportunities for the Somali population due to a 
high level of insecurity for aid operations in the area. Frequent violations of the United Nations 
arms embargo resulted in the continuation of explosives and heavy weapons entering the country 
on a large scale. While returns to northern Somalia were possible under certain conditions, 
especially if the persons concerned had clan links and could expect effective clan protection, the 
UNHCR recommended avoiding large-scale involuntary returns or forced removals of persons 
not originating from the region. Similarly, the United Nations independent expert on the situation 
of human rights in Somalia stated in his recent report to the Human Rights Council of 
13 September 2006 that &#8220;[a]fter 15 years, the lack of security in Somalia continues to have dire 
consequences on the human rights of Somalis. The right to life is violated throughout Somalia 
and most of the country is marked by insecurity and violence, with the south and central areas 
being the most insecure. In the past year, fighting in the capital city of Mogadishu among rival 
militia was especially fierce and the dead, wounded and displaced were mostly civilians. It is 
estimated that hundreds of civilians were killed and thousands injured in the fighting, in 
contravention of international humanitarian and human rights law&#8221;. (A/HRC/2/CRP.2 
(GE.06-13949), para. 13). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 45 
 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdi in detention simply by pointing to the offence that gave rise to his conviction. 
Mr. Abdi is thereby deprived of the procedural safeguards which, because of the presumption of 
innocence, necessarily accompany such a highly sensitive measure as imposing detention as a 
preventive security measure against offenders who have served their sentence or are entitled to 
probation. 
</p>
<p>28. Secondly, the need to protect society against the threat emanating from persons convicted 
for sexual offences who have served their sentence and are entitled to release is the same with 
regard to United Kingdom citizens and foreigners. But by having recourse to immigration 
powers to impose security measures against Mr. Abdi, the Government is making use of the - in 
this respect entirely fortuitous - circumstance that he is a foreigner to deprive him of procedural 
safeguards against deprivation of liberty. Mr. Abdi is therefore deprived of the equal protection 
of the law on grounds of citizenship. 
</p>
<p>29. To sum up, Mr. Abdi is in his fifth year of detention since he completed serving his 
sentence and, due to the lack of prospect for the removal to Somalia, his detention has assumed 
the character of indefinite detention. Such indefinite detention can only be qualified as 
&#8220;arbitrary&#8221; within the meaning of article 9, paragraph 1 of ICCPR.<b>13</b> Moreover, insofar as 
immigration powers are used against him in order to continue limiting his freedom in order to 
protect society, the detention violates the right to equality before the law and equal protection of 
the law without discrimination enshrined in article 26 of ICCPR, which adds to the arbitrary 
character of his detention. 
</p>
<p>30. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Abdi Mustafa is arbitrary, being in contravention of 
article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 26 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United Kingdom is a 
party. 
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group notes that the deprivation of liberty in Mr. Abdi&#8217;s case does not 
squarely fall within any of the three categories which it generally uses to classify cases of 
arbitrary detention. The fact that Mr. Abdi continues to be detained although he has served his 
criminal sentence approaches his case to category I, but it cannot be said that the deprivation of

</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  The Human Rights Committee has considered, in the framework of a temporary or pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention of a judicial nature, that: &#8220;The drafting history of article 9, paragraph 1, confirms that 
&#8216;arbitrariness&#8217; is not to be equated with &#8216;against the law&#8217;, but must be interpreted more broadly to 
include elements of inappropriateness, injustice and lack of predictability.&#8221; See: Decision 
of 23 July 1990, communication No. 305/1988, <i>Hugo van Alphen v. The Netherlands</i>, 
paragraph 5.8, CCPR/C/39/D/305/1988 of 15 August 1990. See also decisions 
of 5 November 1999, communication No. 631/1995, <i>Aage v. Norway</i>, paragraph 6.3

</p>
<p>liberty is devoid of a legal basis. Its discriminatory character approaches the detention to 
category II. The circumstance that he is deprived of his freedom not on the basis of actually 
having committed crimes but on the basis of a perceived risk of reoffending raises questions with 
regard to the presumption of innocence and thus category III. The Working Group considers, 
however, that in the light of the clear mandate of the then Commission on Human Rights to 
consider also cases of immigration detention, which generally would not fall within any of the 
three categories, it is acting fully within the bounds of its mandate in declaring that Mr. Abdi&#8217;s 
detention is arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>32. Having found the detention of Mr. Abdi to be arbitrary, the Working Group requests the 
Government of the United Kingdom to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and bring 
it into conformity with the standards and principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p>Adopted on 24 November 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>OPINION No. 46/2006 (DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 7 March 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Th&#233;odore Ngoyi. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group regrets that the Government did not reply, notwithstanding the fact 
that it had extended the 90-day limit at the Government&#8217;s request. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group would have welcomed the 
cooperation of the Government. In the absence of any information from the Government, the 
Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and 
circumstances of the case, especially since the facts and allegations contained in the 
communication have not been challenged by the Government. 
</p>
<p>5. According to the source, Th&#233;odore Ngoyi, a pastor, attorney, president of the Congo for 
Justice political party and also spokesperson for <i>Rassemblement des partis politiques et des 
Forces sociales pour le Non au r&#233;f&#233;rendum constitutionnel en R&#233;publique D&#233;mocratique du 
Congo</i> (Alliance of Political Parties and Social Forces for a &#8220;No&#8221; to the Constitutional 
Referendum in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), was arrested at his home in Kinshasa, in 
the commune of Gombe, by some 30 armed police officers in plain clothes and in military 
uniform, who had arrived in a vehicle without licence plates. Agents of the Kin Mazi&#232;re police 
special services reportedly also took part in the arrest. About 10 police officers broke into the 
house, threatening to shoot anyone who resisted. Mr. Ngoyi and his employees, some of whom 
were women, were then beaten with rifle butts by police officers, who also punched them and 
kicked them. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 47 
 
</p>
<p>6. Th&#233;odore Ngoyi was then apprehended, handcuffed and thrown into the vehicle of the 
agents of the police special services, who took him to the office of the prosecutor at the Gombe 
regional court. After questioning, Mr. Ngoyi was accused of &#8220;violating general regulatory 
measures and offences against the authorities and the head of State&#8221;. On 31 December 2005, 
Mr. Ngoyi was transferred to the Kinshasa Penitentiary and Re-education Centre (CPRK, 
formerly Makala Central Prison), where he is being held in wing 7. 
</p>
<p>7. On 5 January 2006, Mr. Ngoyi was brought before the Gombe magistrates&#8217; court, which 
on 6 January 2006 extended his pretrial detention by 15 days. The following day, on 7 January, 
Mr. Ngoyi appealed against that decision, and the appeal was heard on 12 January 2006. On 
13 January 2006, the judge issued an order confirming the extension of Mr. Ngoyi&#8217;s detention, 
but without giving the grounds for the decision. On 16 January 2006, Mr. Ngoyi brought the case 
before the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>8. On 23 January 2006, at the request of the procurator-general of the Court of National 
Security, Mr. Ngoyi was questioned by a deputy procurator-general. During the questioning, the 
examining magistrate considered that written evidence on certain points was required, and he 
authorized Mr. Ngoyi to go to his home to retrieve the documents in question. The 
procurator-general of the Court of National Security then asked his deputy to draw up a request 
to transfer Mr. Ngoyi to the Ngaliema clinic for treatment, as he was ill and his personal 
physician had already ordered his hospitalization. After first refusing to entertain the request, on 
25 January 2006 the director of CPRK finally authorized Mr. Ngoyi to have access to the 
medical care that he required. Mr. Ngoyi was hospitalized at the Ngaliema clinic. However, 
pending collection of all the evidence relating to the case, no further hearings were planned. 
</p>
<p>9. Mr. Ngoyi appeared before the Court of National Security on 16 February 2006. 
Pastor Ngoyi&#8217;s lawyers maintained that his detention was illegal, that the case had been brought 
before the court without observance of the required procedure, that there was an irregularity in 
the summons and that the courts should have suspended the proceedings. The prosecution, 
recognizing the irregularity and illegality of the proceedings against Mr. Ngoyi and of his 
detention, asked the Court to consider Mr. Ngoyi&#8217;s request. The Court was to deliberate on 
17 February 2006, the day before its dissolution pursuant to the promulgation of the new 
Constitution. However, the Court refrained from giving an opinion. Article 225 of the draft 
Constitution, adopted by referendum on 18 December 2005, provides that &#8220;the Court of National 
Security shall be dissolved upon entry into force of this Constitution&#8221;. Since the new 
Constitution was promulgated on 17 February 2006, the Court of National Security was 
dissolved on 18 February 2006. 
</p>
<p>10. The source emphasizes that, in accordance with article 138 of the Criminal Code, &#8220;except 
in cases of flagrante delicto, offences against persons covered by articles 136 and 138 may be 
prosecuted only upon the complaint of the injured person or of the institution to which such 
person belongs&#8221;. No complaints were filed by the person concerned or by members of the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>11. Moreover, article 225 of the draft Constitution, adopted by referendum 
on 18 December 2005, provides that &#8220;the Court of National Security shall be dissolved upon 
entry into force of this Constitution&#8221;. Mr. Ngoyi will therefore not appear before this Court. 
According to the source, the criminal proceedings against Pastor Ngoyi must be considered to </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 48 
 
</p>
<p>have lapsed, and Mr. Ngoyi (along with all the suspects in detention) should be released without 
a trial of any kind. Consequently, the source considers that for these two reasons, Mr. Ngoyi&#8217;s 
detention is devoid of any legal basis. 
</p>
<p>12. The source adds that the proceedings against Pastor Ngoyi were motivated by the action 
taken by Mr. Ngoyi&#8217;s party and <i>Rassemblement des partis politiques et des Forces sociales pour 
le Non</i> before the Supreme Court for the annulment of the results of the constitutional 
referendum, and because of the statements that he made on a local private television station 
denouncing a certain &#8220;sale&#8221; by the President, Joseph Kabila, of part of the national territory in 
South Kivu province.  
</p>
<p>13. The source&#8217;s communication was transmitted to the Government by the Working Group 
on 7 March 2006. Following the expiry of the 90-day time limit, two reminders were sent to the 
Government (on 9 August and 25 September 2006) inviting it to reply to the source&#8217;s allegations; 
however, the Working Group has so far received no reply. The Working Group regrets that the 
Government has not communicated the requested information, despite the fact that it extended 
the time limit for submission at the Government&#8217;s request, and notwithstanding the Working 
Group&#8217;s repeated requests. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group 
considers that it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and circumstances of the case, 
in the context of the allegations made by the source. 
</p>
<p>14. The Group notes that, according to the source, the criminal procedure and prosecution 
brought against Mr. Ngoyi are flawed by irregularities, and that these irregularities were 
acknowledged by the procurator-general before the court. The Government, which had the 
opportunity to challenge such allegations, has not seen fit to do so. Consequently, the Working 
Group concludes that these allegations are substantiated. In addition, the Government has not 
contested the fact that, following the dissolution of the Court of National Security, no body has 
been designated to hear the appeal formulated by Mr. Ngoyi challenging the legality of his 
detention. His continued detention in these conditions is in contravention of the provisions of 
article 9, paragraph 4, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo is a party. 
</p>
<p>15. As for the allegations that the proceedings against Mr. Ngoyi were motivated by his 
peaceful political activities and those of his party, the Working Group considers that, in the 
absence of a reply from the Government, these allegations are also substantiated, and that this 
constitutes a violation of article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>16. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Th&#233;odore Ngoyi is arbitrary, being in contravention 
of articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and falls 
within categories II and III of the categories applicable to the consideration of the cases 
submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>Adopted on 22 November 2006. </p>

<p><b>OPINION No. 47/2006 (PEOPLE&#8217;S REPUBLIC OF CHINA) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 29 June 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Chen Guangcheng. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State has signed but not ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>3. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government. The Working Group transmitted the reply provided by the Government to the 
source and received its comments. The Working Group believes that it is in a position to render 
an opinion on the facts and circumstances of the case, in the context of the allegations made and 
the response of the Government thereto, as well as of the observations by the source. 
</p>
<p>4. According to the information submitted by the source, Chen Guangcheng is a citizen of the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China born in 1971 and resident in East Shigu Village, Shuanghou 
Township, Yinan County, Linyi City, Shandong Province. Chen Guangcheng, who is blind since 
early childhood, is a self-taught lawyer and has a long history of campaigning for the rights of 
farmers and the disabled. He assisted villagers in solving drinking water pollution problems 
when he was attending Nanjing Chinese Medicine University in 2000. He created and ran the 
&#8220;Rights Defense Project for the Disabled&#8221; under the auspices of the Chinese Legal Studies 
Association between 2000 and 2001. Since 1996, he has provided free legal consultation to 
farmers and the disabled in rural areas. In 2003, he was sponsored by the &#8220;International Visitors 
Project&#8221; to visit the United States of America. In 2004, he ran a &#8220;Citizen Awareness and Law for 
the Disabled Project&#8221; supported by the United States National Endowment for Democracy and 
the Monica Fund. 
</p>
<p>5. Starting in April 2005, Chen Guangcheng and his wife, Yuan Weijing, began to investigate 
villagers&#8217; claims that Linyi City authorities were employing extensive violence in implementing 
government birth quotas. Later, they put together briefs for lawsuits against officials involved. 
Their work, and that of activists and lawyers who visited the area to assist in documenting the 
abuses and in providing legal advice to villagers who wished to take legal action, represented the 
first known concerted domestic effort to challenge the use of violence in the enforcement of 
China&#8217;s population policy. The first report on the subject was made public on 10 June 2005 
through the Citizens Rights Defense Network (gongmin weiquan wang). 
</p>
<p>6. On 12 August 2005, Chen Guangcheng and Yuan Weijing were put under de facto house 
arrest. Chen Guangcheng was said to be held under &#8220;residential surveillance&#8221;, but according to 
the relevant law (see paragraph 21 below), if such measure is to be applied to a suspect, a 
residential surveillance decision must be issued and shown to the suspect, who must sign or put 
his mark on it. None of this reportedly occurred in Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s case. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 50 
 
</p>
<p>7. The house arrest was enforced by security guards paid on a daily rate by village and 
township officials and the Yinan County Public Security Bureau (PSB). Yinan PSB statements 
called them &#8220;militia&#8221;, but they reportedly did not meet the official criteria for militia members. 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s house arrest was overseen by various local government and Communist 
Party officials, including the Shuanghou Township mayor and party secretary, and the Yinan 
County party school president, party secretary and party office director.  
</p>
<p>8. On 25 August 2005, Chen Guangcheng evaded the police surrounding his village and went 
to Shanghai and Nanjing, then to Beijing, to seek help from lawyers. In Beijing, friends arranged 
for him to meet foreign journalists, diplomats, and international legal experts, to discuss the 
lawsuits. 
</p>
<p>9. In the afternoon of 6 September 2005, Chen Guangcheng was detained at the home of a 
friend in Beijing by six men who said they were public security officers from Shandong. The 
men shoved Chen Guangcheng into a car. He was held overnight in a hotel, where the head of 
the Linyi Public Security Bureau (PSB) and the city&#8217;s deputy mayor came to see him in the 
morning. The Linyi PSB head told Chen Guangcheng that he had revealed news information to 
foreign media and was suspected of violating article 111 of the criminal law (illegally providing 
intelligence to foreign countries), for which the maximum sentence is life in prison. However, 
neither the six public security officials from Shandong Province who deprived 
Chen Guangcheng of his freedom on 6 September, nor the head of the Linyi PSB showed him 
any arrest warrant or other document justifying his detention. The men from the Linyi PSB 
coercively took Chen Guangcheng back to his home. 
</p>
<p>10. Chen Guangcheng was again placed under house arrest without any order to that effect. 
On 9 September 2005 his landline and mobile phone services were cut off, and his computer 
seized. On 23 September 2005 public security officials searched his house from 2.50 to 10 p.m., 
without showing any warrant or other document justifying the search.  
</p><p>11. On 4 October 2005, law lecturer Xu Zhiyong and lawyers Li Fangping and Li Subin 
attempted to visit Chen Guangcheng and negotiate with local officials to have his house arrest 
lifted. The lawyers were stopped on their way to the house. Chen Guangcheng reportedly 
managed to leave his house and spoke with them briefly, but was then forcibly taken back. When 
he resisted, he was beaten up by men surrounding his house. The lawyers tried to go to 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s house, but they were stopped and Xu Zhiyong and Li Fangping were beaten 
up. Thereafter, all three were taken to Shuanghou Township Police Station where they were 
interrogated until the following morning. They were told that the case now involved &#8220;State 
secrets&#8221; and were escorted back to Beijing.  
12. On 24 October 2005, two other Beijing scholars and friends of Chen Guangcheng went to 
visit him. As Chen Guangcheng ran out to greet them, he was stopped and beaten by around 
20 men stationed outside. The visitors were quickly escorted away. Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, 
Yuan Weijing, has also been prevented from leaving the house, and was beaten when she came 
out to greet visitors on 27 December 2005.  
</p>
<p>13. On 30 October 2005, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyer filed a lawsuit on his behalf before the 
People&#8217;s Court of Yinan County, charging two Shuanghou Township officials with intentional 
injury for their involvement in beating him outside his house on 24 October when friends came </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 51 
 
</p>
<p>to visit Chen Guangcheng and Yuan Weijing. The two officials allegedly headed a group of 
more than 20 militia men who beat Chen Guangcheng with fists and sticks, knocked him down 
several times and kicked him. Chen Guangcheng was not able to see a doctor to verify his 
injuries because the militia surrounding his house rejected his requests to seek medical attention, 
but there were a number of eye witnesses on the scene. So far the court has ignored 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s suit. 
</p>
<p>14. On 11 March 2006, Chen was arrested at home by Yinan County police and taken to the 
Yinan Detention Centre. The police did not show a warrant or other document justifying the 
arrest. At Yinan Detention Centre, Chen was held incommunicado for three months. Only 
on 10 June 2006, the Yinan County police acknowledged he was detained there. 
</p>
<p>15. On that day, 10 June 2006, Chen Guangcheng was formally detained on suspicion of 
&#8220;gathering crowds to obstruct traffic&#8221; and &#8220;destructing property&#8221;. On 21 June 2006, officials of 
the Yinan PSB issued Chen arrest warrant No. 193 (2006), stating that the Yinan County 
People&#8217;s Procuratorate approved that the county PSB carry out the arrest of Chen Guangcheng 
on suspicion of &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221; and &#8220;gathering a crowd and disturbing 
traffic order&#8221;, and recalling the relevant provisions of the Chinese Criminal Code (hereinafter 
&#8220;CCC&#8221;) and Criminal Procedural Law. 
</p>
<p>16. On the same day, 21 June 2006, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers were able to visit him in 
detention for the first time in three months. When the lawyers asked him where he was detained 
during those three months, prison guards interrupted the discussion, preventing 
Chen Guangcheng from answering the question. His family has not been allowed to visit. His 
wife remains under house arrest.  
</p>
<p>17. The following day, 22 June, Mr. Li Jinsong, one of Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers, was 
taken into police custody for questioning. On 23 June 2006, two lawyers, Li Jinsong and 
Li Subin tried to visit Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, Yuan Weijin, and to provide legal counsel on 
matters related to obtaining medical parole for Chen Guangcheng. They were stopped in front of 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s house and beaten by guards who were there enforcing the residential 
detention of Yuan Weijin. On 24 June 2006, all six lawyers who went to Linyi County to provide 
legal counsel and handle procedures in Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s and three other villagers&#8217; cases 
returned to Beijing. It was reported that due to the harassment they encountered, they were 
unable to carry out their work. On 27 June 2006, lawyers Li Jinsong and Li Subin went back to 
Linyi, trying to meet with Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, Yuan Weijin, in order to obtain a copy of 
the arrest warrant, convey to her Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s condition at the detention centre, and also 
to obtain her signature in order to process legal papers to apply for medical parole for 
Chen Guangcheng. Again, they were harassed by thugs in the village while police refused to 
intervene. Around 20 men turned over their car and smashed their cameras. Li Jinsong was then 
taken to the police station for questioning. 
</p>
<p>18. The source alleges that the detention of Chen Guangcheng is arbitrary. The authorities 
detain Chen Guangcheng in order to make him desist from providing legal assistance to families 
bringing lawsuits against the Linyi authorities&#8217; violent campaign to meet assigned population </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p>targets<b>14</b> and from spreading information about these abuses. This is evidenced by the timing of 
the initial arrest, by the accusations of &#8220;illegally providing intelligence to foreign countries&#8221; after 
Chen Guangcheng spoke to foreign journalists about the lawsuits, by reports that the police 
forced some villagers to testify against Chen Guangcheng, saying that he fabricated the reports 
about abuses, and by the fact that local officials told Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife that her husband&#8217;s 
life would be in danger unless he abandoned the lawsuit.  
</p>
<p>19. On some occasions, Chen Guangcheng and his family have been told that releasing 
information about violence inflicted on rural people around Linyi City to enforce the population 
control policies constituted a breach of laws governing protection of State secrets.  
</p>
<p>20. The source further argues that from 12 August 2005 until 10 June 2006, when the 
Yinan PSB issued a detention order against Chen Guangcheng, there was no legal basis for the 
various forms of deprivation of liberty he suffered at the hands of officials (house arrest, 
abduction in Beijing on 6 September 2005 and detention at the Yinan County Detention Centre 
from 11 March to 10 June 2006). With regard to the house arrest, the source notes that 
Chen Guangcheng was said to be held under &#8220;residential surveillance&#8221;, a form of house arrest 
that can be applied by Public Security, Procuratorates, and Courts under the Criminal Procedure 
Law (CPL, articles 50 and 51), including in cases where authorities have insufficient evidence to 
charge a person with an offence but are investigating that person for criminal responsibility, or if 
the penalty for the alleged offence would be minor. The maximum period allowable for such 
detention is six months (CPL, article 58). However, according to the Regulations on Procedures 
of the Public Security Organs for Dealing with Criminal Cases (issued by the Ministry of Public 
Security in 1998), if such a measure is to be applied to a suspect, a residential surveillance 
decision must be issued by public security organs at county level or above and this document 
must be shown to the suspect, who must sign or put his mark on it (CPL, articles 95 and 96). At 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  The source reports that in July 2004, the Linyi City Party Committee and government had 
</p>
<p>issued a document on strengthening population and fertility control work. Violent measures 
reportedly began to be used in some districts of Linyi City by the end of that year. In 
mid-February 2005, Linyi City government reissued the July 2004 document, in a move seen as 
encouraging the use of force to meet population control targets. According to Linyi residents, in 
March 2005 local authorities began forcing parents of two children to be sterilized and women 
pregnant with a third child to undergo abortions. Officials detained family members of those 
couples who fled, beat them and held them hostage. There has been official confirmation of the 
abuses in Linyi: on 19 September 2005, an official of the National Population and Family 
Planning Commission of China said that their investigation had found that there had been 
violations of law and policy in Linyi that had infringed the rights of citizens, and that as a 
consequence, some officials had been dismissed, while some were in detention and facing 
investigation for criminal responsibility. 
</p>
<p> Lawsuits filed by four villagers who suffered violent treatment in this campaign, 
Du Dejiang, Liu Benxia, Han Yandong and Hu Bingmei, were due to be heard in October 2005 
in Yinan County People&#8217;s Court. But on 10 October 2005, the Court announced that the hearings 
would be postponed. Other villagers who had been planning to bring suit have pulled out after 
being harassed, threatened, or bribed. </p>

</p>
<p>no time was Chen Guangcheng shown a warrant ordering him to be put under residential 
surveillance, nor was he officially given any reasons for such a measure to be imposed on him. 
From 12 August 2005 until 10 June 2006, i.e. during 10 months, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s deprivation 
of liberty had no legal basis and was therefore arbitrary.  
</p>
<p>21. Finally, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers are prevented from meeting their client in private and 
from consulting with his family, and have not been given a copy of the arrest warrant setting 
forth the charges against Chen Guangcheng. Indeed, they have been harassed by thugs allegedly 
acting on behalf of the authorities and by the police in order to discourage and prevent them from 
assisting Chen Guangcheng.  
</p>
<p>22. The allegations of the source have been brought to the attention of the Government. In a 
statement dated 6 July 2006 the Government alleges that, on 11 March 2006, Chen Guangcheng 
and his family members Chen Guangjun, Chen Guangyu and others, assembled a crowd of 
villagers and obstructed traffic, causing a major traffic jam on national highway 205. On 
12 March 2006, Chen Guangjun and Chen Guangyu were taken into criminal detention, in 
accordance with the law, on suspicion of having committed an offence under article 291 CCC, 
on the gathering of crowds for the purpose of disrupting the movement of traffic. 
Chen Guangcheng was held for questioning by the local public security authorities, in 
accordance with the law, on suspicion of involvement in the offence at the scene of the crime, 
and was released at 9 p.m. on 12 March 2006. 
</p>
<p>23. Article 291 CCC stipulates that &#8220;[w]here people are gathered to disturb order at railway 
stations or bus terminals, ferry landings, civil airports, market places, parks, theatres and 
cinemas, exhibition halls, sports grounds or other public places, or to block traffic or disrupt the 
movement of traffic, or to resist or obstruct public security officials from carrying out their 
duties according to law, if the resulting situation is serious, the ringleaders shall be sentenced to 
fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, criminal detention or surveillance&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government alleges that, in dealing with Chen Guangcheng and his associates, the 
public security authorities acted in compliance with the law, when remanding them in custody or 
holding them for questioning. Throughout this period their lawful rights were fully protected and 
there is no substance to the allegation that Chen Guangcheng was subjected to beatings and 
placed under house arrest. 
</p>
<p>25. The reply of the Government has been brought to the attention of the source for comments 
on 3 November 2006. Their response, dated 10 November 2006, may be summarized as follows.  
</p>
<p>26. The source notes that the statement of the Government fails to address their key challenges 
in their communication. It states that before Chen Guangcheng, Chen Guangjun, and 
Chen Guangyu were taken into criminal detention on 11 March 2006, Chen Guangcheng had 
already been subjected to illegal house arrest and residential surveillance for 197 days since 
mid-August 2005. His wife, Yuan Weijing, has now been under residential surveillance 
for 14 months without legal authorization. 
</p>
<p>27. With respect to the incident which took place on 11 March 2006 the source alleges that 
when Chen Guangcheng marched with other villagers to protest the beating of one villager, 
several dozens of police blocked their way and surrounded them on national highway 205, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 54 
 
</p>
<p>thereby causing traffic disruption. The source states that after Chen Guangcheng was held for 
questioning by the local public security authorities on 12 March 2006, he was not released on 
that day and never released ever since. Instead, he was held under detention for 89 days without 
legal authorization until 11 June 2006 when authorities issued a criminal detention order. During 
the 89 days of illegal detention, the Yinan County Public Security Bureau refused to answer the 
family&#8217;s repeated requests for information about the cause and location of his detention. His 
lawyers, who saw Chen Guangcheng at the Yinan Detention Centre for the first time in late June, 
confirmed with him that he was detained by public security officials at various locations between 
12 March and 11 June 2006. The source referred to written testimonies collected by lawyers 
from witnesses, who were also detained and then released on bail, including Chen Guangdong, 
Chen Gengjiang, Chen Guanghe, Chen Guangyu, Chen Hua, and Han Yandong. These villagers 
were forced to confess or provide incriminating false information against Chen Guangcheng. 
They stated that police used various torture methods at the detention centre in order to break 
their will, such as tying them up to chairs with chains, deprivation of sleep for up to 15 days, and 
withholding of food and water. 
</p>
<p>28. On 24 August 2006, the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court convicted Chen Guangcheng for 
&#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221; and &#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and sentenced him 
to four years and three months of imprisonment. However, the Linyi City Intermediate People&#8217;s 
Court, when reviewing the appeal by Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers, overturned this verdict on 
30 October 2006 on the basis of insufficient evidence for convicting Chen Guangcheng for the 
offence stipulated in article 291 CCC. The Intermediate Court referred the case back to the lower 
court for retrial. The source alleges that under these circumstances Chen Guangcheng should 
have been declared innocent and immediately released from prison until proven guilty at a future 
retrial. However, Chen is still being held at the Yinan County Detention Centre in Shandong 
Province. According to the source, his continued detention is arbitrary and against Chinese law 
and it submits that the Government should respect the local courts&#8217; judicial independence in 
handling this case.  
</p>
<p>29. The Working Group notes that, despite the affirmation from the Government that Mr. Chen 
was released at 9 p.m. on 12 March 2006, it appears as if Mr. Chen is in detention waiting for 
retrial. 
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group holds that it is undisputed that Mr. Chen has been subjected to a 
deprivation of liberty in form of house arrest and residential surveillance at different stages 
between 12 August 2005 and 11 March 2006. This can be derived from the prohibition to leave 
his home and the fact that Mr. Chen was forced back to stay in it. The Working Group has 
considered, in its Deliberation No. 01, that house arrest is a deprivation of liberty whenever the 
person is not authorized to leave a closed area. The Working Group stresses that not even the 
Government argues that there exist any legal basis for his deprivation of liberty between these 
dates. 
</p>
<p>31. As to the period after 11 March 2006, when he was charged following a demonstration on 
that day pursuant to article 291 CCC for the gathering of crowds for the purpose of disrupting the 
movement of traffic by the Government, charges which were communicated on 11 June 2006 as 
those of &#8220;gathering crowds to obstruct traffic&#8221; and &#8220;destructing property&#8221;, the Working Group 
finds that there were significant obstacles in the exercise of Mr. Chen&#8217;s defence. It refers, 
namely, to his incommunicado detention from 12 March to 11 June 2006 and the limitations </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 55 
 
</p>
<p>imposed upon him with respect to contact with his lawyers, after which he was convicted on 
24 August 2006 for these offences to four years and three months of imprisonment. Although the 
Linyi City Intermediate People&#8217;s Court on appeal overturned this verdict, Mr. Chen has not been 
released since then. On the contrary, he will have been judged for these offences in a retrial 
scheduled for 27 November 2006. 
</p>
<p>32. As the Court decided to quash the judgement of the inferior court, the Working Group will 
not take a position on the non-observances of the guarantees of a fair and impartial trial, because, 
at least in principle, the failure to respect his right to fair trial can be redressed when Mr. Chen&#8217;s 
case is retried. Whether the Court has, with this judgement, already remedied the situation, the 
Working Group for lack of sufficient information cannot comment on. However, if the 
information received is accurate, in relation to the continuance of Mr. Chen&#8217;s detention despite 
the judgement of the Court, the Working Group would consider this very worrying. 
</p><p>33. The Working Group notes that, as stated by the source and which the Government did not 
contest, Mr. Chen is a well-known lawyer and activist of China, blind since early childhood, who 
has been documenting and investigating with his wife abuses by authorities in the governmental 
policy of birth quotas, and later providing legal advice and bringing law suits against officials 
involved. The Working Group concludes from the numerous statements the same officials have 
communicated to him that Mr. Chen has been detained several times in connection with these 
activities, be it with or without formal charges against him. 
</p>
<p>34. The Working Group believes that the charges Mr. Chen had and still has to face appear to 
be no other than obstacles to prevent him from continuing his work as a lawyer, defending 
villagers&#8217; rights, and raising his voice in their defence. Thus, Mr. Chen is being deprived of his 
liberty for his defence of human rights and in order to prevent him from and punish him for 
peacefully exercising the right to freedom of expression protected by article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, which includes the &#8220;freedom to hold opinions without interference 
and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of 
frontiers&#8221; and his right of freedom of assembly as enshrined in its article 20: &#8220;everyone has the 
right to freedom of peaceful assembly&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The detention of Chen Guangcheng is arbitrary, as it contravenes the principles and 
norms set forth in article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, for the 
period of 12 August 2005 until 12 March 2006, falls within category I of the categories 
applicable to consideration of cases submitted to the Working Group, and, for the period 
since 12 March 2006, falls within category II of the said categories. 
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group asks the Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the 
situation to bring it in conformity with standards and principles set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and to consider the possibility of ratifying the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

</p>
<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having provided the

<p>3. The Working Group further notes that the source informed the Group that 
Nathalie Gettliffe, who had been sentenced in Canada to 16 months imprisonment on charges of 
abducting two of her children from their father, was returned to France in December 2006 to 
serve the remainder of her term. On 13 January 2007, Ms. Gettliffe was released under judicial 
surveillance by a judge of Evry. She is, therefore, no longer in detention.

<p><b>OPINION No. 2/2007 (MYANMAR) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 10 July 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State has not ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the Government by providing the 
requested information on the facts alleged and the applicable law. The reply of the Government 
was forwarded to the source, which did make comments on it. The Working Group believes that 
it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and circumstances of the case. 
</p>
<p>4. The information submitted to the Working Group is summarized as follows: Ms. Aung San 
Suu Kyi, a citizen of the Union of Myanmar, General Secretary of the National League for 
Democracy (NLD) and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is being held under house arrest in Rangoon. 
She spent more than 10 of the last 16 years in detention and has been held in her Rangoon 
residence without contact with the outside world for more than four years. She is denied visitors 
and has no outside telephone contact. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 57 
 
</p>
<p>5. Ms. Suu Kyi was arrested in May 2003 following an assassination attempt during which 
more than 70 of her supporters were murdered. The attack was reportedly orchestrated by a 
group associated with the Union Solidarity Development Association (USDA). Although 
Ms. Suu Kyi survived the attack, her safety continues to be threatened because she is allowed 
only infrequent visits by her medical doctors. 
</p>
<p>6. On 24 May 2006, Ms. Suu Kyi received a rare visit from Ibrahim Gambari, Special Envoy 
of the Secretary-General on the situation in Myanmar and the Special Adviser on the 
International Compact with Iraq and Other Political Issues, who called for her release. The 
source submits that the detention order of Ms. Suu Kyi expired with no official announcement 
that she will be released from house arrest. On 27 May 2006, the authorities extended 
Ms. Suu Kyi&#8217;s house arrest for another year.  
</p>
<p>7. The source contends that Ms. Suu Kyi is being held under article 10 (b) of the 1975 State 
Protection Act, which permits the authorities to detain anyone considered a threat to State 
security for up to five years, renewable on an annual basis, without charge or trial. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the source, there is no opportunity for domestic judicial review of 
Ms. Suu Kyi&#8217;s detention. Since her initial term of house arrest begun on 30 May 2003, 
Ms. Suu Kyi has been denied all access to NLD leaders and the press. She has no access to 
relatives or lawyers and her communications and visits are permitted at the Government&#8217;s sole 
discretion.  
</p>
<p>9. The source asserts that on 23 May 2006, Major General Khin Yi, who serves as the 
Nation&#8217;s Police Chief, told a conference of regional Police that the release of Ms. Suu Kyi would 
likely have little effect on the country&#8217;s political stability and that there would not be rallies and 
riots if Ms. Suu Kyi was released since public support for her has fallen. 
</p>
<p>10. The source further submits that Ms. Suu Kyi is a known advocate of political change 
exclusively by peaceful means. No controlling body, acting in good faith, would find or believe 
that she is a potential danger to the State. 
</p>
<p>11. The source affirms that there can be no legal justification for Ms. Suu Kyi&#8217;s detention 
under the law, because her release would not endanger State sovereignty or public peace and 
tranquility. Because she is not a threat to the country&#8217;s political stability, her continued detention 
is arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>12. The source concludes that Ms. Suu Kyi is being held because of her political views. It is 
not a coincidence that she is the Secretary General of the NLD. By singling out Ms. Suu Kyi for 
arrest and detention on the basis of her thought, conscience, opinion, and expression, as 
embodied by her work for the NLD. 
</p>
<p>13. The reply of the Government to the allegations of the source can be reproduced as follows. 
In 2003, during her trips to various townships in Myanmar, Ms. Suu Kyi carried out activities 
detrimental to the peace and tranquility of the livelihood of the local community. She delivered 
speeches to discredit the Government to impair the dignity thereof and also conducted 
campaigning with the intention of harming the integrity of the Union and solidarity of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 58 
 
</p>
<p>national races. As her conduct constituted a threat to the security of the State and public peace 
and tranquility, she was retained under section 10 of the Law to safeguard the State against the 
dangers of those desiring to cause subversive acts. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government went on by explaining that the Central Body formed under the Law 
passed restriction orders to restrain Aung San Suu Kyi from 28 November 2003 to 
27 November 2004. After expiration of the one-year restraint, the Central Body obtained the 
prior sanctions from the Council of Ministers to extend the restraint on a yearly basis until now. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government concludes by pointing out that under the law the authorities are 
empowered to restrain individuals without trial. 
</p>
<p>16. When considering the communication, the Working Group stated from the following 
considerations. 
</p>
<p>17. This is already the fourth occasion when the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called 
to address the deprivation of liberty under the form of house arrest of the same individual, 
namely Aung San Suu Kyi (see Opinions 8/1992, 2/2002 and 9/2004). The basic facts in the 
previous opinions and the present communication are either identical or very similar. A leading 
opposition figure in the Union of Myanmar is repeatedly paralysed in her participation in the 
political life of her country by the application against her of subsequent house arrest orders. 
Apart from their possible detrimental health and psychological effects, the measures 
systematically taken against her are tantamount to deprivation of liberty (see Deliberation 001 of 
the Working Group referred to the former Opinions), and are aimed to prevent her to exercise her 
right to freedom of opinion and expression. Moreover, the system of &#8220;restraints&#8221; hampered 
Ms. Suu Kyi to enjoy the safeguards of a fair trial against arbitrary detention, because as the 
Government itself clarified, house arrests are ordered without trial. The unsubstantiated hints of 
the Government to &#8220;activities detrimental to the peace and tranquility&#8221; and to Ms. Suu Kyi&#8217;s 
&#8220;campaigning with the intention of harming the integrity of the Union&#8221; are irrelevant to justify 
her detention, because not even the Government asserts that Ms. Suu Kyi has ever resorted to 
violence or incited to hostility or violence. 
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group notes that the obvious unwillingness of the Government to comply 
with the Working Group&#8217;s Opinions and recommendations to put an end to the house arrest of 
Ms. Suu Kyi is particularly worrying. 
</p>
<p> In the light of the foregoing the Working Group renders the following opinion. 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Aung San Suu Kyi is arbitrary being in contravention of 
articles 9, 10 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and falls under 
categories II and III of the categories applicable to the consideration of cases submitted to 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>19. Consequent upon the opinion rendered the Working Group repeatedly requests the 
Government to remedy the situation and to bring it into conformity with the provisions of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Working Group believes that under the 
circumstances the adequate remedy would be the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi.

agents of the State Security Intelligence (SSI). They were held incommunicado during periods 
from one to three months, periods during which they were allegedly tortured. The officials did

</p>
<p>50. At the end of their incommunicado detention, these persons were informed that they would 
be imprisoned by virtue of an administrative order issued by the Minister of the interior. No 
detention term was fixed. These administrative orders were issued following the regulations on 
the state of emergency, which has been in force without interruption since 6 October 1981. The 
emergency rule was extended on 30 April 2006 for another three years. 
</p>
<p>51. According to the source, the Emergency Law, Law No. 162 of 1958, allows arbitrary arrest 
and indefinite detention without trial. The source considers that it creates an atmosphere of 
impunity, which may give place to cases of torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>52. The source adds that some of these persons were nonetheless able to challenge their 
detention before a judicial authority, mainly before the Exceptional State Security Courts or 
military courts, which, in most cases, ordered their release. However, the administrative 
authority did not comply with these judicial decisions and issued new administrative detention 
orders using the powers conferred on them by the state of emergency. 
</p>
<p>53. The source alleges that in spite of the fact that Egypt is a State party to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it has never followed fully their provisions by reason of 
the state of emergency governed by article 4 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>54. According to the source, these persons are being kept in detention without charges or trial 
exclusively under administrative detention powers. They have never been tried or convicted of a 
crime. Some of them are suspected members or supporters of banned Islamist groups but have 
never participated in violent acts, otherwise they would have been brought before military or 
exceptional courts and would have been charged and tried. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 63 
 
</p>
<p>55. The source adds that the conditions in the prisons and detention centres in which these 
persons are being kept amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Many of these persons 
are suffering from illnesses because of the lack of hygiene and medical care, overcrowding and 
poor food quality. 
</p>
<p>56. The source concludes that the detention of these persons is arbitrary because it is devoid of 
any legal basis. The authorities have so far failed to provide any decision justifying their arrest 
and continued detention during more than 12 years. 
</p>
<p>57. It also argues that their detention results from their political opinions and the consequent 
exercise of their rights to freedom of expression, guaranteed by article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>58. In conclusion, the source considers that the detention of these 45 persons is contrary to 
several articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group notes at the outset that, despite the lack of cooperation from the 
Government, it possesses sufficient factual elements to take a position on the merits of the 
allegation. It is undisputed that the 45 individuals carefully identified by name, age and date of 
detention, were arrested between 1990 and 1994 and are still in detention. That is to say that they 
have been detained for between 13 and 17 years. Most of them were unable to challenge the 
lawfulness of their detention. Some of them could obtain a judicial decision ordering their 
release, but no one was in fact set free. 
</p>
<p>60. It is the position of the Working Group that not even a state of emergency may justify such 
long terms of detention without charges which completely circumvents the guarantees of a fair 
trial. Moreover, by failing to allow the detainees to apply to a judge or, in those cases where the 
detainees could seek review of their detention, by disregarding the judicial orders for release, the 
Government has nullified the control of the Judiciary over the lawfulness of their detention. 
Therefore, the Working Group, in the absence of any response from the Government, considers 
that the deprivation of liberty of the above-mentioned persons is arbitrary under category III of 
the categories applicable to the consideration of cases submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>61. The Working Group further notes that the source&#8217;s allegation that the 46 detainees have 
been deprived of their liberty for having expressed their political opinions which are contrary to 
the Government has not been contradicted. The Working Group therefore finds that the 
deprivation of liberty results from the exercise of their right to freedom of expression, guaranteed 
by article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is accordingly 
arbitrary also under category II of the categories applicable to the consideration of cases 
submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>62. In the light of the foregoing the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Ahmed Ali Mohamed Moutawala and the other above 
named 44 persons is arbitrary, being in contravention of article 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and falls under categories II and III of the 
categories applicable to the consideration of cases submitted to the Working Group. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 64 
 
</p>
<p>63. Consequent upon the opinion rendered, the Working Group requests the Government to 
remedy the situation and to bring it into conformity with the provisions of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Working Group believes that in view of the long 
period of time already spent in detention, the adequate remedy would be the immediate release 
of these persons.

<p><b>OPINION No. 4/2007 (SAUDI ARABIA) 
Communications: addressed to the Government on 29 September 2006 and 
30 November 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Mr. Faiz Abdelmoshen Al-Qaid and Mr. Khaled b. Mohamed 
Al-Rashed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State is not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>3. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group would have welcomed the 
cooperation of the Government. In the absence of any information from the Government, the 
Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and 
circumstances of the cases, especially since the facts and allegations contained in the 
communication have not been challenged by the Government. 
</p>
<p>4. Khaled b. Mohamed Al-Rashed, a citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia born 
on 18 March 1962 with identity card No. 10610423236 issued at Dammam is a teacher at 
Fad Ben mufleh Al Sabiyi School in Thuqba Al Damam Province and is known as a member of 
the so-called Movement of Reformers. 
</p>
<p>5. According to the information received, Mr. Al-Rashed was arrested on 19 March 2006 at 
Makkah Al-Mukkaramah by members of the Intelligence Services, while he was in a religious 
peregrination (Omra) together with his wife. He had recently made some statements expressing 
his opposition to some governmental policies. No arrest warrant was shown to him and no 
reasons were given for his apprehension.  
</p>
<p>6. It was said that Mr. Al-Rashed was placed in incommunicado detention and subjected to 
ill-treatment both during his arrest and detention. Some days after his arrest, Mr. Al-Rashed was 
transferred to Al Hayr Prison near to Riyadh, where he is being currently held. His health has 
reportedly suffered a serious deterioration. 
</p>
<p>7. Faiz Abdelmohsen Al-Qaid, a citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 22 years old, is a 
student at the Faculty of Administrative Sciences at the University of Ibn Saud in Riyadh. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 65 
 
</p>
<p>8. According to the information received, Mr. Al-Qaid was arrested on 12 October 2005, 
at 5.30 p.m. in Riyadh, by agents of the Intelligence Services, without any warrant or charges 
laid against him. 
</p>
<p>9. It was said that the Intelligence Services impute Mr. Al-Qaid having got in contact with the 
Arab Commission for Human Rights and sent them, via the Internet, information pertaining to 
the detention of Majeed Hamdane b. Rashed Al-Qaid as well as about the state of prisons in 
Riyadh. 
</p>
<p>10. Khaled b. Mohamed Al-Rashed and Faiz Abdelmohsen Al-Qaid have neither been 
formally charged with any offence, nor been informed of the duration of their custodial order. 
They have not been brought before a judicial officer, nor been allowed to appoint a lawyer to act 
on his behalf, nor otherwise been provided the possibility to challenge the legality of their 
detention. 
</p>
<p>11. As the allegations of the source have not been disputed, the Working Group can only 
conclude that the detention of the above-mentioned two persons does not have any legal basis. 
This circumstance in itself already renders their detention utterly contrary to the applicable 
international norms and constitutes an extremely grave violation of the right of these persons to 
their liberty. 
</p>
<p>12. The above-mentioned two persons have not been informed of the charges against them; 
have been denied access to a defence lawyer, and have not been brought before a judge in the, 
respectively, 14 and 19 months since their arrest. 
</p>
<p>13. Additionally, according to the information provided by the source, which has remained 
unchallenged by the Government, the unlawful detention of Mr. Al-Rashed is motivated solely 
by his membership at the so-called Movement of Reformers while Mr. Al-Qaid is detained solely 
for his activities as a human rights defender. 
</p>
<p>14. As a consequence, and in the absence of any argument to the contrary submitted by the 
Government, the Working Group can only conclude that these persons have been detained solely 
because of their political activities and because their legitimate exercise of their rights to 
freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>15. In the light of the foregoing the Working Group expresses the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The detention of Mr. Al-Rashed and of Mr. Al-Qaid is in contravention of articles 9 
and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and falls within categories I and II of 
the categories applicable to the consideration of the cases submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>16. Consequent upon this opinion, the Working Group requests the Government to take the 
necessary steps to remedy the situation of these persons in order to bring it into conformity with 
the provisions and principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group further recommends to the Government to consider the possibility of 
becoming party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p>4. The Working Group further notes that the source informed the Group that Hamed Alaa

He is, therefore, no longer in detention.

</p>
<p>19. Isma&#239;l A&#239;ssa, born on 16 January 1972, of Algerian nationality, residing in Mauritania, 
secondary schoolteacher and master&#8217;s student in law, arrested on 29 May 2005; 
</p>
<p>20. Abdelmadjid Belbachir, born in 1974, of Algerian nationality, residing in Mauritania, 
student of religious sciences, arrested on 3 June 2005. 
</p>
<p>21. It was reported that the aforementioned persons, currently detained at the Nouakchott civil 
prison, were arrested between the months of April and June 2005 during a wave of arrests of 
opposition figures, presidents of associations, professors, lawyers, journalists and ordinary 
citizens known to have expressed criticism of the Government&#8217;s policy. They were not informed 
of the grounds for their arrest or the charges brought against them. 
</p>
<p>22. They were held incommunicado for periods ranging from 20 to 44 days, some at the 
Nouakchott police academy, others at El Mina police station No. 2, without being informed of 
the precise reasons for their arrest. The source adds that they were subjected to serious acts of 
torture and particularly inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>23. According to the Government in power at the time, these persons were arrested in 
connection with a matter concerning the internal security of the State, and were reportedly 
accused of belonging to an extremist group acting outside of any legal framework, calling for </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 68 
 
</p>
<p>violence and using mosques for sectarian political propaganda. During their interrogation, they 
were reproached for expressing subversive ideas that were detrimental to the interests of the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>24. Between 9 May and 12 July 2005, the aforementioned persons were brought by officers of 
the judicial police before the public prosecutor attached to the Nouakchott court. They were 
accused of having committed acts constituting criminal association, falsification and use of false 
documents and unauthorized acts that would expose their country to reprisals; such acts are 
covered by articles 77, 141, 142, 143, 246 and 247 of the Criminal Code, articles 3 and 8 of 
Act No. 64-098 of 9 June 1964 on associations, as amended by Act No. 73-007 of 
23 January 1973, and Act No. 73-157 of 2 July 1973, and by articles 3 and 20 of 
Act No. 2003-031 of 24 January 2003 on mosques. The prosecutor instructed the examining 
magistrate of the first chamber to investigate the case and issue arrest warrants for the accused. 
</p>
<p>25. Beginning in September 2005, many people who were arrested at the same time, in the 
same circumstances and with the same charges, were released through an amnesty measure. 
However, the 18 persons referred to above were not affected by this measure. Their lawyers 
subsequently petitioned for their provisional release. The examining magistrate accepted the 
petitions and on 14 September 2005 issued an order for their provisional release. However, the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office immediately appealed against that decision, citing the seriousness of the 
charges. On 6 April 2006, the indictment division of the Nouakchott court of appeal - the court 
supervising the decisions made by the examining magistrate - issued a final decision confirming 
the order. However, the prosecutor&#8217;s office filed an application for a judicial review of the 
court&#8217;s decision. 
</p>
<p>26. According to the source, under domestic law, the indictment division&#8217;s decision is 
enforceable. The persons in question were arrested for peacefully expressing their political 
views; they remained in detention because the authorities refused to apply to them a general 
amnesty for prisoners of conscience. They are still in detention because the authorities have 
refused to release them in spite of a final court decision on their provisional release. 
</p>
<p>27. The persons in question are still being deprived of their liberty, in violation of the 
procedure established by Mauritanian domestic law, which, in cases of pretrial detention, does 
not provide that decisions by the court&#8217;s indictment division are subject to an application for 
judicial review with suspensive effect. 
</p><p>28. The source adds that these persons are being held in detention solely for having peacefully 
expressed their political opinions. It has not been established that they have committed any 
specific reprehensible acts that can be qualified as criminal. Precisely for this reason, the 
examining magistrate assigned to this case ordered their provisional release, and the court&#8217;s 
indictment division confirmed the magistrate&#8217;s order. 
</p>
<p>29. The Working Group considers that the continued detention of these persons despite the 
decision of the indictment division of the Nouakchott court of appeal ordering their provisional 
release is a violation of the principle according to which any detention measure must be in strict 
compliance with the law. Their deprivation of liberty no longer has any legal basis because of the 
final court decision ordering their provisional release - a decision that the authorities have 
refused to implement. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 69 
 
</p>
<p>30. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of the aforementioned 18 persons is arbitrary, being in 
contravention of the provisions of articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
and falls within category I of the categories applicable to the consideration of the cases 
submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group, having rendered this opinion, requests the Government to take the 
necessary steps to remedy the situation of these persons.

</p>
<p>3. The Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the Government, which provided the 
Working Group with information concerning the allegations of the source. The reply of the 
Government was brought to the attention of the source, which made observations on it. 
</p>
<p>4. The case summarized below was reported to the Working Group as follows: 
Amer Haddara, aged 26; Shane Kent, aged 29; Izzydeen Attik; Fadal Sayadi, aged 25; 
Abdullah Merhi, aged 21; Ahmed Raad, aged 22; Ezzit Raad, aged 24; Hany Taha, aged 31; 
Aimen Joud, aged 21; Shoue Hammoud, aged 26; Majed Raad, aged 22; Bassam Raad, aged 24; 
and Abdul Nacer Benbrika, a 45-year-old dual Algerian-Australian citizen, also known as 
Abu Bakr, were arrested and charged with forming a terror cell following a series of coordinated 
anti-terror raids by New South Wales Police, Victorian and Federal Police in Sydney and 
Melbourne. Ten of them were arrested on 8 November 2005 and Majed Raad, Bassam Raad and 
Shoue Hammoud, the remaining three, were detained on 31 March 2006.  
</p>
<p>5. The 13 detainees have been charged with different terrorist offences under the anti-terror 
provisions of the Criminal Code of 1995. The offences are related to membership and support of 
an unnamed terrorist organization. None of the detainees has been charged with engaging in a 
terrorist act or committing an act in preparation of a terrorist act. According to their defence 
lawyers, the case against their clients is weak, based in part on hearsay and rumours, slim and 
peripheral. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 70 
 
</p>
<p>6. The detainees are being held on remand and have been classified by the State correctional 
authority, Corrections Victoria, to be kept at the Acacia Unit of Barwon maximum security 
prison, near Geelong, in Victoria. According to the source, the conditions of their detention are 
oppressive and in clear contrast with regimes normally accorded to unconvicted prisoners, 
established by the Minimum Standard Guidelines for Australian Prisons (2004). Some of the 
accused have been held in solitary confinement for several months. According to the source the 
high-security detention of all the detainees has occurred as a result of a blanket decision relating 
to terrorist offences per se, without consideration of their individual circumstances. 
</p>
<p>7. In December 2005, a bail application hearing was held in Melbourne for Hany Taha and 
Abdullah Merhi. Their request was dismissed. In January 2006, an application for bail was filed 
on behalf of Mr. Haddara before the Supreme Court of Victoria. The request was also dismissed 
on the basis that his case did not give rise to &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; as required by 
Section 15AA of the Crimes Act 1914. In his decision, Justice Osborn considered that 
Mr. Haddara&#8217;s conditions of detention were especially difficult. He stated that if such 
confinement continued for a protracted period pending trial, it might be regarded as constituting 
&#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; according to the referenced law.  
</p>
<p>8. In April 2006, an application for bail was filed on behalf of Mr. Attik on the basis of his 
mental health, the impact of the detention on his mental health and the lack of access to adequate 
health care in custody. The Supreme Court of Victoria rejected the application for bail. 
</p><p>9. In May 2006, another application for bail on behalf of Mr. Haddara was filed before the 
Supreme Court of Victoria, also on the basis of &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221;. This request was 
rejected; in spite of Justice Eames&#8217; statement noting that the preparation of his legal defence was 
difficult to his lawyer because of the remote location of the detention centre and the restrictive 
conditions of detention in the Acacia Unit at Barwon Prison.  
</p>
<p>10. The source alleges that the detention of these 13 persons is arbitrary, on the basis of 
alleged serious violations of their rights as defendants. According to the source, the detainees 
have a limited and restrictive access to legal representation. Thus, detainees&#8217; lawyers do not have 
appropriate access to the evidence gathered against the defendants; all their visits to the detainees 
are videotaped and recorded and all the materials provided to and received by the detainees, 
including documentation related to their defence, are scanned by prison officers. Very limited 
legal visits are often shortened. It was also reported that family members of the defendants have 
complained about verbal harassment and receiving hate mail. 
</p>
<p>11. In its reply, the Government states that each of the alleged offenders has been charged with 
one count of being a member of a terrorist organization, contrary to section 102.3 of the Criminal 
Code. Various additional charges have also been laid against some of the men, including charges 
of intentionally recruiting a person to join a terrorist organization, intentionally making funds 
available to a terrorist organization, and possessing an item connected to preparations for a 
terrorist act. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government confirmed that the above-mentioned offenders are being held on remand 
in the Acacia High Security Unit at Barwon Prison in Victoria, a unit that houses both remand 
and convicted prisoners. However, the two categories of prisoners do not mix. According to the 
Government, the above-mentioned defendants have never been held in solitary confinement and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 71 
 
</p>
<p>if each prisoner has an individual cell, he spends approximately six hours out of his cell each day 
and normally exercises with one other prisoner. Each cell contains standard equipment, including 
a computer with a DVD/CD-ROM drive to access the electronic brief of evidence against them. 
They are able to make applications for any special arrangements they may require to assist them 
in preparation of their defence, consistent with article 14, paragraph 3 (b) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). 
</p>
<p>13. The Government also states that remand prisoners are permitted one non-contact visit per 
week of one hour duration and one contact visit per month with any children they may have 
under the age of 16 years. They however remain shackled and manacled during the contact visit 
with children for security reasons. Remand prisoners have also telephone access and are 
permitted to make 25 personal telephone calls per week.  
</p>
<p>14. As far as visits by legal counsel are concerned, the Government states that remand 
prisoners do not have limits on the number of visits from professionals, except by the conflicting 
demands of other prisoners to have access to the contact room available for professional visits. 
Accordingly, there is a system of booking the contact room to guarantee access. It also states that 
lawyers may visit their clients in the Acacia Unit between 8.45 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. Visits are 
video monitored for security purposes, but there is no audio sound or recording. Remand 
prisoners are also allowed to make an unlimited number of legal professional calls.  
</p>
<p>15. Referring to allegations of the source concerning the dismissal of the application for bail of 
Mr. Haddara by Justice Eames whilst noting: &#8220;that the preparation of [the alleged offender&#8217;s] 
legal defence was difficult to his lawyer because of the location and restrictive conditions of 
detention in Acacia Unit at Barwon Prison&#8221;, the Government clarifies that the Judge went on to 
add: &#8220;Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that the applicant has been unreasonably denied access to 
his lawyer. Indeed the evidence is that he has made frequent contact with his lawyer.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>16. According to the Government all the above-mentioned detainees have been through 
committal proceedings, at which a Magistrate found that there was a case against each on which 
a reasonable jury could convict. On 1 September 2006, 11 of the alleged offenders were 
committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria on the charges under the Criminal 
Code. On 20 September 2006, the remaining two were also committed to the Supreme Court to 
stand trial and all matters have been listed for a directions hearing in the Supreme Court 
on 1 December 2006. 
</p>
<p>17. In its reply, the Government also provided detailed information addressing the allegations 
of lack of access to adequate health care in custody and the violation of the exercise of freedom 
of religion, especially during Ramadan. The Government informed that the allegations that the 
detainees were served pork meals have been referred to the Corrections Inspectorate for 
investigation. The Government also informed that complaints concerning the lack of access to 
adequate health care have been lodged by the detainees and are being investigated. 
</p>
<p>18. The Government considers that arbitrary detention occurs where the detention is not 
reasonable, necessary, proportionate, appropriate and justifiable in all of the circumstances. The 
alleged offenders, according to the Government, have been charged with serious offences and 
remanded in custody in a facility that the Victorian government considers appropriate, given the 
nature of the offences with which they have been charged. Further, they have had their </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 72 
 
</p>
<p>applications for bail reviewed and rejected by judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria. They 
have reasonable access to their lawyers and facilities for preparing their defence consistent with 
both international standards and Australian Guidelines. Moreover, the Victorian government has 
also thoroughly investigated all allegations of mistreatment. 
</p>
<p>19. Commenting on the Government&#8217;s reply, the source reiterates that the above-mentioned 
detainees were held in solitary confinement at least for more than 70 days in Unit 4, which has 
single-occupancy cells, each with its own enclosed yard, and no common areas. During their stay 
in Unit 4, the detainees have no contact with any other prisoners at all. The source insisted on the 
unnecessary restrictions on personal visits and the very intrusive measures imposed during the 
contact visits with children under 16. The source also provides detailed information concerning 
the alleged violations of the religious observances and diet, and on the violation of the right to 
health consequent to the detainees&#8217; conditions of detention and the lack of access to health care, 
particularly mental health care. According to the source, the level of mental health care available 
to the detainees falls short of that explicitly required by article 12 of the International Covenant 
on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and impliedly required by articles 7, 9 and 10 of 
ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>20. As a final matter, the source notes that the detainees have now all been committed to stand 
trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria at a date yet to be fixed. It is unlikely, however, that the 
trial will commence before late 2007, at the earliest. It may then continue for a period of 6 to 
12 months. This means that the detainees may be held in their current oppressive conditions as 
unconvicted remand prisoners for up to three years, which, according to the source, raises 
particular issues in relation to the guarantee that persons charged with a criminal offence must be 
tried without undue delay. The source is of the view that the detention is not reasonable, 
necessary, just or proportionate, as required by article 9, paragraph 1, of ICCPR. 
</p><p>21. The Working Group notes that the allegations submitted by the source basically refer to 
conditions of detention, allegations which, consequently, do not fall within the Working Group&#8217;s 
mandate, which refers to the lawfulness of the detention. The Working Group also notes that the 
source has submitted the same allegations to other United Nations human rights mechanisms, 
such as the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief; the Special Rapporteur on 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Special 
Rapporteur on the Right of Everyone to the Enjoyment of the Highest Attainable Standard of 
Physical and Mental Health and the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights while Countering Terrorism.  
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group considers that the conditions of detention of the above-mentioned 
persons, as described by the source and not contested by the Government, are particularly severe, 
especially taking into account that they have been imposed upon persons who have not yet been 
declared guilty and who must, accordingly, be presumed innocent. Conditions of detention are 
relevant for the Working Group solely in the case that their severity or harshness reaches such 
magnitude that they affect, compromise or impede the right to an adequate preparation and 
exercise of the defence in conditions that guarantee the principle of equality of arms. The 
Working Group pays particular attention, in this context, to the possibility to communicate, in 
private and without interferences, with the defence lawyer.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 73 
 
</p>
<p>23. In his communication, the source has invoked allegations that if they came to be 
established would constitute grave violations of the right to defence. The Government has 
refuted most of these allegations and furnished detailed information on the means put at the 
disposal of the defendants to prepare their defence and to communicate without major 
interferences with their lawyers. The information submitted by the Government was not 
commented on or refuted by the source. However, the Government has not refuted the allegation 
that correspondence between defendants and their lawyers are scanned by prison officers as well 
as the allegation that all the interviews between defendants and lawyers are videotaped, although 
without audio sound or recording, for security reasons. 
</p>
<p>24. With regard to the allegation that the detention is not reasonable, necessary, just or 
proportionate as required by article 9, paragraph 1, of ICCPR, the Working Group recognizes 
that the Committee on Human Rights has considered, in the framework of a temporary or pretrial 
detention of a judicial nature, that: &#8220;The drafting history of article 9, paragraph 1, confirms that 
&#8216;arbitrariness&#8217; is not to be equated with &#8216;against the law&#8217;, but must be interpreted more broadly to 
include elements of inappropriateness, injustice and lack of predictability. This means that 
remand in custody pursuant to lawful arrest must not only be lawful but reasonable in all 
circumstances. Further, remand in custody must be necessary in all circumstances, for example, 
to prevent flight, interference with evidence or the recurrence of crime&#8221;.<b>15</b> The Working Group 
notes that if several general criteria can be identified from the Committee&#8217;s jurisprudence, such 
as legality, legitimacy (of the detention&#8217;s goal), necessity, proportionality, and protection of 
human rights, every kind of deprivation of liberty may require additional and/or specific criteria.  
</p>
<p>25. In the case under consideration, the persons concerned are charged with serious offences; 
the investigation of the case was terminated in September 2006, less than a year after their arrest 
and detention, and all of them are now committed to stand trial before the Supreme Court of 
Victoria. The Working Group notes that even if the date of the trial is yet to be fixed, the period 
spent in pretrial detention could not be, at least at this stage, considered excessive.  
</p>
<p>26. Neither the source nor the Government have provided the Working Group with copies of 
the judicial decisions rejecting the applications for bail. While both the source and the 
Government have quoted some passages from these decisions, the Working Group is not in a 
position to make a definite assessment of the reasoning behind the dismissal by the Court of the 
defendants&#8217; applications for bail. It appears clear that the judges have given serious consideration 
to the arguments provided by the defence for release of some of the detainees or at least a 
relaxation of the conditions of their detention. The Working Group remains concerned, however, 
that the law appears to make the detention under extraordinarily restrictive conditions the rule for 
any person charged with a terrorist offence, without sufficient room for consideration of the 
specific charges against the detainees and their individual circumstances or dangerousness. The 
submissions of the parties suggest that the judges deciding on bail applications might not have 
sufficient discretion to consider these matters either, at least in the absence of &#8220;exceptional 
circumstances&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 74 
 
</p>
<p>27. Despite these concerns (and in the absence of more detailed submissions by the source and 
the Government thereon), in the light of the charges brought against the defendants and the 
length of time they have spent, at this stage, in custody, their pretrial detention does not seem to 
be disproportionate. The Working Group reiterates that the allegedly oppressive conditions of 
their detention per se and the consequences of these conditions on the mental health of the 
defendants do not fall within its mandate. 
</p>
<p>28. In conclusion, the Working Group considers that the material before it does not disclose 
such a lack of observance of international norms relating to a fair trial which would confer on 
the detention of Amer Haddara, Shane Kent, Izzydeen Attik, Fadal Sayadi, Abdullah Merhi, 
Ahmed Raad, Ezzit Raad, Hany Taha, Aimen Joud, Shoue Hammoud, Majed Raad, 
Bassam Raad, and Abdul Nacer Benbrika, an arbitrary character.

<p><b>OPINION No. 8/2007 (SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 5 July 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Ayman Ardenli and Muhammad Haydar Zammar. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>3. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government. The Working Group transmitted the reply provided by the Government to the 
source, which has made comments on it. The Working Group believes that it is in a position to 
render an opinion on the facts and circumstances of the case, in the context of the allegations 
made and the response of the Government thereto, as well as of the observations by the source. 
</p>
<p>4. According to the information submitted by the source Ayman Ardenli is a dual Syrian and 
Australian national, about 47 years of age, usually residing in Australia. 
</p>
<p>5. Mr. Ardenli was arrested at Damascus airport around August 2003. He was initially 
detained at the Aleppo Branch of Military Intelligence, where he was reportedly ill-treated and 
tortured. Thereafter he was transferred to the Far&#8217; Filisteen (Palestine Branch 235) detention 
centre of the Military Intelligence in Damascus, where he has been held since then. He is 
believed to be held in a communal cell measuring 475 cm by 475 cm with between 20 and 60 
other people. 
</p>
<p>6. It is alleged that Mr. Ardenli has not been given any opportunity to challenge the legality 
of his detention. He is being denied all access to a lawyer, his family or consular officials. He has 
not been charged with any offence. It is thought that his arrest and detention may be connected to 
his father&#8217;s previous involvement with the outlawed &#8220;Al Ikhwan al Muslimin&#8221; (&#8220;Muslim 
Brotherhood&#8221;). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 75 
 
</p>
<p>7. Muhammad Haydar Zammar is 43 years of age. He left the Syrian Arab Republic when he 
was about four years old and moved to Germany where he obtained citizenship. He reportedly 
lived in Hamburg. 
</p>
<p>8. Mr. Zammar was arrested in Morocco in October or November 2001, detained and 
interrogated there for two weeks and then secretly transferred to the Syrian Arab Republic. The 
newspaper <i>Washington Post</i> reported that senior Moroccan Government sources had informed it 
that agents of the United States of America had taken part in Mr. Zammar&#8217;s interrogation in 
Morocco, and that United States officials had known that he would subsequently be transferred 
to Syria. 
</p>
<p>9. Since November 2001, Mr. Zammar has been detained at the Far&#8217; Filisteen (Palestine 
Branch 235) detention centre of the Military Intelligence Service in Damascus. During the 
summer or autumn of the year 2002, Mr. Zammar reportedly received one visit by 
representatives of Germany. 
</p>
<p>10. It is alleged that Mr. Zammar has not been given any opportunity to challenge the legality 
of his detention. He is being denied all access to his lawyer and his family. He has not been 
charged with any offence. It is thought that his arrest and detention are related to his alleged 
links to Al-Qaeda. 
</p>
<p>11. The source alleges that the detention of Mr. Ayman Ardenli and Mr. Muhammad Haydar 
Zammar is arbitrary. Mr. Ardenli has spent nearly three years in incommunicado detention 
without any judicial decision to that effect. Mr. Zammar has spent close to five years in 
incommunicado detention (with the exception of the visit by German officials in 2002), without 
any judicial decision to that effect. The deprivation of their liberty is accordingly manifestly 
devoid of any legal basis. 
</p>
<p>12. The allegations of the source have been brought to the attention of the Government 
on 5 July 2006. The Government&#8217;s response, of 20 October 2006, states that Ayman Ardenli was 
released pursuant to a general amnesty issued by the President of the Syrian Arab Republic 
in 2005 and is, therefore, no longer in detention. 
</p>
<p>13. Concerning Muhammed Haydar Zammar, the Government states that he was in fact born 
in 1961, in Aleppo, Syria, is a German national and lived in Germany since 1971, as his father 
had legal residence in that country.  
</p>
<p>14. The Government states that he attended several military training courses in Pakistan and 
Afghanistan and joined the Hekmatyar forces to fight Russian military forces and other factions. 
He later took part in fighting in Bosnia. In late 1995, he was involved in an attempted attack on 
the United States Consulate in Hamburg (Germany) for which it was planned to make use of an 
exploding glider. He joined the ranks of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, met with Osama Bin Laden, 
and collected money for the mujahidin. 
</p><p>15. He was arrested in Casablanca on 8 December 2001 and was handed over to the Syrian 
authorities on 31 December 2001. He was summoned to appear before the Syrian State Security </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 76 
 
</p>
<p>Court (SSSC) on allegations of being a member of an extremist organization that carries out 
terrorist activities in the Syrian Arab Republic. These acts are punishable under Syrian law 
pursuant to articles 288, 304 and 306 of the Syrian Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>16. The reply of the Government has been brought to the attention of the source 
on 10 November 2006, which has made comments on it and provided updated information. As 
regards Ayman Ardenli, the source was neither in a position to confirm nor to deny the fact of 
his release. 
</p>
<p>17. The source explains that Muhammad Haydar Zammar appeared before the SSSC in 
October 2006. It alleges that he was convicted on four charges after an unfair trial on 
11 February 2007. He was given a sentence of 12 years, which, according to the source, is the 
common penalty for membership of the outlawed Syrian organization with the name of &#8220;Muslim 
Brotherhood&#8221;. Mr. Zammar stated during the trial that he had never been a member of the 
&#8220;Muslim Brotherhood&#8221;. No evidence of such membership was presented in court, and the 
organization itself later issued a statement denying that Mr. Zammar had ever been a member or 
had established any ties with it or with any member. 
</p>
<p>18. The source further informs that he was also convicted on three charges carrying lesser 
sentences pursuant to article 306 of the Syrian Criminal Code, which makes it a criminal offence 
to be a member of an &#8220;organization formed with the purpose of changing the economic and 
social status of the state&#8221;, to its article 278 for &#8220;carrying out activities that threaten the state or 
damage Syria&#8217;s relationship with a foreign country&#8221;, and to its article 285 for &#8220;weakening 
national sentiments and inciting sectarian strife&#8221;. The source states that it is common in Syria to 
charge political prisoners with these kinds of offences and that Mr. Zammar remains subjected to 
incommunicado detention, solitary confinement, torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>19. The source also expresses its concern that Mr. Zammar&#8217;s rights were violated by German 
and United States authorities. Apparently, officers from the German Federal Criminal Police 
Office (<i>Bundeskriminalamt</i> - BKA) provided information that was used for his arrest in 
Morocco. Officials from the German intelligence and law enforcement services interrogated 
Mr. Zammar in Syria for three days in November 2002 at a time when it was apparent that he 
was held in incommunicado detention and deprived of procedural rights and guarantees. 
United States officials reportedly provided written questions to his interrogators in Morocco, but 
did not have direct access to him. According to the source, Mr. Zammar was forcibly removed 
from Morocco to the Syrian Arab Republic in December 2001 in connection with the so-called 
&#8220;renditions&#8221; programme led by the United States. 
</p>
<p>20. The source states that, until the end of February 2007, Mr. Zammar had not received any 
visits by relatives in prison. He only had brief access to his lawyer and to members of his family 
during the court sessions before the SSSC between October 2006 and February 2007. 
Furthermore, it was not until 7 November 2006 that Mr. Zammar received his first visit from a 
German diplomat. 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group observes that Mr. Ayman Ardenli has been arrested as an Australian 
resident, apprehended at Damascus airport and detained incommunicado at a military centre for a 
prolonged period of three years. He has not been given the opportunity at any time to challenge 
the legality of his detention, has not been charged with any offence, has been denied access to a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 77 
 
</p>
<p>lawyer, and has not been judged in any trial. In accordance with its Revised Methods of Work, 
chapter C. (a), the Working Group reserves the right to render an opinion in this serious case of 
deprivation of liberty without any legal basis, notwithstanding that the Government of Syria 
informed it about the release of Mr. Ardenli. 
</p>
<p>22. As to the case of Mr. Muhammad Haydar Zammar, the Working Group notes that the 
allegations of his secret transfer from Morocco to Syria have not been denied. As a citizen of 
Germany, he was arrested in Morocco and held in custody for two weeks, interrogated and then 
sent to be kept in detention in Syria outside of any procedure contemplated by law. The Working 
Group has already stated that this practice known as &#8220;renditions&#8221;, i.e. the informal transfer of a 
person from the jurisdiction of one State to that of another on the basis of negotiations between 
administrative authorities of the two countries without procedural safeguards, is irremediably in 
conflict with the requirements of international law (A/HRC/4/40). 
</p>
<p>23. It has not been denied that he was held in incommunicado detention for a significant period 
of no less than five years. During this term, he did not enjoy his right to legal defence and 
procedural safeguards. When he was finally sent to a trial before the SSSC, the Working Group 
considers that despite the severity of the charges Mr. Zammar has not been able to challenge the 
accusations against him, which undermines their credibility.  
</p>
<p>24. As the Working Group has already expressed in other cases, there are serious concerns 
about this Court&#8217;s non-compliance with international standards on the right to a fair trial 
(Opinions Nos. 21/2000, 15/2006 and 16/2006). Lawyers are not granted access to their clients 
prior to the trial, proceedings are initiated before legal representatives have an opportunity to 
study the case file, and lawyers are frequently denied their right to speak on behalf of their 
clients. Lawyers require written permission from the Court&#8217;s President before they can see their 
clients in prison. Moreover, those sentenced by the SSSC and the Field Military Court have no 
right to appeal their sentences (A/HRC/4/40/Add.1). Therefore, the Working Group believes that 
in the case of Mr. Zammar, the violation of the international norms related to a fair trial is of 
such gravity as to confer on the deprivation of his liberty an arbitrary character. 
</p>
<p>25. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Ayman Ardenli was arbitrary during the period of 
August 2003 until his release, as it contravened the principles and norms set forth in 
articles 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and it falls into category I of the methods of work 
adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Muhammad Haydar Zammar is arbitrary, as it 
contravenes the principles and norms set forth in articles 9 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
falls into category III of the methods of work adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 78 
 
</p>
<p>26. Consequent upon the opinion rendered, and taking into account that Mr. Ayman Ardenli 
has been released, the Working Group requests the Government to take the necessary steps to 
remedy the situation and bring it into conformity with the standards and principles set forth in 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights.

</p>
<p>3. The Working Group regrets that the Government has not provided information on the cases 
despite the opportunity it was given to comment. The Working Group was informed by the 
Government, by a letter dated 22 March 2007, that the requisite information is being gathered, 
without requesting for its reply, an extension of the 90-days time limit, which is the applicable 
time limit as stipulated in the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work. Upon a further letter of the 
Working Group to the Government, dated 13 April 2007, indicating that the Working Group is 
going to consider these seven cases during its upcoming session, the Government has not availed 
itself of the opportunity to comment on the allegations submitted by the source. In the light of 
the allegations made, the Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion on 
the facts and circumstances of the cases. 
</p>
<p>4. The case summarized below was reported to the Working Group as follows: Hussain 
Khaled Albuluwy, 36 years old, of Saudi nationality, is an IT Manager for the RMZ Company 
located in the Petromin neighbourhood of Dammam. It was reported that he was arrested on 
17 June 2003, at his work place, by agents of the Security Services, without a warrant or charges 
laid against him. It was said that the Security Services impute Mr. Albuluwy of having been 
involved in a car accident that caused fatal victims.  
</p>
<p>5. Mr. Albuluwy has been detained for more than 40 months at Juba&#239;l prison in Riyadh, one 
year of which in solitary confinement. It was further reported that no charges have been laid 
against him and that no trial date has been set. Furthermore, he has been refused access to a 
defence lawyer.

Riyadh on 20 September 1994, also residing in Ha&#239; Al Aakik, Riyadh, are detained in a General 
Intelligence Services detention centre located in Al Kharj, Al Kharj Province, a centre run by the 
Ministry of the interior. 
</p>
<p>7. It was reported that these two brothers were arrested on 26 February 2005 at 3 p.m. at their 
home by members of the General Intelligence Services. No arrest warrant was shown to them 
and no reasons were given for their apprehension. Their house was also searched without a 
search warrant being shown to them. No reasons were communicated to them for their 
apprehensions. After their arrests, they were transferred to Al Hayr prison in Riyadh. Later, they 
were taken to Al Kharj Prison. No charges have been laid against them. They have not been 
brought before a judge and have not been able to challenge the lawfulness of their detention 
before a judicial authority. No trial date has been set. Furthermore, they do not know the 
eventual duration of their detention. Brothers Al Sabih have been refused the right to receive 
visits and the access to lawyers.  
</p>
<p>8. Salah Hamid Amr Al Saidi, 28 years old, of Saudi nationality, with identity card 
No. 194136 issued in Mecca (Saudi Arabia) on 20 January 1994, widower and father of two girls 
aged 3 and 6, residing in Al Jazair Ha&#239; Al Uta&#239;biya Avenue, Mecca, is an officer of the Haj 
Ministry. He was arrested on 15 January 2006 by agents of the General Intelligence Services 
without a warrant. At the moment of his arrest he was informed that the order of arrest had been 
issued by the Ministry of the interior. Mr. Al Saidi was transferred to the General Intelligence 
Services Headquarters, where he was interrogated for several days. He has been detained for 
more than 10 months at Al Racifa prison in Mecca. It was further reported that no charges have 
been laid against him and that no date for a trial has been set. He has furthermore been refused 
access to lawyers. 
</p>
<p>9. Ahmed Abdo Ali Gubran, a Yemeni national, born on 1 January 1974 in Al Badia, 
Yemen, residing, since 1981, in Riyadh; a lawyer and legal advisor; with Yemeni passport 
No. 00609 438, issued in Riyadh on 13 June 2001 by the General Consulate of Yemen, married 
and father of four children, was arrested on 15 September 2004 at Riyadh International Airport 
upon his arrival from Damascus, where he had stayed during three months attending a 
postgraduate university course. No proper arrest warrant was shown to him and no reasons were 
given to justify his arrest. 
</p><p>10. Ali Gubran has not been given an opportunity to be heard by a judicial authority. He has 
not been presented before a judge or charged. After his first three months in secret and 
incommunicado detention in a cell measuring two square metres, Mr. Gubran was reportedly 
informed that no charges would be laid against him and that he would soon be released. 
However, he was transferred to Al Kharj prison. Mr. Gubran has not been allowed to contact or 
to appoint a defence lawyer or to establish contact with his consular representative. The General 
Consulate of Yemen has limited itself to inform Mr. Gubran&#8217;s relatives about his detention at 
Al Kharj prison. Mr. Gubran has not enjoyed any judicial recourse to contest the lawfulness of 
his detention.  
</p>
<p>11. Manna Mohamed Al-Ahmed Al-Ghamidi, 32 years old, a schoolteacher, residing in 
Al-Kharj, with identity card No. 1007820119, issued on 28 August 1989 at Al-Kharj, was 
arrested on 2 December 2005 at Al-Kharj by members of the General Intelligence Services who </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 80 
 
</p>
<p>did not produce an arrest warrant. Mr. Al-Ghamidi was transferred to the General Intelligence 
Services compound in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) where he was interrogated during several days and 
allegedly ill-treated. Later he was moved to Al Taif. 
</p>
<p>12. Mr. Al-Ghamidi was kept in incommunicado detention for three months. He was refused 
his right to contact a defence lawyer. Later he was accused of financing illegal charity 
associations and was brought before a judicial authority in Al Taif which ordered his immediate 
liberation for lack of evidence to sustain the charges. However, the agents refused to release him 
and transferred Mr. Al-Ghamidi first to Al Alicha prison and later to El Melz prison where he is 
currently being held. Mr. Al-Ghamidi has been detained for more than one year without a trial.  
</p>
<p>13. Jasser b. Mohamed Al-Khanfari Al-Qahtani, born on 22 September 1967, residing in 
Al Thuqba, Al Dammam (Saudi Arabia), a teacher and headmaster of a primary school, was 
arrested in Dammam on 18 March 2006 by agents of the General Security Intelligence Services, 
who neither produced any warrant nor other relevant arrest decision by a public authority. 
Mr. Al-Qahtani was taken to his house with a police escort. His home was searched, however, no 
search warrant was shown to him. Mr. Al-Qahtani was later moved to the General Security 
Intelligence Headquarters at Dammam where he was interrogated. Subsequently, he was 
transferred to the prison of Al Dammam where he is currently being held. Mr. Al-Qahtani has 
not been informed of the reasons for his arrest or of any charge brought against him. His 
relatives have not been allowed to visit him and he has not been authorized to contact or to 
appoint a defence lawyer.  
</p>
<p>14. The source argues that, as it has detailed for every individual case, these seven persons 
were not informed of the reasons for their arrest. No charges have been laid against them. With 
the only exception of Mr. Al-Ghamidi, they have not been brought before a judge and have not 
been able to challenge the lawfulness of their detention before a judicial authority. No dates for 
trials have been set. Furthermore, these persons are not aware of the eventual duration of their 
detention. 
</p>
<p>15. Although Mr. Al-Ghamidi was indeed brought before a judicial authority after three 
months of incommunicado detention, which ordered his release, the Government failed to 
comply with the release order and maintains his detention. 
</p>
<p>16. The Working Group observes that while these allegations were submitted to the Group 
through individual communications, they all refer to persons deprived of their liberty under 
similar circumstances. The Working Group therefore considers that it is appropriate to deal with 
them in a single opinion. 
</p>
<p>17. In the light of the allegations submitted and in the absence of Government&#8217;s information 
regarding the cases, the Working Group concludes that the seven persons mentioned above were 
not informed about the reasons for their arrests; were not informed about the charges laid against 
them; were not allowed to consult or to appoint a defence lawyer; could not effectively contest or 
appeal their detention; and continue to be deprived of their liberty without having been formally 
charged or tried. Although Mr. Al-Ghamidi was brought before a judicial authority, which 
ordered his immediate release, this judicial order has been disregarded by the Government and 
Mr. Al-Ghamidi remains in detention. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 81 
 
</p>
<p>18. In the Working Group&#8217;s view, the current deprivation of liberty of the above-mentioned 
seven persons amounts to arbitrary detention. Their detention violates the guarantees afforded by 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with respect to the right not to be arbitrarily deprived 
of liberty. 
</p>
<p>19. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Hussain Khaled Albuluwy, Abdullah b. Slimane Al 
Sabih, Sultan b. Slimane Al Sabih, Salah Hamid Amr Al Saidi, Ahmed Abdo Ali Gubran, 
Manna Mohamed Al Ahmed Al Ghamidi and Jasser b. Mohamed Al Khanfari Al Qahtani 
is arbitrary, being in contravention of articles 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, and falls within category I of the categories applicable to the consideration 
of cases submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>20. Consequent upon the opinion rendered, the Working Group requests the Government to 
take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and bring it into conformity with the standards 
and principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to study the 
possibility of ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>Adopted on 10 May 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>OPINION No. 10/2007 (LEBANON) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 30 November 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having provided the 
requested information in a timely manner. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the allegations made, the Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government. It has transmitted the Government&#8217;s reply to the source, and has received the 
source&#8217;s comments on it. The Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion 
on the facts and circumstances of the case, in the context of the allegations made, the 
Government&#8217;s reply and the source&#8217;s comments. 
</p>
<p>5. The case mentioned below was reported to the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention as 
follows: Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane, a Palestinian born in 1965, a chauffeur, domiciled at the 
Bourj Barajneh camp in Beirut, was arrested on 5 February 1994 in Beirut, by members of the 
Syrian intelligence services, and was taken to Beau Rivage, a Syrian intelligence interrogation 
centre. After 10 days, he was handed over to the Furn El Chebbak - Dabta Adlieh gendarmerie in 
Beirut, where he was held incommunicado for one month. Mr. Chaabane was later brought to </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 82 
 
</p>
<p>Roumieh central prison, where he is currently being held. Mr. Chaabane was accused of 
murdering a Jordanian diplomat, Na&#235;b Omran al-Maaitha, first secretary of the Jordanian 
Embassy in Beirut, and received a death sentence, which was commuted to life imprisonment 
on 19 October 1994. 
</p>
<p>6. According to the source, Mr. Chaabane was convicted by the Justice Council solely on the 
basis of confessions obtained under torture by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. His 
arrest and trial took place in breach of Lebanon&#8217;s international commitments, in particular the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Lebanon has ratified. 
</p>
<p>7. The source adds that the actual perpetrators of Mr. al-Maaitha&#8217;s murder were convicted 
and executed in Jordan. Mr. Chaabane is still being held in detention, despite the fact that his 
innocence has been recognized. According to the source, the Lebanese courts are unable to retry 
Mr. Chaabane, as verdicts handed down by the Justice Council are not subject to appeal, which is 
a violation of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>8. The source considers that Mr. Chaabane&#8217;s detention is arbitrary and illegal. He was 
arrested without a warrant and was held in detention for 40 days without being brought before an 
examining magistrate or a procurator. His trial reportedly fell far short of the minimum 
requirements for a fair and just trial. Mr. Chaabane was convicted solely on the basis of 
confessions obtained under torture. The source concludes that Mr. Chaabane&#8217;s continued 
detention after his innocence was confirmed by the arrest of the actual perpetrators, coupled with 
the Lebanese judicial system&#8217;s inability to retry him, means that his detention is of an arbitrary 
nature. 
</p>
<p>9. In its reply, the Government explains that the judicial body known as the Justice Council is 
chaired by the president of the court of cassation, and is composed of four judges of that court, 
who serve as its members. It is a special court established by the legislature to consider serious 
cases, in particular those involving the internal and external security of the State, in accordance 
with articles 270 and 336 of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>10. In accordance with Decree No. 4807 of 25 February 1994, the case of the murder in Beirut 
on 29 January 1994 of the first secretary of the Jordanian Embassy in Lebanon, Na&#235;b Omran 
al-Maaitha, was referred to the Justice Council because it involved an attack against the internal 
security of the State. 
</p>
<p>11. On 19 October 1994, the Justice Council found Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane guilty, 
in accordance with article 549, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code, and imposed the death 
sentence, which was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment with forced labour, in 
accordance with article 253 of the Criminal Code. Mr. Chaabane was also found guilty under 
article 72 of the Criminal Code of the serious offence of possessing weapons. The sentences are 
being served concurrently, the most severe being the sentence of life imprisonment with forced 
labour. These sentences were imposed on Mr. Chaabane for his participation, together with 
Tha&#8217;ir Mohammed Ali, in the premeditated murder of Na&#235;b al-Maaitha, first secretary of the 
Jordanian Embassy in Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>12. On 2 December 2005, Mahmoud Chaabane filed an appeal against the verdict handed 
down on 19 October 2004, and requested a retrial. His appeal was based on a judgement reached </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 83 
 
</p>
<p>on 3 December 2001 by the State Security Court of Jordan. According to the judgement, 
Yasir Mohammed Ahmad Salamah Abu Shinar, also known as Tha&#8217;ir Mohammed Ali, and 
others were found guilty of belonging to an illegal association, the Revolutionary Council, which 
had been formed with the aim of carrying out military operations against the security of certain 
States, including the murder of the first secretary of the Jordanian Embassy in Lebanon, 
Na&#235;b al-Maaitha. The judgement supposedly proved that Mr. Chaabane was innocent, since it 
contradicted the verdict handed down by Lebanon&#8217;s Justice Council. 
</p>
<p>13. On 21 March 2006, the Justice Council issued a decision formally accepting the request for 
a retrial, but rejecting it in substance. The Justice Council upheld the decision under appeal, as 
the conditions for a retrial set out in article 328 of the Lebanese Code of Criminal Procedure had 
not been met, in particular paragraph (b), which reads as follows: &#8220;A retrial may be allowed if 
the individual has been found guilty of a serious or major crime and another individual has 
subsequently been found guilty of the same crime in the same capacity, provided that there is 
evidence to acquit the person found guilty.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>14. The judgement cited as a basis for a retrial was issued by a Jordanian court and not by a 
Lebanese court, while article 328, paragraph (b), states that the two judgements must be rendered 
by Lebanese courts. Furthermore, since there is no contradiction between the Lebanese and the 
Jordanian judgements, the latter does not prove that Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane is innocent of 
the charges brought against him. The evidence adduced for Mr. Chaabane&#8217;s appeal was 
considered insufficient to reopen the case. 
</p>
<p>15. Having reconsidered the legal procedures and the judgements in the case of the murder of 
the first secretary of the Jordanian Embassy in Lebanon, the Government contends that 
Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane is serving a prison sentence imposed on him in accordance with a 
verdict issued by the highest court in Lebanon, and following a trial that was properly conducted 
in Lebanon. The denial of the application for a retrial was based on Lebanese law. 
</p>
<p>16. In its comments on the Government&#8217;s reply, the source emphasizes that the Government 
has not replied to the allegations concerning the conditions of Mr. Chaabane&#8217;s arrest. It reiterates 
that the Syrian intelligence services arrested him and held him incommunicado for 10 days, 
notwithstanding the fact that they were not authorized to do so, and that his confessions were 
extracted under torture. Mr. Chaabane had no access to his family, a lawyer or a doctor, and he 
was completely deprived of the protection of Lebanese law. To obtain his confession, the Syrian 
intelligence services in Beirut tortured him. The source repeats that Mr. Chaabane was tried by a 
special court, which relied solely on confessions extracted under torture. 
</p>
<p>17. The source adds that Mr. Chaabane was unable to appeal against his conviction because 
judgements issued by the Justice Council were, at the time, irrevocable and not subject to any 
appeal. In December 2005, the law was amended to allow persons convicted by this court to 
request a review of their conviction. Mr. Chaabane&#8217;s appeal was lodged in accordance with this 
amendment, but it was denied. The source emphasizes that some of the judges who had 
convicted Mr. Chaabane were among those who considered his appeal. They would be reluctant 
to challenge verdicts that they themselves had handed down. According to the source, this 
review is therefore not an effective remedy. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 84 
 
</p>
<p>18. Lastly, regarding the Government&#8217;s contention in its reply that there is no contradiction 
between the judgements handed down by the Jordanian and Lebanese courts, the source points 
out that the judgement of the Jordanian court never mentions the alleged involvement of 
Mr. Chaabane in this case and that, in any event, according to the Jordanian and Lebanese 
forensic medical examiners, there was only one gunman, even though two people - in this case, 
Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane and the person convicted in Jordan - both signed confessions 
stating that they had shot the diplomat. 
</p>
<p>19. Based on the foregoing, the Working Group notes that the Government has not challenged 
the allegations concerning the circumstances of Mr. Chaabane&#8217;s arrest, detention and 
interrogation by the Syrian services. Mr. Chaabane was allegedly held incommunicado for 
10 days on the premises of the Syrian services in Beirut, and confessions were allegedly 
extracted under torture - confessions that served as a basis for his being sentenced to death. Nor 
has the Government contested the fact that Mr. Chaabane was unable to have his conviction 
reviewed by a higher tribunal in accordance with the requirements of article 14, paragraph 5, of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Lebanon is a party. In its case 
law, the Human Rights Committee has on several occasions stated that the right to appeal 
established under article 14, paragraph 5, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights imposes on States parties a duty substantially to review conviction and sentence, both as 
to sufficiency of the evidence and of the law.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group considers that to be sentenced to capital punishment, when the 
Government has not provided evidence that the individual had the ability to have his guilty 
finding and conviction examined by a higher jurisdiction, is itself a very egregious breach of the 
standards of a fair trial. A fortiori, when the convicted person contends that his confessions were 
extracted under torture and when new evidence supports that contention. 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group considers that, in the light of the circumstances, the violation of 
article 14, paragraph 5, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is of such 
gravity as to confer on the detention and sentencing of Mr. Chaabane an arbitrary character. 
</p>
<p>22. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane is arbitrary, being in 
contravention of the provisions of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and falls within category III of the categories applicable to the 
consideration of the cases submitted to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group, having rendered this opinion, requests the Government to take the 
necessary steps to remedy the situation of Mr. Chaabane, in conformity with the standards and 
principles set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p><b>OPINION No. 11/2007 (AFGHANISTAN and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 11 December 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Amine Mohammad Al-Bakry. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The States are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group regrets that neither the Government of Afghanistan nor the 
Government of the United States of America have replied. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>4. According to the source, Amine Mohammad Al-Bakry, born on 29 December 1968, of 
Yemeni nationality, residing at Old Airport Road in the city of Al Medinah, Saudi Arabia, is the 
director of a private company specialized in the import and export of diamonds and precious 
stones. The company is owned by Djamel Ahmed Khalifa, husband of a sister of 
Osama bin Laden.  
</p>
<p>5. The source reports that Mr. Al-Bakry was abducted on 28 December 2002 in Thailand, 
during a business trip to Bangkok, allegedly by agents of the intelligence services of the 
United States or of Thailand. During the whole year 2003, his whereabouts were unknown. The 
Thai authorities confirmed to Mr. Al-Bakry&#8217;s relatives that he had entered Thailand&#8217;s territory 
but denied knowing his whereabouts. In January 2004, Mr. Al-Bakry&#8217;s relatives received a letter 
from him through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), informing them that he 
was kept in detention at the United States Air Force Base of Baghram, near Kabul, Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>6. The source states that Mr. Al-Bakry was detained due to his commercial connections with 
Mr. Khalifa. Mr. Khalifa himself was arrested in San Francisco, United States of America, and, 
after four months in detention, expelled to Jordan. In Jordan he was detained during two months 
without charges or trial. He is back in Saudi Arabia in freedom. The source considers that 
Mr. Khalifa was detained due to his family connection with Osama bin Laden. 
</p>
<p>7. The source alleges that Mr. Al-Bakry has been detained for (at the time of submission of 
the communication) more than 41 months in the military base of Baghram without any charge 
laid against him. No trial date has been set. Furthermore, he has been refused access to defence 
lawyers and the only visits he may receive are those from representatives of ICRC. Mr. Al-Bakry 
is not able to challenge the lawfulness of his detention or to appear before a competent, 
independent and impartial judicial authority.  
</p><p>8. According to the source, States are obliged to apply the norms of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to all persons under their jurisdiction. The Covenant thus 
applies in all territories under the effective control of the Afghan and the United States 
Governments and to all persons under their jurisdiction. The United States has not temporarily 
derogated from of its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
in conformity with article 4 of the Covenant and with general comment No. 31 (2004) of the 
Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, para.10). </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 86 
 
</p>
<p>9. The source argues that Mr. Al-Bakry has been denied the right to a fair trial recognized by 
articles 105 and 106 of the Third Geneva Convention and article 75 of its Additional Protocol I. 
Both Governments deny prisoner-of-war status to the persons detained at Baghram military base. 
Consequently, international human rights law should be applied. The source adds that the right to 
a fair trial is inalienable and constitutes a guarantee necessary to the effective enjoyment of all 
human rights and the preservation of legality in a democratic society.  
</p>
<p>10. The Working Group would have welcomed the cooperation of the two Governments 
concerned. In the absence of any reply from them, the Working Group considers that the 
allegations of the source have not been disputed.  
</p>
<p>11. The Working Group notes that Mr. Al-Bakry was deprived of his freedom in Thailand. 
There is no indication that the circumstances under which he was arrested in any way involved 
an armed conflict which could trigger the applicability of international humanitarian law. In this 
context, the Working Group recalls that it has previously noted &#8220;that the global struggle against 
international terrorism does not, as such, constitute an armed conflict for the purposes of the 
applicability of international humanitarian law&#8221;.<b>17</b> As stated also by ICRC: &#8220;When armed 
violence is used outside the context of an armed conflict in the legal sense or when a person 
suspected of terrorist activities is not detained in connection with any armed conflict, 
humanitarian law does not apply. Instead, domestic laws, as well as international criminal law 
and human rights govern. [&#8230;] The designation &#8216;global war on terror&#8217; does not extend the 
applicability of humanitarian law to all events included in this notion, but only to those which 
involve armed conflict.&#8221;<b>18</b> The rules of international law governing Mr. Al-Bakry&#8217;s detention are 
therefore to be found in international human rights law, in particular in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which both the United States of America and 
Afghanistan are parties (as well as, it might be added, Thailand). 
</p>
<p>12. Article 9 of the Covenant provides in paragraph 1 that &#8220;[e]veryone has the right to liberty 
and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be 
deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are 
established by law&#8221;. Paragraph 4 of article 9 enshrines the right to judicial review of the legality 
of detention. It reads: &#8220;Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be 
entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on 
the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful.&#8221;

</p>
<p>13. Mr. Al-Bakry was secretly arrested by unidentified agents probably belonging to 
United States information services, or to their Thai counterparts acting on instructions from 
the United States services, in Bangkok, where - according to the undisputed account of the 
source - he was carrying out his habitual business. Nobody, not even his close family, was 
informed of this detention. In January 2004, his family learned - only through ICRC - that he has 
been detained since a date unknown at the Baghram United States Airbase in Afghanistan. 
Except for ICRC visits and the possibility to transmit letters through them, he is held there 
completely incommunicado. He has not been informed of any charges raised against him. He has 
not had any possibility to challenge the lawfulness of his situation before a judicial authority, as 
article 9, paragraph 4 of ICCPR requires for all cases of detention, whether criminal charges are 
raised in judicial proceedings or detention remains administrative. No lawyer has been able to 
visit him. Accordingly, the deprivation of liberty suffered by Mr. Al-Bakry since 
December 2002, i.e. for the last four-and-a-half years, is in violation of article 9, paragraphs 1 
and 4, of ICCPR which are the applicable provisions of international law, and constitutes a very 
serious form of &#8220;arbitrary detention&#8221; and an extremely grave violation of his human rights. 
</p>
<p>14. This arbitrary detention is directly perpetrated by the United States, who is therefore 
responsible for it. The Working Group notes, however, that, at least since January 2004, 
Mr. Al-Bakry has been detained on Afghan soil. All the information in the public domain and 
available to the Working Group indicates that the Government of Afghanistan is well aware of 
the fact that the United States Government is holding detainees in situations such as 
Mr. Al-Bakry&#8217;s at Baghram Air Base, a military base the United States runs with the consent of 
the Government of Afghanistan since the end of the international armed conflict at the end of the 
year 2001. The Government of Afghanistan has not informed the Working Group of any 
measures taken to address this matter. The Working Group recalls that under article 2 of 
ICCPR, each State party assumes not only the obligation not to actively engage in violations, but 
also &#8220;&#8230; to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights 
recognized in the present Covenant&#8221;.<b>19</b> This obligation is incompatible with the acceptance of 
situations of year-long arbitrary detention of individuals on one&#8217;s territory by a foreign power. 
The Working Group can therefore only conclude that Afghanistan also bears responsibility for 
the arbitrary detention of Mr. Al-Bakry. 
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group notes that the role of the authorities of Thailand in the transfer of 
Mr. Al-Bakry to United States custody is not clear. In any event, Mr. Al-Bakry having been only 
briefly in the custody of the Thai authorities - if  at all - and this detention having occurred more 
than four years ago, the Working Group did not consider it necessary to bring the 
communication to the attention of the Government of Thailand and to seek its observations. The 
Working Group notes, however, that in its most recent report (A/HRC/4/40) it called attention 
with great concern to the question of irregular extraditions referred to as &#8220;extraordinary 
renditions&#8221;, of which Mr. Al-Barkry&#8217;s case would appear to be an example. In this respect, the 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  The Working Group recalls that the Human Rights Committee has clarified that &#8220;States 
</p>
<p>parties are required by article 2, paragraph 1, to respect and to ensure the Covenant rights to all 
persons who may be within their territory and to all persons subject to their jurisdiction.&#8221; 
(General comment No. 31 (2004) on the nature of the general legal obligation imposed on States 
parties to the Covenant, paragraph 10.) </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 88 
 
</p>
<p>Working Group reiterates that &#8220;[t]he practice of &#8220;renditions&#8221;, i.e. the informal transfer of a 
person from the jurisdiction of one State to that of another on the basis of negotiations between 
administrative authorities of the two countries (often the intelligence services), without 
procedural safeguards is irremediably in conflict with the requirements of international law. 
When a Government eludes procedural safeguards, in particular the affected person&#8217;s right to be 
heard, it cannot in good faith claim that it has taken reasonable steps to protect that person&#8217;s 
human rights after removal, including the right not to be arbitrarily detained. As a consequence, 
it will share responsibility for ensuing arbitrary detention&#8221;. (A/HRC/4/40, para. 50). 
</p>
<p>16. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Mr. Al-Bakry is arbitrary, being in contravention of 
articles 2 and 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and falls within 
category I of the applicable categories to the consideration of cases submitted to the 
Working Group. Both the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of Afghanistan bear responsibility for the violation of his right to liberty. 
</p>
<p>17. Consequent upon the opinion rendered, the Working Group requests both Governments to 
take the necessary steps to remedy the situation, and to bring it into conformity with the 
standards and principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>Adopted on 11 May 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>OPINION No. 12/2007 (ECUADOR) 
Communication: addressed to the Government on 23 March 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Antonio Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Both States are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006). 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group conveys its appreciation to the Government for having provided the 
requested information. 
</p>
<p>3. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 322/2006). 
</p>
<p>4. Antonio Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor, an Ecuadorian national born on 30 April 1951, a state 
schoolteacher with 31 years of teaching experience in Ecuador, residing in Quito, is detained in 
Quito&#8217;s prison No. 3, C wing, cell No. 20. He was arrested by police officers on 21 January 2005 
at his place of work, Escuela Rep&#250;blica de Chile in Quito, while he was teaching a class. The 
police officers did not produce a warrant for his arrest. Mr. Garc&#233;s Loor was taken to the 
premises of the judicial police. 
</p><p>5. Three days after his arrest, Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor was remanded in custody on pretrial detention 
by the magistrate of the tenth court of investigation, Luis Mora, and charged with committing an </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 89 
 
</p>
<p>indecent act with a minor. After reports were received from the photographic laboratory where 
Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor had taken his film to be developed, he was accused of having taken 
photographs of a pornographic nature of a girl. Garc&#233;s Loor denied having taken the 
photographs. He contended that two mischievous girls borrowed his camera during a trip to 
Guayllabamba zoo, and took photographs of him and of another man, Segundo Mogrovejo. 
</p><p>6. After his indictment, Garc&#233;s Loor was summoned to attend court hearings on three 
occasions. On each occasion, the hearings had to be adjourned because the prosecution did not 
appear, and they were postponed for two months. The accused has been held in pretrial detention 
for over a year without having been given the opportunity to be heard by a judge. 
7. The source states that Garc&#233;s Loor&#8217;s detention is, in any case, arbitrary and illegal, given 
that on 20 June 2006, the National Congress decriminalized the offence of indecent assault in a 
law amending the Criminal Code. Garc&#233;s Loor cannot therefore be tried under any statute, since 
the corresponding articles of the Criminal Code have been repealed. 
</p>
<p>8. The source also states that Garc&#233;s Loor was tortured on National Police premises by an 
employee of the prosecutor&#8217;s office who works on the third floor of those premises, and who hit 
him repeatedly in the sacrum with a stick inscribed with the words &#8220;human rights&#8221;. When 
Garc&#233;s Loor was subsequently taken to a cell where there were other detainees, the police 
officers told them that they were bringing them a rapist. This led the inmates to strip him and hit 
him brutally, insulting him and burning his left cheek with a cigarette. The source alleges that 
these acts have not been duly investigated. As a result of this treatment, Garc&#233;s Loor suffered 
severe injuries to the penis; he cannot bend down, and he coughs up blood when he stands up. 
He is not receiving adequate medical care. 
</p>
<p>9. The source alleges that Garc&#233;s Loor is a professional of good repute and that he is 
respected and trusted by his students, his colleagues, parents, neighbours and the community in 
general. He has no police record or previous convictions. The source considers that his arrest 
violated the principles of rationality, proportionality and predictability. It constituted an 
unreasonable act on the part of the authorities, in contravention of the State&#8217;s general duty to 
protect, and violated his right to personal liberty and security. 
</p>
<p>10. In conclusion, the source considers that Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor&#8217;s right to personal liberty, 
judicial guarantees and the due process of law have been violated. He has been subjected to 
arbitrary detention, which has seriously jeopardized his health, his family life and his reputation. 
</p><p>11. The allegations contained in the foregoing paragraphs were submitted to the Government 
on 23 March 2006. On 13 November 2006, the Government responded as follows: Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s 
Loor was subject to ordinary criminal proceedings, in accordance with existing Ecuadorian 
criminal legislation and criminal procedure legislation; all constitutional guarantees were met 
and due process was strictly observed. 
</p>
<p>12. The judicial records provided contain serious and incontrovertible evidence that 
Garc&#233;s Loor committed a grave offence against a minor. It is therefore unreasonable to maintain 
that he was arbitrarily detained, since he was free to exercise his procedural guarantees and he 
was given a public, impartial and independent hearing. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 90 
 
</p>
<p>13. The accusation is based on acts that clearly constitute indecent assault, which is consistent 
with the current criminal offence of sexual abuse. The act took place at a time when the criminal 
law and the criminal offence of indecent assault were fully valid. Under the reform of the 
Criminal Code, that offence was replaced by the criminal offence of sexual abuse. The earlier 
criminal offence of indecent assault was incorporated into the new Ecuadorian legislation under 
the new concept of sexual abuse. The act constituting the criminal offence did not disappear, but 
rather became an element of the new criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>14. No substantial procedural formalities that could have affected the validity of the criminal 
proceedings or that could have influenced the decision in the case were omitted. The case began 
when the staff of a photographic laboratory to which Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor had taken his film to be 
developed noticed that a minor appeared naked in the photographs, and reported the situation to 
the sexual offences unit of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The Office requested the relevant 
judicial authorization, after which it apprehended Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor in the street. The minor&#8217;s 
mother said that Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor had lost his reason, since he had just asked her permission to 
marry her 11-year-old daughter. Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor declared on television that he was in love with 
the minor. During the judicial proceedings, the minor gave details of the sexual abuse to which 
she had been subjected, and added that she had been unable to report the acts earlier because 
Garc&#233;s Loor had threatened to kill her. The case file contains several pieces of evidence of these 
acts, including expert reports, testimonies and serious suspicions concerning Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor&#8217;s 
part as the perpetrator of the offence. 
</p>
<p>15. Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor was given a fair and just trial; he was able to exercise his legitimate right 
to a defence and was afforded all procedural guarantees. Due process of law was implemented 
throughout the proceedings, and his case is currently before the second criminal court, pending a 
decision. 
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Garc&#233;s Loor is not accused of &#8220;having taken photographs of a pornographic nature of a 
girl&#8221;, which is what the source led the Working Group to believe. He is accused of committing a 
serious offence against a minor. There is also no mention in the proceedings of the clumsy and 
paltry excuse given to the Working Group that &#8220;two mischievous girls borrowed his camera&#8221;, 
which demonstrates the defendant&#8217;s intention to avoid and distract the attention of the legally 
competent judges of the international body. 
</p><p>17. The Government concludes that the facts described in themselves constitute major harm 
with terrible consequences for the girl. According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
to which Ecuador is a party, &#8220;the best interests of the child&#8221; should take precedence over all 
procedural considerations. This is included in the Ecuadorian Children&#8217;s and Youth Code. 
Efforts must be made to combat sexual abuse of minors, child pornography and paedophilia. 
This is precisely the aim in this particular case, in which an 11-year-old child has been the victim 
of a deplorable act. The aim of judicial proceedings is to ensure the correct application of justice 
and punish the guilty parties. 
</p>
<p>18. Neither in this nor any other case does the Working Group seek to replace domestic courts 
or to decide whether a person is innocent or guilty. Its task is limited to establishing whether or 
not Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor is a victim of arbitrary detention, and whether in his case the judicial 
guarantees of due process have been upheld in accordance with international principles, norms 
and standards. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 91 
 
</p>
<p>19. According to the source, there were serious violations of the right to a fair and impartial 
trial, which the Government has denied. The source has not submitted its observations or 
comments on the Government&#8217;s reply, despite having been invited to do so. The source asserted 
that Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor was arrested without a court order, which the Government denied. The 
Government has, moreover, explained in detail the measures taken by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office to obtain the warrant required to arrest this person. The source also stated that Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s 
Loor was tortured on National Police premises, to which the Government simply replied that, 
since all constitutional and procedural guarantees have been respected, the criminal proceedings 
cannot be invalidated. The source has also said that Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor was tried for a criminal 
offence that no longer exists, to which the Government replies by stating that the criminal 
offence in question has been incorporated into the new offence of sexual abuse. The Government 
submitted the relevant legislation and confirmed its ongoing validity. 
</p>
<p>20. The Government has not, however, refuted the allegation that Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor was unable 
to appear before a judge for over a year and that he was held in pretrial detention for an 
unreasonable length of time. In this particular case, the period of over a year awaiting sentencing 
does not appear to be entirely disproportionate to the complexity of the offence, the fact that the 
victim is a minor and the course of the proceedings. During its visit to Ecuador in February 2006, 
the Working Group noted the excessive length of time that accused persons - who should be 
presumed innocent until proven guilty - spend in pretrial detention. The Group considered this to 
be a matter of serious concern. 
</p>
<p>21. As for the allegation of torture and the lack of medical care, the Working Group also 
considers that any allegation of torture should be duly investigated, particularly since, during its 
visit to Ecuador, the Working Group observed several detainees in police cells who showed 
visible signs of ill-treatment, beatings and torture. Some inmates reported to the Working Group 
that they had been beaten in police cells and forced to confess, through physical ill-treatment, to 
crimes and offences they had not committed (A/HRC/4/40/Add.2). In this particular case, since 
the criminal charges are not based on this person&#8217;s confession, and the allegation of torture 
would not, in principle, affect the trial. Nevertheless, and although it is not within its mandate, 
the Working Group considers that the Government, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the 
judicial authorities should carefully examine all allegations of torture, and notifies the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of the 
Human Rights Council of the allegations that have been received. 
</p>
<p>22. In conclusion, the Working Group considers that the allegations made by the source have, 
in general, been refuted by the Government, which has submitted legal documents that detail and 
support its arguments and denials. The source has not made any comments or observations on 
the Government&#8217;s reply, despite having been invited and given the opportunity to do so. 
</p>
<p>23. In conclusion, the Working Group considers that the material available to it did not contain 
any such serious lack of observance of the standards relating to a fair trial as to confer on the 
deprivation of liberty of Jos&#233; Garc&#233;s Loor an arbitrary character. 
</p>
<p>24. Based on the above, the Working Group considers that the detention of this person is not 
arbitrary.

<p><b>OPINION No. 13/2007 (VIET NAM) 
Communication: Addressed to the Government on 4 August 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning: Dr. Pham Hong Son. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1. (Same text as paragraph 1 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>2. (Same text as paragraph 3 of Opinion No. 32/2006.) 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group welcomes the cooperation of the Government, which provided the 
Working Group with information concerning the allegations of the source. The replies of the 
Government were brought to the attention of the source, which made observations in its replies. 
</p>
<p>4. The case summarized below was reported to the Working Group as follows: Dr. Pham 
Hong Son, a citizen of Viet Nam, born on 11 March 1968, resident in Hanoi, an advocate for 
democracy and human rights in Viet Nam, was arrested for transmitting statements over the 
Internet advocating political openness and democracy. 
</p>
<p>5. Dr. Son graduated from Hanoi Medical University in 1992 and worked as a business 
manager for Tradewind Asia, a foreign pharmaceutical company, until his arrest. He published 
numerous articles online, such as, &#8220;The promotion of democracy: a key focus in a new world 
order&#8221;, and &#8220;Sovereignty and human rights: the search for reconciliation&#8221;. He also translated and 
posted articles online, such as &#8220;What is democracy?&#8221;, an essay on democratic values. In 
July 2003, Human Rights Watch awarded Dr. Son the Hellman/Hammett grant in recognition of 
his courage to write in the face of political persecution. 
</p>
<p>6. Dr. Son was arrested on 27 March 2002 at his home in Hanoi by members of the Security 
and Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security. He did not receive an arrest order 
upon his detention. Ms. Vu Thuy Ha, his wife, requested a copy of a warrant days after Dr. Son&#8217;s 
arrest but did not receive one. The Government of Viet Nam charged Dr. Son and convicted him 
of espionage under article 80 of the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>7. Dr. Pham Hong Son was sent to a remote prison camp in Yen Giang Village, Thanh Hoa 
Province. He was detained for over four years. Dr. Son was in extremely poor health and was 
suffering a hernia. In 2005 a tumour developed in his nose. It was reported that Dr. Son did not 
receive treatment for his ailments and that he resorted to using a plastic band to support his 
hernia. 
</p>
<p>8. On 10 April 2003, an official indictment against Dr. Son was issued by the Chief 
Prosecutor of the Supreme People&#8217;s Prosecution, accusing him of gathering and supplying 
information and documents on behalf of foreign nations to use in opposition of the Socialist 
Republic of Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>9. After 27 March 2002, Dr. Son was held at several detention centres in Hanoi, Phu Ly 
Province and Thanh Hao Province. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 93 
 
</p>
<p>10. Dr. Son was accused of espionage crimes stemming from his e-mail contact with exiled 
reactionary elements, according to article 80 of the Criminal Code. He was also accused of 
receiving money from Thong Luan, a French group that supports democracy in Viet Nam, and 
disseminating materials and information &#8220;denigrating and distorting the policy of the Party and 
the State &#8230; and falsely accusing the State of violating human rights&#8221; to exiled persons. 
</p>
<p>11. According to the source, Dr. Son&#8217;s arrest on espionage charges was pretextual for his 
posting of the article &#8220;What is democracy?&#8221;. Dr. Son also wrote an article, &#8220;Hopeful signs for 
democracy in Viet Nam&#8221;, which he also transmitted to senior government officials. On 
24 March 2002, Dr. Son&#8217;s house was searched by members of the special police unit P4-A25, 
and his computer and personal papers were seized. Following the incident, Dr. Son published an 
open letter on the Internet protesting the search of his home and confiscation of his property. 
</p>
<p>12. From the date of his arrest on 27 March 2002 to his first trial on 18 June 2003, Dr. Son was 
not allowed any contact with his family or legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>13. Dr. Son was not allowed to contact any lawyers, and he had to rely on his wife to select a 
lawyer on his behalf. Dr. Son&#8217;s wife petitioned the investigative and prison authorities to allow 
Dr. Son to meet with his lawyers in jail before the trial but her request was refused. Nearly 
15 months after his arrest and only 1 week before the trial Dr. Son met with his lawyers, 
Tran Lam and Dam Van Hieu. 
</p>
<p>14. Dr. Son was tried in a closed trial on 18 June 2003 at the People&#8217;s Court in Hanoi. Neither 
foreign diplomats nor journalists were allowed to enter the court. At the trial, Dr. Son refused the 
defence prepared by the lawyers Tran Lam and Dam Van Hieu and he defended himself without 
the assistance of legal counsel. His wife was not allowed to remain in the courtroom while 
Dr. Son was present. The trial lasted half a day, and Dr. Son was convicted of espionage under 
article 80 of the Criminal Code. The Court sentenced him to 13 years of imprisonment, to be 
followed by 3 years of administrative probation upon Dr. Son&#8217;s release from prison. 
</p>
<p>15. Dr. Son appealed the trial court decision. He was permitted to meet with his lawyers to 
prepare for his appeal but he was still not allowed any contact with his wife and family. Closed 
proceedings were held on 26 August 2003 at the People&#8217;s Supreme Court in Hanoi. In protest 
over the lack of transparency of the proceedings and violations of his due process, Dr. Son and 
his lawyer Dam Van Hieu walked out and boycotted the proceedings, refusing to participate in 
the appeal. At the conclusion of the appeal, the Court reduced Dr. Son&#8217;s sentence to five years of 
imprisonment, to be followed by three years of administrative probation upon his release from 
prison. 
</p>
<p>16. In its first response to the above-mentioned allegations, the Government reported that 
Pham Hong Son was released in August 2006 as one of 5,352 inmates under a special amnesty 
order by the President of Viet Nam on the occasion of the sixty-first anniversary of the National 
Day of the Socialist Republic. Since his release, Dr. Son has enjoyed normal citizenship rights, 
although he has to carry out the Court&#8217;s decision of three years&#8217; administrative probation in his 
locality. Dr. Son was charged with having committed acts in violation of the law. On 
18 June 2003, the First Instance Court sentenced him to 13 years&#8217; imprisonment for the crime of  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 94 
 
</p>
<p>espionage, in accordance with article 80, point 1, of the Penal Code. Due to his proper behaviour 
of cooperation and repentance, on 26 August 2003, the Ha Noi Appeal Court reduced his 
sentence to five years&#8217; imprisonment on charge of espionage (article 80, point 2, of the Penal 
Code). 
</p>
<p>17. The Government considered that the allegations summarized in the above paragraphs were 
totally untrue. It pointed out that in Viet Nam there are no prisoners of conscience or suppressed 
dissidents. Freedom of opinion and speech, freedom of the press, the right to be informed, the 
right to assemble, to form associations and hold demonstrations in accordance with the law are 
expressly recognized by article 69 of the 1992 Constitution. 
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group forwarded the Government&#8217;s reply to the source, which confirmed 
that Dr. Son was released from prison on 30 August 2006. However, it reported that he was 
facing numerous restrictions on his fundamental freedoms as part of his release and was not 
enjoying normal citizenship rights to the extent that he is now facing, as part of probation, a 
de facto arbitrary detention. The restrictions upon Dr. Son violate his fundamental freedoms of 
movement, association and opinion and expression. Although he is allowed very minimal 
movement outside of his house, this does not materially change the nature of his house arrest. 
</p>
<p>19. According to the source, the police have restricted the distance that Dr. Son may travel to a 
limited area within the Hai Ba Trung district, where he lives. On 2 September 2006, a request for 
permission to travel to Hoan Kiem Lake, which is approximately 2 kilometres from his house, 
was rejected by the authorities. Another request to go to Nam Dinh City, approximately 
100 kilometres south of Hanoi, for the purpose of visiting his mother and other relatives and to 
pay respect at his father&#8217;s tomb was also rejected, despite the recent death of his father. His 
request to go to a hospital to have surgery for his inguinal hernia and for medical examinations 
of his respiratory tract was also refused and the authorities replied that he could be visited by a 
medical doctor at home. 
</p>
<p>20. The source further reports that Dr. Son is under constant police surveillance. Both 
uniformed police and plainclothes agents have been maintaining a constant presence at his house 
and around the vicinity of his home. There are always two agents that follow him whenever he 
leaves his house, affecting his freedom of movement. The authorities have harassed 
pro-democracy activists who have attempted to visit him and he has been prevented from 
meeting with dissidents, being physically harassed by police agents when he attempted to meet 
Hoang Mink Chin. Two mobile phones used by his relatives were blocked by order of the police 
and he was prevented from trying to have access to the Internet. 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group considered that the comments from the source to the response by the 
Government contained new allegations and decided, at its forty-seventh session, to transmit them 
to the Government. In its second reply, the Government pointed out that, although Dr. Son had 
been granted a special amnesty concerning his sentence to five years&#8217; imprisonment, he had also 
been condemned to three years&#8217; administrative probation in his locality as an additional 
punishment in accordance with provisions of articles 80 and 38 of the Penal Code. The sentence 
to this additional punishment was totally right in accordance with the provisions of Vietnamese 
laws and fully suitable with the provisions of international law. The level of the additional 
punishment was decided by the People&#8217;s Court based on the violations to the law committed by 
Dr. Son. According to the law, during the time of observing this additional punishment, the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
  page 95 
 
</p>
<p>convict should be allowed to freely go out of his or her residential area but is not allowed to 
practise or work in a number of professions. He cannot enjoy all citizenship rights of freedom as 
other normal Vietnamese citizens do. If he wants to go out of his residential area he has to get 
the approval of the professional agencies in his living area. This is very ordinary in many other 
States of the world and is not a form of arbitrary detention. On the other hand, Dr. Son&#8217;s health 
condition is totally normal. If he eventually suffers from ailments, he has the full right to get his 
health examined and treated like other ordinary citizens. 
</p>
<p>22. In its comments on the Government&#8217;s second reply, the source considers that, to the extent 
that Dr. Son now faces conditions as part of probation, he remains a victim of arbitrary detention. 
The conditions imposed on him amount to a form of de facto house arrest, a form of arbitrary 
detention as recognized by the Working Group. House arrest typically involves severe 
restrictions on freedom of movement, freedom of association and freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group has to decide first if the current situation of Dr. Son is a deprivation of 
liberty equivalent to detention. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group notes that, although Dr. Son is suffering from severe restrictions 
imposed on his freedom of movement, freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of 
association, he is not placed in closed and locked premises which he cannot leave without being 
authorized to do so. The Working Group has always maintained, in accordance with its 
Deliberation 1/93 on House Arrest, that &#8220;house arrest may be compared to deprivation of liberty 
provided that it is carried out in closed premises which the person is not allowed to leave&#8221;. The 
Working Group concludes that the above-mentioned restrictions are not tantamount to 
deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group notes, however, that these restrictions are the consequence of the three 
years&#8217; administrative probation imposed by the Court in his sentence. For that reason, it is 
appropriate to make sure that his sentence was imposed in accordance with international 
standards. Consequently, and according to its Methods of Work (chap. C, para. 17a), the 
Working Group reserves the right to render an opinion in this case. 
</p>
<p>26. According to the source, Dr. Son did not enjoy a fair trial and his pretrial detention and 
conviction were due solely to the fact that he had used his right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>27. With regard to the violation of the right to a fair trial, the Working Group notes that, in its 
reply, the Government did not reject or even discuss the facts and allegations contained in the 
communication, particularly those concerning the reasons for the arrest, detention and conviction 
of Dr. Son and those concerning the details of the trial proceedings. The Government did not 
comment on the allegations that Dr. Son was denied the right to a prompt hearing, the right to 
access to a lawyer of his choice, the right to be promptly informed of the charges against him, 
and the right to a fair trial in accordance with international norms as set forth in articles 9 and 14 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Viet Nam is a State party. 
</p>
<p>28. With regard to enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Government has declared that Dr. Son was charged with having committed acts in violation of 
the law and sentenced to 13 years&#8217; imprisonment for the crime of espionage, in accordance with 
article 80 of the Penal Code, without giving any specific details on the facts that underlie the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.1 
page 96 
 
</p>
<p>charges against him and without invalidating the argument submitted by the source, that the 
detention and sentencing of Dr. Son followed the publication of articles critical of the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>29. On the question of the violation of national legislation mentioned by the Government, the 
Working Group recalls that, in conformity with its mandate, it must ensure that national law is 
consistent with the relevant international provisions set forth in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments to which the State concerned has 
acceded. Consequently, even if the detention is in conformity with national legislation, the 
Working Group must ensure that it is also consistent with the relevant provisions of international 
law. 
</p>
<p>30. In the case in question, and given that the Government does not appear to have charged 
Dr. Son with acts other than those indicated in the communication, i.e. to have written statements 
critical to the Government, and to have disseminated these statements via the Internet, the 
national law which gave rise to his indictment cannot be regarded as consistent with the relevant 
provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>31. For all the above-mentioned reasons, the Working Group considers that Dr. Son&#8217;s 
detention between 27 March 2002 and 30 August 2006 was motivated by the peaceful 
dissemination through the Internet of ideas and opinions advocating political openness and 
democracy, a right recognized by article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. His detention also affected his right to 
take part in the conduct of public affairs, a right enshrined in article 25 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>32. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: 
</p>
<p> The deprivation of liberty of Dr. Son between 27 March 2002 and 30 August 2006 
was arbitrary, being in contravention of articles 9, 14, 19 and 25 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Viet Nam is a State party, and falls within 
categories II and III of the categories applicable to the consideration of cases submitted to 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>33. Having found that the detention of Dr. Son is arbitrary, the Working Group requests the 
Government of Viet Nam to take the steps necessary to remedy the situation, in order to bring it 
into conformity with the norms and principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>Adopted on 11 May 2007.
