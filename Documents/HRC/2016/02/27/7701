</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> In Cameroon, there are more than 250 ethnic groups speaking many different 
languages and representing different faith groups. Cameroon is rightly proud of its record 
of stability and peaceful coexistence of such diverse communities. Its numerous 
development and social policies, general respect for minority rights and emphasis on 
national unity in diversity are important factors in that stability. In many respects, 
Cameroon is a positive example of how a highly diverse society in the region can be 
managed. While many challenges remain, the Government is open to discuss them and to 
involve minorities in shaping effective solutions. As an important measure to achieve such 
solutions, the Independent Expert urges the Government to fully record and gather regular 
disaggregated social and economic data, including in the census, which will clearly map the 
country&#8217;s diversity and help to reveal challenges facing certain population groups. 
 The problems faced by the Pygmy and Mbororo pastoralist communities, who 
identify as indigenous minorities and who are among the poorest in Cameroon, were 
frequently raised, and require dedicated attention if their situation is to be improved. The 
Government has initiated a number of programmes targeting such groups. Solutions must 
take into account and respect their unique cultures, traditions and lifestyles if they are to be 
appropriate and sustainable. Issues relating to land access and ownership are of primary 
importance to these communities and require dialogue and a review of current legislation to

<p>secure their essential land rights. 
 The Mbororo frequently face conflicts over access to and ownership of land. 
Although the Government encourages sedentary lifestyles, some Mbororo wish to continue 
their traditional nomadic way of life. The Government should accommodate such wishes 
where possible and seek solutions to land disputes and problems of delivery of education 
and health care, for example, in consultation with communities. Corruption and 
manipulation of land laws must not be allowed to continue with impunity. Pygmy 
communities face severe challenges relating to their removal from forests and the loss of 
their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. They are poorly equipped to manage away from ancestral 
forest habitats and commonly face poverty and exploitation. 
 The decline in use of some of the country&#8217;s many mother-tongue languages is cause 
for concern, and initiatives to record and maintain these languages alongside French and 
English are welcome. The North-West and the South-West are anglophone regions. While a 
national bilingual language policy is a positive practice, anglophone representatives 
expressed frustration at alleged discrimination in such areas as access to employment and 
political posts. While freedom of religion and harmonious coexistence of religious groups 
are generally evident, Pentecostal church leaders complained about the closure of some 
churches and about discriminatory registration processes. The Independent Expert called 
for clearer criteria and time frames to be established and respected, adding that legitimate 
Churches should not be punished for the illegal actions of some individuals or groups.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Independent Expert conducted an official visit to Cameroon from 2 to 11 
September 2013. She thanks the Government for its invitation and for its cooperation in the 
preparation and conduct of her visit. She thanks the senior governmental representatives, 
including the Ministers for External Relations, for Land Tenure, for Social Affairs, for 
Basic Education, for Arts and Culture, for Justice and for Territorial Administration and 
Decentralization, whom she met for their time and the information provided. She also 
thanks the numerous non-governmental organizations and others working in the field of 
minority issues who provided valuable information and assistance. 
</p>
<p>2. Cameroon has a great diversity of ethnic, religious and linguistic groups throughout 
the country. More than 250 ethnic groups and additional subgroups exist, with almost as 
many different languages spoken. According to the population and housing census 
conducted in November 2005, the total population was 17,463,836; official projections 
published in 2010, however, projected that the population would increase to 19,406,100 as 
at 1 January 2010.  
</p>
<p>3. In its report submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
in 1997,1 Cameroon stated that the population comprised ethnic groups defined on the basis 
of dialect, in five major groups: the Bantu, in the South, Littoral, South-West, Centre and 
South-East provinces (now regions), comprising the Beti, Bassa, Douala, Yambassa, Maka, 
Kaka, Bakweri, Bali and others; the semi-Bantu, in the West and North-West, including the 
Bamileke, Bamoun, Tikar and Bali; the Sudanese, in the Adamawa, North and Far North, 
including the Mundang, Toupouri, Kotoko, Kapsiki, Mandara, Haoussa, Matakam, 
Bornouam and Massa; the Peulh, inhabiting the same regions as the Sudanese; and the 
Choa Arab people in the Lake Chad basin. Several ethnic and linguistic groups spread 
across neighbouring countries and therefore bring a regional dimension to the country&#8217;s 
diversity.  
</p>
<p>4. Forest hunter-gatherer peoples (commonly referred to as Pygmies) include the Baka 
and Bakola in the East and the South and Bagyeli and Bedzam on the Tikar plain. Estimates 
suggest that Pygmies constitute about 0.4 per cent of the population. Montagnards, also 
referred to as &#8220;Highlanders&#8221; or &#8220;Kirdi&#8221; (&#8220;pagan&#8221; in Fulfulde), are made up of various ethnic 
groups; their exact numbers are unknown. They commonly practice forms of animism and 
ancestor worship, and have historically been socially, educationally and economically 
disadvantaged when compared with the more dominant Muslim Fulani population in the 
three northern provinces.2  
</p>
<p>5. Although the Constitution uses both the terms &#8220;indigenous&#8221; and &#8220;minorities&#8221;, it is 
unclear to whom they are applied. In the above-mentioned report, the Pygmy population 
was referred to as &#8220;authentic indigenous inhabitants&#8221;. A number of other groups, however, 
self-identify as indigenous or indigenous minorities, including the Mbororo<b> </b>pastoralists.<b> 
</b>According to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, the questions over 
indigenous status prompted the Ministry of External Relations to conduct a study in 2009 to 
identify and characterize indigenous peoples and their problems. The study, completed in 
2011, proposed that the groups to be considered indigenous include the Mbororo 
pastoralists and the hunter-gatherers (Pygmies).3 Cameroon officially celebrates the annual

</b></p>
<p>International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous Peoples and the Government involved 
communities in celebratory events. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert&#8217;s evaluation is based on the Declaration on the Rights of 
Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities and other 
relevant international standards, from which she has identified four broad areas of global 
concern:  
</p>
<p>(a)  The protection of a minority&#8217;s survival by combating violence against them 
and preventing genocide;  
</p>
<p>(b)  The protection and promotion of the cultural identity of minority groups, and 
their right to enjoy their collective identity and to reject forced assimilation;  
</p>
<p>(c)  The guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and to equality, including 
ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action, when 
required;  
</p>
<p>(d)  The right to the effective participation of minorities in public life and in 
decisions that affect them.  
</p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert visited Yaound&#233; and different regions where minority 
communities live, including Kribi in the South, Bamenda in the North-West and Maroua in 
the Far North. She undertook visits to local communities to hear their issues and concerns. 
The Independent Expert focused her work on national, ethnic, religious and linguistic 
groups whose generally non-dominant, disadvantaged situations require measures to allow 
them to exercise all their rights, including minority rights, to the fullest.  
</p>
<p>8. The Independent Expert acknowledges that some communities with whom she 
consulted also self-identify as indigenous peoples or indigenous minorities. She notes that 
their engagement with her mandate on minority issues and her analysis of the situations of 
such groups in no way undermines or is incompatible with their claims to indigenous status 
and to enjoy the rights contained in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and other international standards for indigenous peoples, including 
rights to ancestral lands.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Minority rights: legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Constitution states in its preamble that &#8220;the State shall ensure the protection of 
minorities and preserve the rights of indigenous populations in accordance with the law.&#8221; 
Article 7 prohibits discrimination, stating that &#8220;all are equal before the law and are entitled 
without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal 
protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any 
incitement to such discrimination.&#8221; Cameroon has no laws that explicitly forbid 
discrimination based on race, religion, language or social status; to date, the prohibition of 
racial discrimination has therefore not been fully incorporated into State legislation, 
including the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>10. Cameroon is a party to international treaties relevant to minority rights, including the 
Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Under the Constitution, international law has 
primacy over national laws. Cameroon was one of the few African countries to vote in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>favour of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007 and 
to adopt the notion of &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; in its Constitution. To date, Cameroon has not 
ratified the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) of the International 
Labour Organization (ILO). The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
recommended that Cameroon adopt a bill on the rights of indigenous people, ensuring their 
participation in the drafting process.4 
</p>
<p>11. The Ministry of Social Affairs has responsibility for combating social exclusion and 
promoting the integration of &#8220;marginalized people&#8221;. Its Department of National Solidarity 
promotes the rights of indigenous populations, which encompass Pygmy hunter-gatherers, 
Mbororo nomadic herders, mountain dwellers, island and creek populations and cross-
border populations. Although a bill on marginal populations has been drafted, rights groups 
consider that it does not address minority and indigenous issues comprehensively.5 In the 
Ministry of Justice, the Directorate for Human Rights and International Cooperation, 
established by Decree No. 2005/122 of 15 April 2005, has responsibilities that include 
monitoring human rights issues generally and the application of the international human 
rights conventions to which Cameroon is a party. 
</p>
<p>12. The Independent Expert met with the National Commission on Human Rights and 
Freedoms.6 The functions of the Commission, whose members are appointed by the 
Government, include addressing all claims concerning violations of human rights and 
freedoms, considering questions pertaining to the promotion and protection of human 
rights, bringing instruments pertaining to human rights to wider public attention, and 
maintaining contacts with the United Nations and other institutions. In performing its 
functions, it may summon the parties concerned to a hearing. Its four working groups 
include one focused on vulnerable groups and another on religious issues. The Commission 
includes civil society actors in its activities and provides reports and recommendations to 
the authorities.  
</p>
<p>13. Civil society groups working for the rights of minority and indigenous peoples 
highlight the important role of the National Commission in the protection of their rights. 
They pointed out that, while minority and indigenous groups are considered by the 
Commission, there is limited focus on their issues and few complaints are received by 
groups such as Pygmies. They suggested that the establishment of a separate unit for 
minority and indigenous peoples, employing staff from these communities, would 
significantly enhance its role. There has reportedly never been a Mbororo, Pygmy or 
Montagnard Commissioner or staff member since the establishment of the body. The 
Commission&#8217;s role could be further enhanced to include training on minority and 
indigenous rights for authorities, including the police, gendarmes and judicial authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. General and cross-cutting minority rights concerns  
</b>14. In the sections below, the Independent Expert briefly considers key thematic 
minority rights issues brought to her attention during her mission.

<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 According to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, the term &#8220;marginalized people&#8221; 
</p>
<p>refers to all groups that have difficulty integrating into society, including the physically disabled and 
others. Inclusion of minority or indigenous people into this category makes it difficult to address their 
particular and exceptional situations.  
</p>
<p>

 Originally established as the National Committee of Human Rights and Freedoms by Decree 
</p>
<p>No. 90/1459 of 8 November 1990, it was renamed under Law No. 004/016 of 22 July 2004.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/56/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Land rights 
</b></p>
<p>15. Land issues were frequently cited as being a core concern of minority and 
indigenous peoples that have extremely strong and long-standing connections to land and 
territory, which they occupy and govern according to their customary practices, culture and 
traditions. Consequently, issues relating to access to and the use, occupation or ownership 
of land and displacement from lands featured prominently in consultations with the 
Independent Expert. The right to land is fundamental to the preservation of the identity, 
lifestyles, livelihoods and well-being of many minority and indigenous communities and to 
the enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights.  
</p><p>16. Under the primary land law,7 the State is the guardian of all lands and has the right 
to intervene in land use on issues of national economic or defence policy. Lands that are not 
privately registered are classified as national lands controlled by the State.8 Communities 
may privately register land and therefore claim ownership thereof only if they develop it by 
building houses or farms. The Government retains the right to stop communities from using 
unoccupied or unexploited national land, and may either use the land itself or grant it to 
another party for use or temporary concession. Where land is granted to a private company, 
plantation or a logging concession, for example, an environmental impact study must be 
conducted and a clearly established community consultation process be respected with 
those who use the land concerned. Human rights groups claim that this requirement is 
rarely fully respected in practice.  
</p>
<p>17. Some non-governmental organizations and media reports refer to an unprecedented 
degree of land grabbing that affects thousands of people displaced to make way for large-
scale agribusiness and other projects.9 Reportedly, the current legal and administrative 
regulations relating to land strongly disadvantage some communities and are frequently 
abused; for instance, those who use the land only for the purposes of hunter-gathering or 
grazing do not officially own the lands and their rights are consequently limited under the 
law. Some Mbororo communities have historically used certain routes for livestock grazing 
and therefore require essential seasonal access to them and nearby water sources. In 2010, 
the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Husbandry began consultations with civil 
society to revise the 1974 land tenure ordinance to address some community concerns. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Disaggregated data 
</b></p>
<p>18. Cameroon does not collect data disaggregated by ethnicity, religion or language; for 
this reason, few accurate and up-to-date data are available to provide a detailed picture of 
the country&#8217;s ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity. The Independent Expert noted a 
general lack of statistical clarity even with regard to the actual number of ethnic groups and 
the number and status of national languages. Such data would reveal essential information 
on the population and socioeconomic situation of different groups within the country, and 
important trends in, for example, population numbers, religious affiliation and language 
usage. Such data could also identify problems facing particular groups by, for example, 
allowing poverty levels to be mapped and progress in poverty reduction to be monitored.

</p>
<p>19. Since independence, Cameroon has conducted only three census surveys: in 1976, 
1987 and 2005. The results of 2005 were publicly released only in April 2010,10 leading to 
claims of manipulation of data for political purposes. Under the country&#8217;s regional-based 
development policy, population statistics have an impact on the allocation of State finances 
to different regions, the distribution of social and other services and even the allocation of 
parliamentary seats.  
</p>
<p>20. There is little accurate information on the numbers and relevant socioeconomic 
situation of Pygmies, the Mbororo and the Montagnards. While it may be particularly 
challenging to gather data on some of these communities, including those living in remote 
regions, in forest habitats and those who have a nomadic lifestyle, accurate data are 
nonetheless essential for, inter alia, ensuring essential services. Some non-governmental 
organizations with close connections to such communities are making vital efforts to 
conduct social surveys and community needs assessments, and deserve support in that 
endeavour.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Birth registration and national identity cards 
</b></p>
<p>21. Low levels of birth registration and poor access to national identity cards are a 
significant problem for minority and indigenous communities. The remote areas in which 
they live, nomadic lifestyles, lack of sensitization to the need for such documents and poor 
outreach by responsible bodies all contribute to the problem. Despite efforts by the 
Government, the issue remains a major concern and renders many effectively stateless. In 
2010, a non-governmental organization, in a report on the implementation by Cameroon of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, estimated that 95 per cent of the 
Baka did not have national identity cards, and that most could not afford to provide the 
necessary documentation to obtain them, even though they were required in order to vote in 
national elections.11  
</p>
<p>22. The lack of official identity documents has an impact on the enjoyment of a wide 
range of rights, services and social benefits. For example, the lack of such documents is 
said to be a hindrance in the access of Pygmy communities to hospitals, which have 
identification requirements for consultations. The communities therefore rely heavily on 
traditional remedies and development agencies for health care. A birth certificate is also a 
basic requirement for enrolment in primary school. Non-governmental organizations 
pointed out the need for measures by the Ministry of Territorial Administration and 
Decentralization to make birth registration easier for rural and minority communities. The 
vast majority of births in such communities take place at home, while birth certificates are 
only issued in hospitals.  
</p>
<p>23. The Government informed the Independent Expert about commendable initiatives, 
in collaboration with international non-governmental organizations, aimed at improving the 
situation for groups, including Pygmies and the Mbororo, and has successfully issued 
thousands of identity documents. Plan International, working together with the Ministry of 
Social Affairs, implemented a universal birth registration campaign in order to secure birth 
certificates for all children, including those (such as the Baka) belonging to minority 
indigenous groups. The programme reportedly helped 12,000 children to receive birth

<p>certificates in 2010 and 2011. The Civil Registration Act of 6 May 2011 extended the 
deadline for birth registration from 30 to 90 days. 
</p>
<p>24. In 2013, President Biya announced the issuing of free national identity cards as part 
of an effort to address the ongoing problem. In its national report submitted for the second 
cycle of the universal periodic review,12 the Government highlighted that, in 2011, 
following a census carried out in eight regions, official documents were issued to members 
of the Pygmy and Mbororo communities: 6,600 national identity cards, and 4,253 
declaratory judgements serving as birth certificates, including 1,500 for children (a birth 
certificate remains a requirement for the issuance of an identity card). Civil society groups 
pointed out that, despite the instructions from the President that identity cards be free, local 
officials often demand bribes and other fees that effectively defeat the purpose of the 
policy. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to education and health care 
</b></p>
<p>25. According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund,13 Cameroon has a net primary 
school enrolment rate of around 84 per cent, making it one of the highest in western and 
central Africa. Civil society representatives, however, frequently cited education issues as 
among their primary concerns relating to some minority communities. While education is 
free at the primary level, certain minority communities face challenges that hamper their 
access to education and have a negative impact on education outcomes and literacy levels. 
Problems are particularly acute for communities living in remote or forest localities, and 
also arise in the provision of appropriate education for nomadic communities, issues 
relating to language for communities whose mother tongue is not used in schools (public 
education is conducted in French and English only, putting some children at a 
disadvantage) and extreme poverty.  
</p><p>26. Additional problems exist within communities, including a negative perception of 
the value of education among traditional hunter-gatherer or pastoralist peoples. The 
situation of minority and indigenous girls is a special cause for concern. Established gender 
roles, early marriage and childbirth, the priority given to boys and other cultural factors 
contribute to lower participation rates in education and higher drop-out rates for girls.14 
While these challenges affect many communities, they are particularly grave for certain 
minority and indigenous groups. The Government is striving to address such concerns, 
including by means of sensitization campaigns aimed at parents and the creation of &#8220;girl-
child friendly&#8221; primary schools. 
</p>
<p>27. The Government stated that everyone has the right to equal access to education in 
Cameroon, in accordance with article 7 of Act No. 98/04 of 14 April 1998 on education 
guidelines in Cameroon. It noted that, in cooperation with United Nations agencies and 
local and international non-governmental organizations, it had strengthened measures to 
improve the access of vulnerable groups, in particular Pygmies and the Mbororo, to 
education. Such measures include scholarships, certificate-based admission to training 
schools, the provision of school kits, teacher training, the building of schools closer to 
villages, the construction or rehabilitation of classrooms, mobile schools for nomadic

<p>populations, and the issuance of birth certificates. Representatives of non-governmental 
organizations and minority groups pointed out that greater awareness-raising about such 
initiatives was required, since many people were unaware of them and their impact was 
therefore limited. Government officials stated that certain communities, owing to cultural 
and traditional factors and lifestyles, do not value education or consider it a high priority. 
This commonly-held view was, however, disputed by rights groups working with 
communities, describing it as a stereotype that can hamper steps towards solutions or be 
invoked to justify poor progress in the education services provided.  
</p><p>28. Certain groups face significant challenges, including in particular the Pygmy people 
with regard to health and their access to health-care services. Forest-dwelling and remote or 
nomadic communities frequently have no access to health care owing to their location, the 
lack of funds to pay for treatment, and the lack of interaction with authorities and service 
providers. Poor health-care information and low levels of education also have a significant 
impact on access to health care, while vaccination programmes can be slow to reach remote 
and forest peoples. Fear of discriminatory treatment can also lead communities to avoid 
seeking medical services.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Participation of minorities in political and public life 
</b></p>
<p>29. Certain ethnic minorities are grossly underrepresented in political, administrative 
and decision-making structures. It was pointed out that no member of the Pygmy or the 
Mbororo communities has held the position of government minister, regional governor, 
senior divisional officer, town or city mayor, member of parliament, senator or leader of a 
political party. For certain Pygmy and Montagnard communities, the situation is 
particularly severe. Contributing factors include lack of education, language issues and 
poverty, although some claim that minority groups face political marginalization and 
exclusion by political and ethnic elites at all levels of political life and decision-making.  
</p>
<p>30. The Electoral Code lays down provisions governing elections and the right to stand 
for election without discrimination. Electoral laws require that electoral lists take into 
account the &#8220;sociological components of the constituency concerned&#8221;.15 Non-governmental 
organizations consider that this creates an obligation to include on party lists appropriate 
representation of the ethnic communities present in the constituency. Before the elections in 
2013, a number of party lists were challenged by minority rights groups on the grounds that 
they were not in conformity with this requirement. Nevertheless, their objections were 
eventually dismissed by the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>31. The Government pointed to some progress in improving the participation of 
minorities in the management of public affairs,16 stating that it had been working on 
awareness-raising measures relating to political participation and to help to achieve 
appropriate representation of all population groups without distinction on all electoral lists 
and the involvement of national and ethnic minorities in the electoral process.

 Part V, section 151 (3), of the 2012 Electoral Code on the election of members of parliament states

</b></p>
<p><b> F. Customary law and leadership structures 
</b></p>
<p>32. Customary law is legally recognized and enforceable, and remains in force in rural 
areas. It is valid only when it is not &#8220;repugnant to natural justice, equity, and good 
conscience&#8221;.17 Customary law is based on the traditions of the ethnic group predominant in 
the region and administered by the authorities of that group.18 Many citizens in rural areas 
are unaware of their rights under civil law and refer instead to customary laws. Some 
communities are remote from civil courts and have little practical option other than to rely 
on customary law. In practice there may be negative effects of customary law and 
leadership structures on persons belonging to a particular ethnic or religious minority who 
fall under the customary practices of another, more dominant ethnic or religious group.  
</p>
<p>33. Cameroon maintains a system of chiefs, headed by paramount chiefs who hold 
considerable powers at the local level. While the system generally allows for a degree of 
autonomy over their affairs for ethnic and religious groups, the Independent Expert was 
informed of cases of alleged favouritism or abuse of power by paramount chiefs. In one 
locality near Maroua in the Far North, some Christian community members complained 
that, despite good relations in the past, a Muslim paramount chief had begun to charge them 
rent on land that belonged to them, and expressed their concern that it was an attempt to 
remove them from their lands. Community representatives stated that it was impossible for 
members of some minority groups to be appointed paramount chiefs, so they were 
consistently under the authority of leaders from other ethnic or religious groups.  
</p>
<p>34. Community representatives expressed their concern at the power wielded by 
paramount chiefs over community affairs and the lack of effective redress for those who 
object to decisions they find unfair or in violation of their rights. It was also reported that 
regional government officials, including governors and senior divisional officers, exercise 
little authority over or have a negligible oversight role in the activities of paramount chiefs, 
and take little if any action to resolve local disputes falling within the jurisdiction of a 
paramount chief.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation of Pygmy communities 
</b>35. Pygmy communities have traditionally lived in the forests, conducting hunter-
gatherer lifestyles in harmony with their forest environment. Many have historically had 
little interaction with wider society and had a self-sufficient, subsistence livelihood. These 
communities have, however, been deeply affected by the logging industry and other natural 
resource and economic development projects in the areas that they traditionally inhabit. 
Logging activities are estimated to cut down 2,000 km2 of forest every year. The loss of 
forestland and the removal of the Pygmies to make way for logging and development 
projects have had a major impact on Pygmy communities, which are poorly equipped for 
life outside the forest.  
</p>
<p>36. Non-governmental organizations estimate that as many as 75,000 Baka Pygmies live 
in Cameroon, although their exact number is unknown. The logging industry has led to the 
resettlement of many Baka to villages and roadside camps outside the forest, where they 
face discrimination, marginalization and numerous social problems. They lack education 
and employment; alcoholism and teenage pregnancy are reportedly common in displaced 
Pygmy communities. Deprived of forest-based food sources and lacking sustainable

<p>income-generating activities, the displaced Pygmy communities suffer from poor nutrition, 
which has a direct impact on health, child development and life expectancy.19 
</p>
<p>37. The Independent Expert visited a displaced Bagyeli Pygmy community in Kribi, in 
the South. The people live in very basic accommodation and extreme poverty. One 
community leader requested the Independent Expert to &#8220;help bring us out of this misery&#8221;. 
While economic development projects are necessary for the country&#8217;s development, non-
governmental organizations working with Bagyeli communities commented that many 
Pygmy communities have been displaced by major projects, including a deep-sea port, gas 
plants, the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, and forestry and logging projects. Palm and rubber 
plantations have also displaced the Bagyeli, and their former forest habitats have become 
&#8220;no-go&#8221; areas for them. They rarely receive compensation for their land, jobs, health care or 
other benefits. 
</p>
<p>38. The national land tenure laws are particularly problematic for Pygmies, since they 
recognize those who develop the land as eligible for land concessions or compensation if 
they are required to be relocated for development projects. The Pygmies, however, are only 
considered to occupy the forest and have consequently not been granted rights of ownership 
or given compensation when they have been relocated. The Government pointed out that 
the 1994 law<b> </b>on the rules governing the forests authorizes the reassignment to the local 
Pygmy and Bantou peoples of a share of annual forest and faunal royalties that amounts to 
12 per cent.20 It is unclear whether this has been honoured in practice and how such an 
allocation has been provided or used to assist communities. 
</p>
<p>39. Pygmies commonly lack education and skills, and have no access to employment or 
any form of income-generating activities. They frequently lack agricultural skills and 
training. In some cases, they face exploitation for their labour or are subject to abuse by 
others who see them as backwards and undeveloped. Some Bantu communities reportedly 
treat Pygmies as their property, and use them in what amounts to conditions of forced 
labour. There are few avenues for Pygmies to take up their issues, since they are almost 
totally excluded from political and decision-making bodies at all levels.  
</p>
<p>40. A number of government-supported programmes are aimed at improving the living 
conditions of Pygmy groups. In July 2013, the Ministry of Social Affairs announced the 
second phase of its development plan for Pygmy peoples, implemented by the National 
Participatory Development Programme. Under the plan, some 800 million CFA francs have 
been allocated to activities for Pygmy peoples in 31 municipalities in the Centre, East and 
South regions. Components of the plan focus on key areas of concern, including 
citizenship, education, agriculture, health, inter-community dialogue and land security.  
</p>
<p>41. Cameroon adopted a plan for the development of the Pygmy peoples within the 
framework of its poverty reduction strategy paper. A plan for indigenous and vulnerable 
peoples has also been developed in the context of the oil pipeline carrying oil from Chad to 
the Cameroonian port of Kribi.21 The international non-governmental organization Plan 
International is working with the Ministry of Basic Education to pilot the use of the Baka 
language in some primary schools, and hopes to demonstrate an improvement in education 
outcomes for the Baka who undertake the programme compared to those who attend 
schools using only the official languages. School books and teaching materials appropriate

been provided with school kits.  
</p>
<p>42. The Independent Expert was informed that, despite the above-mentioned efforts, 
many governmental initiatives achieve limited results because they are often ad hoc in 
nature, not permanent or sustainable, and not based on specialist knowledge of the 
communities and their needs, or on the expertise of non-governmental organizations 
working with them. Some projects provide money to communities, although many are not 
used to receiving and managing money; it could indeed be counterproductive, and lead to 
problems, including alcohol abuse.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Situation of Mbororo pastoralists 
</b>43. Mbororo pastoralist communities are estimated to number more than 1 million 
people, which would account for some 12 per cent of the total population. The Independent 
Expert met numerous community representatives, including the Mbororo Social and 
Cultural Development Association in Yaound&#233; and Bamenda (North-West), and visited 
Mbororo communities near Bamenda. Some described a problem of general discrimination 
against the Mbororo owing to a perception that they are a foreign presence or strangers who 
do not fully belong, and are consequently treated as second-class citizens.  
</p>
<p>44. While in certain regions, such as the North-West, the Mbororo are now largely 
settled communities, in other regions, such as the Far North, the Mbororo continue their 
nomadic, pastoralist lifestyle. Land issues may therefore differ from one region to another, 
and for different pastoralist communities. Cases of tensions and conflict over land 
ownership, occupation and use were frequently raised by representatives of Mbororo 
communities. They stated that conflicts between farmers, ranchers and herders are a major 
issue for the Mbororo throughout the country, and that some conflicts have continued for 
generations.  
</p>
<p>45. The Mbororo claim that agro-industrial companies, including some foreign-owned 
companies, are taking over large areas of historic grazing lands (such as in Kadey and Lom 
and Djerem Divisions) in order to establish sugar plantations and other forms of agro-
business. This is allegedly done without the free, prior and informed consultation with or 
consent of the Mbororo communities. Concerns also exist over the impact of the 
establishment of national parks, including Ntakamanda National Park in the South-West, 
and the threat of expulsion of Mbororo families and their livestock from newly protected 
areas. The Mbororo have reportedly occupied these lands for more than a century. 
Ranching operations in the Adamawa region is a major concern for the Mbororo, who claim 
that their traditional herding is being threatened.22  
</p>
<p>46. Some land rights cases demonstrate that the current system of land categorization, 
tenure or ownership may leave some communities vulnerable to eviction from their homes 
and lands, and may be open to abuse. Poor, rural and poorly educated communities may be 
particularly vulnerable to attempts to obtain their lands by parties that do not compensate 
them adequately or make clear the nature of agreements proposed and that may ultimately 
lead to their eviction. It is imperative that any such transactions are fully transparent and, 
where necessary, subject to judicial review.  
</p><p>47. The Independent Expert visited the community of Wumse Ndzah, Bamenda III 
Subdivision (North-West), the scene of a long-term land dispute between the Mbororo 
community and the Catholic University. The University claims to have paid compensation 
</p>

</p>
<p>to community members to acquire and build on the site. Community members countered 
that they had not been fully aware of what the payments were for and would not voluntarily 
have agreed to quit their homes and land that they have occupied since 1904. Community 
representatives claimed that their land had been falsely classified as Category 2 land, 
namely, unoccupied and available for concession. The community added that, had this been 
the case, however, no payment would have been made to the community by the University.  
</p>
<p>48. The Independent Expert visited the neighbouring Bambili Tubah Sub Division, 
where houses belonging to the ethnic Bambili community had been demolished, reportedly 
by bulldozers sent by the administration of Mezam Division. Community members stated 
that they had not been consulted or given prior warning, and that lives may have been 
endangered. They did not know why their homes had been destroyed. Those affected 
remain homeless or live with neighbours, and were clearly distressed. The authorities 
reportedly claim that prior warning had been given and that the land had been designated as 
a resettlement site for the Mbororo due to be expelled from their homes on the 
neighbouring Mamada Estates (see paragraph 47).  
</p><p>49. High-profile land disputes involving Mbororo communities have drawn much media 
attention, including a long-standing dispute with Baba Ahmadu Danpullo, a prominent and 
wealthy individual rancher, in the North-West. The Government has taken steps to settle 
this and other disputes; for example, in 2003, it created a special interministerial 
commission to investigate the conflict between the landholder and the Mbororo. The 
recommendations made by the commission - including restoration of the original ranch 
boundaries and compensation for displaced victims - have not, however, been implemented, 
leading to a protracted dispute that now threatens to undermine new initiatives to resolve it.  
</p>
<p>50. Mbororo representatives made serious allegations relating to ongoing land disputes, 
including the shooting and serious injury of a Mbororo human rights defender and the 
alleged harassment, including judicial harassment, of others. Representatives of the 
Mbororo Social and Cultural Development Association (see paragraph 43 above) alleged 
that they had been subject to harassment and unfounded charges because of their legitimate 
activities to protect and promote the rights of the Mbororo and ongoing land disputes. They 
alleged that investigative and judicial procedures had been flawed and discriminatory, and 
called into question the independence of law enforcement bodies and the judiciary.  
</p><p>51. In the Far North, local authorities stated that there were few tensions between 
pastoralists and farmers or other local inhabitants over land and resources. Unlike in other 
regions, most pastoralists are nomadic and continue to follow a traditional lifestyle and 
traditional grazing routes, which are well known to farmers and accepted by them. Many 
Mbororo cross national borders and do not have identification cards. They may stay to 
graze for weeks at a time, but then move on to find food for their cattle; they thus have little 
impact on local communities and there is little cause for tensions or conflict, because land 
is plentiful in the region.  
</p>
<p>52. Civil society representatives nevertheless highlighted the fact that the Mbororo face 
numerous challenges relating to their nomadic lifestyles, and emphasized that conflicts over 
land are common in all regions. In the far North, vast areas of grazing lands normally used 
by pastoralists have reportedly been leased to foreign companies, including as hunting 
zones for the foreign tourist market. Mbororo cattle have been killed because they allegedly 
&#8220;trespassed&#8221; into these zones.  
</p>
<p>53. In consultation with civil society, a pastoral code has been drafted, which includes 
provisions for the demarcation of boundaries between pastoral land and farmland, which is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/56/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>15 
</b></p>
<p>a major source of conflict. If adopted,23 the code would open corridors for cattle grazing, 
facilitate access to water sources, and outline procedures for the establishment and 
management of community pastures. While civil society groups consider the code a very 
positive development, they point out that it still does not affirm the collective customary 
ownership rights of the Mbororo over lands they have been using for generations or address 
the issue of grazing lands being &#8220;national lands&#8221; under the current land laws.  
</p>
<p>54. The Mbororo are subject to a long-standing tax on their livestock (cattle and horses) 
that they consider to be discriminatory. The Jangali tax is reportedly levied &#8211; above and 
beyond regular purchase and sales taxes for livestock &#8211; on all livestock, even animals kept 
for subsistence or cultural reasons and not purely for economic profit. The tax, which is 
reportedly levied annually on each animal, disproportionately affects the Mbororo because 
of their strong cultural and everyday association with livestock.  
</p>
<p>55. Mbororo communities in the far North reported cases of violence and kidnapping by 
armed bandits or <i>coupeurs de route</i>, a phenomenon that has reportedly increased 
significantly in recent years. Armed persons steal cattle or kidnap family members who are 
held hostage for ransom. The perpetrators are aware that families have livestock, which 
they can sell to pay ransom demands, although this may impoverish the herders&#8217; families. 
Local authorities in Maroua stated that a special police rapid intervention force (BIR) was 
established in 2011 to prevent armed robbery and kidnapping, and that the situation had 
improved.  
</p>
<p>56. In Bamenda, Mbororo representatives acknowledged the progress made in the 2013 
council elections, in which 48 Mbororo councillors had been elected, reflecting a 
significant increase. The Mbororo attributed the increase to, inter alia, awareness-raising 
initiatives on minority indigenous, civil and political rights by non-governmental 
organizations and efforts by political parties to gain the Mbororo vote. While the number of 
councillors was the highest in more than a century, the representatives pointed out that there 
had never been a Mbororo Member of Parliament, and that much remained to be done at the 
regional and national levels to achieve appropriate representation. The Mbororo now 
account for 4.8 per cent of councillors in the region; according to ILO, however, the 
Mbororo number some 130,000, or 7 per cent of the total regional population.24 While four 
of the councillors are women, targeted efforts are needed to increase female representation. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Situation of Montagnard communities  
</b>57. The Independent Expert was informed by civil society groups about the challenges 
faced by Montagnard communities. The exact number of Montagnards (also known as 
Highlanders or Kirdi) which comprise various ethnic groups, is not known. The 
Government estimates that there are some 82,000, while non-governmental sources suggest 
that they number more than 400,000 in the Mandara Mountains area in the Far North. The 
Montagnards reportedly endure particular challenges owing to their cultural and social 
marginalization, their economic situation and high incidence of poverty, and their 
underrepresentation in political, decision-making and administrative bodies.  
</p>
<p>58. The Independent Exert was concerned at the lack of detailed information relating to 
Montagnard communities. According to civil society actors, this lack of data has resulted in

</p>
<p>their neglect when compared to other communities, and in terms of policy and programme 
measures to improve their living conditions and socioeconomic situation. While people of 
all ethnic and religious groups living in remote and mountainous regions may have to 
endure a range of problems caused by lack of development and by poverty, ethnic and 
religious minorities such as the Montagnards may be made particularly vulnerable by 
factors that include their non-dominant position with regard to other communities.  
</p>
<p>59. The Independent Expert was informed that, historically, the Montagnards have 
always had a lower economic and social status than other communities, a condition that 
continues to this day. Some were historically former slaves of the Fulani people in certain 
chiefdoms since the nineteenth century. Today, some reportedly continue to experience 
exploitative relations with neighbouring communities, including labour practices that may 
constitute bonded labour or forced servitude. Some Montagnards allegedly work for Fulani 
rulers for low wages and remain trapped in such hierarchical relations because of a lack of 
options and poverty. They are reportedly required to pay local chiefdom taxes to the Fulani. 
The combination of low wages and taxes, although legal, may effectively constitute forced 
labour.25 
</p>
<p>60. Montagnard communities reportedly have no paramount chiefs; indeed, their chiefs 
are commonly considered third-class and under the authority of Islamo-Fulbe chiefs 
(<i>Lamibes</i>). Consequently they have little decision-making power or authority over 
community affairs that affect them and their lands. The Montagnards are Christians or 
followers of traditional African religions; some reports allege that they are subject to 
religious-based discrimination by dominant Muslim communities. They are reportedly not 
represented in regional or national decision-making and political and economic structures 
of State, and consequently have little say in decisions affecting them. Some groups have 
allegedly been displaced from their lands by government projects, without compensation. 
61. A range of other problems that this minority group faces require investigation and 
attention. The often remote location of their land results in an absence of governmental 
administrative services, for example, for the registration of births. Montagnard communities 
also suffer from a lack of education and health-care facilities, since most schools and 
hospitals are located in urban centres. Infant mortality rates are reportedly higher than the 
national average. A lack of investment in infrastructure in the mountain region has resulted 
in the scarcity of roads and an electricity supply, water sources and employment 
opportunities. Since the mountain region is also unsuitable for agriculture, most people 
have no regular source of income; consequently, the levels of poverty and extreme poverty 
are reportedly high.  
</p>
<p>62. The Government highlighted the fact that a number of initiatives seek to address the 
challenges faced by mountain communities. The Mandara Mountains Development Project, 
for example, is an integrated project designed to improve the living conditions of mountain 
peoples thanks to the provision of basic social welfare services to targeted social groups in 
an effort to eliminate all forms of discrimination against them.26  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Religious minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>63. In general, religious groups coexist harmoniously in Cameroon. The Constitution 
and other laws and policies protect religious freedom and, in practice, the Government

<p>generally enforces these protections. Muslims and Christians are found in every region, and 
large cities have significant populations of both groups. Anglophone regions of the western 
part of the country are largely Protestant, while the francophone regions of the southern and 
western areas are mostly Catholic. In the northern regions, the dominant Fulani (or Peuhl) 
ethnic group is mainly Muslim, but the overall population is fairly evenly divided among 
Muslims, Christians and followers of indigenous religious beliefs. Indigenous religious 
beliefs are commonly practiced in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>64. The Independent Expert met leaders of Pentecostal churches, who raised concerns, 
including with regard to registration processes that they believe discriminate against them. 
Although the history of the Pentecostal Church in Cameroon reportedly dates back to 1958, 
leaders stated that they have not been granted the same recognition as other faiths. Despite 
an increase in followers, pastors noted official and wider social discrimination against their 
churches and congregations and negative perceptions of them as &#8220;sects&#8221; posing a danger to 
those who join. One leader referred to &#8220;open expressions of hatred&#8221; in the media, portrayals 
of them dividing families, and hostility that &#8220;makes it difficult for individuals to live openly 
according to their faith&#8221;. They described persistent harassment and persecution, including 
the arrest of pastors on charges that they consider unjust or fabricated.  
</p><p>65. Pentecostal Church leaders pointed out that many churches had not received 
authorization to function even though they had fulfilled all the requirements, and were 
therefore forced to function without legal status. They stated that, despite prior 
authorization received from the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization 
and background checks having been conducted, their files were frequently &#8220;lost&#8221; or blocked 
at some stage prior to completion, sometimes for several years. The authorities &#8220;refused to 
collaborate at every level&#8221;. Leaders called for open and transparent procedures for 
authorization, with clear criteria and time frames that should be adhered to, and refusals for 
authorization clearly explained.  
</p>
<p>66. Pentecostal leaders raised concerns about the closure of more than 30 churches in 
Yaound&#233; and Bamenda in August and September 2013 by written instruction of senior 
divisional officers &#8220;for activities contrary to the law and good morals&#8221;, and reportedly 
based on an order of the President. Reports suggest that further closures may be planned. 
Many churches were identified as &#8220;clandestine&#8221;, functioning without full legal status. 
Media reports highlighted allegations of illegal and immoral activities in some churches as 
justification for the closures.  
</p><p>67. Leaders strongly refuted accusations of illegal activity by most churches, adding that 
any allegations made should be investigated and individuals be prosecuted if found guilty 
of illegal acts. They felt, however, that many churches were being collectively punished for 
the actions of a few, given that the majority of churches are law-abiding. They added that 
they had not been consulted before the closures. Pastors stated that there is a climate of 
hostility towards Pentecostal churches that is being fuelled by inflammatory media 
coverage and the statements of politicians. They called for international and national laws 
on freedom of religion and belief, non-discrimination and minority rights to be 
implemented fully for all religious minorities.

<p><b> IX. Linguistic minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>68. Article 1 of the Constitution establishes that English and French are the official 
languages of Cameroon, and that both languages have the same status. The State is to 
guarantee the promotion of bilingualism throughout the country, endeavour to protect and 
promote national languages. French and English were introduced during the colonial 
period. After independence and reunification in 1961, Cameroon opted for a policy of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>official language bilingualism. Experts suggest that more than 275 indigenous African 
languages are spoken in the country, making Cameroon one of the most linguistically 
diverse countries in the world. Many mother-tongue languages remain in common usage in 
different regions. Some languages are used by relatively few and have no written form to 
assist in their preservation, making them particularly vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>69. The UNESCO Atlas of the World&#8217;s Languages in Danger 
(www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php) identifies 36 languages in Cameroon 
categorized as endangered to varying degrees, with three identified as extinct. Factors 
contributing to the serious decline of some languages include the prevalence of French and 
English as national languages and the lingua franca in most official interactions, including 
government, administration and services. The sheer extent of linguistic diversity in the 
country may also be a factor, since the high degree of interaction and intermarriage between 
those of different language groups results in the need for a common language, which is then 
transmitted to the children as their main language of communication. Young people 
increasingly prioritize French and English as most useful for their economic, social and 
physical mobility.  
</p>
<p>70. A significant proportion of the population conduct their daily interactions in mother-
tongue languages and are not fluent in the official languages. This fact can be a major 
barrier to the development of some minority communities, and poses challenges in their 
interaction with authorities. Cameroon does not have an official policy for the protection 
and promotion of native languages. A number of initiatives have however been taken to 
protect and promote national languages in accordance with the Constitution. These 
initiatives include projects that involve the recording of languages and a pilot bilingual 
education programme conducted in cooperation with non-governmental organizations, 
including Plan International.  
</p>
<p>71. Cameroon&#8217;s bilingual policy and its emphasis on French and English to the 
detriment of other languages have also been motivated by the desire to promote national 
unity; however, French remains the most commonly used and understood European 
language, spoken by more than 80 per cent of the population. Despite the bilingual policy, 
there is a distinct geographical demarcation between English- and French-speaking regions. 
The Independent Expert noted several positive elements of the bilingualism policy in 
practice, including in some television, radio and print media, in which English and French 
were clearly used alongside each other. Critics however suggest that the majority of media 
output is solely in French in most of the country.  
</p>
<p>72. In Bamenda, in the North-West (one of two regions where the majority are 
anglophones), the Independent Expert encountered a commonly voiced perception of 
general discrimination against anglophones, and specifically in such areas as access to 
public posts and political office. Some complained that, even within anglophone regions, 
francophones are commonly appointed to senior positions and public offices, decisions that 
some perceive as deliberate and politically motivated. Francophones have access to 
employment in the civil service without being bilingual, whereas this is rarely the case for 
anglophones.  
</p>
<p>73. The predominance of French as the language of Government and administration in 
most regions was highlighted. Numerous official documents, including certain laws and 
decrees, are unavailable in English. The Government has promoted bilingualism by creating 
bilingual secondary schools and through initiatives that include pilot linguistic centres. 
Francophones have, however, little incentive to learn English, while anglophones stated 
that they felt forced to learn French to have access to the status and opportunities that its 
knowledge affords. One commentator stated, &#8220;even in this anglophone region, we are 
served in French&#8221;. Others described their perception of relative general neglect of the 
anglophone region with regard to economic development.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/56/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>19 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Independent Expert was informed about the situation of certain anglophone 
individuals and organizations advocating for greater political autonomy for their regions or 
for secession from Cameroon, including on the grounds of the distinct cultural and 
linguistic characteristics of the region&#8217;s inhabitants and other historical factors. Some 
organizations, including the Southern Cameroons National Council, have been banned on 
the grounds of their activities, and numerous individuals have faced arrest, detention and 
restrictions on their freedom of association and assembly and their freedom of expression. 
Serious allegations of mistreatment and abuse in detention were made, while it was also 
noted that no individual had been found guilty by the courts of any crime.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>75. <b>It has been frequently said that Cameroon is &#8220;Africa in miniature&#8221;. It is indeed 
evident that the diversity in the country is valued, and that persons belonging to many 
different ethnic, religious and linguistic groups feel that they are equal stakeholders in 
society. Cameroon is rightly proud of its record of stability and peaceful coexistence of 
its diverse communities. While an emphasis is placed on creating unity in diversity, 
most people are free to practice their religion, use their language and maintain and 
express unique aspects of their identity, culture, traditions and lifestyles without 
hindrance. In many respects, Cameroon is a positive example of managing a highly 
diverse society in the region. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>As in all countries in the region, however, challenges involving specific 
minorities with unique circumstances remain to be resolved. Those belonging to the 
Mbororo, Pygmy and Montagnard communities face challenges specific to their 
lifestyles, livelihoods and relationship to the lands that they own, occupy or 
historically use. The Independent Expert welcomes the Government&#8217;s openness to 
discuss these remaining and ongoing concerns, and to work with minorities and 
national and international partners to overcome them. Importantly, adequate 
financial, human and development resources must be allocated and targeted at 
protecting and promoting the rights of minorities.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Communities, such as the Mbororo, the Pygmies and the Montagnards, with 
their unique lifestyles, cultures, traditions and languages, constitute a rich and 
irreplaceable part of the country&#8217;s national and cultural heritage. Parts of that 
valuable heritage are, however, under clear and immediate threat from development 
projects and the activities of private companies and other actors. While economic and 
development goals are legitimate and necessary for the benefit of all, they should not 
be pursued at the cost of the loss of distinct communities and cultures. In the 
planning, design and implementation of national projects, due regard must be given to 
minimizing their impact on vulnerable communities, whose interests must be 
accorded a high priority.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Independent Expert urges the Government to take measures to fully 
record and gather regular social and economic data, including in census surveys, that 
will clearly map the country&#8217;s diversity and help to reveal the specific challenges 
facing particular population groups. In addition to gender disaggregation, data should 
be disaggregated on the basis of ethnicity, religion and language, and individuals 
should be able to self-identify as belonging to their chosen ethnic and linguistic group, 
and faith.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Independent Expert welcomes the efforts made by the Ministry of Arts and 
Culture to ensure the preservation of the country&#8217;s diverse cultural heritage. 
Adequate resources should be provided for the cultural and protection activities of the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Ministry, including through the establishment of the new national museum, which will 
have great potential to play a key role in education, awareness-raising and cultural 
preservation. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The current legal and administrative regulations governing land use, 
occupation and ownership do not offer certain minority and indigenous communities 
adequate protection of their land rights, and should be reviewed and amended to 
provide stronger legal protection against land grabbing, illegal eviction, forced 
displacement and ongoing land disputes. Specific legal and policy measures are 
required to protect the land rights of those who practice nomadic, transhumance and 
hunter-gatherer lifestyles, including their right to have access to traditional forest 
habitats and to use land seasonally for grazing.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Government is urged to ratify ILO Convention No. 169. Importantly, the 
Convention requires that indigenous and tribal peoples be consulted on issues that 
affect them and be able to engage in policy and development processes that affect 
them. It also requires their free, prior and informed consent for projects implemented 
on their lands and territories. A specific national law on the rights of minority and 
indigenous peoples should be drafted in consultation with the communities concerned.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Local disputes, including over land and inter-community affairs, are 
commonplace and must be effectively settled and prevented to avoid tensions 
emerging and growing between communities. It is essential that Government leaders 
at the local and national levels consult and involve grass-roots community 
representatives in decision-making processes in order to maintain the peaceful 
coexistence of the various ethnic and religious groups. National human rights 
commitments must be better implemented and monitored at the local level. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Mechanisms should be established, in consultation with communities, to ensure 
that local leadership structures and chiefdoms function in the interests of all 
communities without discrimination. Effective oversight mechanisms and complaint 
procedures should be put in place to ensure that paramount chiefs and others with 
lower-level authority are subject to appropriate review and that community members 
from all groups have channels through which to challenge decisions or register 
complaints. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Independent Expert acknowledges the significant efforts made by the 
Government to ensure free primary education for all children. She however urges it to 
intensify specific, targeted efforts to improve education access and outcomes for 
children from minority communities. Education initiatives should be developed in 
close consultation with minority communities and non-governmental organizations, 
and should be sensitive to the specific situations of such groups and their cultures, 
traditions, lifestyles and languages.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The State should strengthen legislative and policy measures to ensure the 
political participation of groups that are currently underrepresented in political and 
decision-making bodies at the local, regional and national levels, including the Pygmy, 
Mbororo and other communities. Existing measures, including those relating to 
electoral processes, should be reviewed and, where necessary, revised or clarified and 
their implementation evaluated to ensure that they are fit for their intended purpose. 
The Independent Expert urges the State to consider the recommendations made at the 
second Forum on Minority Issues in this regard.</b>27<b>

</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The customary leadership structures and practices of minority and indigenous 
communities, including in the appointment of chiefs and the resolution of community-
based disputes, should be fully respected and allowed to function according to 
traditional practices with no undue interference by other communities, individuals or 
the State. Where a complaint is made that there has been undue interference or 
disputes exist, an independent review should be conducted with the full participation 
of the parties and community members concerned, both men and women. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Mbororo pastoralists are facing pressure to settle as well as loss of access to 
traditional lands. In addition to measures to protect their rights to land and water and 
to urgently resolve ongoing land disputes, initiatives should be continued and 
intensified to ensure their access to basic services, education and health care 
appropriate to their needs, culture and traditions and, where necessary, their nomadic 
lifestyle. The draft pastoral code provides essential guarantees for pastoralist 
communities, and should be adopted into law.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Pygmies are the guardians of the forest, in which they have always lived in 
harmony. The Government should respect the rights of Pygmy communities to 
continue to live in their traditional forest habitats and to have full access to the forests 
and their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyles wherever possible, and find solutions, 
in consultation with communities, to enable them to do so.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Where displacement of Pygmy communities has taken place or is unavoidable 
following full review of available options, communities should be consulted fully 
regarding relocation, with priority given to options allowing them to continue their 
traditional forest-based lifestyle. Communities should be fully supported in the short, 
medium and long term to ensure their access to services, food security, their safety 
and secure, non-exploitative interaction with neighbouring communities, and their 
access to income-generating activities. Compensation for their displacement must be 
appropriate to their situation, culture and traditions.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Essential research is required on Montagnard communities and the regions in 
which they live, to build a comprehensive picture of their numbers, geographical 
location, socioeconomic conditions relative to other communities, the minority and 
other human rights issues that they face, and their needs as individuals, families and 
communities. On the basis of such research, targeted interventions should be made, in 
close consultation with communities, in order to urgently improve their situations and 
enjoyment of their rights.  
</b>91. <b>The protection of the right to freedom of religion and belief and of the rights of 
religious minorities to freely practice their faith must extend to all faith and belief 
groups, and not be unduly restricted. Registration processes, where required, to grant 
authorization to function should be non-discriminatory, and clear criteria and time 
frames should be established and respected in practice. No undue delays or restrictive 
criteria should be imposed and, where authorization is not granted, clear reasons 
should be stated and appeals permitted. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Individuals or groups suspected of having committed crimes in the context of 
their faith or belief-based activities should be prosecuted pursuant to national law and 
in compliance with international standards of fair trial. Faith communities conducting 
legitimate faith-based activities, including assembling for worship and proselytizing, 
should not face undue restrictions on those activities, be closed or otherwise punished 
without due recourse to the law and judicial process.  
</b>93. <b>In the specific cases of the Pentecostal churches closed in 2013, an investigation 
of such closures should be urgently conducted. Where no justifiable legal grounds for 
their closure are found, the churches should be allowed to reopen and resume their </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>functions. Where any church was found to have been closed for functioning without 
proper legal authority, investigations should establish whether such authority was 
sought and whether any undue delay or obstruction was imposed to prevent the 
granting of such authority.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The decline and possible disappearance of some of the many mother-tongue 
languages spoken in Cameroon are cause for national and international concern. The 
Independent Expert welcomes initiatives to record and maintain these languages 
alongside French and English, and urges the Government to intensify such measures 
in collaboration with international actors and experts in this field, including the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>A pilot project for bilingual education for certain linguistic groups, including 
Baka Pygmy communities, has now begun in several schools using a model that has 
proved effective for improving education outcomes for minority children and for 
helping to maintain minority languages. Should the results be positive, the 
Government is urged to expand models of bilingual and multilingual education 
throughout the country, with adequate resources being provided for teacher training, 
the supply of text books and other appropriate teaching materials. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>There are significant challenges to the achievement of the full and effective 
implementation of the State&#8217;s policy of official language bilingualism. Further steps 
are necessary, including in the fields of education, training and administration, to 
ensure that no discrimination or economic, social or cultural exclusion is experienced, 
in particular by minority English speakers in non-Anglophone majority regions, but 
also by minority francophones in English-speaking regions. The implementation of the 
policy should be closely monitored throughout the country, and stronger measures 
should be taken to ensure equality in practice, including in employment and in 
appointments to public office.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Serious allegations were brought to the attention of the Independent Expert 
regarding violations of the civil and political rights of individuals advocating for 
greater political autonomy for anglophone regions or for their secession from 
Cameroon. The Independent Expert emphasizes that, without any crime having been 
committed, actions to restrict the freedom of association and assembly or the freedom 
of expression of such individuals, as well as their arrest and detention, constitute 
violations of their civil and political rights and, as such, should be revoked 
immediately.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms has a valuable role 
to play in the protection of minority rights, which could be further enhanced by a 
dedicated unit and the inclusion in its work of training on minority and indigenous 
rights for authorities, including for public officials, the police, gendarmes and judicial 
authorities.
