<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 9/9 on the protection of the human rights of civilians in armed 
conflict, the Human Rights Council invited the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to convene an expert consultation, open to the participation of Governments, 
regional organizations, relevant United Nations bodies and civil society organizations, and 
in consultation with the International Committee of the Red Cross, on the issue of 
protecting the human rights of civilians in armed conflict. As requested by the Council, the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported on the outcome of this 
consultation, in the form of a summary of discussions, to the Council at its eleventh session. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 12/5 the Council took note with appreciation of the report of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the 
outcome of the expert consultation on the protection of the human rights of civilians in 
armed conflict (A/HRC/11/31) and invited the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to convene, within the parameters set forth in paragraph 8 
of Council resolution 9/9, a second expert consultation on the issue of protecting the human 
rights of civilians in armed conflict, with a view to enabling the completion of the 
consultations on this issue. The Council further requested the Office of the High 
Commissioner to report on the outcome of the consultation, in the form of a summary of 
discussions, to the Council at its fourteenth session. The present report is submitted in 
accordance with that request and provides a summary of the discussion by the experts. The 
draft was circulated to the experts for their comments. 
</p>
<p>3. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights consulted with the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the expert consultation and in a letter 
dated 3 March 2010, the High Commissioner brought the resolution to the attention of the 
President of the ICRC and invited him to appoint a focal point for the purpose of following-
up the consultations. 
</p>
<p>4. The expert consultation was announced on the OHCHR website. On 9 March 2010, 
notes verbales were sent to all permanent missions in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>5. The expert consultation was held in Geneva on 31 March 2010. Representatives 
from 24 Member States of the United Nations: Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, 
Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, 
Greece, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, 
the Netherlands, Turkey, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 
United States of America and Uruguay, as well as representatives the European Union and 
the European Council and representatives from civil society organizations, attended the 
expert consultation.  
</p>
<p>6. The expert consultation comprised one opening session and four substantive 
sessions. The substantive sessions were structured around the different human rights 
mechanisms: (a) Human Rights Council special procedures; (b) human rights treaty bodies; 
(c) international and regional judicial organs; and (d) other human rights mechanisms, 
including international fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry, the universal 
periodic review of the Human Rights Council, and activities undertaken by international 
civil society organizations acting in the context of armed conflicts. 
</p>
<p>7. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the expert 
consultation. It was recalled that over the years, the General Assembly, the Security 
Council, the Commission on Human Rights and more recently the Human Rights Council, 
have considered that in situations or armed conflict, parties to the conflict have legally 
binding obligations concerning the rights of persons affected by the conflict. The Council </p>


<p>has recognized the importance and urgency of the effects of armed conflicts on the human 
rights of civilians. In line with international jurisprudence and the practice of relevant treaty 
bodies, the Council acknowledged that human rights law and international humanitarian 
law are complementary and mutually reinforcing, taking into account that human rights law 
continues to apply in armed conflict situations. 
</p>
<p>8. It was recalled that in the 2009 expert consultation, the question of the applicable 
legal framework in situations of armed conflict, in particular the continued application of 
international human rights law in situations of armed conflict, was thoroughly discussed. 
Against that background, the meeting aimed to discuss the way in which existing 
mechanisms for monitoring and ensuring compliance of human rights obligations and 
accountability for violations have undertaken their particular mandates when addressing 
situations of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>9. In this respect, it was worth noting that the Office of the High Commissioner works 
to respond to human rights and humanitarian law concerns across the world. The Office 
engages with all relevant actors, including non-State actors, for the purpose of ensuring the 
observance of relevant international human rights and humanitarian law. OHCHR also 
monitors and reports on alleged violations by State and non-State actors. The High 
Commissioner also issues periodic reports referring to, inter alia, violations of international 
human rights law and international humanitarian law by parties to a conflict. 
</p>
<p>10. It was stated that the Office of the High Commissioner is not alone in this endeavor. 
The human rights system has a wealth of different mechanisms that have developed, within 
the framework of their mandates, a solid experience concerning the implementation of 
human rights in situations of armed conflict. Special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council, treaty bodies, international and regional courts, and civil society organizations 
have all, in different ways, provided the operational mechanisms to monitor, promote and 
protect the human rights of civilians in the context of armed conflict. In that context the 
expert consultation aimed to address the experience of special-procedures mandate holders 
have had in reporting to the Human Rights Council on human rights issues in conflict 
situations. Indeed, a number of special rapporteurs have, through their legal analyses, 
contributed in clarifying the extent and nature of the legal obligations of parties to armed 
conflict. They have also provided the Council with relevant information and analyses and 
have proposed measures to tackle systematic violations of international human rights and 
international humanitarian law in different contexts.  
</p>
<p>11. The expert consultation also sought to address the case-law of treaty bodies, both 
through their general comments as well as in the context of their analysis of country reports 
and individual complaints. One issue of particular importance in this respect was the extra-
territorial applicability of human rights treaties, in particular when a State party undertakes 
military operations on the territory of another State. Similarly important is the experience of 
treaty bodies in dealing with derogations from human rights treaties. Treaty bodies have 
clarified the extent, scope and limitations applicable to derogations. 
</p>
<p>12. Furthermore, the meeting also aimed to deal with the way in which judicial bodies, 
in particular the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia, and the European Court of Human Rights, within their respective 
jurisdictions have addressed questions of applicability of human rights and international 
humanitarian law. These issues are of particular importance, in light of the need to ensure 
accountability, both from the perspective of international State responsibility and in relation 
to individual criminal responsibility. Indeed, often the legal characterization of many acts 
can only be ascertained if the situation is analyzed from both perspectives. The protection 
of the human rights of civilians against those and other violations is better served when this 
complementarity between international human rights and international humanitarian law is 
duly recognized. </p>


<p>13. It was recalled that the impact of these issues on the ground is visible on a frequent 
basis. One challenge is to reflect on more effective ways to ensure that human rights and 
humanitarian law are respected by parties to conflicts. Another challenge is to focus on 
means of ensuring accountability for those violations when they occur. 
</p>
<p>14. Georges Abi-Saab introduced the meeting by recalling that during the first expert 
consultation of 2009, extensive reference was made to the combined application of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law in situations of armed 
conflict. He noted that in practice only one norm applies to each concrete situation. When 
applicable international human rights norms and international humanitarian norms yield 
similar results, there is no need for a complex legal analysis. However, he noted that the 
international law system has evolved to greater specialization and that, therefore, in certain 
exceptional situations, principles such as that of lex specialis is required to determine which 
is most detailed norm that applies to each concrete and individual case. Therefore, the 
combined application of international human rights law and international humanitarian law 
does not mean two norms are to be applied simultaneously, but rather that one should seek 
to identify the norm that provides the most specific answer for each particular situation.  
</p>
<p>15. Mr. Abi-Saab pointed out that, given that the 2009 expert consultation had clarified 
the legal and substantive questions of the continuous and mutually reinforcing application 
of international human rights law and international humanitarian law in situations of armed 
conflict, the meeting was designed to address the question of how different human rights 
mechanisms have implemented, in their practice, their respective human rights mandates in 
the context of armed conflict, taking into account the complementary application of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law. Such experience, in the 
form of judicial decisions, treaty bodies&#8217; general comments and concluding observations, 
special rapporteurs&#8217; reports to the United Nations bodies, and others, constitute a rich body 
of practice that should be incorporated in the work of the relevant United Nations organs, in 
particular the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Session 1: Special procedures&#8217; experience in protecting 
human rights in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>16. Concerning the experience of human rights special procedures in dealing with the 
protection of human rights in situations of armed conflict, experts stated that on a number 
of issues special procedures have applied both international human rights and international 
humanitarian law in a fully complementary manner. 
</p>
<p>17. In the case of internally displaced persons, for example, it was indicated that the 
normative framework applicable to internal displacement resulting from armed hostilities 
fully integrates relevant international humanitarian law norms and combines them with 
international human rights law. The fact that two bodies of law were applicable was not 
seen as a dilemma, but rather as an opportunity. In that respect, it was mentioned that the 
solution that had been adopted concerning internal displacement was to identify the 
relevant standards in international human rights law and international humanitarian law and 
to create a third norm. While in the field of internal displacement there is no specific 
convention dealing with the issue, the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which 
have been acknowledged by the General Assembly as an important framework for this 
issue, are in fact the result of such combination of applicable standards deriving from both 
bodies of law.  
</p>
<p>18. At the level of normative framework, the African Union Convention on Internally 
Displaced Persons adopts a similar approach. There are several articles in that Convention 
that contain language typically found in international humanitarian law, such as the </p>


<p>provision in article 7 of the Convention, which refers to protection and assistance to 
internally displaced persons in situations of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>19. Experts recalled some examples of situations in which reference was made to both 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law obligations. For instance, 
it was recalled that in his report on the situation in Somalia (A/HRC/13/21/Add.2), the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons 
stated that the level of violence faced by civilians, including very serious violations of 
human rights and international humanitarian law, is a major trigger for displacement. He 
further noted the many alleged instances of arbitrary displacement of persons as a result of 
violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, contrary to the Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement. He referred to indiscriminate attacks, shelling of 
residential areas, generalized use of force without the necessary precautions to minimize the 
impact on the civilian population, prohibited methods of warfare, as well as targeted human 
rights violations and abuses, such as killings, rapes or forced recruitment, all taking place in 
a climate of impunity. Moreover, he indicated that such acts may also amount to war crimes 
or crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>20. Experts also highlighted the strong and important interaction between special 
procedures mechanisms and the human rights treaty bodies. It was noted, for instance, that 
general comment 29 of the Human Rights Committee on states of emergency has become a 
reference, in particular in relation to the mandate concerning the promotion and protection 
of human rights while countering terrorism, because a number of States are currently 
dealing with terrorism related issues in the context of states of emergency. Similarly, it was 
mentioned that general comment 31 of the Human Rights Committee is also a fundamental 
interpretation of international human rights law, in particular its reference to the relation 
between international human rights law and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>21. Experts noted that in the context of the fight against terrorism there is a need to 
assess specifically when a situation escalates to a point where it can be qualified as armed 
conflict with identifiable parties. These situations require, therefore, a careful evaluation of 
the most relevant rule to be applied, in order to ensure adequate protection of the rights of 
the persons concerned, based on the principle of complementarity of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>22. It was noted in this connection that the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights while countering terrorism recalled in the report of his mission 
to the United States of America (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3) that it is a well-established principle 
that, regardless of issues of classification, international human rights law continues to apply 
in armed conflict. In that respect, he reminded the government that its conduct must 
therefore comply not only with international humanitarian law, but also with applicable 
international human rights law. In the report on his mission to Israel (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4) 
he stated that the legal framework against which Israeli measures against terrorism are to be 
addressed is the combined effect of international humanitarian law and international human 
rights law. He further noted with regard to the applicability of substantive norms of 
international humanitarian law that international humanitarian law norms pertaining to 
international armed conflict are also applicable and that the classification of an armed 
conflict as an international or non-international one can no longer be treated as having 
major substantive consequences for the international humanitarian law obligations of a 
State that is a party to an armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>23. Experts further recalled that the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of human rights while countering terrorism has, in the context of his mandate, referred to 
issues such as the targeted killings of civilians and the notion of active participation in 
hostilities; the issue of detention without access to judicial review in relation to persons 
detained on charges of terrorism in the context of an armed conflict; the question of security </p>


<p>detention in armed conflict; and the issue of the qualification as unlawful alien enemy 
combatant to justify the non-recognition of prisoner of war status. In all these situations, the 
Special Rapporteur took into consideration both international human rights and 
international humanitarian law norms.  
</p>
<p>24. Concerning the issue of arbitrary detention in armed conflict situations, it was 
recalled that while the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had decided in 1993 that it 
would not deal with situations of international armed conflict in so far as they are covered 
by international humanitarian law instruments (E/CN.4/1993/24), it has recently stated that 
its mandate is to deal with communications arising from a situation of international armed 
conflict in particular to the extent that the detained persons are denied the protection of the 
Third or the Fourth Geneva Conventions (E/CN.4/2006/7). For example, the Working 
Group applied both international human rights and international humanitarian law in 
relation to persons detained in Guant&#225;namo Bay by the United States (E/CN.4/2006/120). It 
recalled, inter alia, that international humanitarian law and international human rights law 
are not mutually exclusive, but complementary. 
</p>
<p>25. Experts indicated that the application of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law to conflict situations is not limited to questions dealing 
exclusively with civil and political rights. It was recalled that economic, social and cultural 
rights are also strongly affected by conflict. In that respect, special procedures have also 
dealt with issues related to, inter alia, housing, health, environment, access to water, and 
education. One expert indicated, for example, that a group of special rapporteurs, including 
the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, carried out a mission in Lebanon in the aftermath of the 2006 conflict 
with Israel (A/HRC/2/7). The Special Rapporteur looked at issues related to the armed 
conflict dealing with land confiscation, forced evictions and displacement, dispossession of 
property, as well as destruction of homes. In the joint report it was recalled, inter alia, that 
the demolition of homes in violation of international humanitarian law and subsequent 
displacement<b> </b>amounted to forcible eviction, called into question numerous international 
human rights requirements and, as stated by the Commission on Human Rights in its 
resolution 1993/77, constitute gross violations of human rights, in particular the right to 
adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>26. Finally, experts noted that special procedures have been quite effective and active in 
addressing human rights situations in armed conflict situations. Experts agreed that the 
most important challenge remained how their analyses and recommendations were 
followed up in the different political bodies of the United Nations, in particular the Human 
Rights Council. Experts noted that taking into account that relevant legal and factual 
information was regularly provided to the Council, it was for the Council to agree on the 
action that was required to effectively protect the rights of civilians in relation to particular 
armed conflicts. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Session 2: Treaty bodies&#8217; views concerning the protection of 
human rights in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>27. In relation to the experience of treaty bodies in protecting human rights in situations 
of armed conflict, experts pointed out that the different treaty bodies have, in the context of 
their relevant conventions, made important contributions to the clarification of States&#8217; 
treaty obligations. Experts noted that the Human Rights Committee has, through its general 
comments, greatly contributed to clarify the extent of States&#8217; legal obligations in relation to 
the application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in situations of 
armed conflict. In general comment 29, for instance, the Committee indicated that during 
armed conflict, whether international or non-international, rules of international </p>


<p>humanitarian law become applicable and help to prevent the abuse of a State&#8217;s emergency 
powers. The Committee further indicated that the Covenant requires that even during an 
armed conflict measures derogating from the Covenant are allowed only if, and to the 
extent that, the situation constitutes a threat to the life of the nation, after a careful analysis 
of its justification and why such a measure is necessary and legitimate in the circumstances. 
In relation to the mutually reinforcing nature of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law, the Committee indicated, for example, that the Covenant 
requires that no measure derogating from the provisions of the Covenant may be 
inconsistent with the State party&#8217;s other obligations under international law, particularly the 
rules of international humanitarian law. Moreover, States parties may in no circumstance 
invoke the Covenant&#8217;s provisions on derogations as justification for acting in violation of 
humanitarian law or peremptory norms of international law, for instance by taking 
hostages, by imposing collective punishments, through arbitrary deprivations of liberty or 
by deviating from fundamental principles of fair trial, including the presumption of 
innocence.  
</p>
<p>28. Experts further noted that in general comment 31 the Human Rights Committee 
further confirmed that the Covenant applies in situations of armed conflict to which the 
rules of international humanitarian law are applicable. The Committee noted that while in 
respect of certain Covenant rights more specific rules of international humanitarian law 
may be especially relevant for the purposes of the interpretation of the Covenant, both 
bodies of law are complementary, not mutually exclusive. In relation to the territorial scope 
of the Covenant, experts recalled that the Human Rights Committee indicated that States 
parties are required to respect and to ensure the Covenant rights to all persons who may be 
within their territory and to all persons subject to their jurisdiction. This means that a State 
party must respect and ensure the rights laid down in the Covenant to anyone within the 
power or effective control of that State party, even if not situated within the territory of the 
State party. Furthermore, the enjoyment of Covenant rights is not limited to citizens of 
States parties but must also be available to all individuals, who may find themselves in the 
territory or subject to the jurisdiction of the State party. This principle also applies to those 
within the power or effective control of the forces of a State party acting outside its 
territory, regardless of the circumstances in which such power or effective control was 
obtained, such as forces constituting a national contingent of a State party assigned to an 
international peacekeeping or peace-enforcement operation. 
</p>
<p>29. Experts also recalled that the Human Rights Committee has issued concluding 
observations in which it has referred to the application of the Covenant to situations of 
armed conflict. In its concluding observations on the United States of America&#8217;s periodic 
report (CCPR/C/USA/CO/3/Rev.1), for example, the Committee noted with concern the 
restrictive interpretation made by the State of its obligations under the Covenant, as a result, 
in particular, of its position that the Covenant does not apply with respect to individuals 
under its jurisdiction but outside its territory, nor in time of war, despite the contrary 
opinions and established jurisprudence of the Committee and the International Court of 
Justice. Experts further indicated that, in its concluding observations on Israel&#8217;s periodic 
report (CCPR/CO/78/ISR), the Committee noted the State party&#8217;s position that the 
Covenant does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank and in Gaza, 
especially as long as there is a situation of armed conflict in these areas. The Committee 
reiterated the view that the applicability of the regime of international humanitarian law 
during an armed conflict does not preclude the application of the Covenant. The Committee 
further noted that the applicability of the regime of international humanitarian law does not 
preclude accountability of States parties under the Covenant for the actions of their 
authorities outside their own territories, including in occupied territories.  
</p>
<p>30. It was also indicated that the Human Rights Committee had expressed its concern in 
relation to the use by Israel of targeted killings of those identified by the State party as </p>


<p>suspected terrorists in the Occupied Territories. In the view of the Committee such practice 
raised concerns in relation to the protection of the right to life under the Covenant. The 
Committee, therefore, recommended that the State party should not use targeted killings as 
a deterrent or punishment and that before resorting to the use of deadly force all measures 
to arrest a person suspected of being in the process of committing acts of terror must be 
exhausted. The Committee further recommended that complaints about disproportionate 
use of force should be investigated promptly by an independent body.  
</p>
<p>31. Experts also referred to the experience of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. Armed conflict exacerbates inequalities that that make 
women particularly vulnerable when armed conflict breaks out. Conflict is often 
accompanied by gender based violence and an increasing scale and brutality of sexual 
violence. Women and girls are increasingly targeted as a tactic of war to humiliate, 
dominate, terrorize, punish, disperse and forcibly relocate members of a given community 
or ethnic group. 
</p>
<p>32. Experts considered that the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women and Security Council resolutions 1325 and 1820 are critical tools for addressing 
gender equality in conflict and post-conflict situations. Security Council resolution 1325 
helps to broaden the scope of the Convention&#8217;s application by clarifying its relevance to all 
parties in conflict and in peace. The Convention, in turn, provides concrete strategic 
guidance for actions to be taken on the broad commitments outlined in Security Council 
resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008).  
</p>
<p>33. It was recalled that in general recommendation 19 the Committee recognized the 
importance as a human rights issue of gender-based violence against women in all contexts, 
including throughout displacement. The Committee noted that wars, armed conflicts and 
the occupation of territories often lead to increased prostitution, trafficking in women and 
sexual assault of women, which requires specific protective and punitive measures. In 
general recommendation 24 the Committee recommended that special attention be given to 
the health needs and rights of women belonging to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, 
such as refugees and internally displaced women. It also recommended that States parties 
ensure adequate protection and health services, including trauma treatment and counselling 
for women trapped in situations of armed conflict and women refugees. 
</p>
<p>34. Experts also referred to the experience of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women in reviewing States&#8217; periodic reports. When it examined the 
report of Indonesia (A/53/38/Rev.1), for example, the Committee noted that the information 
provided on the situation of women in areas of armed conflict reflected a limited 
understanding of the problem. The Government&#8217;s remarks were confined to the 
participation of women in the armed forces and did not address the vulnerability of women 
to sexual exploitation in conflict situations, as well as a range of other human rights abuses 
affecting women in such contexts.  
</p>
<p>35. The Committee has regularly expressed concern about the fact that in post-war 
transition periods the promotion of women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality is not seen 
as a priority, in particular in efforts to address the consequences of the armed conflict and in 
the peace building and reconstruction processes. The Committee also recommended the 
government of Uganda to include in peace negotiations measures of accountability, redress 
and rehabilitation for women and girls who have been victims of violence, including 
enslavement, in those conflicts (A/57/38).  
</p>
<p>36. Recently, the Committee expressed concern that in Rwanda equal access to justice 
and appropriate protection and support may not be guaranteed for all women and girl 
victims within the framework of the comprehensive process of prosecution of perpetrators 
that is ongoing at international and national levels. The Committee urged the State party to </p>


<p>continue to ensure appropriate protection, support and equal access to justice for the women 
victims of sexual violence during the genocide (see CEDAW/C/SR.884 and 885).  
</p>
<p>37. Experts recalled that the Committee examined the report of Rwanda and focused on 
post-genocide reconstruction and prosecution of perpetrators (CEDAW/C/RWA/CO/6). 
The Committee expressed concern that women&#8217;s participation and involvement in the post-
conflict reconstruction and social economic development has not been fully realized owing 
to deeply entrenched stereotypes and gender-based violence, as well as other forms of 
discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>38. Finally, some experts raised the issue of the application of international 
humanitarian law by human rights treaty bodies. It was indicated that the decision to apply 
international human rights law or international humanitarian law should be based on an 
analysis of the extent of protection that these bodies of law can offer in each distinct 
situation. Other experts noted, however, that some treaty bodies have avoided basing their 
analysis on international humanitarian law given their specific mandate to apply and 
interpret their relevant conventions. For example, the Human Rights Committee, in general 
comment 29, did not take an approach based in international humanitarian law but simply 
stated the conditions to be observed by States when applying the derogations provisions in 
the Covenant to situations of emergency in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Session 3: The role of judicial organs in implementing human 
rights obligations in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>39. Concerning the application by judicial organs of human rights law and international 
humanitarian law to cases involving armed conflict situations, it was indicated that 
international and regional courts have a wealth of experience and have contributed to the 
clarification of how these two bodies of law interact in concrete situations. 
</p>
<p>40. The International Court of Justice has been requested to deal with a growing number 
of cases involving serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law and has focused 
on such disputes not only from the perspective of the rights and duties of States, but also 
from that of the rights of individuals, addressing human rights in armed conflict situations, 
the relationship between State and individual responsibility, as well as questions of 
restitution and compensation to individual persons. Recent cases include the Wall Advisory 
Opinion <i>(Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory</i>); the Arrest Warrant case (<i>DRC vs. Belgium</i>); the Armed Activities on the 
Territory of the Congo (<i>DRC v. Uganda</i> case); the Application of the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide case (<i>Bosnia and Herzegovina v. 
Serbia and Montenegro</i>); Legality of Use of Force (<i>Yugoslavia v. NATO countries</i>); 
Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (<i>Georgia v. Russian Federation</i>); and Jurisdictional Immunities of the State 
(<i>Germany v. Italy</i>).  
</p>
<p>41. Experts recalled that the Court&#8217;s decisions in the field of human rights have reflected 
a visible trend towards complementarity between international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law. The Court, for example, insisted on the application of 
human rights in armed conflict, thus continuing the trend developed in the context of 
human rights treaty bodies. In the <i>Nuclear Weapons</i> advisory opinion, it recognized the 
continued existence of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in time of 
armed conflict, in particular the right to life. In the Wall advisory opinion, while confirming 
the continuing applicability of human rights instruments to the extent that they had not been 
derogated from, the Court stated that as regards the relationship between international 
humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some </p>


<p>issues may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be 
exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches 
of international law. In order to answer the question put to it, the Court will have to take 
into consideration both these branches of international law, namely human rights law and, 
as lex specialis, international humanitarian law. This passage was reiterated in the <i>Congo v. 
Uganda </i>case, in which the Court found that both massive human rights violations and grave 
breaches of international humanitarian law had been committed by Ugandan military forces 
on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  
</p>
<p>42. Moreover, experts indicated that in the <i>Wall</i> advisory opinion, the Court reaffirmed 
the application in time of armed conflict not only of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, but also of all human rights instruments, including the Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This 
insistence on the indivisibility of human rights was further confirmed by the Court in the 
<i>DRC v. Uganda</i> case, which included in the list of applicable law, also the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.  
</p>
<p>43. The Court has further pronounced on the extraterritorial nature of international 
human rights instruments. In the <i>Georgia v. Russia</i> case the Court observed in its decision 
on the request to issue provisional measures that there is no restriction of a general nature in 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination relating to its 
territorial application. 
</p>
<p>44. In the <i>Bosnia v. Serbia </i>case the Court underlined that the obligation of each State to 
prevent and to punish the crime of genocide under article 1 of the Genocide Convention is 
not territorially limited. In the <i>Wall</i> advisory opinion it also concluded that the major 
human rights instruments are applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of 
its jurisdiction outside its own territory, particularly in occupied territories. 
</p>
<p>45. Finally, in relation to the obligation to pay reparations for international human rights 
and international humanitarian law violations, experts noted that in the <i>Wall </i>advisory 
opinion the Court declared that in the event of the impossibility of restitution, Israel was 
under an obligation to make reparation to all natural or legal persons who have suffered any 
form of material damage as a result of the wall&#8217;s construction in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory. This was a landmark decision for the Court in acknowledging the duty of a State 
to make such reparations to individuals, as opposed to the traditional right of diplomatic 
protection where the State had a right of reparation for breach of its own interests.  
</p>
<p>46. In relation to the experience of international criminal tribunals, experts referred to 
the important contribution of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 
with regard to the application of human rights standards to situations of armed conflict. It 
was indicated, for example, that the International Criminal Tribunal has, inter alia, 
developed a strong practice concerning the application of notions of fair trial and due 
process in its own case-law, thus strengthening the Tribunal&#8217;s position as one of the leading 
bodies for trying individuals for international crimes.  
</p>
<p>47. Experts noted that international human rights law, international humanitarian law 
and international criminal have evolved rapidly over the last few years and that cross-
fertilization between the different legal regimes has strengthened the interaction and the 
complementarity between the three bodies of law. Moreover, the increased attention on 
accountability for human rights and international humanitarian law violations at the 
national and the international level has created a wealth of case-law in which elements of 
the three regimes can be identified. This has been the case not only for international 
tribunals, but also for United Nations agencies, such as OHCHR, and United Nations 
organs, including the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. </p>


<p>48. It was indicated, for example, that while the mandate of the International Criminal 
Tribunal was essentially to apply international humanitarian law, the fact that the Statute of 
the Tribunal included crimes against humanity and violations of common article 3 required 
that the Tribunal also refers in its analysis to international human rights law. The Tribunal&#8217;s 
experience in dealing with human rights is illustrated, for instance, in the way in which it 
has dealt with the prohibition of torture as a crime against humanity. The Tribunal has 
borrowed extensively from the Committee Against Torture and the Human Rights 
Committee. The Tribunal has further elaborated on the notion of the link between the 
perpetrator and the State and has adopted a more flexible requirement concerning the 
characterization as an agent of the State. It was noted that while the Convention Against 
Torture requires an act of torture to have been inflicted by or at the instigation of or with 
the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official 
capacity, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia decided that the 
definition of torture in the context of crimes against humanity is not identical to the 
definition in the Convention and that outside the framework of the Convention, customary 
international law does not impose a public official requirement in relation to criminal 
responsibility for torture. 
</p>
<p>49. In the case of rape as a crime against humanity, the Tribunal has focused its analysis 
from the perspective of the human rights of women. In this respect, it was recalled that the 
Tribunal&#8217;s statute was the first landmark document that contained a provision classifying 
rape as a crime against humanity. Experts highlighted that previously rape was traditionally 
treated as a war crime. While rape was not mentioned in Nuremberg Charter nor prosecuted 
as a war crime under customary international law, it was prosecuted in Tokyo and was 
included in Control Council Law No. 10 as a crime against humanity. Nevertheless, 
although both the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocols prohibit rape, 
they do not list it as a grave breach to the Geneva Conventions subject to universal 
jurisdiction. In that respect, the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda have greatly 
contributed through their jurisprudence to understand the legal confines of sexual crimes, in 
particular rape as a crime against humanity, rape as a war crime, and rape as violation of 
common article 3, which reflects customary law.  
</p>
<p>50. Experts also recalled that International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 
jurisprudence has established that humiliating and degrading treatment could also be 
characterized as a crime against humanity. According to the above Tribunal, certain types 
of treatment could fall under the crime of persecution, which is considered as a crime 
against humanity in the Statute of the Tribunal. Other acts described as &#8220;inhumane acts&#8221; 
also introduce gross violations of human rights to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. 
</p>
<p>51. Experts referred to the experience of regional human rights courts in applying 
international and regional human rights instruments and international humanitarian law to 
conflict situations. Some experts recalled that the Inter-American Commission of Human 
Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Human 
Rights have a wealth of case-law dealing with the application of the relevant human rights 
instruments to situations of armed conflict. The European Court of Human Rights, for 
example, has had some opportunities to deal with cases of violation of human rights during 
armed conflict. For instance, in the case of <i>Loizidou v. Turkey</i>, the Court ruled in favour of 
the applicant who was no longer able to have access to her properties situated in the 
northern part of Cyprus after the occupation of the island by Turkish troops in 1974. In the 
case of <i>Ergi v. Turkey</i>, the Court employed standards such as the principles of legitimacy, 
proportionality and necessity. The Court also referred to the principle of distinction 
between civilians and combatants; the principle of limitation in the choice of means and 
methods of war; and also the principle of precaution and of proportionality to be used in <i>jus 
in bello</i>. </p>


<p>52. Experts recalled that the principle of proportionality plays a very important role in 
the European Court&#8217;s case-law. In several cases the Court examined whether the use of 
force was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, whether a fair equilibrium was 
reached between the aim expected and the means employed, and whether this use was 
absolutely necessary. 
</p>
<p>53. It was also pointed out that the European Court&#8217;s case-law insists on procedural 
aspects of the rights to life, one of them being the right of the family to a thorough, prompt 
and effective investigation into the killing of a person. The procedural aspect comprises a 
State&#8217;s obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish violations of the right to life. In the 
Court&#8217;s case-law all serious human rights violations must be subject to a prompt, impartial, 
thorough and independent official investigation. The Court has not hesitated to apply the 
requirement to investigations in situations of armed conflicts. Indeed, the fact that a killing 
might be justified under international humanitarian law does not preclude the right to an 
investigation. This was indicated in particular in the case of <i>Kaya v. Turkey</i>, in which the 
Court stated that neither the prevalence of violent armed clashes nor the high incidence of 
fatalities can displace the obligation to ensure that an effective, independent investigation is 
conducted into death arising out of clashes involving the security forces.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Session 4: Other actors that contribute to the implementation 
of human rights in armed conflicts 
</b></p>
<p>54. Concerning the contribution of other mechanisms to the implementation of 
international human rights in armed conflict situations, experts pointed out to the important 
work done by international commissions of inquiry. Mention was made to the Commission 
of Inquiry on Darfur established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1564 (2004), as 
well as to commissions of inquiry established under the Human Rights Council mandate, 
including the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict.  
</p>
<p>55. It was pointed out that commissions of inquiry do not operate as a court of law, but 
instead use different methods and investigating procedures, including in relation to 
gathering, analysis and evaluation of information. The Darfur and the Gaza commissions of 
inquiry, for example, based their conclusions on credible information that showed that 
violations had occurred. Commissions of inquiry use standards for evaluating prima facie 
evidence that are less strict than those used by courts. The information they gather provide 
sufficient factual grounds to support findings related to allegations of human rights and 
humanitarian law violations. Moreover, evidence produced in the context of investigations 
of commissions of inquiry may further serve as a starting point for criminal investigations 
at the domestic and international levels. 
</p>
<p>56. Experts further indicated that investigations and conclusions of commissions of 
inquiry often lead to an in-depth analysis of domestic justice mechanisms in order to assess 
whether accountability for gross human rights violations and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law can be guaranteed, in line with States&#8217; international law 
obligations to investigate, prosecute and punish alleged perpetrators of such violations. For 
instance, both the Darfur factfinding mission and the Gaza commission of inquiry assessed 
whether the relevant parties had established mechanisms to ensure accountability for 
violations, taking into account fairness and due process obligations. 
</p>
<p>57. Experts also highlighted that civil society organizations have been actively involved 
in the application of international human rights and international humanitarian law in their 
evaluation of the effects and consequences of armed conflict situations. Some international 
non-governmental organizations, for example, have undertaken field missions and have 
submitted analytical reports in relation to a number of conflicts. Their analyses take into </p>


<p>account the complementary and mutually reinforcing nature of international human rights 
and international humanitarian law. In particular, reports prepared by non-governmental 
organizations have taken into account that each body of law contains specific legal 
provisions that provide better protection depending on the specific circumstances. 
Furthermore, taking into account that civil society organizations may be more reactive to 
specific situations in the field, it was indicated that information gathered in their 
investigations is often taken into account by other human rights mechanisms and bodies 
dealing with the same situation. 
</p>
<p>58. Experts also recalled that international humanitarian law is one of the bases for 
consideration of the human rights record of member States in the universal periodic review 
(UPR). Protection of civilians in armed conflict has been one of the subjects of specific 
recommendations. In particular, recommendations have been issued concerning, inter alia, 
the obligation to strictly adhere to international humanitarian law obligations; to take 
measures to ensure access to humanitarian assistance for vulnerable populations and take 
measures to protect civilians; to protect religious freedom in accordance with article 27 of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention; and to take every possible measure to ensure the protection 
of the civilian population, in particular vulnerable groups, such as children, women and 
internationally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>59. It was further indicated that recommendations formulated in the context of the UPR 
are often based on the concluding observations of human rights treaty bodies and 
recommendations issued by special procedures. The importance of the linkages between 
mechanisms is that their recommendations are inter-linked and could, therefore, be 
reinforced in the different mechanisms. For instance, experts recalled that under the UPR 
mechanism States are invited to explicitly indicate those recommendations that it is willing 
to accept. States&#8217; commitments in the UPR context may be followed-up by treaty bodies or 
special procedures in their analysis of States&#8217; reports or mission reports. Similarly, 
recommendations issued by human rights treaty bodies and special procedures are 
systematically included in the UPR compilation reports. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Final remarks 
</b></p>
<p>60. In sum, experts explored in detail how the different human rights mechanisms, as 
well as judicial organs and civil society organizations have applied international human 
rights and international humanitarian law in a complementary way to concrete armed 
conflict situations. Experts agreed that there has been an evolution over the years and that 
the practice of the different mechanisms has clearly led to a better understanding of how 
such complementarity can be implemented in a way that ensures better protection for the 
rights of civilians. It was furthermore indicated that the practice judicial organs, human 
rights mechanisms, international commissions of inquiry and civil society organizations, 
has also reaffirmed that the application of international human rights is not limited to the 
territory of the State, but that it can be applied extraterritorially in relation to persons who 
are under the jurisdiction or the effective control of the State. Experts also agreed that the 
complementary and mutually reinforcing nature of international human rights and 
international humanitarian law have ensured, in practice, that the protection gap has been 
much reduced. Experts stated that the main challenge is how to ensure the 
recommendations formulated by the different mechanisms are taken into account and lead 
to action by the relevant United Nations political organs. 
</p>
<p>61.  Finally, in relation to the gathering of evidence and other information concerning 
violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law, experts agreed 
that the existing mechanisms play an essential role given their ability to verify facts, 
interview witnesses and victims and communicate with Government officials. It was </p>


<p>recognized that each of these bodies have different mandates and different methods of work 
and that the information and evidence that each mechanism gathers should allow the 
different United Nations political organs to have a clear understanding of the human rights 
situation in a number of armed conflict situations in order to adopt the relevant measures.  </p>
