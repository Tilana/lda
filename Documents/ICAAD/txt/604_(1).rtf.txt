2. Background

 The Plaintiff claimed:

 2.1 Shiuraji Sukhnandan (alia) Siuraji and Sukhnandan (alias) Ram Sanehi were wife and husband respectively.

 2.2 Sukhnandan died on 18 March 1984 at CWM Hospital, Suva and his wife Siuraji died on 21 April 2001 in USA.

 2.11 The Plaintiff contends that the purported Will dated 11 May 1998 made by Siuraji is not a valid last Will of the deceased as the purported Will has been revoked by the deceased's subsequent last Will made on 2nd day of June 1999.

 3.7 The Defendant had admitted that receipt of the letter dated 24/11/2008 and denied the rest of the contents of paragraph (13) and stated the Plaintiff is not a capable person to administer both the estates because he had not taken any steps to prove the alleged Will dated 2/6/1999 and had left the estate abandoned.

The letter was tendered marked as Exhibit 'P10'. The witness stated he claim reliefs in the prayer of the Statement of Claim.

8. Analysis and Conclusion
 
 8.1 The late father of the Plaintiff and the Defendant died intestate on 18 March 1984 and the mother Siuraji wife of the deceased died on 21 April 2001. On 22 January 1985, Letters of Administration No. 20755 (Exhibit 'P9') in the Estate of Sukhnandan was granted to Siuraji. However, she failed to distribute the estate of her late husband during her life time.

 8.2 On 11 February 2005, the Defendant was appointed as the Administrator to the unadministered estate of Sukhnandan (Exhibit P7A).

 8.3 The Plaintiff in his evidence explained about the brothers and sisters in his evidence which was summarized hereinbefore.

 8.4 The paragraphs 1 to 7 of the Statement of Claim was admitted by the Defendant.

 8.5 I am satisfied, the Plaintiff is entitled to 1/16th share of all the properties described in the Exhibits P1(A); P1(B); P2; P3; P4; P5; and P6 produced in the evidence of the Plaintiff.

 8.6 The Plaintiff in his evidence stated the Defendant migrated to Australia and he never distributed the estate of the deceased Sukhnandan. Although he made several request those were ignored by the Defendant which compelled the Plaintiff to institute this action.

 8.7 The Defendant had stated in his Statement of Defence the second Will dated 2 June 1999 document marked as 'P5' was executed under duress. I believe the evidence of the Plaintiff and conclude there was no fraudulent and deceitful means used by the Plaintiff in the process of executing the said Will by Siuraji.

 8.8 I considered the submissions made by Mr V Maharaj in paragraph 13 to 23 and agree that out of the 8 beneficiaries of the estate only two of the beneficiaries namely the Defendant Ujjna Nand and Sajjna Nand are receiving all the benefits and the Defendant had not taken steps to distribute the Estate of Sukhnandan for the benefit of other beneficiaries.

 8.9 As stated in paragraph 17 of the submissions, Hon. Justice Jitoko had failed to consider there were two competing Wills in existence on the Ex-parte Motion filed on 11 April 2008 pursuant to Order 76 Rule 4 of the High Court Rules.

9. The Defendant had failed to deposit in the Court Registry the Original Grant in the state of the deceased Siuraji and the Defendant's position was original probate was lodged at the Registrar of Titles Office and it was missing. Whilst the Defendant failed to distribute the estate, he had after obtaining the grant he had as stated in P1(A); P1(B); P2; and P3 memorial shows the Defendant registered himself as the Administrator/Executor in each of the properties owned by the two estates which led the Plaintiff to obtain an interim injunction on 23/7/2010 restraining the Defendant from disposing any of the assets. I am satisfied any that the Defendant has failed in his duties as an administrator as such the Plaintiff is entitled to the Orders sought. 

10. Orders:

 (a) The Probate No. 43285 granted by Jitoko J. on 23 February 2005 is recalled and revoked pursuant to Order 76 Rule 2, 3 and 4 of the High Court Rules;

 (b) A fresh probate is granted to the Plaintiff pursuant to the Last Will of Siuraji executed on 2 June 1999;

 (c) The Defendant to file audited accounts and inventory in the Estate of Sukhnandan within 60 days of this Judgment;

 (d) The Estate to be valued by two registered valuers and the estate be distributed thereafter;

 (e) The Defendant removed as the Administrator of the Estate of Sukhnandan and the Plaintiff is appointed as the Administrator in place of the Defendant;

 (f) The Defendant to pay summarily assessed costs of $2,500.00 to the Plaintiff.

Delivered at Suva this 15th Day of August 2014.
