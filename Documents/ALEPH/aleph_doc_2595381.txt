<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">On July 22, 2016,
JPX Global, Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) entered
into a Securities Purchase Agreement (&ldquo;SPA&rdquo;) in connection with the 
issuance of a convertible promissory note (&ldquo;Note&rdquo;)
in the aggregate principal amount of $166,000. The Note matures on April 22, 
2017 (the &ldquo;Maturity Date&rdquo;), and bears
interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The Note may be prepaid at graduated 
rates from 125% to 150% for the first 180 days. After
180 days the Note may not be prepaid. The Note, together with all interest as 
accrued, is convertible into shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock at a 45% discount to the lowest trading price in the previous 
twenty-five days. The SPA and the Note contain representations,
warranties, conditions, restrictions, and covenants of the Company that are 
customary in such transactions with smaller companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent:

and issued the Note as described in Item 1.01 above. The Note may be accelerated
by the holder in the event of default and the
rate of interest on the Note will increase to 24% per annum, retroactive to the 
date of issuance. In addition, the amount due and
payable under the Note (and, consequently, the number of shares of common stock 
convertible thereunto) may be increased to 150%
of the principal amount of the Note, plus default interest as accrued thereon, 
in the event of default. The Note is a direct financial
obligation of the Company and is considered a current liability of the Company 
for accounting purposes.</P>

and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;). No
solicitation was made and no underwriting discounts were given or paid in 
connection with this transaction. The Company believes
that the issuance of shares pursuant to the Acquisition was exempt from 
registration with the SEC pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933.</P>

assigns (the &ldquo;Holder&rdquo;) the sum of US$166,000
together with any interest as set forth herein, on April [&#9679;], 2017 (the 
&ldquo;Maturity Date&rdquo;), and to pay interest
on the unpaid principal balance hereof at the rate of ten percent (10%) (the 
&ldquo;Interest Rate&rdquo;) per annum from the date
hereof (the &ldquo;Issue Date&rdquo;) until the same becomes due and payable, 
whether at maturity or upon acceleration or by prepayment
or otherwise. This Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as 
otherwise explicitly set forth herein with the written
consent of the Holder which may be withheld for any reason or for no reason. Any
amount of principal or interest on this Note which
is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-four percent 
(24%) per annum from the due date thereof until the
same is paid (the &ldquo;Default Interest&rdquo;). Interest shall commence 
accruing on the date that the Note is fully paid and
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days 
elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent
not converted into common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the &ldquo;Common 
Stock&rdquo;) in accordance with the terms hereof)
shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments 
shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter
give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance with the provisions of
this Note. Whenever any amount expressed to be
due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a business day, the
same shall instead be due on the next succeeding
day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment date which 
is not the date on which this Note is paid in full,
the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for 
purposes of determining the amount of interest due on
such date. As used in this Note, the term &ldquo;business day&rdquo; shall mean 
any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day
on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York are authorized or 
required by law or executive order to remain closed.
Each capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise defined, shall have the 
meaning ascribed thereto in that certain Securities

have the right from time to time, and at any time
following the date of this Note and ending on the later of (i) the Maturity Date
and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount
(as defined in Article III) pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Article III, each in 
respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount
of this Note to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal 
amount of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any 
shares of capital stock or other securities of the
Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified
at the Conversion Price (as defined below) determined
as provided herein (a &ldquo;Conversion&rdquo;); <U>provided</U>, 
<U>however</U>, that in no event shall the Holder be entitled
to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon 
conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates 
(other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed
beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes
or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any
other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitations contained herein)
and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the
portion of this Note with respect to which the
determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial 
ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than
4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to 
the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange
Act&rdquo;), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in 
clause (1) of such proviso, <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>,
<U>however</U>, that the limitations on conversion may be waived by the Holder 
upon, at the election of the Holder, not less than
61 days&rsquo; prior notice to the Borrower, and the provisions of the 
conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such
61st day (or such later date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified 
in such notice of waiver). The number of shares
of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be
determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined
below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified 
in the notice of conversion, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the &ldquo;Notice of Conversion&rdquo;), delivered to the 
Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section
1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or 
e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably
expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New 
York time on such conversion date (the &ldquo;Conversion
Date&rdquo;). The term &ldquo;Conversion Amount&rdquo; means, with respect to 
any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal
amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion <U>plus</U> (2) at the 
Holder&rsquo;s option, accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to 
the Conversion Date, provided however, that the
Borrower shall have the right to pay any or all interest in cash <U>plus</U> (3)
