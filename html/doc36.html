Interights v. Egypt
Summary of the Complaint
1. This communication is brought before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the
African Commission or the Commission) on behalf of Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mohamed Abdalla
Abu-Gareer and Ossama Mohamed Al-Nakhlawy (the Victims), by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal
Rights and Interights (the Complainants).
2. The Respondent State is Egypt, a State Party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the
African Charter or the Charter).
3. The Complainants state that the Victims were tried and sentenced to death after being accused of
bombings which took place on 6 October 2004 and 23 July 2005 on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.
4. The Complainants submit that on the night of 7 October 2004, three bombings took place in the Taba
Hilton Hotel and in two tourist resorts (Al-Badia and Gozor Al-Qamer) near Nuweiba, on the Sinai Peninsula
("the Taba bombings"). They further state that as a result of the attacks, 34 people died and at least 157
were injured. The Complainants say that the Victims were Egyptian, Israeli and other foreign tourists and
workers.
5. They allege that the security forces of the Respondent State responded with a campaign of mass arrests
and detentions in Northern Sinai, from where the perpetrators of the attacks were believed to have
originated. According to the Complainants, among those taken into custody was the First Victim, Mohamed
Gayez Sabbah.
6. The Complainants also state that on 23 July 2005, a series of new bombings took place in the city of
Sharm El-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula, and that following those attacks, the security forces again
arrested a large number of Egyptian citizens, including Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani al-Nakhlawy (the
Second Victim) and Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer (the third victim), on 12 August and 28 September 2005,
respectively.
7. According to the Complainants, agents of the State Security Intelligence (the SSI) subjected the victims
to various forms of torture and ill-treatment during their detention, in order to "confess" before the State
Security Prosecutor for their involvement in the Taba bombings. The Complainants state that the victims
were held incommunicado for a long period of time without access to a lawyer.
8. The Complainants state that the victims were denied necessary medical attention as well forensic
medical examination during interrogation sessions. They allege that the victims were charged with crimes in
relation to the Taba bombings and were tried by the Supreme State Security Emergency Court in a trial
characterized by procedural and substantive anomalies. They further allege that the court's decision was
based substantially on the 'confessions' obtained through torture and prolonged ill-treatment.
9. They state that on 30 November 2006, the victims were sentenced to death by hanging. The
Complainants state that the First Victim, Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, was arrested on 22 October 2004
pursuant to an Administrative Order issued under Law 162/1958 of the State of Emergency (the Emergency
Law).1 The Complainants allege that the first victim was held incommunicado detention by SSI agents until
March 2005. They state that SSI agents blindfolded and bound the first victim, and occasionally hung him
from the ceiling by his arms and legs.
10. The Complainants state that the First Victim was held in these conditions for 96 days, being untied only
during his interrogation by the State Security Prosecutor.
11. They further allege that SSI agents applied electrical shocks to several parts of his body. They state
that beatings and torture took place before and after his interrogation sessions by State Security
Prosecutors which started on 3 November 2004 and that most of the interrogation sessions took place
around midnight and lasted for several hours each.
12. They allege that despite the fact that the First Victim was tortured before these sessions, the
interrogation sheet completed by the State Security Prosecutor in respect of the First Victim indicated that
there were no visible injuries on his body.
13. According to the Complainants, during the first interrogation session, the First Victim denied
involvement in the Taba bombings. The Complainants submit that it was during the second session, held
on 4 November 2004 that the First Victim "confessed" to the State Security Prosecutor. The Complainants
1

also aver that the First Victim was held incommunicado, without access to his family, legal counsel, medical
care or a court until 24 March 2005. Requests for access to a defence lawyer by the first victim were
ignored.
14. The Complainants allege that a plea submitted by a group of human rights lawyers to the Public
Prosecutor's Office, which exercises oversight over the State Security Prosecutor's Office, requesting
permission to represent the victims together with others whose names had been printed in the local press
as the chief suspects in the investigation of the Taba bombings, went unanswered.2
15. Thus according to the Complainants, from the date of arrest on 22 October 2004 to 24 March 2005, the
First Victim was denied access to counsel and that it was on 24 March 2005 that a lawyer attended the final
interrogation hearing during which the First Victim retracted his "confessions".
16. The Complainants assert that the First Victim also requested medical attention and a forensic
examination in relation to his allegations of torture while in detention but the request for a forensic
examination was rejected by the Public Prosecutor's Office according to the viciously circular logic that only
a legal representative (which he was also denied) could make such a claim.
17. According to the Complainants, the charges against the victims and two other individuals in relation to
the Taba bombings were referred to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court in Ismailiya on 30 March
2005, and listed as case No. 40/20053 . They state that the trial started on 2 July 2005 and it was at this
time that the First Victim appeared before a judge for the first time since his arrest, eight months earlier.
The Complainants also assert that during the first hearing on 2 July 2005 the First Victim informed the court
that he had been tortured by SSI officers before and after interrogation sessions, in an attempt to force him
to confess.
18. The Complainants further state that the First Victim told the prosecutor about his torture and requested
medical attention, but the prosecutor denied his requests.
19. The Complainants state that it was during this hearing that the First Victim and his defence counsel
requested that he be examined by a forensic expert. According to the Complainants, the court itself
examined the First Victim in camera, in the presence of his defence counsel as well as a lawyer attending
the hearing on behalf of Human Rights Watch. They state that he was stripped of his clothes for the court to
examine whether there were any physical signs of torture and that the court found "... brown spots on his
arms."4 The Complainants further state that, as a result, the court granted the application for a medical
examination, and adjourned the trial to 24 July 2005.
20. The Complainants aver that the Forensic Medical Authority (FMA) examination took place eight months
after the victim's alleged torture and that the report, dated 5 July 2005, noted injuries that were consistent
with the First Victim having been subjected to torture, including "healings" and "dark discolorations" on his
right and left forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint.5
21. The Complainants also state that the two Government examiners concluded that "due to the long lapse
of time and the fact that the marks were not examined at the time they occurred, it was not possible to
determine with certitude the reason, manner or time of such marks."6 According to the Complainants,
further charges were preferred against the First Victim during his trial on 25 March 2006, in relation to the
Taba bombings.
22. The Complainants submit that the Second Victim, Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawy, was
arrested on 12 August 2005 and placed under administrative detention pursuant to a decree of the Minister
of Interior issued under the Emergency Law.
23. The Complainants further submit that the Second Victim was also tortured by SSI officers during the
initial period of his detention and interrogation, including the use of electric shocks, beatings and
suspension from the roof in painful positions. They state that the Second Victim was only informed of the
charges against him on 22 August 2005, when he first appeared before the State Security Prosecutor for
interrogation.
24. The Complainants assert that during the interrogation session, the Second Victim agreed to sign a
written confession recounting his role in the Taba bombings. They state that during this session, the State
Security Prosecutor indicated on the interrogation sheet that there were no visible injuries on the body of
the Second Victim.
25. According to the Complainants, the Second Victim was denied access to a lawyer during the
interrogation sessions, which spanned a period of seven months and that during the session held on 19
March 2006, the second victim insisted on summoning lawyers to represent him and to that effect
submitted the names and mobile phone numbers of two human rights lawyers.

2

26. The Complainants further submit that on 25 March 2006, the State Security Prosecutor presented a
"complementary indictment" in relation to the Taba bombings in which the First Victim had been charged
(Case No. 40/2005).
27. The Complainants state that the Second Victim also retracted his "confessions" before the court on 26
March 2006 when he informed the court that he had been tortured during his detention. The Complainants
say that the court granted the Second Victim's request for a medical examination which took place two
months later, nine months after the second victim's alleged torture. They state that the forensic medical
report, dated 27 May 2006, noted "darker intersecting discolorations all over the back" as well as an
unhealed fracture in one of the toes of his left foot. The Complainants submit that despite the findings, the
Report concluded that, due to the time lapse, it was not possible to determine precisely the cause or date7
of the discolorations.
28. The Complainants state that the Third Victim, Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, was detained on 28
September 2005 under an Administrative Detention Decree issued under the Emergency Law.
29. According to the Complainants, the period of their arrest was between 12 August and 28 September
2005. The Complainants submit that the Third Victim was first interrogated by the State Security Prosecutor
on 20 November 2005, 50 days after his arrest, at which point he was informed of the charges against him.
30. They state that on 25 March 2006 the Third Victim was referred to the Supreme State Security
Emergency Court, as a result of the referral of the complementary indictment by the State Security
Prosecutor.
31. They state that he had not been brought before a judge at any point during his six-month period of
pre-trial detention. According to the Complainants, he too was held in incommunicado detention without
access to family members, lawyers or medical care.
32. The Complainants state that all the victims informed the court during the trial that they were subjected
to beatings, electric shocks and different forms of cruel and degrading treatment, and that their requests for
referral to the Forensic Medical Authority were consistently denied by the Prosecution Office, but on a
referral by the court the examination confirmed the presence of several injuries but was unable to decisively
conclude the cause of injuries due to the long period of time that had elapsed.
33. The Complainants allege that the repeated requests of the victims to obtain official copies of the
transcript of the hearing of the trial were reportedly denied by the court.
34. The Complainants aver that despite the obvious anomaly of the trial of the Victims and the objections
raised by the defence with respect to procedural impropriety, the court proceeded with the trial and
adjourned on September 2006 to 30 November 2006 to seek the Mufti's (Religious Adviser's) view on the
proceedings in order to deliver its judgement. They state that according to Article 381 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, the court is only obliged to seek the Mufti's view when it intends to issue a death
sentence, indicating that the court had already reached verdict to sentence the Victims to death.
35. According to the Complainants the victims were charged with; belonging to a group established in
violation of the provisions of the law and with the intention of flouting the provisions of the constitution and
the relevant laws as well as violating personal freedoms and targeting foreign tourists and the police as well
as tourist installations; premeditated murder, attempted premeditated murder, damaging property, illegal
manufacture and possession of explosives and car robbery.

Articles alleged to have been violated
36. The Complainants submit that the rights of the victims under Articles 4, 5, 7 (1) (a), (c) and 26 of the
African Charter have been violated.
Prayers
37. The Complainants seek the following reliefs:
a. Recognition by the African Commission that the rights in the above mentioned articles in the Charter
have been violated;
b. An order for compensation in respect of the violations of the rights of the victims;
c. Harmonisation of the Respondent State's legislations in line with the Guidelines and Principles of the
Rights to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance adopted by the African Commission;
d. Ensure that the appropriate mechanisms are implemented to avoid the reoccurrence of similar human
rights violations.

Rights (the Secretariat) during the Commission's 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November

The Law on Admissibility
Submissions of the Complainants on Admissibility

66. The Complainants submit that all the criteria of Article 56 of the African Charter are satisfied and that
therefore, the communication should be declared admissible.
67. On the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainants state that under the Emergency Law
(Law No. 162 of 1958 as amended), the President may decide to commute the sentence, revoke the
judgement, or order a retrial by another circuit of the State Security Emergency Court. They submit that in
the present case, the sentence imposed by the State Emergency Court on 30 November 2006 on the
victims becomes final once it has been ratified by the President of the Republic and that there is no judicial
right to appeal the decision of the State Security Emergency Court.
68. According to the Complainants, the President's decision under the Emergency Law is not judicial in
nature and therefore it cannot be defined as an available remedy for the Complainants to pursue. They
compare the facts of the present communication to those of Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria in which
the Commission described the power of the Governor to confirm or disallow the decision of a special
tribunal in Nigeria as a "discretionary, extraordinary remedy of a non-judicial nature" and where it was
found that the Governor's decision was not a remedy of the nature that required exhaustion under Article
56(5) of the African Charter. The Complainants also refer to Civil Liberties Organisation v Nigeria wherein
it was found that in the absence of a judicial body to adjudicate on the Applicant's complaint, there was no
effective remedy available.
69. The Complainants further argue that the President's decision under the Emergency Law cannot be
made subject to any appeal. Therefore, they submit that the victims are left without any judicial right to
appeal the decision of the State of Emergency Court.
The Respondent State's Submissions on Admissibility

70. The Respondent State submits that the communication is inadmissible for two reasons: firstly, it was
lodged before exhausting local means of redress as the sentence was not final; and secondly, the content
of the communication is inaccurate.
71. In terms of the second grounds the Respondent State submits that certain facts of the communication
are false. It argues that the victims were given due process before and during the trial and that they had
access to lawyers during interrogations.
5

72. The Respondent State submits that the victims had access to a forensic doctor and were examined.
They further State that copies of court proceedings were made available to the victims and their lawyers
and they were properly remanded by a court prior to the commencement of interrogations commenced.
73. The Respondent State asserts that trial of the victims was fair and was conducted in public.
74. On the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent State submits in its written statement that
the judgment pronounced on 30 November 2006 by an Emergency Court is not final as it has not yet been
endorsed.
75. The Respondent State further explains that the Act No. 162 of 1958 stipulates that judgments by the
State of Emergency Security Courts are only made final after being endorsed by the President of the
Republic (Article 42), and that the ratifying authorities may, in examining the judgment, mitigate the
sentence, replace it by a more lenient punishment, rescind it or rescind part thereof or stop its
implementation or a part thereof (Article 14).
76. In addition, the Respondent State points out that for endorsement, the law stipulates that all cases on
which a ruling has been made must be examined by legal advisers assigned for this purpose to ascertain
that the proper procedure was followed.
77. The Respondent State also submits that the law allows the person convicted to submit a written appeal
to the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
78. The Respondent State confirmed that the request for Provisional Measures sent by the Chairperson in
December 2006 to suspend the execution of the death penalty sentence while the communication was
before the Commission had been received, and further explained that the request was transmitted to the
President of Egypt who considered it.
The Commission's Analysis on Admissibility
79. The second ground submitted by the Respondent State pertains to the merits of the case and is not
relevant at the stage of admissibility.
80. The admissibility of communications within the African Commission is governed by the requirements of
Article 56 of the African Charter which provides for seven requirements to be met before a communication
can be declared Admissible. If any of the requirements set out in this article are not met, the African
Commission declares the communication Inadmissible, unless the Complainant provides sufficient
justifications why any of the requirements could not be met.
81. In the present communication, the Complainants claim that this communication fulfils all the
requirements of Article 56 of the African Charter. The Respondent State on the other hand submits that the
Complainants have not fulfilled the requirements under Article 56(5) and as such, the African Commission
should declare the communication inadmissible. The Commission would thus analyze the arguments of
both parties based on the provisions of Article 56 of the Charter.
82. Article 56(1) of the African Charter states that "Communication relating to Human and Peoples' Rights...
received by the Commission shall be considered if they indicate their authors even if the latter request
anonymity..." This communication is brought before the African Commission by the Egyptian Initiative for
Personal Rights and Interights, the Complainants, on behalf of the victims. In this communication, the
authors as well as the victims have been identified. The African Commission is therefore of the view that
sub-article (1) of Article 56 has been complied with.
83. Article 56(2) of the African Charter states that "Communications...received by the Commission shall be
considered if they are compatible with the Charter of the Organization of African Unity or with the present
Charter." The present communication sets out that Articles 4, 5, 7(1) (a), and 26 of the African Charter have
been violated. The communication is brought against the Arab Republic of Egypt a State Party to the
African Charter, and alleges violation of the rights of Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mohamed Abdallah
Abu-Gareer and Ossama Mohamed Al-Nakhlawy who are in custody awaiting to be executed by the
Respondent State. The African Commission therefore holds that the requirements under Article 56(2) have
been fulfilled.
84. Article 56(3) of the African Charter states that "Communications ...received by the Commission shall be
considered if they are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned
and its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity (AU)". The present communication is not written in
a disparaging or insulting language directed to the Respondent State, its institutions or the AU and for
these reasons the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56(3) have been complied
6

with.
85. Article 56(4) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'
Rights... shall be considered if they are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass
media". There is no evidence in this communication indicating that the allegations contained therein are
based exclusively on news or news disseminated through the mass media. The Complainants submit that
the communication is based on eyewitness evidence, as well as documented reports, which they have
submitted along with the communication as attachments. The Respondent State have not challenged this
assertion. For these reasons, the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56(4) have
been fulfilled.
86. Article 56(5) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'
Rights... shall be considered if they are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that
this procedure is unduly prolonged".
87. The rationale of the local remedies rule both in the Charter and other international instruments is to
ensure that before proceedings are brought before an international body, the Respondent State concerned
must have had the opportunity to remedy the matters through its own local system. This prevents the
Commission from acting as a court of first instance rather than a body of last resort. Three major criteria
could be deduced from the practice of the Commission in determining this rule, namely: the remedy must
be available, effective and sufficient.8
88. The only issue at stake at this stage of admissibility in the present case is the one of the exhaustion of
local remedies.
89. It appears from the oral submissions of the Respondent State that there is no local remedy left for the
complainants to exhaust. They argued that the decision of the State of Emergency Court has been
examined and confirmed by a legal adviser and the final procedure of endorsement (ratification by the
President) of the decision of the State of Emergency Court what is a waiting. The outcome of these two
procedures did not change the decision of the State of Emergency Court.
90. The fact that the endorsement of the Emergency Special Court in Egypt is of legal nature or not is not
relevant for the examination of the communication by the Commission at this stage, because what is at
stake is whether there are other remedies available that the applicants did not resort to. The clarifications
brought before the Commission by the representatives of the Respondent State during the 41st Ordinary
Session led to the conclusion that there were no other local remedies available for the Complainant to
resort to. The endorsement process was completed and it was submitted by both parties that the
Complainants had already used the appeal that was available to them by bringing their grievance to the
"judgment ratification office" and that this remedy was unsuccessful.
91. Most of the submissions made by the Respondent State and examined during the 41st Ordinary
Session of the Commission refer to the notion of due process during the trial and would be examined at the
merits' stage. The respect of the rights of the Complainants is indeed a matter relevant at the merits stage
and irrelevant at the admissibility stage.
92. The African Commission in several communications held that the condition of exhaustion of local
remedies "should not constitute an unjustifiable impediment to access international remedies. Therefore,
Article 56(5) should be applied concomitantly with Article 7, which establishes and protect the right to fair
trial"9 . To this extent the African Commission, in determining whether local remedies have been exhausted
takes into consideration the circumstances of each case, including the general context in which the formal
remedies operate and the personal circumstances of the applicant."10
93. In Communication No 250/2002 Zegveld v Eritrea11 , the African Commission confirmed that a
domestic remedy is considered effective if it offers a prospect of success, and sufficient or adequate if it is
capable of redressing the complaint.12 In Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara v The Gambia, the African
Commission decided that the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also
in practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. In the instant case and
consistent with the jurisprudence of the Commission, there are no remedies remaining for the
Complainants to pursue as they have no judicial right to appeal the decision of the State Security
Emergency Court. What remains was for the President of the Republic to ratify the judgment to give force
to it.
94. Therefore, if the victim cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of lack of an effective legal
remedy to address his fear and concerns, local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him.
95. In the present case, the sentence imposed by the State Security Emergency Court on 30 November
2006 on the Victims becomes final once it has been ratified by the President of the Respondent State.
7

Under Article 14 of the Emergency Law (Law No. 162 of 1958 as amended), the President may decide to
commute the sentence, revoke the judgment, or order a retrial by another circuit of the State Security
Emergency Court. The President's decision is discretionary and cannot be made subject to any appeal.
96. The African Commission decided in Communication No. 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria13
that purely discretionary remedies of non judicial nature where "the object of the remedy is to obtain a
favour and not to vindicate a right" are not of the kind contemplated by Article 56(5). In this decision, the
African Commission described the power of the Governor to confirm or disallow the decision of a Special
Tribunal in Nigeria as a "discretionary, extraordinary remedy of a non-judicial nature."14 The African
Commission stated that the remedy was neither adequate nor effective because the Governor was under
"no obligation to decide according to legal principles"15 and concluded that the Governor's decision was
therefore not a remedy of the nature that required exhaustion under Article 56(5) of the Charter.16 In
Communication No 87/93 Civil Liberties Organisation v Nigeria [sic] , the African Commission also found
that in the absence of a judicial body to adjudicate the applicant's complaints, there was no effective
remedy to which the applicant could have recourse.17
97. In the Instant matter, the clarifications by the Representatives of the Respondent State during the 41st
Ordinary Session led the Commission to the conclusion that there were no other local remedies available
for the victims to resort to. The ratification process was completed and it has been submitted by both
parties that the victims had already used the appeal that was available to them by bringing their grievance
to the "judgment ratification office" and that this remedy has proved unsuccessful.
98. The African Commission therefore concludes that since the decision of the court is not appealable by
any other judicial authority, the Complainants have exhausted the requirements of Article 56(5) of the
Charter.
99. Article 56(6) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'
Rights... shall be considered if they: are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies
are exhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized with the matter". The Complainant states that the
case has been decided by the State Security Emergency Court whose decision was awaiting the ratification
by the President of the Republic. The Secretariat of the African Commission received this communication
during the Commission's 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul The Gambia
and acknowledged receipt by a letter dated 12 February 2007. The Charter does not provide for what
constitutes a reasonable time, for a Complainant to bring his/her Complaint before the Commission. The
Commission has however dealt with this issue, on a case by case basis. The communication got to the
Commission ten months after the decision of the State Security Emergency Court. The African Commission
considers this to be a reasonable time, taking into consideration the complexities of getting a representation
before an international body, and the challenges of communications system in Africa. The African
Commission therefore holds that this provision has also been complied with.
100. Article 56(7) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'
Rights... shall be considered if they: do not deal with cases which have been settled by these states
involved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the
Organisation of African Unity or the provisions of the present Charter." The Complainants state that this
communication has not been settled by any international body and as such this requirement has been met.
The Respondent State did not object to Complainants assertion and there is no evidence before the
Commission to show that the communication is being or has been settled by another international body.
The Commission therefore holds that the requirement set out in Article 56(7) has been fulfilled.
101. Therefore, since all, under Article 56 have been met, the African Commission declares the
communication Admissible and maintains the request for Provisional Measures communicated to the
Respondent State on 5th December 2006, in order to prevent irreparable damages.
102. Other submissions which are made by the Respondent State and examined during the 41st Ordinary
Session of the Commission refer to the notion of due process during the trial and will be examined at the
merits stage.
The Merits
The Complainants' Submissions on the Merits

103. The Complainants submit that the manner in which the Respondent State conducted the arrest,
detention, interrogation, trial and sentencing of the victims violates Articles 4, 5, 7 (1) (a), (c) and 26 of the
8

African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment)

104. It is submitted by the Complainants that, the First Victim, Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, after his arrest on
22 October 2004 was held incommunicado by SSI (State Security Intelligence) agents until March 2005.
SSI agents blindfolded and bound him, and occasionally hung him from the ceiling by his arms and legs.
According to the Complainants he was held in this condition for 96 days, being untied only during his
interrogation by the State Security Prosecutor. They also allege that the SSI agents applied electric shocks
to several parts of his body. They further allege that this beatings and torture took place before and after his
interrogation sessions by state security prosecutors which started on 3 November 2004.
105. The Complainants also submit that the First Victim initially denied involvement in the bombings but
due to the beatings and torture was compelled to change his plea and confessed on 4 November 2004.
They also submit that the First Victim was not allowed access to his family, lawyers, medical care until 24
March 2005.
106. The Complainants aver that the Second Victim, Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawy, who
was arrested on 12 August 2005, was tortured by SSI officers during the initial period of his detention and
questioning, includes the use of electric shocks, beatings and suspension from the roof in painful positions.
They further submit that, during the interrogation session which spanned over seven months, the Second
Victim was denied access to his legal counsel.
107. They submit on behalf of the Third Victim, Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, that between 28 September
2005 and 20 November 2005, he was questioned by SSI officers in at least twenty-five sessions and that
he was subjected to electric shocks and suspended by the hands and legs in painful positions.
108. In arguing this case, the Complainants further refer to the African Commission's jurisprudence18 where
it held that the prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment includes 'actions which cause
serious physical or psychological suffering (or) humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his
or her will or conscience'.
109. The African Commission was also referred to the absolute prohibition of torture and ill treatment as
contained in the Robben Island Guidelines19 and Hurilaws v Nigeria20 . They further contend that the
absolute character of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment is recognized in other regional and
international instruments including the RIG and CAT.21 The Complainants submit that even those
instruments which, in contrast to the African Charter, allow for some derogation during times of national
emergency explicitly exclude from the scope of permissible derogation, inter alia, the provisions prohibiting
torture and ill-treatment.22 The Complainants argue that even the undoubted threat posed by terrorism, do
not affect in any way the absolute prohibition on torture.23
110. The Complainants further argue that, because of the importance of the values it protects, and as
international courts and bodies have recognized, the prohibition of torture has now evolved into a
peremptory norm or jus cogens, reflecting that the prohibition has become one of the most fundamental
standards in the international community.24
111. The Complainants submit that, not only is the Respondent State required to refrain from torture and
ill-treatment, but also that, it must take positive measures to effectively prevent and protect against it. They
argue that, certain safeguards - such as access to counsel, courts and medical personnel, and the
inadmissibility of evidence obtained through torture - are inherent aspects of the prohibition of torture and
ill-treatment. They further submit that where torture or ill-treatment does arise, the Respondent State is
obliged to respond with effective investigation and remedial action. The importance of such measures they
argue, lies firstly, in acting as a deterrent to the commission of torture and ill-treatment and, secondly, in
ensuring that where torture and other ill-treatment occurs, it is investigated and documented. The
Complainants refer the African Commission to General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture,
which recognized judicial remedies and access to counsel and to medical assistance during detention as
"baseline" guarantees which the state is obliged to respect in order to give effect to the obligation to prevent
and protect against torture or ill-treatment.25
112. The Complainants argue that under the African Charter, a parallel obligation to prevent torture or
ill-treatment derives from the undertaking given by the States Parties in Article 1 of the Charter "to adopt
legislative or other measures to give effect" to the rights contained in the Charter. The importance of such
safeguards, the Complainants argue, has been recognized by the African Commission in the Robben
Island Guidelines.26 The Complainants aver that, the Commission itself has noted that while "punishment of
9

the torturer is important, [...] preventive measures such as halting of incommunicado detention, effective
remedies under a transparent, independent and efficient legal system, and ongoing investigations into
allegations of torture"27 are the best ways to deal with such atrocities.
113. It is submitted by the Complainants that, the victims were subjected to torture and ill-treatment by state
agents - members of the security forces - while they were in state custody. They argue that, the victims
were subjected to repeated electric shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging, binding and blindfolding aimed at
their complete disorientation. They further state that, this treatment, which was inflicted by state officials on
the victims, which intended to elicit confessions and information, clearly meets the torture threshold.
114. The Complainants also argue that, although the context of the victims incommunicado detention and
interrogation is such that available evidence is necessarily limited, the allegations of torture and
ill-treatment are supported by the victims' independent testimonies of similar ill-treatment. According to the
Complainants, the fact that the victims were held incommunicado, hidden from the outside world during the
6-9 months of pre-trial detention, and that access to medical professionals was persistently denied until
during trial itself is indicative of ill-treatment. They submit that, the irregular nature of the "interrogation"
sessions which is also consistent with the decision to interrogate late at night is a form of ill-treatment.
115. The Complainants submit that the Forensic Medical Report, following the examination of the first
victim on 5 July 2005, nearly nine months after his injuries were sustained, noted "healings" and "dark
discolorations" on his right and left forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint. The
second report of the FMA of 27 May 2006, following examination of the second and third victims also nearly
nine months after their torture, found that the Second victim had a "darker intersecting discolorations" all
over his back, as well as an unhealed fracture in a left foot toe and that the third victim had dark
discolorations in the chest, abdomen and upper arms. The Complainants concede that, in both cases the
government examiners concluded that the long time lapse between being examined and the injuries made
it impossible to determine with certainty the reason, manner or time of such injuries."
116. The Complainants aver that their allegations are consistent with reports of the systemic nature of
torture by security forces in Egypt in cases such as the present one. By referring the African Commission to
the 1996 findings into the use of torture in Egypt, in which it concluded that "torture is systematically
practiced by the security forces in Egypt, in particular by State Security Intelligence",28 the Complainants
argue that human rights mechanisms consistently point to widespread and systematic torture in places of
detention in Egypt. The Complainants also refer the African Commission to the decision of the Committee
Against Torture which found that "Egypt resorted to consistent and widespread use of torture against
detainees" and that "[r]isk of such treatment was particularly high in the case of detainees held for political
and security reasons."29
117. The Complainants aver that under international human rights law, when a person is injured in
detention or while under the control of security forces, there is a strong presumption that the person was
subjected to torture or ill-treatment. They argue that, it is incumbent on the state to provide a plausible
explanation of how the injuries were caused.30
118. The Complainants also argue that, the Respondent State has failed to discharge this burden in that,
they made no attempt to give satisfactory explanation of how the injuries were sustained, or to take any
steps to investigate and address the surrounding circumstances. The Complainants contend further that,
the trial court did nothing to follow up on questions raised in the FMA reports or the victims' testimonies.
They also argue that the SSI officers who were called to testify against the defendants in court were not
asked to confront a single question with regard to the alleged torture and ill-treatment. They submit that the
judgment fails to mention, still less to address, the allegations of ill-treatment; and that the authorities have
continuously failed to take any steps to investigate the allegations of ill-treatment or the questions raised by
the FMA reports.
119. The Complainants also contend that the carrying out of a death sentence using a particular method of
execution may amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if the suffering caused in
execution of the sentence is excessive and goes beyond that strictly necessary. They further argue that
where a death sentence has been imposed "it must be carried out in such a way as to cause the least
possible physical and mental suffering."31 This approach they submit was tested and applied in the case of
Ng v. Canada where it was found that the particular method of gas asphyxiation fell foul [sic] of it.32
120. The Complainants submit that in the present case, the victims have been sentenced to death by
hanging. Hanging, they contend, is a notoriously slow and painful means of execution. If carried out without
appropriate attention to the weight of the person condemned, hanging can result either in slow and painful
strangulation, because the neck is not immediately broken by the drop, or, at the other extreme, in the
10

separation of the head from the body. The risk of either possibility is not compatible with respect for the
inherent dignity of the individual and the duty to minimize unnecessary suffering.
Alleged Violation of Articles 7(1) and 26 (Right to Fair Trial and Independent Judiciary)

121. The Complainants argue that the victims right to a fair trial was violated in that; (a) they were tried by a
court that was not independent and impartial and whose decisions is not subject to appeal; (b) their right to
a counsel was not fully respected; (c) confessions made under torture or ill-treatment were used by the
court, and
122. The Complainants also submit that by virtue of Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter, the victims have
"the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal". They also state that, the
victims were tried by an exceptional security court, which failed to meet the minimum guarantees of an
independent and impartial tribunal.
123. The Complainants state that the requirement of impartiality in Article 7 of the Charter is complemented
by Article 26 of the same which imposes on States Parties 'the duty to guarantee the independence of the
courts' in their respective territories. These obligations, they submit, are captured in the Commission's
Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial wherein the Commission inter alia stated that: 'judicial bodies shall
be established by law to have adjudicative functions to determine matters within their competence on the
basis of the rule of law and in accordance with proceedings conducted in the prescribed manner;33 there
should not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process nor shall decisions be
subject to revision except through judicial review;34 all judicial bodies shall be independent from the
Executive branch35 and the government shall respect that independence;36 the process of appointments to
judicial bodies shall be transparent;37 the judicial body shall decide matters before it without any
restrictions, improper influence, inducements, pressure, threats or interference, direct or indirect, from any
quarter or for any reason.38
124. The Complainants aver that, not applying these fair trial principles stated above, to special tribunals,
violates Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter because their composition is at the discretion of the executive
branch. They also contend that the removal of cases from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and placing
them before an extension of the executive branch necessarily compromises their impartiality39 and that
"[the] very existence [of such special tribunals] constitutes a violation of the principles of impartiality and
independence of the judiciary."40
125. The Complainants state that the above averments are founded on the jurisprudence of the African
Commission and are equally reflected in broader international and comparative law approaches to the right
to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal. To support this position the Complainants refer the
African Commission to the jurisprudence and case law of other regional and international and human rights
mechanisms. They argue that an interpretation of such a right under Article 14(1) of the ICCPR has been
deemed to be "an absolute right that may suffer no exception,"41 and that where the executive is able to
'control or direct' the judiciary, the notion of an independent and impartial tribunal is violated.42 This
jurisprudence they submit has been followed by regional human rights treaty bodies such as the
Inter-American and European Courts of Human Rights, which have similarly held that special courts with
close ties to the executive branch violate provisions requiring an independent and impartial tribunal.43
126. The Complainants state that the competence and procedures of the Supreme State Security
Emergency Court, an Exceptional Court, which tried the victims fall far short of the above standards. They
also argue that the Supreme State Security Emergency Court was established by the Emergency Law as a
temporary court,44 although, like the Emergency Law itself, it has been in force continually since 1981. The
Emergency Law gives the court the primary competence of ruling on crimes perpetrated in violation of
decrees issued by the President of the Republic in application of the Emergency Law,45 but the President
of the Republic may also, at his/her discretion, refer any ordinary crime to the Supreme State Security
Emergency Court.46 According to Presidential Decree 1/1981 regarding the referral of some crimes to
Emergency State Security Courts, all felonies and misdemeanors against the government's security or
related to explosives shall be referred to State Security Emergency Courts, established under the
Emergency Law.
127. It is further contended by the Complainant that the composition of the Supreme State Security
Emergency Court, and the procedure for appointments to it, illustrate the lack of independence. They state
that while normally composed of three judges of the Court of Appeal,47 the President of the Republic may
order that the Security Court be formed of three judges of the Court of Appeal and two officers of the
11

army,48 or simply decide that it be formed of three military officers.49 Before appointing the judges and/or
military officers, the law provides that the President of the Republic shall seek the opinion of the respective
Minister of Justice and the Minister of War.50
128. The Complainants also argue that, the degree of control which the President of the Republic exercises
over the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the State Security Court is antithetical to
the notion of an independent and impartial judicial process because, the President, for example exercises
the following powers:
? the President may suspend a case before it is submitted to Supreme State Security Emergency Court or
order the temporary release of the accused person before referral of the case to the Supreme State
Security Emergency Court;51
?? decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency Court are final only when they're approved by the
President of the Republic, and cannot thereafter be challenged before any other court in Egypt;52
? the President of the Republic may commute, change, suspend or cancel such decisions. He may also
order the release of defendants53 ; and or
? order the retrial of the case before another court.54
129. The Complainants further aver that, this lack of independence and impartiality of the Supreme State
Security Emergency Court has been identified and criticized by the Human Rights Committee when it
expressed its 'alarm' at the fact that "that Military Courts and State Security Courts have jurisdiction to try
civilians accused of terrorism although there are no guarantees of those Courts' independence and their
decisions are not subject to appeal before a higher Court."55
130. With regards to the right to a counsel, as enshrined in Article 7(1) (c) of the African Charter, 56 the
Complainants contend that this right which underpins several others, such as freedom from ill-treatment
and the right to prepare a defense,57 should be observed during all stages of criminal prosecution
"including preliminary investigations in which evidence is taken, periods of administrative detention, trial
and appeal proceedings."58 They submit that in proceedings relating to criminal charges, legal
representation is the "best means of legal defence against infringements of human rights and fundamental
freedoms".59 They also argue that in cases involving capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused
must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings".60
131. They refer the African Commission to its decision in the matter of Malawi African Association and
Others v. Mauritania,61 the Complainants submit that the right to counsel in Article 7 refers to the right to
counsel of the detainee or defendant's choice and argues that where the accused either had no access, or
only restricted or delayed access, to lawyers, there is a violation of Article 7(1) (c). They contend that this
right guarantees the right to timely and confidential consultations with that counsel.62
132. The Complainants further argue that although the European system has recognized that in certain
exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to limit the right to counsel, such restrictions can only be
allowed if they are no more than strictly necessary and do not hinder the fairness of the proceedings.63 The
Complainants refer the African Commission to the case of Ocalan v. Turkey, where the court held inter alia
that the denial of access to a lawyer for ten days during interrogations, "a situation where the rights of the
defence might well be irretrievably prejudiced", interfered with the fairness of the proceedings and violated
the defendant's human rights.64
133. In the instant matter, the Complainants state that none of the Victims had lawyers present at the
critical early interrogation stage. They argue that on 23 November 2004 a group of human rights lawyers
submitted a specific request to the Public Prosecutor's Office (registered under number 16332) to legally
represent a number of individuals, including the First Victim but received no response. They submit that the
First Victim was denied representation at interrogations for a period of 5 months until 24 March 2005 and
the Second and Third Victims had no access to counsel until 26 March 2006, when they first appeared in
court.
134. The Complainants submit that, even at the beginning of the trial, all three victims were denied the
opportunity to consult with counsel privately, in order to prepare their defence. They also submit that, the
lawyer client communication took place through bars of the court room, in the presence of, and within
earshot security officials. It is submitted that the complete denial of access to counsel before their
appearance in court and the restrictive access thereafter, violated the right to counsel and the right to a
12

defence under Article 7(1) (c).65
135. With regards to the issue of the State Security Emergency Court's reliance on the "confessions" of the
three Victims, the Complainants submit that "any confession or other evidence obtained by any form of
coercion or force may not be admitted as evidence or considered as probative of any fact at trial or in
sentencing."66 They argue that "any confession or admission obtained during incommunicado detention
shall be considered to have been obtained by coercion."67 They further argue that any evidence and/or
confessions obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment cannot be used in judicial
proceedings except for the purpose of prosecuting the act of torture or ill-treatment itself.68
136. Relying on decisions from European Court of Human Rights69 , the Complainants aver that the use of
evidence obtained under torture or ill-treatment in criminal proceedings raises serious issues as to the
fairness of such proceedings. They contend that any incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a
confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment
which can be characterized as torture should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt, irrespective of
its probative value."70 They further submit that the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 also stipulates that "if a
confession is proved to have been made by a person under any ...forms of duress or coercion, it shall be
considered invalid and futile".71
137. The Complainants submit that although the Committee against Torture has affirmed in a number of
cases that, "it is for the author to demonstrate that the allegations are well founded", 72 the duty is generally
on the state to prove that the confessions were freely obtained.73 In support of this view the Complainants
refer the Commission to observations of the Human Rights Committee that "all allegations that statements
of detainees have been obtained through coercion must lead to an investigation and such statements must
never be used as evidence, except as evidence of torture, and the burden of proof, in such cases, should
not be borne by the alleged victim."74 The African Commission was also referred to in the UN Report of the
Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, who had
noted that "[...] the applicant is only required to demonstrate that his or her allegations of torture are well
founded. This means that the burden of proof to ascertain whether or not statements invoked as evidence
in any proceedings, including extradition proceedings, have been made as a result of torture shifts to the
State, [sic]75
138. The Complainants assert that the victims in this case all raised allegations of torture and ill-treatment
and that these allegations are at least consistent with the circumstances of their case, such as the
incommunicado nature of their detention and the reports of the FMA which, at a minimum, indicate a risk of
ill-treatment. The Complainants also state that despite these concerns, and the apparent inconsistency and
unreliability of the evidence, the "confessions" were admitted as evidence and appear to have formed at
least part of the basis of their convictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The reliance on such
evidence, they argue, violates Article 7 of the Charter.
139. With regards to the right to appeal, the Complainants aver that Article 12 of the Egyptian Emergency
Law stipulates that "It is not allowed in any form to appeal the decisions pronounced by State Security
Courts." They argue that these laws, and its application in practice, violate Article 7(1) (a) of the Charter,
which provides for 'the right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his
fundamental rights as recognized and guaranteed by conventions, laws, regulations and customs in force.'
140. The Complainants also submit that States Parties should guarantee the right to appeal as well as
provide for a genuine and timely review of the cases, including the facts and the law",76 and that in extreme
cases where life is at risk States Parties should take steps to make appeals mandatory especially in death
penalty cases.77 The Complainants refer the Commission to its decisions in Law Office of Ghazi Suleiman
v Sudan78 to highlight the importance of appeal rights in the Commission's jurisprudence, and to Civil
Liberties Organization and Others v. Nigeria79 concerning the right to appeal in death penalty cases.
141. As a result of the above, the Complainants submit that the court before which the victims were tried
failed to meet the criteria which the Commission has identified as essential for an independent and
impartial tribunal and urged the Commission to hold that the Arab Republic of Egypt has violated Articles 7
and 26 of the African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)

142. In support of the alleged violation of Article 4 of the African Charter, the Complainants contend that
although the imposition of the death penalty is not per se unlawful under the Charter or broader
international human rights law, certain circumstances, which are present in this case, will render it a breach
13

of the right to life. For the purposes of this instant case the Complainant argued that these special
circumstances would include situations where the sentence was passed without meeting the requirements
of a fair trial set out in Article 7 of the African Charter; and where the death penalty is mandatory or
automatic, imposed by law rather than being applied by a court of law in light of all relevant circumstances.
143. They submit that in criminal proceedings which may lead to the imposition of the death penalty,
respect for due process is required to ensure that the right to life guaranteed under Article 4 of the Charter
is not violated. By referring the African Commission to its decisions in International Pen and Others (on
behalf of Saro-Wiwa) v Nigeria80 and in Malawi African Association and Others v Mauritania, they argue
that, where the death penalty is unlawfully imposed, Article 4 is violated because the victims' rights under
Article 7 of the Charter had been denied.
144. The Complainants submit that 'a higher threshold of rights is intended for those who are charged with
crimes the sentence of which might be the death penalty'81 , which explains the need for "scrupulous
respect of the guarantees of fair trial" in capital offence cases.82 It is submitted that the Respondent State in
a statement to the UN General Assembly in 2007 recognized the critical nature of respect for due process
rights in capital offence cases.83
145. It is contended by the Complainants that the imposition of the death sentence by the Supreme State
Security Emergency Court in the particular circumstances of this case would amount to an arbitrary
deprivation of life.
The Respondent State's Submissions on the Merits

146. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 5, the Respondent State submits that Article 42
× Article 42 Any person arrested, detained or his freedom restricted shall be treated in the manner
concomitant with the preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him. He
may not be detained or imprisoned except in places defined by laws organising prisons. If a confession is
proved to have been made by a person under any of the aforementioned forms of duress or coercion, it
shall be considered invalid and futile.
of the Constitution of Egypt provides for and guarantees the right to security of the person and that if a
confession is proved to have been made by a person under duress or coercion, it shall be considered
invalid and futile. It is further submitted by the Respondent State that Article 57
× of the same Constitution provides that "any assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of the
private life of citizens and any other public rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and Article 57
Any assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of private life of citizens and any other public rights
and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and the law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and
civil lawsuit is not liable to prescription. The State shall grant a fair compensation to the victim of such an
assault.
the law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and civil lawsuit is not liable to prescription. The State
shall grant a fair compensation to the victim of such an assault."
147. Concerning the allegation that the victims were denied visits while in detention, the Respondent State
submit that the relatives of Ossama Mohamed al- Nakhlawy visited him 17 times, the relatives of Mohamed
Gayez Sabah visited him 30 times and the relatives of Yunis Mohamed Abu Gareer visited him 16 times
until April 2007. These, argues the Respondent State shows that the allegations of the Complainants are
baseless.
148. The Respondent State avers that its penal code criminalizes acts of torture in Articles 126 and 282,
and that the same code further criminalizes unjustified detention imposes penalties exceeding those
decided by Articles 127 and 280.
149. The Respondent State contends that, the assessment, value and reliance on any confession as a
piece of evidence in any criminal proceedings is an issue entirely at the discretion of the Court. It is argued
that it is the judge who in exercise of this discretion decides whether or not to accept and rely on the
confession as reliable evidence for conviction.
150. It is contended by the Respondent State that the judge's competence to assess the value of a
confession entails as well his competence to interpret it, define its significance and explore its motives. This
principle, argues the Respondent State, applies whether the confession was judicial or non judicial, whether
it took place in the process of factual investigation, interrogation or even before a normal person. The
judge, argues the Respondent State, does not rely on a confession if he is not convinced with it even in the
14

case where the accused person insists on his confession. In such a case, the judge may issue an acquittal
and clarify in the causation why he did not take the confession into consideration. If it is proved that the
confession was made under duress or coercion, it would be considered as invalid. But this does not prevent
the court from taking other evidences to prove the accusation.
151. It is argued by the Respondent State that the court judgment against the victims took into
consideration all the circumstances related to the facts according to the satisfaction of the court based upon
the processes in the case, the investigations, the court sessions and the related hearings of witnesses and
the written and verbal pleadings of the defence in order to clarify the facts, the elements of the crime and
the provisions of the law applicable thereon. The Respondent State argues that the court considered,
scrutinized and analyzed all the evidences of the subject matter of the complaint including the related
medical and technical reports and the public prosecution investigations to reach the facts upon which its
judgment was established.
152. It is further contended by the Respondent State that the court responded to all the pleas of the
defence during the trial including the plea of the invalidity of the confessions, and that the court was
satisfied that the confessions of the victims and the other accused persons during the investigation were
made by persons who have the will and the discernment and are fully aware of the charges against them.
153. The Respondent State submits that when the accused persons first appeared before the public
prosecutor they were free from any injuries. They further submit that the court was certain that the victims
were fully aware that the investigations were made by the Public Prosecution Office (PPO) and that the
PPO had informed them of the charges against them. The Respondent State also stated that 'the Office of
the Public Prosecutor in carrying out its investigations, interrogated the accused, Mohamed Gaiz Sabah in
four sessions, Osama Abdel Ghani El-Nakhlawi in eight sessions and Mohamed Alyan Abu Garir in twenty
five sessions. During these sessions, all the accused pleaded guilty of having committed the crimes
attributed to them'.
154. The Respondent State contends that as a result of the findings of the PPO, the victims were referred
to Court in suit number No. 40/2005 of breaching security under the State of Emergency by committing
capital offence. The Court, the Respondent State contends, had responded throughout its sittings to all the
requests made by the victims. They also submit that the Court had during deliberations allowed the victims
and their defence to produce evidence in support of their case and to bring their own to witnesses. They
further submit that the Complainants were heard and that their request to be examined by a forensic doctor
was also granted. They submit that the court equally heard the Complainants submissions in defence of the
victims in 12 sessions and that they were allowed access to visit victims whenever they requested. They
also submit that the Complainants were given copies of the minutes of investigations and all the records of
court sittings as well as the witnesses and that the court was convinced that their confessions were valid.
155. Concerning the Complainants' allegation that the fair trial rights of the victims were violated, the
Respondent State adopted its earlier position that the victims had a fair and just trial before a legal, national
and competent court. They submit that the trial sessions were public and were attended by the lawyers who
represented the victims; and that, the trial was concluded within a reasonable period.
156. The Respondent State argues that it is clear from the court processes that the victims were tried
before a legal, national and independent court constituted of judges who enjoy judicial immunity. This
according to the Respondent State negates the allegation of a any violation of Article 26 of the African
Charter.

The African Commission's Analysis on the Merits
157. In this communication, the African Commission is called upon to determine whether the arrest, pre-trial
detention, trial and sentencing of the Victims by the Respondent State following their alleged involvement in
a bomb attack on 6 October 2004, in the Taba and Noueiba' resorts of the Sinai Peninsula which led to the
death of 34 and the injury of 105 Egyptian, Israeli and other foreigners, violates the victims' rights
guaranteed under Articles 4, 5, 7(1) (a)(c) and 26 of the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.
The summary of the rights allegedly violated by the Respondent State are viz:

? The torture of the victims while in State custody, including electrical shocks, beatings, hanging from their
hands and legs and prolonged sensory deprivation violates the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or
15

degrading treatment enshrined in Article 5 of the Charter;

? The denial of essential safeguards necessary to give effect to that prohibition, such as access to counsel,
courts and medical personnel, and the use in court of evidence obtained through torture, themselves
amount to a violation of Article 5 of the Charter;

? The character, procedures and conduct of the Office of the State Security Prosecutor and of the Supreme
State Security Emergency Court violate the victims' rights to due process under Article 7(1) of the Charter
and the State's obligations to ensure the independence of the courts under Article 26;

? The denial of fair trial rights and the imposition of the death penalty which would constitute a breach of
the right to life, as protected by Article 4 and 5 of the Charter.
158. The Commission will accordingly proceed to analyze each of the Articles of the Charter alleged to
have been violated by the Respondent State
Alleged Violation of Article 5

159. The Complainants submit that the Respondent State violated Article 5 in that, the Victims were held
incommunicado and denied access to their families, lawyers and medical care by SSI agents. They State
that they were beaten, tortured, blindfolded and occasionally hung from the ceiling by their arms and legs in
painful positions by SSI agents who applied electrical shocks to several parts of their bodies.
160. Article 5 of the African Charter, reads, "Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity
inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and
degradation particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and
treatment shall be prohibited.
Article 42 of the 1971 Constitution of Egypt stipulates that:
"any citizen arrested, detained or whose freedom is restricted shall be treated in a manner concomitant with
the preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him..."84
161. In order to analyse the allegation of torture by the Victims, the African Commission will look at what
amounts to torture in accordance with the Charter and other international instruments. Article 60 of the
Charter has drawn inspiration from broader international law to deal with specific issues. Substantive
international jurisprudence and practice has therefore developed in recent years regarding the nature of the
prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and the obligations of states to protect its
citizens against such treatment.
162. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel or Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (CAT) has defined
torture as: "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted
on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,
punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or
intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when
such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public
official or other person acting in an official capacity."85
163. The African Commission will now seek to address issues as outlined in the submissions of the
Complainants viz:
(a) the Arab Republic of Egypt, through its State Security Intelligence force tortured and/or ill-treated the
victims; (b) the State, through its intelligence services, prosecutor's office and security court, denied the
Victims the essential safeguards against torture and ill-treatment, including prompt access to counsel, to a
court and to medical personnel, and has permitted the admissibility of "confessions" obtained through
torture in proceedings against them. (c) the State has failed to conduct an effective investigation into these
16

alleged acts of torture and ill-treatment and no diligent attempts have been made to hold anyone to
account.
164. The facts of torture as contained in the complaints is that the SSI agents subjected the victims to
repeated electrical shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging by the leg, binding and blindfolding aimed at their
complete disorientation.
165. The Respondent State on the other hand submit that the investigations carried out by the Public
Prosecutor established that it has conducted external check on the accused persons immediately when
they were brought before it and that it was confirmed that they were free from any external injuries. The
question therefore that would follow is, who then inflicted the injuries that were subsequently found on the
victims?
166. The victims' allegation is also consistent with the forensic reports which were eventually issued for
each of the victims. The FMA report, following the examination of the First Victim on 5 July 2005, nearly
nine months after his injuries were sustained, noted "healings" and "dark discolorations" on his right and left
forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint. The Second Report of the FMA of 27 May
2006, following examination of the Second and Third Victim also nearly nine months after their torture,
found that the Second Victim had a "darker intersecting discolorations" all over his back, as well as an
unhealed fracture in a left foot toe and that the Third Victim had dark discolorations in the chest, abdomen
and upper arms.86 However, in both cases the government examiners concluded that the long time lapse
between being examined and the injuries made it impossible to determine with certainty the reason,
manner or time of such injuries."87
167. The question therefore that begs the mind is who then is responsible for the dark colorations found on
the bodies of the Victims? Certainly this could not have been inflicted by the Victims themselves, especially
when it has been established that during all this time they were under the custody of the Respondent
State's agents.
168. It is a well established principle of international human rights law, that when a person is injured in
detention or while under the control of security forces, there is a strong presumption that the person was
subjected to torture or ill-treatment. As the European Court of Human Rights has recently noted: Where a
person is injured while in detention or otherwise under the control of the police, any such injury will give rise
to a strong presumption that the person was subjected to ill-treatment [...]. It is incumbent on the State to
provide a plausible explanation of how the injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under
Article 3 of the Convention [...].88
169. The African Commission wishes to state that under such circumstance, the burden now shifts to the
Respondent State to convince this Commission that the allegations of torture raised by the Complainants is
unfounded. The context of the Victims incommunicado detention and interrogation is such that available
evidence is necessarily limited. However, the allegations of torture and ill-treatment are supported by the
victim's independent testimonies of similar ill-treatment. Their allegations fit also with the fact that they were
held incommunicado, hidden from the outside world during the 6-9 months of pre-trial detention, and that
access to medical professionals was persistently denied until during trial itself.
170. In the present case, the Respondent State has made no attempt to give a satisfactory explanation of
how the injuries were sustained, or to take any steps to investigate and address the surrounding
circumstances. The trial court did nothing to follow up on questions raised in the FMA reports or the Victims'
testimonies.
171. In the light of the above the African Commission concludes that the marks on the victims evidencing
the use of torture could only have been inflicted by the Respondent State.
172. On the right to medical services, during detention, the African Commission and other international
bodies have recognized and emphasizes that such rights be provided "promptly". The Human Rights
Committee, in its General Comment No. 20, has observed that protection of the detainee from torture and
ill-treatment requires "prompt and regular access" to doctors.89 The General Assembly has repeatedly
underlined the importance of the right to prompt medical examination promptly following detention to
prevent abuse of detainees.
173. In the presence of allegations or possible indications of abuse, the importance of prompt access to
medical personnel becomes all the more critical. The Istanbul Protocol, a set of detailed guidelines on the
investigation of torture and ill-treatment elaborated by an independent group of experts in 1999, recalls that
"[t]he investigator should arrange for a medical examination of the alleged victim. The timeliness of such
medical examination is particularly important. A medical examination should be undertaken regardless of
the length of time since the torture, but if it is alleged to have happened within the past six weeks, such an
17

examination should be arranged urgently before acute signs fade."90
174. The Robben Island Guidelines in its section 20, urges State Parties to make sure that "all persons
who are deprived of their liberty by public prder or authority should have that detention controlled by
properly and legally constituted regulations. Such regulations should provide a number of basic safeguard,
all of which shall apply from the moment when they are first deprived of their liberty. These include:
a) The right that a relative or relative or other appropriate third person is notified of the detention;
b) The right to an independent medical examination;
c) The right of access to a lawyer; and
d) Notification of the above rights in a language which the person deprived of their liberty understand. [sic]
175. In the present case, the victims were not examined by doctors at any point during their pre-trial
detention. Even when they reported their torture and ill-treatment, they were still denied access to medical
personnel by the authorities.
176. Only when the allegations of torture were made for the second time during the trial itself did the Judge
order the examination of the Victims by the FMA. The forensic examination conducted by the authorities
plainly did not satisfy the obligations set out above, as it was carried out more than 6 months after the
Victims complained that they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment and was, therefore, ineffectual as a
method of prevention or investigation.
177. The African Commission therefore holds that the failure by the Respondent State to provide prompt
medical services to the victims whiles they were under detention violates the victims' rights to prompt
medical services whiles under custody.
178. The African Commission also notes that the victims were denied counsel during their detention,
including the critical interrogation sessions. In the Jamaican Case of Osbourne Wright and Eric Harvey v.
Jamaica, adopted on 27 October 1995, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has held that the
requirement that legal assistance must be made available to an accused faced with a capital crimes applies
not only to the trail and relevant appeals, but also to any preliminary hearing relating to the case.
179. The African commission, therefore, notes that there is no disputed that the victims were unrepresented
at the preliminary investigation stage, and notwithstanding the Respondents State's assertion that it is not
the responsibility of the State authorities to pay for such legal aid, it finds that it is axiomatic that legal
assistance be available in capital cases, at all stages of the proceedings, especially when there were
request from human rights lawyers to represent the victims. It should be understood by the Respondent
State that there a positive obligation on them to provide access to independent legal assistance under the
Charter, inherent in the international prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. The African Commission has
recognized the right to access to a lawyer as one of the "basic procedural safeguards for those deprived of
their liberty"91 and as one of the necessary safeguards against abuse during the pre-trial process.92
180. The link between the prevention of torture and the right to prompt access to a lawyer has likewise
been emphasised by other international human rights bodies. In its Resolution 61/153 of 2007, reaffirming
the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment,
the General Assembly stressed that permitting prompt and regular access to legal counsel constitutes an
"effective measure [...] for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and
punishment."93 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee has stated that the protection of detainees from
torture and ill-treatment "requires that prompt and regular access be given to [...] lawyers"94 and that the
use of prolonged detention without any access to a lawyer violates a number of provisions of the Covenant,
including Article 7.95
181. Human rights bodies have thus recognized that, for access to a lawyer to constitute an effective
protection against torture and ill-treatment, such access has to be "prompt" and regular.96 For example the
Human Rights Committee has recommended "that no one is held for more than 48 hours without access to
a lawyer",97 whilst the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has clarified that "[l]egal provisions prescribing
that a person shall be given access to a lawyer not later than 24 hours after he has been arrested usually
function as an effective remedy against torture, provided compliance with such provisions is strictly
monitored."98
182. Further, the right is to have access to a lawyer of one's choice, as recognized for instance in the UN
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers.99 For the right to counsel to be meaningful it must also comprise
the right to timely, effective and confidentially communicate with counsel.
183. In the instant matter, the obligation to permit access to counsel or independent legal advice was
breached, as detailed above. The African Commission is convinced that the Victims were not given access
18

during the critical early stage of detention, including interrogation sessions, when there is the greatest risk
of torture and ill-treatment. The African Commission's view is that right of a detainee to have prompt
recourse to a court is established as a matter of international law. It constitutes a vital aspect of the
prevention and deterrence of torture and other ill-treatment.
184. In this regard it is worth mentioning that in the Robben Island Guidelines, the African Commission has
recognized that the right to be brought promptly before a judicial authority constitutes an essential
safeguard against torture and ill-treatment,100 In its General Comment No. 2, the Committee Against
Torture expressed the view that the obligation to take measures to ensure the effective prevention of torture
implied a requirement that States should ensure "the availability to detainees and persons at risk of torture
and ill-treatment of judicial and other remedies that will allow them to have their complaint promptly and
impartially examined, to defend their rights, and to challenge the legality of their detention or treatment."101
185. This approach has been repeatedly endorsed by the General Assembly,102 and finds further support in
the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.103
186. As one of the inherent aspects of the protection of detainees from torture and ill-treatment, judicial
oversight of detention applies at all times, including times of national emergency, as noted by the
Inter-American Court:
"[...] even in emergency situations, the writ of habeas corpus may not be suspended or rendered
ineffective. [...] the immediate aim of this remedy is to bring the detainee before a judge, thus enabling the
latter to verify whether the detainee is still alive and whether or not he or she has been subjected to torture
or physical or psychological abuse. The importance of this remedy cannot be overstated, considering that
the right to humane treatment recognized in Article 5 of the American Convention on Human Rights is one
of the rights that may not be suspended under any circumstances."104
187. In this case the Respondent States' obligation to bring the victims promptly to an independent judicial
authority was breached. While they did appear before a prosecutor, the right guaranteed in law is to bring
them before a judicial authority that is independent of the authorities detaining, interrogating and ultimately
prosecuting them. They also had no meaningful opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of their detention,
due to lack of access to a court and to lawyers. Article 3 of the Emergency Law 50/1982 as amended,
stipulates that detainees or their representatives may appeal their arrest or detention orders within 30 days
after the orders are issued. However, in practice detainees often have little access to the appeal provided
for in law. The victims had no access to lawyers neither were they arraigned before a competent court
during to properly remand them to custody
188. The Respondent State, while arguing that the victims were allowed access to their families, failed to
challenge in specific terms the allegations that they were refused access to medical care. The allegation of
torture and more particularly the particulars of injuries sustained by the Victims as contained in the Forensic
Medical Reports were never challenged by the Respondent State.
189. The Respondent State has not refuted the allegations of torture or the harsh treatment to which the
victims were subjected to. The African Commission has in many of its decisions held that facts uncontested
by the Respondent State shall be considered as established.105 The fact that the victims were subjected to
repeated electric shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging, binding and blindfolding and denied access to
medical care violates their physical and psychological integrity. There was also no evidence whatsoever
pointing to violent action from the victims themselves nor has there been any reported escape attempt by
the victims to warrant holding them in such degrading and inhuman manner.
190. Article 5 prohibits not only torture, but also cruel inhuman or degrading treatment. This includes not
only actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but which humiliate the individual or
force him or her against his or her will or conscience. The African Commission therefore holds that the
action of the Respondent State constitutes a multiple violation of Article 5 of the African Charter.
Alleged Violations of Article 7 and 26

191. The Complainants contend that the victims right to fair trial were violated in that;
? they were tried by a Court that was not independent and impartial and whose decisions cannot be
appealed;
? their right to a counsel was not fully respected;
19

? confessions made under torture or ill-treatment were used by the Court; and
? they were denied the right of appeal.
192. The essential question that must be asked here is whether the trial of the Victims complied with the
provisions of Articles 7(1) and 26 of the African Charter.
193. Article 7 of the African Charter provides that: "Every individual shall have the right to have his cause
heard. This comprises:
a) The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as
recognized and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;
b) The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;
c) The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;
d) The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.
194. Article 26 on its part provides that: 'States Parties to the present Charter shall have the duty to
guarantee the independence of the courts and shall allow the establishment and improvement of
appropriate national institutions entrusted with the promotion and protection of the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by the present Charter'.
195. A combined reading of Articles 7 and 26 brings to the fore two core issues - having access to
appropriate justice and the other relating to the independence of justice system. These two issues
constitute the bedrock of a sound justice delivery system. The African Commission believes that the right to
a fair trial is analogous with the concept of access to appropriate justice and requires that one's cause be
heard by efficient and impartial courts106 .
196. Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter enshrines "the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an
impartial Court or tribunal." The requirement of impartiality in Article 7 is complemented by Article 26 of the
African Charter which imposes on States parties "the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts" in
their respective territories.
197. These obligations are captured in the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial where the
Commission has expounded on what should be required for an independent and impartial tribunal. Among
other criteria, the Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial state that:
- judicial bodies shall be established by law to have adjudicative functions to determine matters within their
competence on the basis of the rule of law and in accordance with proceedings conducted in the prescribed
manner;107
- there should not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process nor shall
decisions be subject to revision except through judicial review;108
- all judicial bodies shall be independent from the Executive branch109 and the government shall respect
that independence;110
- the process of appointments to judicial bodies shall be transparent;111
- the judicial body shall decide matters before it without any restrictions, improper influence, inducements,
pressure, threats or interference, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.112
198. Applying these fair trial principles to special tribunals, the African Commission has held that they
"violate Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter because their composition is at the discretion of the executive
branch.
199. The victims were tried before the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, whose competence and
procedures fall far short of the above standards. The Supreme State Security Emergency Court is an
exceptional court. It was established by the Emergency Law as a temporary court,113 although, like the
Emergency Law itself, it has been in force continually since 1981. The Emergency Law gives the Court the
primary competence of ruling on crimes perpetrated in violation of decrees issued by the President of the
Republic in application of the Emergency Law,114 but the President of the Republic may also, at his
discretion, refer any ordinary crime to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court.115 According to
Presidential Decree 1/1981 regarding the referral of some crimes to Emergency State Security Courts, all
20

felonies and misdemeanours against the Government's security or related to explosives shall be referred to
the State Security Emergency Courts, established under the Emergency Law.
200. In view of the above, the African Commission is of the view that the degree of control which the
President of the Republic exercises over the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the
State Security Court is antithetical to the notion of an independent and impartial judicial process. The law
itself provides, for example, for the President to exercise the following powers:
? The President may suspend a case before it is submitted to Supreme State Security Emergency Court or
order the temporary release of the accused person before referral of the case to the Supreme State
Security Emergency Court.116
? Decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency Court are final only when they're approved by the
President of the Republic, and cannot thereafter be challenged before any other court in Egypt.117
? The President of the Republic may commute, change, suspend or cancel such decisions. He may also
order the release of defendants118 or order the retrial of the case before another court.119
201. It most [sic] be pointed out that Supreme State Security Emergence Court is not part of the regular
criminal court structure in Egypt. Sentences passed by this court can only be reviewed by the office
responsible for ratifying its judgments, office of the President of the Republic who is also the ratifying
authority. The ratifying authority which is not a court of law, may mitigate the sentence or repeal it and,
once the sentences are upheld the convicts may only petition the President for an amnesty or mitigation in
accordance with the provisions of Article 149
× Article 149 The President of Republic shall have the right of granting amnesty or commute a sentence.
As for general amnesty, it can only be granted by virtue of a law.
of the Constitution.
202. The Respondent State, however, submitted that the State of Emergency Security Court which tried the
accused persons is a prosecuting court with limited functions according to the law and the objective criteria.
They further asserted that membership of this court comprises three experts (Judges who are members of
the judiciary. They also state that the trials and procedures in this case and in stages and phases were
carried out in public and in accordance with the law. It further argued that the criteria of fair trial adopted by
the international agreements on human rights were observed, and therefore, it is obvious from the above
and from the records of the proceedings of the court trials that two lawyers appeared during all the hearings
together with the first and the second accused persons and four lawyers representing the third complainant.
203. From the submissions of the Respondent State, the African Commission of the view that the
Respondent State does not appreciate the importance of an independent tribunal, especially one that is
responsible for trying victims charged with capital offences. The African Commission therefore reiterates
that the essence of a higher tribunal is that, it affords the victims the opportunity to have their case
re-examined on both law and facts by a judicial body. In this way the decision of the court below can be
tested. The omission of the opportunity of such an appeal therefore greatly deprives the victims of due
process.
204. In this regard the African Commission also wishes to make reference to the UN Basic Principle on the
Independence of the Judiciary. Those principles provide that every one shall have the right to be tried by
the ordinary courts or tribunals using established procedures. Tribunals that do not use the duly established
procedures of the legal process shall not be created to displace the jurisdiction belonging to the ordinary
courts or judicial tribunals. Therefore, it is the view of the African Commission that a tribunal cannot be said
to be independent when the implementation of its decision squarely vests on the executive branch of the
Government, in this case the Head of State. This has completely defeated the criteria envisaged in a
democratic state.
205. In Civil Liberties Organisation, and Others v Nigeria120 , the African Commission held that 'the
foreclosure of any avenue of appeal to competent 63 national organs in a criminal case attracting
punishment as severe as the death penalty clearly violates Article 7(1) (a)'. The African Commission
agrees with the Complainants that the fact that the decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency
Courts are not subject to appeal constitutes a de jure procedural irregularity and manifestly violates Article
7(1) (a) of the African Charter.
206. Therefore, the African Commission notes that in all cases, the independence of a court must be
judged in relation to the degree of independence of the judiciary vis-?-vis the executive. This implies the
21

consideration of the manner in which its members are appointed, the duration of their mandate, the
existence of protection against external pressures and the issue of real or perceived independence: as the
saying goes 'justice must not only be done: it must be seen to be done'.
207. The African Commission is of the view that the degree of control which the President exercises over
the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the State Security Court does not guarantee
an independent and impartial judicial process. In its view that amounts to executive interference in the
judicial process defeating the intent and purporse of Article 7(1) (d). The African Commission is therefore of
the view that the verdict of the Supreme State Security Emergency court did not offer guarantees of
independence, impartiality and equity and therefore constitutes a violation of the Article 7 of the African
Charter.121
208. In any event, it was the responsibility of the Respondent State to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut
the arguments that the court in its composition was independent and was capable of giving an impartial
ruling, and this the Respondent State has not done to the satisfaction of the African Commission. In the
absence of such rebuttal or facts that could convince the African Commission of the opposite view, it
cannot invalidate the submission by the complainants regarding the inexistence of a fair justice system.
209. The African Commission will look into the issue of the right to counsel of ones [sic] choice. This right
as enshrined in Article 7(1) (c) of the African Charter122 is an important right which underpins several
others, such as freedom from ill-treatment and the right to prepare a defence.123 In the Principles and
Guidelines on Fair Trial, the African Commission considered that in proceedings relating to criminal
charges, legal representation is the "best means of legal defence against infringements of human rights
and fundamental freedoms".124 Such right to counsel applies during all stages of any criminal prosecution
"including preliminary investigations in which evidence is taken, periods of administrative detention, trial
and appeal proceedings. Article 7 is explicit that the right is to counsel of the detainee or defendant's
choice. It comprises the right to timely and confidential consultations with that counsel.125 Where the
accused either had no access, or only restricted or delayed access, to lawyers, the African Commission
has found a violation of Article 7.1(c)126 .
210. In the instant case, none of the Victims had lawyers present at the critical early interrogation stage. It
is submitted by the Complainants and not refuted by the Respondent State that on 23 November 2004 a
group of human rights lawyers submitted a specific request to the Public Prosecutor's Office (registered
under number 16332) to legally represent a number of individuals, including the First Victim, whose names
had appeared in the local press as chief suspects in the Taba bombings' investigation. The lawyers
received no response. The First Victim was denied representation at interrogations for a period of 5 months
until 24 March 2005. The Second and Third Victims had no access to counsel until 26 March 2006, when
they first appeared in court.
211. Moreover, even at the beginning of the trial, all three were denied the opportunity to consult with
counsel privately, in order to prepare their defence. The lawyer client communication, as alleged by the
Complainants and not refuted by the Respondents, took place through bars of the court room, in the
presence of and within earshot security officials. The African Commission therefore finds that the complete
denial of access to counsel before their appearance in court and the restrictive access thereafter violated
the right to counsel and the right to a defence (see below) under Article 7(1) (c).127
212. Furthermore, in interpreting Article 7 of the African Charter, the African Commission has stated that
"any confession or other evidence obtained by any form of coercion or force may not be admitted as
evidence or considered as probative of any fact at trial or in sentencing."128 In Malawi African Association
V. Mauritania, this Commission has held that "any confession or admission obtained during incommunicado
detention shall be considered to have been obtained by coercion."129
213. These principles correspond with other international human rights norms, addressed in relation to
torture and ill-treatment, under which evidence and confessions obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment, cannot be used in judicial proceedings apart from for the purpose of prosecuting
the act of torture or ill-treatment itself.130
214. The African Commission makes reference to Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture (CAT). It
also notes that it has been accepted as inherent in international fair trial provisions comparable to Article 7
of the African Charter. The European Court of Human Rights for example has held that "the use of
evidence obtained in violation of Article 3 [prohibition against torture or ill-treatment] in criminal proceedings
raises serious issues as to the fairness of such proceedings. Incriminating evidence - whether in the form of
a confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of
treatment which can be characterized as torture should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt,
22

irrespective of its probative value."131
215. It notes that the principle can also be found in the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 which stipulates that
"if a confession is proved to have been made by a person under any ...forms of duress or coercion, it shall
be considered invalid and futile"132 .
216. Thus, where an individual alleges that a confession has been obtained by torture or ill-treatment, the
burden of proof then lies in this case on the state to demonstrate that the confession in question was freely
made. Although the Committee against Torture has affirmed in a number of cases that, "it is for the author
to demonstrate that her allegations are well founded",133 it nevertheless stressed in P. E. v. France that, "In
the light of the allegations that the statements at issue, which constituted, at least in part, the basis for the
additional extradition request, were obtained as a result of torture, the State party had the obligation to
ascertain the veracity of such allegations."134
217. In a similar vein, the Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment, reviewing two national decisions that adopted a somewhat different approach to
the standard of proof question,135 noted as follows:
"[...] the applicant is only required to demonstrate that his or her allegations of torture are well founded. This
means that the burden of proof to ascertain whether or not statements invoked as evidence in any
proceedings, including extradition proceedings, have been made as a result of torture shifts to the State.136
218. Accordingly, once a victim raises doubt as to whether particular evidence has been procured by
torture or ill-treatment, the evidence in question should not be admissible, unless the State is able to show
that there is no risk of torture or ill-treatment. Moreover, where a confession is obtained in the absence of
certain procedural guarantees against such abuse, for example during incommunicado detention, it should
not be admitted as evidence.
219. The victims in this case all raised allegations of torture and ill-treatment. These allegations are at least
consistent with the circumstances of their case, such as the incommunicado nature of their detention and
the reports of the FMA which, at a minimum, indicate a risk of ill-treatment. Despite these concerns, the
"confessions" were admitted as evidence and appear to have formed at least part of the basis of their
convictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The reliance on such evidence violates Article 7 of the
Charter.
220. The African Commission will now briefly address the matter of appeal. In this regard, the African
Commission notes that Article 12 of the Egyptian Emergency Law stipulates that "It is not allowed in any
form to appeal the decisions pronounced by State Security Courts." This law, and its application in practice,
violate Article 7(1)(a) of the Charter, which provides for "the right to an appeal to competent national organs
against acts violating the fundamental rights as recognised and guaranteed by conventions, laws,
regulations and customs in force."
221. According to the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial, the right to appeal should be
guaranteed in all States Parties and should provide "a genuine and timely review of the case, including the
facts and the law".137 The Commission has noted that States Parties should take steps to make appeals
mandatory in death penalty cases, confirming the heightened importance of fair trial guarantees where life
is at stake.138
222. The importance of appeal rights is also reflected in the Commission's jurisprudence. In Law Office of
Ghazi Suleiman v. Sudan, the Commission held that "the fact that the decisions of the military Court [was]
not subject to appeal [...] constitute[d] a de jure procedural irregularity."139 Concerning the right to appeal in
death penalty cases, the Commission found that "the foreclosure of any avenue of appeal to competent
national organs in a criminal case attracting punishment as severe as the death penalty clearly violates
[Article 7(1)(a) of the Charter]."140
223. By denying the victims the right to appeal the decision of the Supreme State Security Emergency
Court, the Arab Republic of Egypt has violated Article 7(1) (a) of the African Charter. It should be noted
that the imposition of the death penalty is not per se unlawful under the Charter or broader international
human rights law.
224. The African Commission therefore concludes that the victims' rights under Article 7 (1) (a), (b) and (c)
of the African Charter including their right to appeal, were violated.
225. The African Commission will now analyse the submissions of the parties on Article 4 of the Charter.
226. The Complainants aver that the imposition of the death penalty on the victims by a court, whose
composition is illegal and unconstitutional, such as the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, violates
the victims' right to life and would amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.
23

227. The Respondent State argues that trial as well as procedures adopted in this case satisfied the
requirement of fair trial as guaranteed by international norms and standard. They stated that the trials were
carried out in public and in accordance with the assurances provided by the law. They also state that the
victims were represented by lawyers of their choice during trial.
228. Article 4 of the African Charter provides that 'human beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be
entitled to respect for his life and the integrity of his person. No one shall be arbitrary deprived of this right'.
229. The victims were charged, inter alia, under Article 86 b (ii) and (iii) of the Egyptian Penal Code. This
law provides that the punishment for the crimes specified in those provisions is death penalty where "the
action of the offender leads to the death of the victim of the crime"141 or "the crime which occurred was the
object of the efforts or intelligence /contacts or involvement in committing it."142
230. The above law imposes a penalty on a particular crime in specified circumstances but did not provide
an avenue for a competent judiciary to evaluate the appropriate penalty, in light of all of the circumstances
of the case. The penalty is effectively mandated by law for certain categories of offences, with the President
empowered to decide not to apply that sentence if he so decides. This is at odds with the requirements of
right to life, as reflected in international legal practice.
231. The African Commission in the case of International Pen and Others (on behalf of Saro-Wiwa) v
Nigeria143 took the view that the execution and implementation of a death sentence emanating from a trial
which did not conform to Article 7 of the African Charter will amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.
Having held that the trial of the applicants offended Article 7 of the African Charter, it follows that any
implementation of the death sentence imposed on the applicants by the Supreme State Security
Emergency courts will therefore amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.
232. However after careful consideration of Articles 7 and 26 and the wordings of Article 4, the African
Commission is of the view that Article 4 of the Charter has not been violated. The victims are still under the
custody of the Respondent State, through a process that denied them due process and are not yet
executed.

Holding
233. For these reasons, the African Commission holds as follows:
(a) That the Respondent State - Republic of Egypt has violated the provisions of Articles 5, 7 (1) (a), (d)
and 26 of the African Charter;
(b) that there has been no violation of Article 4 of the African Charter;

The African Commission therefore calls on the Respondent State;
I. Not to implement the death sentences;
II. Calls on the Respondent State to adequately compensate the victims in line with international standard;
III. Reform the composition of the State Security Emergency Courts and ensure their independence;
IV. Take measures to ensure that its law enforcement organs particularly the police respect the rights of
suspects detained in line with Article 5 of the Charter;
V. Calls on the Respondent State to harmonize the State Security Emergency Laws with a view to bringing
it in conformity with the Charter and other international legislations and regional norms and standards
VI. Calls on the Respondent State to release the victims;
VII. Calls on the Respondent State to submit the African Commission within 180 days from the date of
receipt of this decision (in line with Rule 112(2) of the African Commissions Rules of Procedure) on the
measures taken to give effect to these recommendations.

Done in Banjul this 9th Extra-Ordinary Session held From 23 February to 3 March 2011.

made as a result of torture."
