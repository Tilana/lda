<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 6/19 on 
religious and cultural rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in 
which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report 
to the Council, at its next session, on the implementation of that resolution. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 6/19, the Council stressed that all policies and measures taken by Israel, 
the Occupying Power, to limit access of Palestinians to their holy sites, particularly in Occupied 
East Jerusalem, on the basis of national origin, religion, birth, sex or any other status were in 
violation of a number of human rights standards and resolutions and therefore should cease 
immediately. It also called upon Israel, the Occupying Power, to respect the religious and 
cultural rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to allow Palestinian worshippers unfettered 
access to their religious sites. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with resolution 6/19, the present report assesses legislative and policy 
measures taken by Israel that have had an adverse impact on the enjoyment of religious and 
cultural rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It focuses in particular on those measures 
that have limited the access of Palestinian residents in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (both 
Christians and Muslims) to religious sites located in the Territory, including East Jerusalem. 
The present report is not mandated to deal with the situation of religious and cultural rights in 
Israel or the issue of access of Palestinians to religious sites located in Israel. Nor does 
resolution 6/19 cover the issue of access of Israeli citizens to Jewish holy sites located in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory. A note setting out the scope of the report was submitted to the 
Council at its seventh session in March 2008.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>4. On 28 February 2008, in view of the preparation of the present report, notes verbales were 
sent to the Permanent Mission of Israel and the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), seeking 
comments and observations on the resolution by 4 April. The Permanent Observer Mission of 
Palestine submitted its reply on 2 April. Reference to the reply is included in the present report. 
No reply was received from the Permanent Mission of Israel. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Context 
</b></p>
<p>5. The international legal framework applicable to the exercise of religious and cultural rights 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory referred to in resolution 6/19 includes the following 
international instruments: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons 
in Time of War. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  A/HRC/7/77. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Freedom of religion or belief under the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights outlines the main elements of the exercise of 
freedom of religion or belief. Article 18 provides that everyone has the right &#8220;either alone or in 
community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, 
practice, worship and observance&#8221;. According to article 18 (1) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion includes freedom of &#8220;worship, 
observance, practice and teaching&#8221;,<b>2</b> which could be exercised &#8220;either individually or in 
community with others and in public or private&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>7. The freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion may be subject to certain limitations, envisaged in 
paragraph 18 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Such limitations 
must be &#8220;prescribed by law&#8221; and &#8220;necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of others&#8221;. The Human Rights Committee has emphasized 
that limitations imposed must not be applied in a manner that would vitiate the rights guaranteed 
in article 18. According to the Committee, paragraph 3 of article 18 is to be strictly interpreted: 
restrictions are not allowed on grounds not specified there, even if they would be allowed as 
restrictions to other rights protected in the Covenant, such as national security. Limitations may 
be applied only for those purposes for which they were prescribed and must be directly related 
and proportionate to the specific need on which they are predicated. Restrictions may not be 
imposed for discriminatory purposes or applied in a discriminatory manner.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>8. Freedom of movement, as set out in article 13 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is an 
important precondition for the exercise of many rights and freedoms, including the freedom 
to manifest one&#8217;s religion. According to article 12, paragraph 3, freedom of movement may be 
subject to certain restrictions; however these must be &#8220;consistent with the other rights recognized 
in the Covenant&#8221;. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  See Human Rights Committee, general comment 22, paragraph 4: &#8220;The freedom to manifest 
</p>
<p>religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching encompasses a broad range of 
acts. The concept of worship extends to ritual and ceremonial acts giving direct expression to 
belief, as well as various practices integral to such acts, including the building of places of 
worship, the use of ritual formulae and objects, the display of symbols, and the observance of 
holidays and days of rest. The observance and practice of religion or belief may include not only 
ceremonial acts but also such customs as the observance of dietary regulations, the wearing of 
distinctive clothing or head coverings, participation in rituals associated with certain stages of 
life, and the use of a particular language customarily spoken by a group. In addition, the practice 
and teaching of religion or belief includes acts integral to the conduct by religious groups of their 
basic affairs, such as the freedom to choose their religious leaders, priests and teachers, the 
freedom to establish seminaries or religious schools and the freedom to prepare and distribute 
religious texts or publications.&#8221;

</b>  Human Rights Committee, general comment 22, paragraph 8. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C. Cultural rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>9. Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that everyone &#8220;has the 
right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in 
scientific advancement and its benefits&#8221;. Article 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights includes the rights (a) to take part in cultural life; (b) to enjoy the 
benefits of scientific progress and its applications; and (c) to benefit from the protection of the 
moral and material interests. Furthermore, under paragraph 3 of article 15, States parties to the 
Covenant undertake to respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative 
activity. Under paragraph 4 of the same article, they recognize the benefits to be derived from 
the encouragement and development of international contacts and cooperation in the scientific 
and cultural fields. Through its reporting guidelines, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has provided further clarification of the content of article 15 of the Covenant.<b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Protection of religious freedom under the Fourth Geneva Convention 
</b></p>
<p>10. With regard to the rights of the civilian population during a period of occupation, article 27 
of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that the protected persons are entitled to respect for 
&#8220;their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs&#8221;. According to the 
authoritative commentary of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to that article, 
&#8220;religious freedom is closely connected with the idea of freedom to practice religion through 
religious observances, services and rites. Protected persons [&#8230;] in the occupied territory must be 
able to practise their religion freely, without any restrictions other than those necessary for the 
maintenance of public law and morals&#8221;.<b>5</b> The ICRC interpretation of the article further states that 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Revised general guidelines regarding the form and contents of reports to be submitted by 
</p>
<p>states parties under articles 16 and 17 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights E/C.12/1991/1. In particular, States are requested to provide information on 
(a) availability of funds for the promotion of cultural development and popular participation in 
cultural life; (b) the institutional infrastructure established for the implementation of policies to 
promote popular participation in culture; (c) promotion of cultural identity as a factor of mutual 
appreciation among individuals, groups, nations and regions; (d) promotion of awareness and 
enjoyment of the cultural heritage of national ethnic groups and minorities and of indigenous 
peoples; (e) Role of mass media and communications media in promoting participation in 
cultural life; (f) Preservation and presentation of mankind&#8217;s cultural heritage; (g) legislation 
protecting the freedom of artistic creation and performance; (h) professional education in the 
field of culture and art; and (i) other measures taken for the conservation, development and 
diffusion of culture. States are also required to report on measures taken to realize the right of 
everyone to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications, including those aimed at 
the preservation of mankind&#8217;s natural heritage and those taken to promote the diffusion of 
information on scientific progress. On the issue of international contacts and co-operation in the 
scientific and cultural fields, States are to report on measures taken for, i.a., participation by 
scientists, writers, artists and others involved in scientific research or creative activity, in 
international scientific and cultural conferences, seminars, symposiums, etc.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the measures of constraint should not affect the fundamental rights of the persons concerned.<b>6</b> 
It also underlines that these fundamental rights must be respected, even when measures of 
control are justified. Furthermore, article 58 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that the 
&#8220;Occupying Power shall permit ministers of religion to give spiritual assistance to the members 
of their religious communities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Applicability of the International Covenant on Civil and Political  
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and  
Cultural Rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention with regard 
to actions by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</b></p>
<p>11. With regard to the responsibilities of Israel under its international human rights treaty 
obligations with regard to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the International Court of Justice, 
in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, concluded that the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights were 
applicable.<b>7</b> The position of United Nations human rights treaty bodies mirrors that of the 
International Court of Justice, and affirms that, as a State party to international human rights 
instruments, Israel continues to bear responsibility for implementing its human rights 
conventional obligations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, to the extent that it continues to 
exercise jurisdiction in those territories.<b>8</b> The International Court of Justice also noted that the 
obligations of Israel under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
included &#8220;an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields 
where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities&#8221;.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the responsibilities of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as the 
Occupying Power under the Fourth Geneva Convention Concerning the Protection of Civilian 
</p>
<p>

</b>  ICJ Advisory Opinion paragraphs 102-113 (where ICJ concluded that the protection offered 
</p>
<p>by human rights conventions do not cease in cases of armed conflict and that the ICCPR, the 
ICESCR and the CRC are applicable in respect of individuals within its jurisdiction, even 
concerning those individuals under its jurisdiction outside its own territory). 
<b>8
</b>  An examination of the Concluding Observations of different UN treaty bodies confirms this 
</p>
<p>view: In its Concluding Observations of 2003, the Human Rights Committee (HRC) reiterated 
that the ICCPR provisions apply &#8220;to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories for 
all conduct by the State party&#8217;s authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment 
of rights enshrined in the Covenant&#8230;&#8221;. Similarly in its 2003 Concluding Observations, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) reaffirmed its view that &#8220;the State 
party&#8217;s obligations under the Covenant apply to all territories and populations under its effective 
control&#8221; (E/C.12/1/Add.90) CERD drew a similar conclusion in its Concluding Observations of 
March 2007 (CERD/C/ISR/CO/13, paragraph 32).

</b>  ICJ Advisory Opinion, paragraph 112. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Persons in Time of War, in its advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice concluded that 
the Fourth Geneva Convention was applicable in the Palestinian territories, which before the 
conflict in 1967 lay to the east of the Green Line and which, during that conflict, were occupied 
by Israel.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 6/19 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Observance of religious rights by Israel in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Religious demography 
</b></p>
<p>13. The total number of Palestinians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is 
approximately 3.8 million.<b>11</b> Islam is the religion of around 97 per cent of the Palestinian 
population, while Palestinian Christians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the 
Gaza Strip are estimated to range between 1.5 and 3 per cent.<b>12</b> The Occupied Palestinian 
Territory is also home to the small Samaritan religious community. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Access of Palestinians to religious sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</b></p>
<p><b>Closure regime 
</b></p>
<p>14. The elaborate Israeli regime of closures in the West Bank before and during the reporting 
period included the designation of roads as reserved primarily for Israeli nationals; settlements, 
many of which were constructed within areas with a traditionally high Palestinian population; 
and a system of physical obstacles, such as checkpoints, closed areas, road barriers, earth walls, 
roadblocks and trenches, etc.<b>13</b> These physical obstacles, combined with the Wall, flying 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  This fact has not been altered by Israel&#8217;s 2005 unilateral withdrawal of its forces from the 
</p>
<p>strip, as confirmed repeatedly since then by the United Nations General Assembly (most recently 
in its resolution 62/107 of 17 December 2007) and the United Nations Secretary General 
(notably in the Secretary-General&#8217;s message to the United Nations Seminar on Assistance to the 
Palestinian People, Amman, Jordan, 19 February 2008; and in the Secretary-General&#8217;s message 
to the opening of the 2008 session of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of 
the Palestinian People, New York, 14 February 2008).

<p>  Palestinian Bureau of Statistic, Preliminary results, 2007 Population, Housing and 
Establishment Census. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  Historically the number of the Palestinian Christian population has been higher however. 
According to British mandate census in 1931, Christian Palestinians were 9 per cent of the total 
population. 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  The relevant reporting period is 28 September 2007 (the day of the adoption of Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/19) to 4 April 2008. In its reply to the OHCHR request to provide 
comments and observations on resolution 6/19, the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine 
included detailed information regarding the road and settlement constructions around the city of 
Jerusalem which disrupt &#8220;the fabric of life of more than 250,000 Palestinians&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>checkpoints and a complex system of permits, formed an integrated, multifaceted system that 
restricted the movement of around 2.4 million Palestinians in the West Bank. According to the 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, approximately 38 per cent of the 
West Bank territory has been subsumed in Israeli settlements, outposts,<b>14</b> &#8220;closed areas&#8221; west of 
the Wall, closed military areas, Israeli-declared nature reserves or other Israeli infrastructure. As 
a result, the West Bank has been fragmented into a series of Palestinian enclaves. 
</p>
<p>15. The number of closures increased considerably prior to and during the reporting period. 
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported 367 closures in the West Bank 
in August 2005. In October 2007, there were 561 closures;<b>15</b> by 18 March 2008, the closures had 
increased to 612.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>16. Curfews introduced by the Israeli security forces also impeded freedom of movement. 
The total number of hours under curfew in the West Bank increased during the reporting 
period. While the total hours under curfew in 2006 and 2007 amounted to 696 and 873, 
respectively, in the period from January to March 2008, the total number of hours under curfew 
amounted to 776.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>17. The Gaza Strip remained isolated during the reporting period, with the exception of limited 
humanitarian imports and the movement of a small number of international visitors, patients and 
Israeli-approved Palestinians.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>18. During the period under review, travel in the West Bank was generally time-consuming, 
unpredictable and at times costly as a result of impediments imposed by the closure regime. 
These included permit restrictions, the requirement of travel by indirect routes, hours spent 
waiting at checkpoints and humiliating searches. Travellers were also often required to change 
their means of transport en route owing to obstacles blocking the road, such as earth mounds. 
This situation posed a significant challenge to inhabitants of the West Bank who wished to attend 
religious services in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The closure regime especially caused 
difficulties during the religious holidays of Ramadan and Christmas in 2007, when the number of 
people wishing to pass the checkpoints in order to attend religious services increased manifold. 
The delays and congestion experienced as a result of the closures were particularly detrimental 
for Muslims during Ramadan, who were frequently unable to reach their destination in time to

Owing to the long queues, many people were obliged to offer their prayers and break the fast 
at checkpoints.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>19. Meanwhile in Gaza, the closure prevented the inhabitants from worshipping at sacred sites 
such as al-Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, the Ibrahimi mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs, the 
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of Nativity and other holy places in Jerusalem and the 
West Bank. 
</p>
<p><b>The Wall 
</b></p>
<p>20. In 2001, the Government of Israel announced its intention to build a barrier to separate 
Israel from the West Bank. The current planned length of the most recently approved route of the 
Wall is approximately 723 kilometres. As at March 2008, approximately 57 per cent of the 
planned route had been constructed. 
</p>
<p>21. When completed, some 80 per cent of the Wall&#8217;s length will run inside the West Bank. 
Approximately 250,000 Palestinians reside in villages and towns that will be totally or partially 
surrounded by the Wall, and about 9.5 per cent of West Bank land will be isolated by it.<b>20</b> For 
Palestinians living in the closed area between the Wall and the Green Line, the Wall not only 
restricted their access to places of worship, but also affected their social relations, since family 
and friends on the &#8220;Palestinian side&#8221; required visitor permits to enter the closed areas, a fact 
which entailed significant distress for the population during times of particular religious and 
social importance, such as the Eid festivals, marriages and funerals. 
</p>
<p>22. Furthermore, prior to and during the reporting period, the construction of the Wall 
prevented access to, and endangered the preservation of, religious and cultural sites along its 
route or close by.<b>21</b> The Wall also further separated Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank. 
Only West Bank residents with special permits could pass on foot through the four main 
checkpoints open for Palestinians. Thus, access to holy sites in Jerusalem for both Muslims and 
Christians residing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip became increasingly problematic.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>23. In its advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice concluded that the Wall gravely 
infringed a number of fundamental rights of Palestinians residing in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory that could not be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national

<p>security and order.<b>23</b> The Court therefore concluded that Israel was obliged to put an end to the 
violation of its international obligations and that it should therefore dismantle the parts of the 
Wall situated within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It also concluded that Israel had the 
obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all natural and legal persons concerned. 
No steps were taken by Israel towards the fulfilment of these obligations during the reporting 
period. 
</p>
<p><b>Permit regime 
</b></p>
<p>24. The permit system imposed in the early 1990s continued to be applied to all Palestinian 
identity cardholders within the Occupied Palestinian Territory during the reporting period. 
Palestinian identity cardholders required a permit to enter East Jerusalem and Israel. The 
procedure for issuing permits was unclear, time-consuming and lacked transparency. For 
Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip, permits to enter Israel (and hence to travel to 
East Jerusalem or the West Bank) were very difficult to obtain, except in rare circumstances. 
Consequently, the permit system constituted a substantial impediment to access by Palestinian 
Muslims and Christians to their holy sites.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>25. On religious holidays, special permits were issued by the Israeli authorities. However, the 
number of worshippers declined dramatically before and during the reporting period. During 
Ramadan in 2005, some 150,000 worshippers were expected to attend the important last Friday 
of Ramadan prayer, but only 50,000 were permitted to do so. During Ramadan of 2006, 
attendance at Friday prayers showed a further sharp decrease compared to previous years.<b>25</b> 
During Ramadan in 2007, access was hampered to both the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and the 
Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. No Palestinians were permitted to attend the Friday prayers at the 
al-Aqsa mosque on the second Friday of Ramadan and access to the three other Friday 
communal prayers was restricted to Palestinian men over the age of 50 and women over 45. 
On one occasion during the second week of Ramadan, Israeli border police stationed at the 
Ibrahimi mosque closed the entrance, trapping several worshippers inside for two hours. At 
Lailat al-Qader, Israeli settlers threw rubbish at Palestinians who were trying to reach the 
Ibrahimi mosque to pray. Members of the Israel Defense Forces fired sound bombs inside the 
mosque grounds, interrupting prayers and creating chaos among the worshippers.<b>26</b>

<p>26. In general, restrictions on entrance to al-Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount varied during 
the reporting period. Sometimes only Palestinians over the age of 45 were permitted; at other 
times, only Jerusalem identity cardholders over the age of 50 were allowed entrance. At other 
times, restrictions permitted only residents of the Old City over the age of 50 to enter 
al-Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount. 
</p>
<p>27. Many Christian churches also experienced a significant decline in the number of 
worshippers attending services, as Palestinian Christians tended to avoid travelling because of 
the burdensome permit system and long waits experienced at checkpoints. While permits were 
often granted for special Christian holidays, it was generally difficult to obtain permits to attend 
regular services. Jerusalem was frequently closed, even to permit holders. In 2007, 37 days of 
closure were reported.<b>27</b> Holders of permits for specific Christian holidays were usually allowed 
access to Jerusalem, even when access to the city was restricted to holders of work permits. 
</p>
<p>28. Palestinian Christian clergy and religious staff experienced increasing difficulties in 
serving their parishes owing to the obstacles connected with travelling between various religious 
locations, both before and during the reporting period. At times, religious congregations 
reportedly preferred to appoint a foreign priest to serve their communities, as foreign nationals 
were generally not subject to the same travel restrictions as Palestinian clergy. However, 
Christian foreign clergy working in Gaza and the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) 
encountered difficulties in obtaining or renewing their Israeli visas. In October 2007, the 
Ministry of the Interior of Israel reportedly declared that it had cancelled all re-entry visas for 
Christian clergy in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Those who wished to return to their 
parishes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory were required to apply for new entry visas in 
Israeli consulates abroad, which often entailed a lengthy waiting time. Some clergy refused to 
leave the Occupied Palestinian Territory, fearing that they might not be allowed back; others 
who did leave were turned back by border officials. It was further reported that there was a usual 
practice of granting 90-day tourist visas to priests and nuns, thus compelling the clergy to travel 
to neighbouring countries and re-apply for a new tourist visa at regular intervals, thereby 
interrupting their work. This created considerable obstacles for the Christian clergy in serving 
their often scattered communities and in performing their religious duties.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>29. Regarding the opportunity to travel abroad for religious or other purposes, West Bank and 
Gaza Palestinians were generally not allowed to use the Israeli airport in Tel Aviv. In order to 
perform <i>Hajj</i>, they had to obtain a Saudi Hajj visa and travel by land to Amman (for West Bank 
residents) and to Egypt (for Gaza residents). 
</p>
<p><b>Identity cards 
</b></p>
<p>30. Four kinds of identity cards are issued by the Israeli authorities to Palestinians 
over 16 years of age: (a) for West Bank residents; (b) for Gaza residents; (c) for Jerusalem 
residents; and (d) for Israeli citizens. Palestinian holders of Jerusalem identity cards are

<p>permanent residents of Israel. Holders of West Bank and Gaza resident identity cards require a 
permit to enter Jerusalem. The permits indicate the length of stay, the duration of the permit and, 
in many cases, specify the checkpoint through which the bearer is permitted to cross. Since 2000, 
these permits have become increasingly difficult to obtain. It is further estimated that some 
50,000 Palestinians do not hold any identification at all.<b>29</b> They are therefore regarded by the 
Israeli authorities as illegally staying in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and consequently are 
not authorized to visit holy places in the Territory or abroad. 
</p>
<p>31. The West Bank and Gaza identity cards indicate whether the cardholder is Muslim or 
Christian, with no possible alternatives. The identity cards of those who are not believers, for 
example, indicate that they have the same religion as their parents; in contrast, cards of 
Jerusalem residents and Israeli citizens do not contain information about religion. Following her 
visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in January 2008, the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief stated that, in her opinion, &#8220;to indicate the religious affiliation on 
official identity cards carries a serious risk of abuse, which has to be weighed against the 
possible reasons for disclosing the holder&#8217;s religion&#8221;.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Consequences of the closure regime for access to religious sites, notably in Hebron 
and Nablus 
</b></p>
<p>32. The above-mentioned closure regime created a serious impediment to travel for 
Palestinians, and consequently denied the majority of inhabitants of all religions of the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory access to many places of worship. The difficulties facing Palestinians in 
their attempt to have access to religious sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory were of a 
particularly severe nature in the cities of Hebron and Nablus during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>33. Hebron, the second largest city in the West Bank, is the location of the Ibrahimi 
mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs - considered to be the burial place of Abraham/Ibrahim, Isaac, 
and Jacob and their wives Sarah, Rebecca and Leah - and is of great significance for many 
Muslims, Jews and Christians. 
</p>
<p>34. Since 1967, more than 24 Israeli settlements have been established in the Hebron 
governorate, creating a ring around its urban centre and fragmenting the outlying lands. 
Between 1979 and 1983, Israeli settlers established four settlements inside the Old City of
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>29
</b>  In terms of the reasons for the situation, some have had their IDs revoked by Israeli 
</p>
<p>authorities; others have been refused family reunification applications since 2000, with the 
exception of a few thousand that have been issued in the last couple of years (OCHA, 
East Jerusalem, January 2008, p. 23).

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Hebron itself. Some 600 settlers live there protected by 1,500 soldiers of the Israel 
Defense Forces, entailing severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of the 
city&#8217;s 165,000 Palestinian inhabitants. This situation has had an enormous economic impact 
on the city centre and has induced many Palestinians to abandon the Old City.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>35. During the reporting period, Israeli authorities left only one entrance only for local 
residents and visitors of at least six main routes that lead to the section of the Ibrahimi 
mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs reserved for Muslim prayers. This entrance is a checkpoint for 
the Israel Defense Forces, equipped with a metal detector. Muslims who wished to attend 
religious services in the mosque had to approach from the Kasaba area of the Old City. 
Therefore, even inhabitants who lived close to the mosque in the city were forced to travel a 
distance between 1 and 15 kilometres in order to pass through this entrance. Driving a 
Palestinian vehicle into the Old City was prohibited (except for ambulances, fire engines or 
municipality vehicles which needed prior coordination to have access to it). In addition, there 
were three checkpoints along the way leading to the entrance of the mosque, in the form of 
rotating metal bars, metal detectors and physical checks. Thus, attending prayer in the mosque 
implied, for most Hebron residents, a long trip, a subsequent walk on foot and passage through 
three to five checkpoints (depending on the route taken), which tended to be a time-consuming 
and degrading process. 
</p>
<p>36. Muslim worshippers were prevented from entering the grounds surrounding the Ibrahimi 
mosque/Tombs of the Patriarchs except for 10 days each year; on all other days, the area was 
reserved for the settlers. At the time of writing, the Israeli authorities had reserved 60 per cent of 
the Ibrahimi mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs for Jewish worshippers and 40 per cent for 
Muslims. During Jewish holidays, the Israel Defense Forces closed it completely to Muslims. 
The Israeli authorities also regularly prevented the call to prayer (especially the <i>Maghreb </i>and 
<i>Isha</i> prayers) when Jews were praying in their section. Waqf authorities reported that the call to 
prayer was prevented on an average of 50 to 60 times per month. They also voiced their concern 
over the fact that the settlers regularly use the yards of the Ibrahimi mosque/Tomb of the 
Patriarchs for celebrations, such as weddings or Bar Mitzvahs). 
</p>
<p>37. Nablus, located 65 kilometres from Jerusalem, is the largest Palestinian city in the 
West Bank. Its population is predominantly Muslim, with Christian and Samaritan minorities. 
The Old City is replete with major religious sites, including 9 historic mosques, 19 Islamic 
monuments and a seventeenth-century church.<b>32</b> Christian, Jewish and Muslim holy places, such 
as Jacob&#8217;s Well and Joseph&#8217;s Tomb, are also situated there. 
</p>
<p>38. At the time of writing, Nablus was encircled by 14 Israeli settlements and 26 settlement 
outposts. The settlements were connected to each other by a series of roads, used primarily by

<p>settlers, that stretch around the city and across the Nablus governorate. The roads are in turn 
linked to 10 checkpoints, including 7 encircling Nablus city. All Palestinians going in and out of 
Nablus were required to cross these checkpoints. In addition, more than 70 obstacles installed by 
the Israel Defense Forces blocked the road junctions and physically prevented Palestinian traffic 
from reaching the roads that were used primarily by the settlers.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>39. In April 2007, only 10 per cent of Nablus buses (22 of 220) and 7 per cent of Nablus 
taxis (150 of 2,250) had permits to use the checkpoints around the city. Only 50 private 
Palestinian cars were permitted to use the checkpoints.<b>34</b> The heavy restrictions on the freedom 
of movement in the reporting period had a serious impact on the capacity of the Nablus 
population to have access to places of worship situated within the governorate and in Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Preservation of religious sites 
</b></p>
<p>40. A number of events affecting the preservation of religious sites in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory were reported during the period. 
</p>
<p>41. An excavation project in the area of the Arab neighbourhood of Silwan in occupied 
East Jerusalem, a few hundred metres away from al-Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, raised 
concern among the Palestinian population and archaeological experts that this major religious 
site might be damaged.<b>35</b> Although Israeli authorities claimed that the excavation would take 
place at a certain distance from the compound, residents erected a protest tent nearby and filed a 
lawsuit, expressing fears for the stability of the buildings above and arguing they had not been 
consulted on a dig which they alleged ran beneath their homes. On 18 March 2008, an Israeli 
court ordered a halt to the project while it considered the case.<b>36</b> At the time of writing, the case 
was still pending before the court. 
</p>
<p>42. During the night of 1 January 2008, the historic mosque of al-Hamadiyya in the town of 
al-Khader near Bethlehem was set alight, allegedly by Israeli settlers.<b>37</b> Reportedly, settlers

The remains of the original mosque building are believed to be 700 years old. An Israeli 
investigation had opened but no charges had been brought against any suspect at the time 
of writing.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p>43. The decision of the Israeli authorities to demolish the al-Omari mosque in Umm Tuba, 
a small village 4 kilometres south-west of Jerusalem, in February 2008, provoked protests. 
The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem condemned the decision, as did the Islamic Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>44. Furthermore, both before and during the reporting period, the Israeli authorities reportedly 
raised bureaucratic obstacles to the efforts of the Waqf authorities to carry out even minor 
repair and maintenance works in al-Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount related to the normal usage 
of the premises. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Religious, charitable or humanitarian institutions or schools 
</b></p>
<p>45. As noted above, the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion as set out in article 18 (1) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights includes the freedom to establish 
seminaries or religious schools.<b>41</b> In the Occupied Palestinian Territory, several Islamic 
charitable institutions and schools intended to assist the most needy Palestinian individuals and 
families. Run as non-profit organizations, they were independent from Government authority and 
relied on donations or voluntary assistance to carry out their work. 
</p>
<p>46. In February 2008, the Israel Defense Forces raided a number of buildings and schools run 
by Hebron Islamic Charity, one of the largest charity bodies in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, and handed over military orders for their closure and confiscation of property. 
These actions risked depriving thousands of orphans and other children in need of the 
education and shelter provided by Hebron Islamic Charity.<b>42</b> Israeli authorities claimed that

<p>  Furthermore, according to the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the right to freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion or belief shall include the right to establish and maintain appropriate 
charitable or humanitarian institutions. Moreover, the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 6/37 of 14 December 2007 urged all States to &#8220;ensure that, in accordance with 
appropriate national legislation and in conformity with international human rights law, the 
freedom of all persons and members of groups to establish and maintain religious, charitable or 
humanitarian institutions is fully respected and protected&#8221; (paragraph 9 (h)).

</p>
<p><b>B.  Observance of cultural rights by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Effects of the closure regime on the enjoyment of cultural rights 
</b>47. During the reporting period, the above-mentioned restrictions on freedom of movement 
limited the possibilities for Palestinians to enjoy the right to participate freely in the cultural life 
of the community and to enjoy the arts, as provided for in article 15 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to fully realizing the right of everyone to take part in 
cultural life &#8220;shall include those necessary for the conservation, the development and the 
diffusion of science and culture&#8221; (article 15 (2) of the Covenant). 
</p>
<p>48. Without access to cultural and artistic institutions and communication between 
members of a community, aspects of cultural practice and tradition can be lost or severely 
impaired. Many cultural and social activities take place away from the local area. For culture to 
thrive and develop, there must be unhindered communication between, and the involvement of, 
all groups and individuals in society. The closure regime restricted the access of Palestinians to 
places of cultural significance and locations where cultural events were held. If Palestinian 
cultural events were to be organized, they needed to be held separately in the West Bank, Gaza 
and East Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p>49. As a consequence, all forms of cultural and educational contacts and exchange, such as 
theatre, cinema, fine arts and music, were limited inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
This included cultural exchanges with the countries of the region, as restrictions on the right 
of Palestinians to leave and re-enter the Occupied Palestinian Territory hampered their 
participation in cultural events organized in other States. Similarly, owing to visa restrictions 
for citizens of Arab countries, faculties of fine arts, music and other cultural educational 
institutions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory were unable to invite visiting scholars, lecturers 
and art performers from neighbouring countries to benefit from their common cultural heritage 
and language. 
</p>
<p>50. The importation of Arabic language books was subject to restrictions. Several copies of 
each book had to be provided for review by the Israeli authorities in order to obtain import 
approval. This procedure impeded especially the import of specialized literature used by a 
limited number of readers. The traditional Ramallah Arab book fair, which had been 
discontinued since 2000, was held again for the first time in 2005, but owing to the burdensome 
importing procedure, the organizers indicated that they did not intend to repeat the event in 
the future. 
</p>
<p>51. Another implication of the restrictions on freedom of movement for Palestinians in the 
West Bank and Gaza was the lack of access to their historic and cultural heritage. Palestinians, 
notably the younger generation, were prevented from visiting renowned places of historical or 
cultural interest in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, although they were accessible to 
international visitors. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>52. At their regular meeting, in November 2007, the ministers of culture of the League of 
Arab States declared Jerusalem the Capital of Arab Culture for 2009, a title awarded annually to 
an Arab capital city. On 25 March 2008, Palestinian organizers planned to hold an event at the 
Palestinian National Theatre in East Jerusalem to announce the winner of an art contest for 
designing a logo for the cultural campaign. When they arrived, the doors were locked and the 
Israeli police were standing outside, reportedly with a warrant from the Ministry of Internal 
Security banning the event.<b>43</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Preservation of cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>53. Inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory there are reportedly an estimated 10,000 
archaeological sites and features dating from a number of different civilizations.<b>44</b> This 
extraordinary cultural diversity requires careful maintenance so that its unique character 
is preserved. 
</p>
<p>54. The Palestinians have, however, been deprived of the right to manage, take proper care of 
and benefit from this rich historic and cultural heritage. According to UNESCO, territorial 
fragmentation and restricted mobility has impaired the capacity of the Palestinian Authority to 
control and monitor the condition of cultural sites across the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
Furthermore, the reliance on international donors for heritage conservation has not contributed 
to the establishment of a stable and sustainable conservation sector, which could be invaluable 
to the future socio-economic life of Palestinians.<b>45 </b>In addition, it was reported that, during 
the period under review, no positive action was taken by Israeli authorities to ensure the 
preservation of archaeological and historical sites and objects in East Jerusalem and in the areas 
of the West Bank under Israeli administrative jurisdiction. 
55. Since 1967, Israel has undertaken numerous activities that have had a negative impact on 
religious and historic sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, ranging from demolitions 
and excavations to road construction and the building of new structures.<b>46</b> By a military order 
dated 18 September 2007, Palestinian lands of the al-Khader and Artas villages were 
appropriated for the ongoing construction of the Wall. According to media reports and as

<p>  Buildings of historical, cultural and religious value have been damaged or destroyed in for 
instance Nablus, Hebron, Bethlehem and East Jerusalem. The destruction and damage 
caused to the cultural heritage in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was unanimously deplored 
by the World Heritage Committee in 2002 (26COM 6.1 - Protection of the Cultural Heritage 
in the Palestinian Territories, adopted by the World Heritage Committee at its 26th session 
on 24-29 June 2002). </p>

<p>indicated in the map of the military order, the area where the new section will be constructed 
might also lead to the demolition of Kherbet &#8216;Alia (&#8216;Alia Hamlet), a site that features the remains 
of a Roman town, mosaic flooring, water channels and rock-carved tombs, located in Artas 
village.<b>47</b> During the reporting period, Israeli authorities still refused to grant permission to the 
Hebron Rehabilitation Committee to renovate 44 houses in the Old City of Hebron, reportedly 
because of their close proximity to Israeli settlements. 
</p>
<p>56. The unique cultural, architectural and historic sites of the Gaza Strip, which include 
Roman mosaics, a seventh-century Islamic mosque and a fifth-century Greek Orthodox church, 
were also at risk of natural decay owing to lack of conservation and preservation efforts and to 
damage caused during violent clashes. Reportedly, many objects of archaeological value were 
kept in private houses in an attempt to ensure better protection, however this practice may further 
increase the risk of damage or permanent loss. 
</p>
<p>57. On a positive note, a working group of some 50 Israeli and Palestinian archaeologists is 
reportedly preparing an agreement on Israeli-Palestinian cultural heritage. The agreement 
would reportedly be based on the assumption of a two-State solution and peaceful interaction. 
The archaeological professionals on both sides have agreed that the national territories of Israel 
and Palestine constitute a unified archaeological landscape divided by political borders. Bearing 
in mind the fact that archaeological resources are not renewable, the members of the working 
group share the opinion that both sides hold a special responsibility for the preservation of local 
archaeological heritage, as its significance extends far beyond national borders.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>58. During the reporting period, the measures adopted by the Government of Israel to restrict 
freedom of movement of both people and goods in the Occupied Palestinian Territory severely 
impeded the population&#8217;s access to religious sites, notably in Jerusalem, cultural exchanges and 
events. The justification for the closure regime repeatedly cited by the Israeli authorities was the 
need to provide security and protection to all people within its jurisdiction.<b>49 </b>While the security 
of the population is undoubtedly an important consideration, the relevant measures should be

<p>59. International humanitarian law requires that the Occupying Power permit ministers of 
religion to give spiritual assistance to their religious communities. In this regard, Israel should 
take the necessary measures to ease existing restrictions on local and foreign clergy and 
allow unhampered movement and access for spiritual leaders to communicate with members of 
their faith. 
</p>
<p>60. The existing rules governing the importation of Arabic literature to the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory limit the capacity of Palestinians to exercise their right to take part in 
cultural life by effectively restricting the opportunity to exchange knowledge and experiences 
and take part in the cultural achievements of other peoples of the region with whom they share 
language and culture. The Government of Israel should consider revisiting these rules to assess 
their proportionality. 
</p>
<p>61. The freedom to establish seminaries or religious schools and religious, charitable or 
humanitarian institutions should be fully respected and protected. While restrictions on such 
institutions might be introduced when necessary to protect public safety, order, health, morals or 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, any such restrictions must be prescribed by law, 
applied only for those purposes for which they were prescribed and be directly related and 
proportionate to the specific need for which they are predicated. 
</p>
<p>62. As Occupying Power, Israel bears responsibility for the preservation of the cultural and 
religious heritage in the Occupied Palestinian Territory under international law, and should take 
positive measures to preserve this heritage and refrain from action which could negatively affect 
the sites.

</b>  As stated by Ms. Asma Jahangir, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Human Rights Council, on 27 January in Jerusalem at the end of her visit to 
Israel and the OPT (20-27 January 2008): &#8220;A major issue of concern for my mandate is the 
restricted access to holy places. Muslims and Christians are impeded from worshipping at some 
of their most holy places in the world due to an elaborate system of permits, visas, checkpoints 
and the Barrier. While the Israeli Government informed me that these restrictions are necessary 
for security reasons, I would like to emphasize that any measure taken to combat terrorism must 
comply with the States&#8217; obligations under international law, including freedom of religion or 
belief. These intrusive restrictions strike me as disproportionate to their aim as well as 
discriminatory and arbitrary in their implementation.&#8221;
