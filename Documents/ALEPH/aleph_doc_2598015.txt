REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Corporate

In May 2016, at ABx’s AGM, all resolutions put to the meeting were passed on a show of 
hands. Approval given by shareholders to issue 662,423 shares to the Non-Executive directors 
in lieu of cash consideration for their services
  Group cash balance was $2.9 million as at 31 August 2016.  
  Number of shareholders grows to approximately 2,800.
Operations & Exploration 
Bald Hill Bauxite Project.  ABx’s 1st operating mine
As  at  31  January  2016,  ABx  suspended  production  at  the  Company’s  first  mine,  Bald  Hill  bauxite 
project in northern Tasmania due to an oversupply of bauxite from Malaysia into the China market. 
ABx  had  40,000  tonnes  of  high  quality  bauxite  stockpiled  at  Bell  Bay  port  ready  for  shipping  to 
customers.
Port Stockpile Completely Sold.  New shipments being assembled at mine site
During  the  first  half  of  2016,  ABx  identified  new  markets  other  than  the  Chinese  metallurgical 
bauxite market and sold the 40,000 tonnes stockpile as cement-grade bauxite.  Furthermore, sales 
of fertiliser grade bauxite have continued to grow at moderate tonnages in a seasonal agricultural 
demand cycle.
ABx reopened the Bald Hill bauxite project ahead of schedule on 4 August 2016, in conjunction with 
its  mine  contractors,  Stornoway,  to  continue  with  routine  rehabilitation  and  to  commence 
assembling the next 3 bauxite lots for sale from existing mine stockpiles, including a large ship load, 
planned  for  shipment  in  late  2016.    The  Company  is  currently  in  contact  with  several  repeat 
business  customers  and  customers  seeking 
long-term  contracts  that  will  underpin  the 
recommencement of full-scale mine production from Bald Hill and may justify and early start-up of 
a second mine nearby at Fingal Rail.
ABx  bauxite  is  a  dust  free  aggregate,  ideal  for  road,  rail  and  sea  transport  and  is  very  stable  in 
stockpiles.  ABx  bauxite  is  rigorously  processed  by  Stornoway  contractors  at  the  Bald  hill  mine, 
carefully transported pit to port by TasRail and efficiently managed at Bell Bay port by Qube Ports.

Figures 1 to 7 show the 
simple mining, screening and 
high-standard logistics from 
the mine to the ship.  As sale 
tonnages grow, this will 
become cost-competitive 
with larger bauxite projects 
which are usually in less well 
serviced locations.

ABx and its contractors are assembling bauxite stockpiles for a new customer that has satisfactorily 
tested the ABx product. ABx is also in discussions with several customers to conclude long-term sale 
contracts  that  will  underpin  the  opening  new  bauxite  mines  in  addition  to  the  Bald  Hill  Bauxite 
Project.

TasTech Technology can increase revenue & further reduce market risk
The core objective of TasTech is to extract 3 constituent bauxite types from Tasmanian bauxite:
1.  High grade, ultra-cleaned metallurgical-grade bauxite for the aluminium industry;
2.  Cement-grade bauxite for the manufacture of certified, high specification cement; and,
3.  Fertiliser-grade bauxite for the fertiliser industry.  
 
The technology involves 3 steps:
1.  A specific mining process to pre-prepare the broken bauxite ore for TasTech processing;
2.  During  a  simple,  specific  screening  and  handling  process,  the  bauxite  naturally  breaks  into
lumps that each have their own separate chemistry and physical properties;
Lumps are separated by low-cost physical processes into the 3 separate bauxite types listed above.
3. 
 
Proof-of-Concept Achieved
Table  1  and  Figure  8  shows  the  natural  grouping  of  lump  qualities  after  TasTech  technology  is 
applied  under  ideal  conditions.    This  recent  fundamental  testwork  is  proof  of  concept  but 
operational practicalities and customer requirements will change product specifications.

Exploration
Significant Resource Increase at Fingal Rail Bauxite Project to 6 million tonnes
ABx has announced a significant increase in the cement-grade bauxite resources at the Fingal Rail 
project located 14kms north of Bald Hill Bauxite Mine (see ASX release dated 25 August 2016).


Cement-grade bauxite resources for the Fingal Rail Bauxite Project totalled 6.3 million tonnes 1 
which is a 5-fold increase compared with its maiden resource estimate of 1.18 million tonnes
Fingal  Rail  is  considered  the  most  likely  second mine  for  ABx  and  would  be  operated  by  the 
same operating team that is working on the Bald Hill Mine
  When long-term sale contracts are finalised, ABx will expedite development of Fingal Rail which 
holds substantial tonnages of cement-grade bauxite and is located immediately adjacent to the 
rail line (see Figures 11 & 12)



90% of Fingal Rail resources meet saleable grade in its raw state but it is anticipated that most 
of the bauxite production from Fingal Rail Bauxite Project will be dry-screened into a range of 
quality-assured product types to suit the specific requirements of each customer 
Total Tasmanian bauxite resources now exceed 12 million tonnes (an increase of 33%) 1
The upgrade to Fingal Rail bauxite resources increase ABx’s total resource base for all regions 
in Eastern Australia to 124 million tonnes, of which 12 million tonnes are in Tasmania
Marketing: Offtake Cooperation Agreement in place
ABx has executed a long-term offtake cooperation agreement with Rawmin Mining and Industries 
Pvt Ltd (Rawmin) of Mumbai, India.  The Offtake Agreement runs for 5 years and covers all bauxite 
produced  by  the  Company  out  of  Tasmania.    The  Offtake  Agreement  provides  for  Rawmin  to 
purchase a total of up to 4.7 million wet metric tonnes of bauxite over the 5 year period.
The Offtake Agreement further provides for blended shipments of ABx and Rawmin bauxites on a 
profit  sharing  basis  for  any  blending  profits  achieved.    ABx  and  Rawmin  are  currently  working 
together on a possible sale of metallurgical grade bauxite to a major non-Chinese refinery.

Chinese Metallurgical Bauxite Market to 31 July 2016 Remains Flat

July  tonnages  of  3.63Mt  are  49%  lower  than  December  2015  and  are  lower  than  China’s 
consumption rate.
  Malaysian tonnages down 96% on December 2015 to only 0.15Mt but is still a threat to market-
dump again
  Guinean Bauxite keeps flooding into China: 0.87Mt at a remarkably low US$54.74/t CIF price 
 

Indian Bauxite supply ceased as Chinese refineries buy Guinean bauxite instead 
Australian bauxite is dominating at 2.1Mt or 59% of the total, mainly from Rio’s Weipa and Gove 
mines but also a trial shipment by Alcoa from its WA mines. 
Average metallurgical bauxite import price remained flat at US$48.33 per tonne CIF China.

CEMENT GRADE BAUXITE DEMAND IS GROWING:
When cement kilns convert  from coal to gas fuel, they must  also replace the supply  of Al2O3  and 
some Fe2O3 that coal ash previously supplied.  ABx can now provide both Al2O3 and Fe2O3 in a tailor-
made single bauxite product which processes superbly through the cement kilns and makes extra-
strong, corrosion-resistant cement, stops kiln blockages, reduces fuel consumption and saves wear 
on the kiln.
Medium-Term Marketing Strategy
Until  metallurgical  bauxite  markets  stabilise,  ABx  will  focus  on  sales  of  Cement-Grade,  Fertiliser-
Grade  and  other  non-metallurgical  bauxite markets,  with  an emphasis  on customers that  require 
strict Quality Control and assured technical specifications.  Overall, the demand for bauxite cement 
is growing world-wide – as is the demand for fertiliser-grade bauxite as demand for fertiliser grows 
in all agricultural areas across Australia and internationally.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Environmental Code of Practice for Bauxite Mineral Exploration, adopted 1 March 2010
The  Company  is  committed  to  conducting  its  exploration  programs  by  following  industry  best 
practice in accordance with published government guidelines and codes.
The  following  policy  is  specific  to  bauxite  exploration  on  the  Company’s  east  Australian  bauxite 
province.
Access to Land
to
the
commencement  of  any  work,
Prior 
contact  with 
landholders/leaseholders and discusses the general aims and types of work likely to be conducted. 
Discussion with landowners, leaseholders and Native Title Claimants is ongoing. It commences prior 
to any work being conducted and continues throughout the program and beyond the cessation of 
exploration work.
the  Company  makes
The  Company  establishes  conditions  of  access  with  landholders  and  where  practicable,  signs  a 
written access agreement that sets out conditions and includes a schedule of agreed compensation 
payments.  The  Company  endeavours  to  provide  landholders  with  ample  warning  prior  to 
commencing any work and landholders are kept informed upon commencement, during and upon 
completion of an exploration program.
Type of Land
The  type  of  land  is  determined  and  its  inhabitants  are  assessed  to  identify  areas  of  particular 
environmental concern including identification of sensitive areas or areas prone to erosion, water 
catchment, heritage sites, and areas home to vulnerable and endangered species.
Land use is taken into consideration and land under cultivation is not disturbed without the express 
consent of the landholder.
Mineral Exploration Programs
Access
The Company utilises existing tracks for access where possible. Climatic conditions are considered 
when assessing areas to avoid access during extreme conditions such as during bush fire risk during 
hot,  windy  conditions  and  damage  to  tracks  after  heavy  rain.  Surface  disturbances  are  kept  to  a 
minimum.
Drilling
Drilling programs include rehabilitation and where possible holes are positioned in areas requiring 
little or no clearing. Small, manoeuvrable drill rigs are used to minimise the need for track clearing 
and  to  reduce  ground  compaction.  Where  required,  topsoil  is  removed  and  stored  separately  so 
that it can be replaced during rehabilitation of the site. Ground sheets are used where required to 
avoid oil/fuel spills contaminating the soil.
Rehabilitation
Drill  sites  are  rehabilitated  as  soon  as  practicable  and  drill  holes  are  filled  and  capped  where 
necessary.
Landholders are asked to confirm at the end of each program that exploration has been conducted 
to their satisfaction and that sites have been rehabilitated.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT

To the Members of Australian Bauxite Limited
Report on the Half-Year Flnancial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Australian Bauxite Limited,
which comprises the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the statement of profit
or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement in changed in equity and
the statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, noted comprising a statement
of accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the
entity comprising the company at the half-year’s end or from time to time during the half-year.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the halfeyear financial
report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and
the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary
to enable the preparation of the half-year financial report that gives a true and fair view and is
free from maternal misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility »
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our
review. We conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review
Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a Financial Performed by Independent Auditor of the Entity,
in order to state whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of
any matter that makes us believe that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with
the Corporation Act 2001 Including: giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entib/s
financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its performance for the half-year ended on that date;
and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 interim Financial Reporting and the
Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Australian Bauxite Limited, ASRE 2410 required
that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial
report.
A review of a half«year ﬁnancial report consists of making enquiries, primary of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is subsequently less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurances that
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identiﬁed in an audit.
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that
makes us believe that the halfeyear financial report of Australian Bauxite Limited is not in
accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the Half‐Year Ended 30 June 2016
1.  BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE HALF‐YEAR FINANCIAL REPORT
Reporting Entity
Australian Bauxite Limited (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Australia. The consolidated 
interim financial report of the Company as at and for the six months ended 30 June 2016 comprises 
the Company and its controlled entities (together referred to as the "consolidated entity").
Statement of Compliance
The consolidated interim financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been 
prepared in accordance with AASB 134: Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Act 2001.
Estimates
The preparation of the interim financial report requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim financial report are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise 
stated.
(a)  Basis of Preparation
This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian 
Accounting Standards, Australian Accounting Interpretations, other authoritative 
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporation Act 2001.
Statement of Compliance
Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that the financial report of Australian 
Bauxite Limited complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS”).
Critical to accounting estimates
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting 
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and 
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
(i)
Options valuation
Refer to Note for estimates and assumptions used to calculate the valuation of options.
Critical judgements
Management have made the following judgements when applying the Group's accounting 
policies:
(i)
Capitalisation of exploration costs
The Group follows the guidance of AASB 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources 
when determining if exploration costs incurred can be capitalised. This determination requires 
significant judgement. In making this judgement, the Group evaluates if any one of the following 
conditions is met:

The exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through 
successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; 
and

Australian Bauxite Limited and Controlled Entities
ACN 139 494 885
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued


Exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date 
reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of 
economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, 
the areas of interest are continuing.
During the period, there were commodity price drops. No impairment losses were 
recognised as no significant production has occurred resulting in sales at prices requiring 
write-down of capitalised expenditures.
If one of the above conditions is met then the Group has made the judgement to capitalise the 
associated exploration expenses.
Historical cost convention
These financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and are based on the 
historical cost convention except where noted in these accounting policies.
Material accounting policies
The policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are presented below and 
have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.
(b)  Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of 
Australian Bauxite Limited (“parent entity”) as at 30 June 2016 and the results of all subsidiaries 
for the period then ended.
Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the parent entity has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one‐half of 
the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable 
or convertible are considered when assessing whether the parent entity controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the parent 
entity. They are de‐consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between consolidated 
entity entities are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the 
consolidated entity.
Business Combinations
Business combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses.
A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a 
combination involving entities or business under common control. The business combination will 
be accounted for from the date that control is attained, whereby the fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed is recognised (subject to 
certain limited exemptions).
When measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination, any asset or liability 
resulting from a contingent arrangement is also included, subsequent to initial recognition, 
contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement 
accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is 
remeasured in each reporting period to fair value, recognising any change to fair value in profit or 
loss, unless the change in value can be identified as existing at acquisition date.

Australian Bauxite Limited and Controlled Entities
ACN 139 494 885
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
All transaction costs incurred in relation to business combinations are recognised as expenses in 
profit or loss when incurred.
The acquisition of a business may result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain 
purchase.
(c)  Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services 
that are subject to risks and returns that are different to those of other business segments. A 
geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic 
environment and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments 
operating in other economic environments.
(d)  Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is 
recognised for the major business activities as follows:
Interest Revenue
Interest revenue is recognised as it accrues taking into account the effective yield on the financial 
asset.
Other Income
Income from other sources is recognised when proceeds or the fee in respect of other products or 
service provided is receivable.
(e)
Income Tax 
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s 
taxable income based on the income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and 
liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates 
expected to apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates 
which are enacted or substantively enacted for each jurisdiction. The relevant tax rates are 
applied to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure 
the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is made for certain temporary differences arising 
from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability. No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised 
in relation to these temporary differences if they arose in a transaction, other than a business 
combination, that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable 
profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses 
only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary 
differences and losses.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the 
carrying amount and tax bases of investments in controlled entities where the parent entity is 
able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also 
recognised directly in equity.
(f)  Goods and services tax (GST)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
  where the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the
taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of 
the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and 
receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
(f)  Goods and services tax (GST) continued
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as 
part of receivables or payables in the Statement of Financial Position.
Cash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis except for the GST 
component of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable 
from, or payable to, the taxation authority, are classified as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, 
or payable to, the taxation authority.
(g)  Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on 
hand and in at call deposits with banks or financial institutions, investment in money market 
instruments maturing within less than two months, net of bank overdrafts.
(h)  Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at original invoice amounts and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts. Trade receivables are due for 
settlement no more than 60 days from the date of recognition.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be 
uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that entities in the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of receivables.
(i)  Acquisition of assets
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for all acquisitions of assets regardless of 
whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. Cost is measured as the fair value of 
the assets given, shares issued or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
(j)
Tenement exploration, evaluation and development costs
Costs incurred in the exploration for, and evaluation of, tenements for suitable resources are 
carried forward as assets provided that one of the following conditions is met:


the carrying values are expected to be justified through successful development and 
exploitation of the area of interest; or 
exploration activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a 
reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of recoverable mineral resources, 
and active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Expenses failing to meet at least one of the aforementioned conditions are written off as 
incurred.
Costs associated with the commercial development of resources are deferred to future periods, 
provided they are, beyond any reasonable doubt, expected to be recoverable. These costs are 
be amortized from the commencement of commercial production of the product to which they 
relate on a straight‐line basis over the period of the expected benefit. 
Costs associated with the development of resources are expensed as incurred if their 
recoverability is unlikely or unable to be determined.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
(k)
Impairment of assets
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Non‐financial assets other than goodwill that 
suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting 
period. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash‐generating unit to which the asset 
belongs.
(l)
Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the 
end of the financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid 
within 30 days of recognition.
(m)  Restoration and rehabilitation provisions
Both for close down and restoration and for environmental clean‐up costs from exploration 
programs, if any, a provision will be made in the accounting period when the related disturbance 
occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs.
(n)  Employee Benefits
(i)
Wages, salaries and annual leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non‐monetary benefits and annual leave 
expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in other 
payables in respect of employees’ services up to the reporting date and are measured at 
the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
(ii)
Long service leave
The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits 
and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect 
of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.
(o)  Share based payments
Ownership‐based remuneration is provided to employees via an employee share option plan.
Share‐based compensation is recognised as an expense in respect of the services received, 
measured on a fair value basis.
The fair value of the options at grant date is independently determined using a Black‐Scholes 
option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the 
vesting and performance criteria, the impact of dilution, the non‐tradeable nature of the option, 
the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected 
dividend yield and the risk‐free interest rate for the term of the option.
The fair value of the options granted excludes the impact of any non‐market vesting conditions 
(for example, profitability and sales growth targets).  Non‐market vesting conditions are 
included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. 
At each balance date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected 
to become exercisable. The employee benefit expense recognised each period takes into 
account the most recent estimate.
Upon the exercise of options, the balance of the share‐based payments reserve relating to those 
options is transferred to share capital.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
(p)  Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS is calculated as net profit attributable to members, adjusted to exclude costs of 
servicing equity (other than dividends), divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares, adjusted for any bonus element.
Diluted EPS is calculated as net profit attributable to members, adjusted for costs of servicing 
equity (other than dividends), the after tax effect of dividends and interest associated with 
dilutive potential ordinary shares that have been recognised as expenses; and other non‐ 
discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the 
dilution of potential ordinary shares; divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.

Tenement interest, development costs and  
capitalized exploration expenditures 
 
The  ultimate  recoupment  of  costs  carried  forward  for  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  is 
dependent on the successful development and commercial exploration or sale of the respective 
areas. 
The carrying values of the exploration tenements are valued using the Exploration Expenditure 
Method and are limited to exploration expenditure incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Historical expenditure by other entities has not been included. 
The Company regularly considers the commercial viability of its exploration tenements and 
reduces the area or relinquishes the exploration tenement where the commercial prospects are 
diminished.
