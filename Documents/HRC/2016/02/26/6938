</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>the principles of the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in 
1993 that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that they 
must be treated on an equal footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p>

<p> (<i>b</i>) To request, in the above context, the Committee on Economic, Social and

<p> (<i>d</i>) To convene at the same session, in relation to the above process and its
