 EREMASI TASOVA on the 14th day of March, 2012 at Lautoka in the Western Division, resisted Detective Constable No. 3952 Senitiki Nakatasavu, a police officer whilst effecting arrest in due execution of his duty.

2.      
All three assessors unanimously found accused guilty of the above counts.

3.      
I direct myself in accordance with the law and the evidence which I discussed in my summing up to the assessors.

4.      
Considering the nature of the evidence before the court, I am convinced that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. 

5.      
The lay witnesses Jackson Bhai had identified the accused as the person who robbed his vehicle. This evidence is confirmed by independent witness Suliasi. There was positive identification and they both said that the next day they pointed out the accused to police from album of photos.

6.      
The accused had admitted the offence in his caution interview. I have already ruled that it is admissible in the Voir-dire inquiry.

7.      
The assessors have rejected the evidence of the accused and his witnesses. Considering the available evidence, I agree with their decision to reject the evidence of the accused and his witnesses.

8.      
I find the verdict of the assessors were not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I concur with their verdict. Considering all, I find the accused guilty as charged in respect of two counts of Aggravated Robbery, one count of Theft of a Motor vehicle and one count of Resisting arrest. 

9.      
Accordingly I convict Eremasi Tasova for two counts of Aggravated Robbery under Sections 311 (1) of the Crimes Decree, 2009, one count of theft of Motor vehicle under Section 291 (1) of the Crimes Decree, 2009 and one count of Resisting Arrest under Section 277 (b) of the Crimes Decree, 2009.

10.     
This is the Judgment of the Court.
