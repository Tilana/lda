Management’s Responsibility
To the Shareholders of CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:
Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the accompanying financial
statements,  including  responsibility  for  significant  accounting  judgments  and  estimates  in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This
responsibility  includes  selecting  appropriate  accounting  principles  and  methods,  and  making
decisions affecting the measurement of transactions in which objective judgment is required.
In  discharging  its  responsibilities  for  the  integrity  and  fairness  of  the  financial  statements,
management  designs  and  maintains  the  necessary  accounting  systems  and  related  internal
controls  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  authorized,  assets  are
safeguarded and financial records are properly maintained to provide reliable information for the
preparation of financial statements.
The  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for  overseeing  management  in  the  performance  of  its
financial  reporting  responsibilities,  and  for  approving  the  financial  information  included  in  the
annual  report.  The  Board  fulfills  these  responsibilities  by  reviewing  the  financial  information
prepared  by  management  and  discussing  relevant  matters  with  management  and  external
auditors. The Board of Directors is also responsible for recommending the appointment of CTT
Pharmaceutical’s external auditors.
MNP  LLP,  an  independent  firm  of  Chartered  Professional  Accountants,  is  appointed  by  the
shareholders to audit the financial statements and report directly to them; their report follows. The
external  auditors  have  full  and  free  access  to,  and  meet  periodically  and  separately  with,  the
Board of Directors, Audit Committee and management to discuss their audit findings.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Fenwafe Inc.)
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of February
28, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity,
and  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  years  in  the  three  year  period  ended  February  28,  2014.  CTT
Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.’s  management  is  responsible  for  these  financial  statements.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our  audit  included  consideration  of  internal  control
over  financial  reporting  as  a  basis  for  designing  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the
company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of February 28, 2014 and 2013, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended
February  28,  2014  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United
States of America.
The accompanying financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements,
the  Company  has  accumulated  operating  losses  of  $205,124  since  inception  and  the
continuation  of  the  Company  is  dependent  upon  the  continuing  support  of  the  shareholders,
ongoing  product  development,  the  successful  implementation  of  a  marketing  program,  market
acceptance of its products and achieving profitability. These factors along with other matters as
set forth in Note 1, raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going
concern.  The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  that  might  result  from  the
outcome of this uncertainty.

(formerly Fenwafe Inc.)
Notes to Financial Statements
For the Years Ended February 28, 2014, 2013 and 2012
(Canadian Dollars)
1.        BASIS OF PRESENTATION
CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Fenwafe Inc.) (the “Company”) was incorporated
under  the  Canadian  Business  Corporations  Act  on  March  8,  2007.  The  Company  intends  to
specialize in the development of oral drug delivery systems for pain management and treatment.
These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a
going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The Company has accumulated operating losses of $205,124 since
inception  and  the  continuation  of  the  Company  is  dependent  upon  the  continuing  support  of
creditors  and  the  shareholders,  long-term  financing,  ongoing  product  development,  the
successful  implementation  of  a  marketing  program,  market  acceptance  of  its  products  and
achieving  profitability.  These  factors  raise  substantial  doubt  that  the  Company  will  be  able  to
continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments to
the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities which might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue its operations as a going concern.
2.        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States applicable to a going concern and reflect the policies
outlined below.
(a)        Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or
remaining  maturity  of  less  than  three  months  at  the  date  of  purchase  to  be  cash  equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include balances with banks and operating line of credit.
(b)        Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title passes
to the customer, typically upon delivery, and when collection of the fixed or determinable selling
price is reasonably assured.
(c)        Functional and Presentation Currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Company and its consolidated entities is
the  Canadian  Dollar.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  relating  to  transactions  not
denominated in the Canadian Dollar are included in operating income (loss).
(d)        Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  are  included  in  comprehensive  income,  but  are
excluded  from  net  income  as  these  amounts  are  recorded  directly  as  an  adjustment  to
stockholders’  equity.  The  Company  had  no  elements  of  comprehensive  income  for  the  years
ended February 28, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
(e)        Share Capital
Proceeds from share issuance net of share issuance costs are recorded at the amount
paid. Share capital issued for non-monetary consideration is recorded at the fair market value of
the shares on the date the shares are issued.

(formerly Fenwafe Inc.)
Notes to Financial Statements
For the Years Ended February 28, 2014, 2013 and 2012
(Canadian Dollars)
(f)        Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares  outstanding  during  the  period,  and  diluted  earnings  per  share  is  computed  using  the
weighted  average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding  during  the  period  adjusted  for  all
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common
stock  equivalents  would  be  antidilutive.  There  were  no  potentially  dilutive  common  stock
equivalents outstanding at February 28, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
(g)        Financial Instruments.
The fair market value of the Company’s financial instruments comprising cash, accounts
payable  and  accrued  liabilities  and  due  to  shareholder  were  estimated  to  approximate  their
carrying  values  due  to  immediate  or  short-term  maturity  of  these  financial  instruments.  The
Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions which do not exceed federally insured
amounts. The Company has not experienced any material losses in such accounts.
The Company is not exposed to any foreign exchange or interest rate risk.
(h)        Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
We measure and disclose certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC Topic
820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that
would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market
participants on the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
which  requires  an  entity  to  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs
that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Observable  inputs  other  than  Level  1  prices  such  as quoted  prices  for  similar
assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that
are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially
the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
We utilize the active market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets and
liabilities. We report separately each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis and include assets and liabilities that are disclosed but not recorded at fair value
in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and due to shareholder
for  all  periods  presented  approximate  their  respective  carrying  amounts  due  to  the  short  term
nature of these financial instruments.
(i)        Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities
and  their  respective  tax  bases  and  operating  loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.  Deferred  tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  reduced  by  a  valuation
allowance  so  that  the  assets  are  recognized  only  to  the  extent  that  when,  in  the  opinion  of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized.
CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(formerly Fenwafe Inc.)
Notes to Financial Statements
For the Years Ended February 28, 2014, 2013 and 2012
(Canadian Dollars)
Per FASB ASC 740 “Income taxes” under the liability method, it is the Company’s policy
to  provide  for  uncertain  tax  positions  and  the  related  interest  and  penalties  based  upon
management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination by tax authorities. At February 28, 2014, the Company believes it has appropriately
accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for
which  a  liability  for  an  unrecognized  benefit  is  established  or  is  required  to  pay  amounts  in
excess of the liability, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may
be affected. Interest and penalties associated with the Company’s tax positions are recorded as
Interest Expense.
(j)        Research costs
Research costs are expensed in the year incurred. The Company expenses development
costs in the year incurred, except when it is determined that the costs meet United States GAAP
criteria for deferral and amortization. Deferred development costs, if any, will be amortized on
straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the underlying product.
(k)        Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires entities to disclose both
gross information and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the
statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar
to  a  master  netting  arrangement.  The  scope  of  this  standard  includes  derivatives,  sale  and
repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and
securities  lending  arrangements.  These  disclosures  assist  users  of  financial  statements  in
evaluating the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position.
This guidance was effective for the Company in its fiscal year beginning March 1, 2013. This
guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In February 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to update the presentation
of  reclassifications  from  comprehensive  income  to  net  income  in  consolidated  financial
statements.  Under  this  new  guidance,  an  entity  is  required  to  present  information  about  the
amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income either by the respective
line items of net income or by cross-reference to other required disclosures. The new guidance
does not change the requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the
financial statements. This guidance was effective for the Company in its fiscal year beginning
March 1, 2013. This guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In July 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires the presentation of
unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of the deferred tax assets, when a net operating loss
carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. This new
guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and
subsequent interim periods. This guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
March  1,  2014  and  is  not  expected  to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial
statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic
915).  Elimination  of  Certain  Financial  Reporting  Requirements,  Including  an  Amendment  to
Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this Update
remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting
Standards  Codification, 
reporting  distinction  between
development  stage  entities  and  other  reporting  entities  from  U.S.  GAAP.  In  addition,  the
amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to:

disclose  a  description  of  the  development  stage activities  in  which  the  entity  is
engaged; and

(formerly Fenwafe Inc.)

(Canadian Dollars)
4)
disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that
in prior years it had been in the development stage.
The amendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties, is
applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations.
Finally, the amendments remove the exception for development stage entities (to not be
considered  a  VIE,  if  certain  conditions  are  met)  in  paragraph  810-10-15-16.  Under  the
amendments,  all  entities  within  the  scope  of  the  Variable  Interest  Entities  Subsections  of
Subtopic 810-10 are required to evaluate whether the total equity investment at risk is sufficient
using  the  guidance  provided  in  paragraphs  810-10-25-45  through  25-47,  which  requires  both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other
remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the
clarification  to  Topic  275,  which  shall  be  applied  prospectively.  For  public  business  entities,
those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014,
and interim periods therein. For other entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting
periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2014,  and  interim  reporting  periods  beginning  after
December 15, 2015. Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual
reporting period or interim period for which the entity’s financial statements have not yet been
issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption,
entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915. The Company
has chosen to early adopt these amendments and accordingly has not presented inception-to-
date information in these financial statements.
(k)        Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported
amount  of  revenues  and  expenses  recognized  during  the  periods  presented.  The  Company
reviews  all  significant  estimates  affecting  its  financial  statements  on  a  recurring  basis  and
records  the  effect  of  any  necessary  adjustments  prior  to  their  publication.  Judgments  and
estimates  are  based  on  the  Company’s  beliefs  and  assumptions  derived  from  information
available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such
estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates are
primarily  used  in  the  Company’s  assessment  of  going  concern,  fair  value  assumptions  in
determining  market  interest  rates  on  amounts  due  to  shareholder,  and  estimation  of  deferred
income taxes.
3.        DUE TO SHAREHOLDER
The advances from shareholders are non interest bearing and have no fixed terms of
repayment (note 6).

4.        INCOME TAX
As  at  February  28,  2014,  the  Company  has  non  capital  loss  carry  forwards  of
approximately  $99,632  (2013  -  $83,440).  This  benefit  has  been  fully  offset  by  a  valuation
allowance based on management's determination that it is not more likely than not that some or
all of this benefit will be realized. These losses expire as follows:

Accounting for uncertainty for Income Tax
Effective March 1, 2009, we adopted the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in
income  taxes  which  was  an  interpretation  of  the  accounting  standard  accounting  for  income
taxes.  This  interpretation  created  a  single  model  to  address  accounting  for  uncertainty  in  tax
positions. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements.

Notes to Interim Condensed Financial Statements
For the Three Month Period Ended May 31, 2014
(Canadian Dollars)
(Unaudited)
1.        BASIS OF PRESENTATION
CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Fenwafe Inc.) (the “Company”) was incorporated
under  the  Canadian  Business  Corporations  Act  on  March  8,  2007.  The  Company  intends  to
specialize in the development of oral drug delivery systems for pain management and treatment.
The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared using U.S. Generally
Accepted  Accounting  Principles  (US  GAAP)  for  interim  financial  information  and  accordingly,
they do not include all of the information necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations,
financial  position,  and  cash  flows  in  conformity  with  US  GAAP.  In  our  opinion,  the  unaudited
interim  condensed  financial  statements  reflect  all  adjustments  of  a  normal  recurring  nature
considered necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Operating
results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the
fiscal year as a whole. These unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and notes there to included in the Company’s annual
audited financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a
going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The Company has accumulated operating losses of $208,569 since
inception  and  the  continuation  of  the  Company  is  dependent  upon  the  continuing  support  of
creditors  and  the  shareholders,  long-term  financing,  ongoing  product  development,  the
successful  implementation  of  a  marketing  program,  market  acceptance  of  its  products  and
achieving  profitability.  These  factors  raise  substantial  doubt  that  the  Company  will  be  able  to
continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments to
the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities which might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue its operations as a going concern.
2.        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States applicable to a going concern and reflect the policies
outlined below.
(a)        Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or
remaining  maturity  of  less  than  three  months  at  the  date  of  purchase  to  be  cash  equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include balances with banks and operating line of credit.
(b)        Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title passes
to the customer, typically upon delivery, and when collection of the fixed or determinable selling
price is reasonably assured.
(c)        Functional and Presentation Currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Company and its consolidated entities is
the  Canadian  Dollar.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  relating  to  transactions  not
denominated in the Canadian Dollar are included in operating income (loss).
(d)        Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  are  included  in  comprehensive  income,  but  are
excluded  from  net  income  as  these  amounts  are  recorded  directly  as  an  adjustment  to
stockholders’ equity. Since inception, the Company had no elements of comprehensive income.
CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(formerly Fenwafe Inc.)
Notes to Interim Condensed Financial Statements
For the Three Month Period Ended May 31, 2014
(Canadian Dollars)
(e) Capital Stock
Proceeds from share issuance net of share issuance costs are recorded at the amount
paid. Share capital issued for non-monetary consideration is recorded at the fair market value of
the shares on the date the shares are issued.
(f)        Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares  outstanding  during  the  period,  and  diluted  earnings  per  share  is  computed  using  the
weighted  average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding  during  the  period  adjusted  for  all
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common
stock  equivalents  would  be  antidilutive.  There  were  no  potentially  dilutive  common  stock
equivalents outstanding at May 31, 2014 or February 28, 2014.
(g)        Financial Instruments.
The fair market value of the Company’s financial instruments comprising cash, accounts
payable  and  accrued  liabilities  and  due  to  shareholder  were  estimated  to  approximate  their
carrying  values  due  to  immediate  or  short-term  maturity  of  these  financial  instruments.  The
Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions which do not exceed federally insured
amounts. The Company has not experienced any material losses in such accounts.
The Company is not exposed to any foreign exchange or interest rate risk.
(h)        Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
We measure and disclose certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC Topic
820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that
would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market
participants on the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
which  requires  an  entity  to  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs
that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Observable  inputs  other  than  Level  1  prices  such  as quoted  prices  for  similar
assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that
are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially
the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
We utilize the active market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets and
liabilities. We report separately each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis and include assets and liabilities that are disclosed but not recorded at fair value
in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and due to shareholder
for  all  periods  presented  approximate  their  respective  carrying  amounts  due  to  the  short  term
nature of these financial instruments.

(formerly Fenwafe Inc.)
Notes to Interim Condensed Financial Statements
For the Three Month Period Ended May 31, 2014
(Canadian Dollars)
(i)        Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities
and  their  respective  tax  bases  and  operating  loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.  Deferred  tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  reduced  by  a  valuation
allowance  so  that  the  assets  are  recognized  only  to  the  extent  that  when,  in  the  opinion  of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized.
Per FASB ASC 740 “Income taxes” under the liability method, it is the Company’s policy
to  provide  for  uncertain  tax  positions  and  the  related  interest  and  penalties  based  upon
management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination  by  tax  authorities.  At  May  31,  2014,  the  Company  believes  it  has  appropriately
accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for
which  a  liability  for  an  unrecognized  benefit  is  established  or  is  required  to  pay  amounts  in
excess of the liability, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may
be affected. Interest and penalties associated with the Company’s tax positions are recorded as
Interest Expense.
(j)        Research costs
Research costs are expensed in the year incurred. The Company expenses development
costs in the year incurred, except when it is determined that the costs meet United States GAAP
criteria for deferral and amortization. Deferred development costs, if any, will be amortized on
straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the underlying product.
(k)        Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires the presentation of
unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of the deferred tax assets, when a net operating loss
carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. This new
guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and
subsequent interim periods. This guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
March 1, 2014 and adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic
915).  Elimination  of  Certain  Financial  Reporting  Requirements,  Including  an  Amendment  to
Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this Update
remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting
Standards  Codification, 
reporting  distinction  between
development  stage  entities  and  other  reporting  entities  from  U.S.  GAAP.  In  addition,  the
amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to:
removing
thereby
the
financial

2)

4)
present  inception-to-date  information  in  the  statements of  income,  cash  flows,  and
shareholder equity;
label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity;
disclose  a  description  of  the  development  stage activities  in  which  the  entity  is
engaged; and
disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that
in prior years it had been in the development stage.
The amendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties, is
applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations.
CTT Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(formerly Fenwafe Inc.)
Notes to Interim Condensed Financial Statements
For the Three Month Period Ended May 31, 2014
(Canadian Dollars)
Finally, the amendments remove the exception for development stage entities (to not be
considered  a  VIE,  if  certain  conditions  are  met)  in  paragraph  810-10-15-16.  Under  the
amendments,  all  entities  within  the  scope  of  the  Variable  Interest  Entities  Subsections  of
Subtopic 810-10 are required to evaluate whether the total equity investment at risk is sufficient
using  the  guidance  provided  in  paragraphs  810-10-25-45  through  25-47,  which  requires  both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other
remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the
clarification  to  Topic  275,  which  shall  be  applied  prospectively.  For  public  business  entities,
those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014,
and interim periods therein. For other entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting
periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2014,  and  interim  reporting  periods  beginning  after
December 15, 2015. Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual
reporting period or interim period for which the entity’s financial statements have not yet been
issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption,
entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915. The Company
has chosen to early adopt these amendments and accordingly has not presented inception-to-
date information in these financial statements.
(k)        Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported
amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Actual results may
differ from those estimates.
The Company reviews all significant estimates affecting its financial statements on a
recurring  basis  and  records  the  effect  of  any  necessary  adjustments  prior  to  their  publication.
Judgments and estimates are based on the Company’s beliefs and assumptions derived from
information  available  at  the  time  such  judgments  and  estimates  are  made.  Uncertainties  with
respect  to  such  estimates  and  assumptions  are  inherent  in  the  preparation  of  financial
statements.  Estimates  are  primarily  used  in  the  Company’s  assessment  of  going  concern,  fair
value  assumptions  in  determining  market  interest  rates  on  amounts  due  to  shareholder,  and
estimation of deferred income taxes.
3.        DUE TO SHAREHOLDER
The advances from shareholders are non interest bearing and have no fixed terms of
repayment (note 5).
