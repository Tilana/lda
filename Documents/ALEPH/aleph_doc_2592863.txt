"back-in" or "reversionary" interests held by third parties which could reduce the interests of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in such Oil and Gas Properties except as set forth in
Engineering Report, (E) no operating or other agreement to which the Borrower or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is
bound affecting any part of such Oil and Gas Properties requires the Borrower or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to bear any of the costs relating to such Oil and Gas Properties greater
than the record title interest of the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in such portion of
the such Oil and Gas Properties as set forth in such Engineering Report, except in the event the
Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is obligated under an operating agreement to
assume a portion of a defaulting party's share of costs, and (F) the Borrower's and the Restricted
Subsidiaries' ownership of the Hydrocarbons and the undivided interests in the Oil and Gas
Properties as specified in such Engineering Report (i) will, after giving full effect to all Permitted
Liens afford the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary not less than those net interests
(expressed as a fraction, percentage or decimal) in the production from or which is allocated to
such Hydrocarbons specified as net revenue interest in such Engineering Report and (ii) will
cause the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to bear not more than that portion
(expressed as a fraction, percentage or decimal), specified as working interest in such
Engineering Report, of the costs of drilling, developing and operating the wells identified in such
Engineering Report or identified in the exhibits to the Mortgages encumbering such Oil and Gas
Properties.
(v)        Concurrently with each delivery of an Engineering Report, the Borrower shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent a First Lien Cap Certificate.   The First Lien Cap Certificate required
under this clause (v) shall no longer be required once the Junior Debt Payoff has occurred
(c)       Interim Redeterminations.  In addition to the Borrowing Base redeterminations provided for
in Section 2.02(b) and based on such information as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
deem relevant (but in accordance with Section 2.02(d)):
(i)        at the election of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may
make one additional redetermination of the Borrowing Base during any six-month period
between scheduled redeterminations; and
(ii)       at the request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may make one
additional redetermination of the Borrowing Base during any six-month period between
scheduled redeterminations.
(d)       Standards for Redetermination.  Each redetermination of the Borrowing Base by the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall be made (i) in the sole
discretion of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (but in accordance with the other
provisions of this Section 2.02(d)), (ii) in accordance with the Administrative Agent's and the
Lenders' customary internal standards and practices for valuing and redetermining the value of
Oil and Gas Properties in connection with reserve based oil and gas loan transactions, (iii) in
conjunction with the most recent Independent Engineering Report or Internal Engineering
Report, as applicable, or other information received by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
relating to the Proven Reserves of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and (iv) based
upon the estimated value of the Proven Reserves owned by the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries as determined by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.  In valuing and
redetermining the
32
Borrowing Base, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may also consider the business,
financial condition, and Debt obligations of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries and
such other factors as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders customarily deem appropriate,
including without limitation, commodity price assumptions, projections of production, operating
expenses, general and administrative expenses, capital costs, working capital requirements,
liquidity evaluations, dividend payments, environmental costs, and legal costs.  In that regard, the
Borrower acknowledges that the determination of the Borrowing Base contains a value cushion
(market value in excess of loan value), which is essential for the adequate protection of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders.  No Proven Reserves shall be included or considered for
inclusion in the Borrowing Base unless the Administrative Agent shall have received, at the
Borrower's expense, (A) evidence of title reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the
Administrative Agent covering at least 80% (by value) of the Proven Reserves and the Oil and
Gas Properties relating thereto (or in the case of the initial Borrowing Base set on the Effective
Date, at least 70% (by value) of the Proven Reserves and the Oil and Gas Properties related
thereto), and (B) Mortgages and such other Security Instruments requested by the Administrative
Agent to the extent necessary to cause the Administrative Agent to have an Acceptable Security
Interest in at least 85% (by value) of the Proven Reserves and the Oil and Gas Properties relating
thereto.  At all times after the Administrative Agent has given the Borrower notification of a
redetermination of the Borrowing Base under this Section 2.02, the Borrowing Base shall be
equal (i) to the redetermined amount or (ii) such lesser amount designated by the Borrower and
disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, provided that the Borrower shall
not request that the Borrowing Base be reduced to a level that would result in a Borrowing Base
Deficiency, until the Borrowing Base is subsequently redetermined in accordance with this
Section 2.02.
(e)       Mandatory Reductions in the Borrowing Base.  In addition to the Borrowing Base
redeterminations provided for otherwise in this Section 2.02, the Borrowing Base shall be
automatically reduced as follows:
(i)        Effective immediately upon each issuance of Senior Unsecured Notes by the Borrower or
any Restricted Subsidiary, the Borrowing Base shall automatically reduce on the effective date of
such issuance by an amount equal to 25% of (A) the principal amount of such Senior Unsecured
Notes minus (B) to the extent such Senior Unsecured Notes constitute Refinancing Debt, the
principal amount of Second Lien Debt or other Senior Unsecured Notes being refinanced
thereby.
(ii)       Effective immediately upon the issuance of any Additional Subordinated Debt (other than
Senior Unsecured Notes and Additional Subordinated Debt to the extent the proceeds thereof
are applied to effect the Permitted Exchange/Payment of Senior Unsecured Notes) by the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, the Borrowing Base shall automatically reduce on the
effective date of such issuance by an amount equal to 25% of (A) the principal amount of such
Additional Subordinated Debt minus (B) the principal amount of Second Lien Debt repaid with
the proceeds of such Additional Subordinated Debt (other than repayments of any increases in
principal of Second Lien Debt effected after the Amendment No. 11 Effective Date and any
interest accrued on such increased principal amount).
(iii)      if a Triggering Event occurs which results in the aggregate amount of all Triggering Events
(including such Triggering Event) effected during the six month period between scheduled
redeterminations of the Borrowing Base to exceed 5% of the Borrowing Base then in effect, then
effective immediately upon the occurrence of such Triggering Event and each subsequent
Triggering Event until the next scheduled redetermination of the Borrowing Base occurs, the
Borrowing Base shall automatically reduce on the date such Triggering Event and such
subsequent Triggering Event is effected by an amount equal to (A) in the case of a Disposition of
Oil and Gas Properties (or any Restricted Subsidiary that owns Oil and Gas Properties), the
value, if any,
33
assigned such Oil and Gas Properties under the then effective Borrowing Base, as reasonably
determined by the Administrative Agent, and (B) in the case of a hedge position or Hedge
Contract that has been novated, assigned, unwound, terminated, or amended, the value, if any,
assigned such hedge position or Hedge Contract under the then effective Borrowing Base, as
reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.
(iv)       [Reserved.]
(v)        If (A) the Borrowing Base has not been redetermined within 75 days after receipt by the
Administrative Agent of the First Lien Cap Certificate required under Section 2.02(b)(v) above
and the related Engineering Reports and (B) the Borrowing Base then in effect is greater than the
First Lien Cap (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement and as set forth in such First Lien Cap
Certificate) then in effect, then effective as of the 76th day following such receipt, the Borrowing
Base shall automatically be reduced to equal such First Lien Cap and such First Lien Cap shall
be in effect until redetermined as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, the automatic reductions of the Borrowing Base provided for in this
Section 2.02 shall not constitute nor be construed as a consent to any Debt incurrence or
proposed Debt incurrence that would not be permitted under the terms of this Agreement.
Section 2.03       Method of Borrowing.
(a)       Notice.  Each Borrowing shall be made pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing (or by telephone
notice promptly confirmed in writing by a Notice of Borrowing), given not later than 11:00 a.m.
(Dallas, Texas time) (i) on the third Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing, in
the case of a Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances or (ii) on the Business Day of
the proposed Borrowing, in the case of a Borrowing comprised of Reference Rate Advances, by
the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn give to each Lender prompt notice of
such proposed Borrowing by telecopier.  Each Notice of a Borrowing shall be given in writing,
including by telecopier,  specifying the information required therein.  In the case of a proposed
Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.09(a)(ii).  Each Lender shall,
before 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available for the
account of its applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in
Section 9.02, or such other location as the Administrative Agent may specify by notice to the
Lenders, in same day funds, in the case of a Borrowing, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
Borrowing.  After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent shall make such funds
available to the Borrower at its account with the Administrative Agent.
(b)       Conversions and Continuations.  The Borrower may elect to Convert or continue any
Borrowing under this Section 2.03 by delivering an irrevocable Notice of Conversion or
Continuation to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's office no later than 11:00
a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) (i) on the date which is at least three Business Days in advance of the
proposed Conversion or continuation date in the case of a Conversion to or a continuation of a
Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances and (ii) on the Business Day of the proposed
Conversion in the case of a Conversion to a Borrowing comprised of Reference Rate
Advances.  Each such Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be in writing or by telephone
notice promptly confirmed immediately in writing specifying the information required
therein.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation under this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall provide each Lender with a copy thereof and, in the case of a
Conversion to or a continuation of a Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, notify
each Lender of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.09(a)(ii).
34
(c)       Certain Limitations.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in paragraphs (a)
and (b) above:
(i)        at no time shall there be more than four Interest Periods applicable to outstanding
Eurodollar Rate Advances and the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any
Borrowing at any time that a Default has occurred and is continuing;
(ii)       if any Lender shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Borrowing,
Conversion, or continuation, notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change
in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or
other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending
Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to
fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate
Advances from such Lender shall be suspended until such Lender shall notify the Administrative
Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and the Advance made
by such Lender in respect of such Borrowing, Conversion, or continuation shall be a Reference
Rate Advance;
(iii)      if the Administrative Agent is unable to determine the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate
Advances comprising any requested Borrowing, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar
Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing
such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a
Reference Rate Advance;
(iv)       if the Required Lenders shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested
Borrowing, notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances
comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
funding their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances, as the case may be, for such Borrowing, the
right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any
subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and
each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Reference Rate Advance; and
(v)        if the Borrower shall fail to select the duration or continuation of any Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of
"Interest Period" in Section 1.01 and paragraph (b) above, the Administrative Agent shall
forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances shall be made available to
the Borrower on the date of such Borrowing as Reference Rate Advances or, if existing
Eurodollar Rate Advances, Convert into Reference Rate Advances.
(d)       Notices Irrevocable.  Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Conversion or Continuation
shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.  In the case of any Borrowing for which the
related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, out-of-pocket cost, or expense incurred
by such Lender as a result of any failure by the Borrower to fulfill on or before the date specified
in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III
including, without limitation, any loss (including any loss of anticipated profits), cost, or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such
Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
35
(e)       Administrative Agent Reliance.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender before the date of any Borrowing that such Lender shall not make available
to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share of a Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
Section 2.03 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that any
Lender shall not have so made its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent (the "Non-Funding Lender"), such Non-Funding Lender and the Borrower
severally agree to immediately repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such corresponding
amount, together with interest on such amount, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in
the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable on such day to Advances comprising such
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Non-Funding Lender, the Federal Funds Rate for such
day.  If such Non-Funding Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding
amount and interest as provided above, such corresponding amount so repaid shall constitute
such Non-Funding Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement
even though not made on the same day as the other Advances comprising such Borrowing.
(f)       Lender Obligations Several.  The failure of any Non-Funding Lender to make the Advance
to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if
any, to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing.  No Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of
any Borrowing.
Section 2.04       Reduction of the Commitments.
(a)       The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portion of the
Commitment;  provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of
$3,000,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
(b)       Other than as provided in Section 2.04(c) below, any reduction and termination of the
Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be applied ratably to each Lender's
Commitment and shall be permanent, with no obligation of the Lenders to reinstate such
Commitments.
(c)       In the event of a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower, at the Borrower's election may elect to
terminate such Defaulting Lender's Commitment hereunder; provided that (i) such termination
must be of the Defaulting Lender's entire Commitment, (ii) subject to the set-off rights set forth in
the immediately following sentence, the Borrower shall pay all amounts owed by the Borrower to
such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents (including
principal of and interest on the Advances owed to such Defaulting Lender, accrued commitment
fees, and letter of credit fees but specifically excluding any amounts owing under Section 2.12 as
result of such payment of Advances) and shall deposit with the Administrative Agent into the
Cash Collateral Account cash collateral in the amount equal to such Defaulting Lender's ratable
share of the Letter of Credit Exposure, including any such Letter of Credit Exposure that has been
reallocated pursuant to Section 2.17(c)(i);  (iii) a Defaulting Lender’s Commitment may be
terminated by the Borrower under this Section 2.04(c) if and only if at such time, the Borrower has
elected, or is then electing, to terminate the Commitments of all then existing Defaulting
Lenders.  With respect to the amounts described in clause (ii) above which would be payable by
the Borrower to the Defaulting Lender (but not including any deposits that the Borrower is
required to make with respect to the Letter of Credit Exposure), the Borrower may set-off and
apply any amounts owing from such Defaulting Lender or Affiliate thereof to the Borrower under
any Hedge Contract against any such amounts payable to the Defaulting Lender.  Upon written
notice to the Defaulting Lender and
36
Administrative Agent of the Borrower's election to terminate a Defaulting Lender's Commitment
pursuant to this clause (c) and the payment and deposit of amounts required to be made by the
Borrower under clause (ii) above, (A) such Defaulting Lender shall cease to be a “Lender”
hereunder for all purposes except that such Lender's rights under Sections 2.13, 2.14, and 9.07
shall continue with respect to events and occurrences occurring before or concurrently with its
ceasing to be a “Lender” hereunder, (B) such Defaulting Lender's Commitment shall be deemed
terminated, and (C) such Defaulting Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder,
provided that, any such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim by
Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.
Section 2.05       Prepayment of Advances.
(a)       Optional.  The Borrower may prepay the Advances, after giving by 10:00 a.m. (Dallas,
Texas time) (i) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, at least three Business Days' or (ii) in
the case of Reference Rate Advances, same Business Day's, irrevocable prior written notice (or
irrevocable telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent stating the
proposed date and aggregate principal amount of such prepayment.  If any such notice is given,
the Borrower shall prepay the Advances in whole or ratably in part in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the amount specified in such notice, together with accrued interest to the date of
such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid and amounts, if any, required to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date; provided,
however, that each partial prepayment with respect to:  (A) any amounts prepaid in respect of
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be applied to Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising part of the
same Borrowing; (B) any amounts prepaid in respect of Reference Rate Advances shall be made
in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof, and
(C) any prepayments made in respect of Borrowings comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be made in a minimum amount of $3,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof and in an aggregate principal amount such that after giving effect thereto such
Borrowing shall have a remaining principal amount outstanding with respect to such
Borrowings of at least $1,000,000.  Full prepayments of any Borrowing are permitted without
restriction of amounts.
(b)       Borrowing Base Deficiencies.
(i)        Other than as provided in clause (ii) and clause (iii) below and in Section 5.11, if a
Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, then the Borrower shall, after receipt of written notice from the
Administrative Agent regarding such deficiency, take any of the following actions (and the failure
of the Borrower to take such actions to remedy such Borrowing Base Deficiency shall constitute
an Event of Default):
(A)       prepay the Advances or, if the Advances have been repaid in full, make deposits into the
Cash Collateral Account to provide cash collateral for the Letter of Credit Exposure, such that the
Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within 10 days after the date such deficiency notice is
received by the Borrower from the Administrative Agent;
(B)       pledge as Collateral for the Obligations additional Oil and Gas Properties acceptable to
the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders such that the applicable Borrowing
Base Deficiency is cured within 10 days after the date of such notice by the Administrative Agent
is received;
(C)       (1) deliver within 10 days after the date such deficiency notice is received by the Borrower
from the Administrative Agent, written notice to the Administrative Agent indicating the Borrower's
election to repay the Advances and make deposits into the Cash Collateral Account to provide
cash collateral for the Letters of Credit, each in five monthly installments equal to one-fifth of such
37
Borrowing Base Deficiency with the first such installment due 30 days after the date such
deficiency notice is received by the Borrower from the Administrative Agent and each following
installment due 30 days after the preceding installment and (2) to make such payments and
deposits within such time period; or
(D)       (1) deliver within 10 days after the date such deficiency notice is received by the Borrower
to the Administrative Agent written notice to the Administrative Agent indicating the Borrower's
election to combine the options provided in clause (B) and clause (C) above, and also indicating
the amount to be prepaid in installments and the amount to be provided as additional Collateral,
and (2) make such five equal consecutive monthly installments and deliver such additional
Collateral within the time required under clause (B) and clause (C) above.
The failure of the Borrower to deliver an election notice pursuant to the terms of this clause (b)(i)
shall be deemed to be an election by the Borrower of the option set forth in clause (C) above.
(ii)       Upon each reduction of the Borrowing Base under Section 2.02(e)(i) or (ii) resulting from
the issuance of Additional Subordinated Debt,  if a Borrowing Base Deficiency then exists or
results therefrom, then the Borrower shall prepay the Advances or, if the Advances have been
repaid in full, make deposits into the Cash Collateral Account to provide cash collateral for the
Letter of Credit Exposure, in an amount equal to (A) such portion of the Borrowing Base
Deficiency resulting from such reduction plus (B) if a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists prior to
such reduction, then an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Debt Incurrence Proceeds of such
Additional Subordinated Debt and (ii) such portion of the Borrowing Base Deficiency in existence
immediately prior to such reduction.
(iii)      Upon each reduction of the Borrowing Base under Section 2.02(e)(iii) from the occurrence
of a Triggering Event, if a Borrowing Base Deficiency then exists or results therefrom, then the
Borrower shall prepay the Advances or, if the Advances have been repaid in full, make deposits
into the Cash Collateral Account to provide cash collateral for the Letter of Credit Exposure, in an
amount equal to (A) such portion of the Borrowing Base Deficiency resulting from such reduction
plus (B) if a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists prior to such reduction, then an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the Net Cash Proceeds of such Triggering Event and (ii) such portion of the
Borrowing Base Deficiency in existence immediately prior to such reduction.
(iv)       Each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be accompanied by accrued
interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and amounts, if any, required to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date. 
Each prepayment under this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied to the Advances as determined by
the Administrative Agent.
(c)       Reduction of Commitments.
(i)        On the date of each reduction of the aggregate Commitments pursuant to Section 2.04,
 the Borrower agrees to make a prepayment in respect of the outstanding amount of the
Advances to the extent, if any, that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Advances plus
the Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the lesser of (A) the aggregate Commitments, as so
reduced, and (B) the Borrowing Base.
(ii)       Each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) shall be accompanied by accrued
interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and amounts, if any, required to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date.  Each
prepayment under this Section 2.05(c) shall be applied to the Advances as determined by the
Administrative Agent and agreed to by the Lenders in their sole discretion.
38
(d)       Illegality.  If any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the
adoption of or any change in any applicable Legal Requirement or in the interpretation of any
applicable Legal Requirement by any Governmental Authority makes it unlawful, or that any
central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful for such Lender or its
applicable Lending Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to maintain any
Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding hereunder, (i) the Borrower shall, no
later than 11:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) and if not prohibited by law, (A) on the last day of the
Interest Period for each outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advance made by such Lender, or (B) if
required by such notice, on the second Business Day following its receipt of such notice, either
prepay all of the Eurodollar Rate Advances made by such Lender then outstanding or Convert all
of the Eurodollar Rate Advances made by such Lender then outstanding to Reference Rate
Advances, and, in either case, pay all accrued interest on the principal amount prepaid or
Converted to the date of such prepayment or Conversion and amounts, if any, required to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such prepayment or Conversion being made on such date,
(ii) to the extent the principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances are prepaid, such Lender shall
simultaneously make a Reference Rate Advance to the Borrower on such date in an amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Rate Advances prepaid to such
Lender, and (iii) the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances from such Lender
for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until such Lender giving notice referred to
above shall notify the Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.
(e)       No Additional Right; Ratable Prepayment.  The Borrower shall have no right to prepay any
principal amount of any Advance except as provided in Section 2.04(c) and this Section 2.05,
and all notices given pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be irrevocable and binding upon the
Borrower.  Each payment of any Advance pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be made in a
manner such that all Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing are paid in whole or
ratably in part other than Advances owing to a Defaulting Lender as provided in Section 2.17.
Section 2.06       Repayment of Advances; Mandatory Prepayment of Advances.
(a)       Scheduled Maturity Date.  The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the
ratable benefit of the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of each Advance, together with
any accrued interest on the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date pursuant to
Section 7.02 or Section 7.03.
(b)       Mandatory Prepayment of Advances.  Without duplication of any amounts required to be
paid and deposited under Section 2.05(b)(iii) above, in the event of any Material Disposition by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which is a Disposition of Oil and Gas Properties that have
a positive value in the most recently delivered Engineering Report or in the Engineering Report
evaluated for the then effective Borrowing Base, within three Business Days after receipt of the
proceeds thereof, the Borrower shall prepay the outstanding Advances in an amount equal to the
least of (i) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds resulting from such Material Disposition, (ii) 100% of
the value, if any, assigned to such Oil and Gas Properties under the then effective Borrowing
Base, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, and (iii) the principal amount of
Advances outstanding at such time; provided that, the prepayment under this Section 2.06(b)
shall not be required after the occurrence of the Junior Debt Payoff.  For the avoidance of doubt,
the prepayments required under this Section 2.06(b) shall not constitute nor be construed as a
consent to any Disposition that would not be permitted under the terms of this Agreement.
Section 2.07       Letters of Credit.
(a)       Commitment.    From time to time from the date of this Agreement until 30 days prior to the
Commitment Termination Date, at the request of the Borrower, the Issuing Lender shall, on the
terms and
39
conditions hereinafter set forth, issue, increase, or extend the Expiration Date of, Letters of Credit
for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day.  No Letter of Credit will be issued,
increased, or extended:
(i)        if such issuance, increase, or extension would cause the Letter of Credit Exposure to
exceed the lesser of (A) $15,000,000 and (B) the lesser of (1) the aggregate Commitments at
such time and (2) the Borrowing Base in effect at such time minus, in each case under this clause
(B), the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Advances at such time;
(ii)       if such Letter of Credit has an Expiration Date later than the earlier of (A) one year after the
date of issuance thereof (or, in the case of any extension thereof, one year after the date of such
extension) and (B) ten days prior to the Commitment Termination Date;
(iii)      unless the Letter of Credit Documents are in form and substance acceptable to the Issuing
Lender in its sole discretion;
(iv)       unless such Letter of Credit is a standby letter of credit not supporting the repayment of
indebtedness for borrowed money of any Person;
(v)        unless the Borrower has delivered to the Issuing Lender a completed and executed Letter
of Credit Application; provided that, if the terms of any such Letter of Credit Application conflicts
with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control;
(vi)       unless such Letter of Credit is governed by (A) the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits (2007 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 600,
or (B) the International Standby Practices (ISP98), International Chamber of Commerce
Publication No. 590, in either case, including any subsequent revisions thereof approved by a
Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce and adhered to by the Issuing Lender;
(vii)      if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its
terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any
Legal Requirement applicable to the Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender
shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit
generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender with
respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the
Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the date hereof, or shall
impose upon the Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
applicable on the date hereof and which the Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it;
(viii)     if the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing
Lender applicable to letters of credit generally;
(ix)       except as otherwise agreed by the Issuing Lender, if Letter of Credit is to be denominated
in a currency other than Dollars; or
(x)        a default of any Lender’s obligations to fund under Section 2.07(d) exists or any Lender is
at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless the Issuing Lender has entered into
satisfactory arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing Lender's risk
with respect to such Lender.
40
(b)       Participations.    Upon (A) the date of the issuance or increase of a Letter of Credit, and (B)
the date hereof as to the deemed issuance of the Existing Letters of Credit under Section 2.07(h),
the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have sold to each other Lender having a Commitment and
each other Lender having a Commitment shall have been deemed to have purchased from the
Issuing Lender a participation in the related Letter of Credit Obligations equal to such Lender's
Pro Rata Share at such date and such sale and purchase shall otherwise be in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.  The Issuing Lender shall promptly notify each such participant
Lender having a Commitment by telephone or telecopy of each Letter of Credit issued, increased,
or extended or converted and the actual dollar amount of such Lender's participation in such
Letter of Credit.
(c)       Issuing.  Each Letter of Credit shall be issued, increased, or extended pursuant to a Letter
of Credit Application (or by telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing by a Letter of Credit
Application), given not later than 10:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the fifth Business Day before
the date of the proposed issuance, increase, or extension of the Letter of Credit, and the Issuing
Lender shall give to each other Lender prompt notice thereof by telex, telephone or
telecopy.  Each Letter of Credit Application shall be delivered by facsimile or by mail specifying
the information required therein; provided that if such Letter of Credit Application is delivered by
facsimile, the Borrower shall follow such facsimile with an original by mail.  After the Issuing
Lender's receipt of such Letter of Credit Application (by facsimile or by mail) and upon fulfillment
of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Issuing Lender shall issue, increase, or
extend such Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower.  Each Letter of Credit Application
shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.
(d)       Reimbursement.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay on demand to the Issuing Lender an
amount equal to any amount paid by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit.  In the event
the Issuing Lender makes a payment pursuant to a request for draw presented under a Letter of
Credit and such payment is not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower upon demand, the Issuing
Lender shall give the Administrative Agent notice of the Borrower's failure to make such
reimbursement and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender having a
Commitment of the amount necessary to reimburse the Issuing Lender.  Upon such notice from
the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall promptly reimburse the Issuing Lender for such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount, and such reimbursement shall be deemed for all
purposes of this Agreement to be an Advance to the Borrower transferred at the Borrower's
request to the Issuing Lender.  If such reimbursement is not made by any Lender to the Issuing
Lender on the same day on which the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender to make
reimbursement to the Issuing Lender hereunder, such Lender shall pay interest on its Pro Rata
Share thereof to the Issuing Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.  The
Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably authorizes, empowers, and directs the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders to record and otherwise treat such reimbursements to the
Issuing Lender as Reference Rate Advances under a Borrowing requested by the Borrower to
reimburse the Issuing Lender that have been transferred to the Issuing Lender at the Borrower's
request.
(e)       Obligations Unconditional.  The obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement in
respect of each Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without
limitation, the following circumstances:
(i)        any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit Documents;
(ii)       any amendment or waiver of, or any consent to or departure from, any Letter of Credit
Documents;
41
(iii)      the existence of any claim, set‑off, defense, or other right which the Borrower may have at
any time against any beneficiary or transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom
any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender, or any other
person or entity, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement or in any Letter of Credit Documents, or any unrelated transaction;
(iv)       any statement or any other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent, invalid, or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect;
(v)        payment by the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft
or certificate which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or
(vi)       any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing.
provided, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph (e) shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver of the Borrower's rights under Section 2.07(f) below.
(f)       Liability of Issuing Lender.  The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of
Credit.  Neither the Issuing Lender nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible
for:
(i)        the use which may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith;
(ii)       the validity, sufficiency, or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon,
even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent,
or forged;
(iii)      payment by the Issuing Lender against presentation of documents which do not comply
with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or
adequate reference to the relevant Letter of Credit; or
(iv)       any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any
Letter of Credit (INCLUDING THE ISSUING LENDER'S OWN NEGLIGENCE),
except that the Borrower shall have a claim against the Issuing Lender, and the Issuing Lender
shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, as opposed to consequential, damages
suffered by the Borrower which a court determines in a final, non-appealable judgment were
caused by the Issuing Lender's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender may accept documents that
appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary.
(g)       Cash Collateral Account.
(i)        If the Borrower is required to deposit funds in the Cash Collateral Account pursuant to
Sections 2.04(c), 2.05(b), 2.17,  7.02(b), or 7.03(b), then the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent shall establish the Cash Collateral Account and the Borrower shall execute any
documents and agreements, including the Administrative Agent's standard form assignment of
deposit accounts, that the Administrative
42
Agent requests in connection therewith to establish the Cash Collateral Account and grant the
Administrative Agent a first priority security interest in such account and the funds therein.  The
Borrower hereby pledges to the Administrative Agent and grants the Administrative Agent a
security interest in the Cash Collateral Account, whenever established, all funds held in the Cash
Collateral Account from time to time, and all proceeds thereof as security for the payment of the
Obligations.
(ii)       So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, (A) the Administrative Agent may apply
the funds held in the Cash Collateral Account only to the reimbursement of any Letter of Credit
Obligations, and (B) the Administrative Agent shall release to the Borrower at the Borrower's
written request any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account in an amount up to but not
exceeding the excess, if any (immediately prior to the release of any such funds), of the total
amount of funds held in the Cash Collateral Account over the Letter of Credit Exposure.  During
the existence of any Default or Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may apply any funds
held in the Cash Collateral Account to the Obligations in any order determined by the
Administrative Agent, regardless of any Letter of Credit Exposure that may remain
outstanding.  The Issuing Lender may in its sole discretion at any time direct the Administrative
Agent to release to the Borrower any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account.
(iii)      The Administrative Agent shall exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation
of any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account which may bear interest or be invested in the
Administrative Agent's reasonable discretion and the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to
have exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that
which the Administrative Agent accords its own Property, it being understood that the
Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve
rights against any parties with respect to any such funds.
(h)       Existing Letters of Credit. The Issuing Lender, the Lenders and the Borrower agree that
effective as of the Effective Date, the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been
issued and maintained under, and to be governed by the terms and conditions of, this
Agreement.
(i)       Defaulting Lender.  If, at any time, a Defaulting Lender exists hereunder, then, at the
request of the Issuing Lender subject to Section 2.17(c), the Borrower shall deposit funds with
Administrative Agent into the Cash Collateral Account an amount equal to such Defaulting
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Exposure.
Section 2.08       Fees.
(a)       Commitment Fees.    The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender having a Commitment a commitment fee in an amount equal to the
Applicable Margin on the daily Unused Commitment Amount of such Lender, from the date of this
Agreement until the Commitment Termination Date; provided that, no commitment fee shall
accrue on the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender during the period such Lender remains a
Defaulting Lender.  The commitment fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the
last day of each March, June, September, and December commencing on June 30, 2010 and
continuing thereafter through and including the Commitment Termination Date.
(b)       Letter of Credit Fees.
(i)        Letter of Credit Fees.  Subject to Sections 2.17(c)(iii) and (iv),  the Borrower agrees to pay
(A) to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders having a Commitment a per
annum letter of credit fee for each Letter of Credit issued hereunder in an amount equal to the
greater of (1) Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances times the daily maximum amount
available to be drawn
43
under such Letter of Credit and (2) $750, and (B) to the Issuing Lender, a fronting fee for each
Letter of Credit equal to 0.25% per annum times on the face amount of such Letter of Credit.  The
fronting fee shall be payable annually in advance on the date of the issuance of the Letter of
Credit, and, in the case of an increase or extension only, on the date of such increase or such
extension.  The fee set forth in (A) above shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and
be due and payable on the last day of each March, June, September, and December
commencing June 30, 2010.
(ii)       The Borrower also agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender such other usual and customary
fees associated with any transfers, amendments, drawings, negotiations or reissuances of any
Letters of Credit.
(c)       Facility and Other Fees.  To the extent not otherwise included under Section 2.08(a) and
(b), the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees required to be paid under the
Fee Letters.
Section 2.09       Interest.
(a)       Applicable Interest Rates.  The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each Advance made by each Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal
amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:
(i)        Reference Rate Advances.  If such Advance is a Reference Rate Advance, a rate per
annum equal at all times to the Adjusted Reference Rate in effect from time to time plus the
Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each
calendar quarter and on the date such Reference Rate Advance shall be paid in full.
(ii)       Eurodollar Rate Advances.  If such Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per
annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the Eurodollar Rate for
such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last
day of such Interest Period, and, in the case of six-month Interest Periods, on the day that occurs
during such Interest Period three months from the first day of such Interest Period.
(b)       Usury Recapture.
(i)        If, with respect to any Lender, the effective rate of interest contracted for under the Loan
Documents, including the stated rates of interest and fees contracted for hereunder and any other
amounts contracted for under the Loan Documents that are deemed to be interest, at any time
exceeds the Maximum Rate, then the outstanding principal amount of the loans made by such
Lender hereunder shall bear interest at a rate which would make the effective rate of interest for
such Lender under the Loan Documents equal the Maximum Rate until the difference between
the amounts which would have been due at the stated rates and the amounts that were due at the
Maximum Rate (the "Lost Interest") has been recaptured by such Lender.
(ii)       If, when the loans made hereunder are repaid in full, the Lost Interest has not been fully
recaptured by such Lender pursuant to the preceding paragraph, then, to the extent permitted by
law, for the loans made hereunder by such Lender the interest rates charged under Section 2.09
hereunder shall be retroactively increased such that the effective rate of interest under the Loan
Documents was at the Maximum Rate since the effectiveness of this Agreement to the extent
necessary to recapture the Lost Interest not recaptured pursuant to the preceding sentence and,
to the extent allowed by law, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender the amount of the Lost
Interest remaining to be recaptured by such Lender.
44
(iii)        NOTWITHSTANDING the foregoing or any other term in this Agreement and the Loan
Documents to the contrary, it is the intention of each Lender and the Borrower to conform strictly
to any applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any
consideration THAT constitutes interest in excess of the Maximum Rate, then any such excess
shall be canceled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied
to the outstanding amount of the ADVANCES made hereunder by such Lender or be refunded to
the Borrower.
Section 2.10       Payments and Computations.
(a)       Payment Procedures.  The Borrower shall make each payment under this Agreement and
under the Notes not later than 12:00 p.m. (noon)  (Dallas, Texas time) on the day when due in
Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the location referred to in the Notes (or such other location
as the Administrative Agent shall designate in writing to the Borrower) in same day funds without
deduction, setoff, or counterclaim of any kind.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter
cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or fees ratably
(other than amounts payable solely to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, or a specific
Lender pursuant to Section 2.08(c), 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 8.05, or 9.07, but after taking into account
payments effected pursuant to Section 9.04) in accordance with each Lender's Pro Rata Share to
the Lenders for the account of their respective applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating
to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender or the Issuing Lender to such Lender
for the account of its applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.
(b)       Computations.  All computations of interest and fees shall be made by the Administrative
Agent, on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first day, but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable.  Each
determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(c)       Non‑Business Day Payments.  Whenever any payment shall be stated to be due on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day,
and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of
interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause
payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following
calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
(d)       Administrative Agent Reliance.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
written notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that
the Borrower shall not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each
Lender on such date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the extent
the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each
Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to
such Lender, together with interest, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal
Funds Rate for such day.
45
Section 2.11       Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether
voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set‑off, or otherwise) on account of the
Advances or Letter of Credit Obligations made by it in excess of its Pro Rata Share of payments
on account of the Advances or Letter of Credit Obligations obtained by all the Lenders (other than
as a result of a termination of a Defaulting Lender's Commitment under Section 2.04(c)), such
Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Advances made by them or Letter of Credit Obligations held by them as shall
be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of
them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered
from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such Lender's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of the participation sold by such
Lender to the purchasing Lender as a result of such excess payment to (b) the total amount of
such excess payment) of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable
share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to the
purchasing Lender to (ii) the total amount of all such required repayments to the purchasing
Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of
the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.11 may, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set‑off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of
such participation.  The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale
of a participation in any of its Advances or participations in Letter of Credit Exposure to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to
which the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply).
Section 2.12       Breakage Costs.  If (a) any payment of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Advance
or any Conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of the Interest
Period for such Advance, whether as a result of any payment or Conversion pursuant to
Section 2.05, the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Article VII, or otherwise, or
(b) the Borrower fails to make a principal or interest payment with respect to any Eurodollar Rate
Advance on the date such payment is due and payable, the Borrower shall, within 10 days of any
written demand sent by any Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such
Lender for any additional losses, out‑of‑pocket costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as
a result of such payment or nonpayment, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.
Section 2.13       Increased Costs.  If any Change in Law shall (a) impose, modify or deem
applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or
participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate)
or the Issuing Lender; (b) subject any Lender or the Issuing Lender to any tax of any kind
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of
Credit or any Eurodollar Rate Advance made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to
such Lender or the Issuing Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes covered by Section 2.14 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded
Tax payable by such Lender or the Issuing Lender); or (c) impose on any Lender or the Issuing
Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this
Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Advances made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Advance (or of maintaining its obligation to make
any such Advance), or to increase the cost to such Lender
46
or the Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of
maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount
of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of
principal, interest or any other amount) then, within thirty (30) days after demand by such Lender
or the Issuing Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case
may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   A certificate
as to the amount of such increased cost and detailing the calculation of such cost submitted to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.
(a)       Capital Adequacy.  If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in
Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such
Lender’s or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender's
capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Advances made by, or
participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the
Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender’s
or the Issuing Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such
Lender’s or the Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from
time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such
Lender’s or the Issuing Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.  A certificate
as to such amounts and detailing the calculation of such amounts submitted to the Borrower by
such Lender or the Issuing Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be,
the amount shown as due on any such certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof.
(b)       Letters of Credit.  If any Change in Law shall either (i) impose, modify, or deem applicable
any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by, or assets
held by, or deposits in or for the account of, the Issuing Lender or (ii) impose on the Issuing
Lender any other condition regarding the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Letters of
Credit or any Letter of Credit Obligations, and the result of any event referred to in the preceding
clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase the cost to the Issuing Lender of issuing or maintaining any
Letter of Credit (which increase in cost shall be determined by the Issuing Lender's reasonable
allocation of the aggregate of such cost increases resulting from such event), then, upon demand
by the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender, from time to time as specified
by the Issuing Lender, additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuing
Lender for such increased cost.  A certificate as to such increased cost incurred by the Issuing
Lender, as a result of any event mentioned in clause (i) or (ii) above, and detailing the calculation
of such increased costs submitted by the Issuing Lender to the Borrower, shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(c)       Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender’s or the Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower
shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13
for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date
that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the Issuing
Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to
such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above
shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
47
Section 2.14       Taxes.
(a)       No Deduction for Certain Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation
of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of
and without reduction or withholding for taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any
withholding or deduction of tax is required by applicable Legal Requirement (as determined in
the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding Agent), then (i) to the extent such taxes are
Indemnified Taxes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Other Taxes), the sum payable by the
Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent,
Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall
make such deductions and (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Legal Requirement.
(b)       Other Taxes.  Without limiting the provisions of clause (a) above, the Borrower agrees to (i)
pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes,
charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery or enforcement of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement, the Notes, or the other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"), or
(ii) or at the option of the Administrative Agent, to timely reimburse the Administrative Agent,  or
applicable Lender or Issuing Lender for the payment of any Other Taxes.
(c)       Indemnification.  THE BORROWER INDEMNIFIES EACH LENDER, THE ISSUING
LENDER, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF INDEMNIFIED
TAXES OR OTHER TAXES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INDEMNIFIED TAXES
OR OTHER TAXES IMPOSED BY ANY JURISDICTION ON AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER
THIS SECTION 2.14) PAID BY SUCH LENDER, THE ISSUING LENDER, OR THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (AS THE CASE MAY BE) AND ANY LIABILITY (INCLUDING
INTEREST AND EXPENSES) ARISING THEREFROM OR WITH RESPECT THERETO,
WHETHER OR NOT SUCH TAXES OR OTHER TAXES WERE CORRECTLY OR LEGALLY
ASSERTED.  EACH PAYMENT REQUIRED TO BE MADE BY THE BORROWER IN
RESPECT OF THIS INDEMNIFICATION SHALL BE MADE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANY PARTY CLAIMING SUCH INDEMNIFICATION WITHIN
30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE BORROWER RECEIVES WRITTEN DEMAND THEREFOR
FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AS ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, THE ISSUING LENDER, OR ANY SUCH LENDER.
(d)       Status of Lenders.  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax
purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder
or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign
Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally
entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: (i) duly completed copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E, as applicable) claiming eligibility for benefits of
an income tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party; (ii) duly completed copies
of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, (iii) in the
48
case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a
“bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of
the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign
corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies
of  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E, as applicable), or (v) any other form
prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United
States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation
as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or
deduction required to be made.  To the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, such
Foreign Lender shall deliver executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form
W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E, as applicable), IRS Form W-9, and/or other
certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable.
Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or
prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to
time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent),
executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal
backup withholding tax.
If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable
reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the
Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at
the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be
necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under
FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for
purposes of this Section 2.14(d), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after
the date of this Agreement.
(e)       Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender
determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes
as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has
paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount
equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts
paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise
to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the
Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the
relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon
the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, agrees to repay the
amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender
in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require
the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender to make available its tax returns (or
any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other
Person.
Section 2.15       Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation
under Section 2.13, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender
shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its
Advances hereunder or
49
to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in
the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future and
(ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise
be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Section 2.16       Replacement of Lender.  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section
2.13 or requires that the Borrower pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.14,  (ii) any
Lender suspends its obligation to continue, or Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances
pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) or Section 2.11, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) any
Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender (any such Lender, a "Subject Lender"), then (A) in the case
of a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent may, upon notice to the Subject Lender and the
Borrower, require such Subject Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.06), all of its
interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an
Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) and (B) in the case of any Subject Lender,
including a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may, upon notice to the Subject Lender and the
Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's sole cost and expense, require such Subject Lender
to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and
consents required by, Section 9.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations
(which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
(A)       as to assignments required by the Borrower, the Borrower shall have paid to the
Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 9.06;
(B)       such Subject Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Advances and participations in outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.12) from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Applicable Borrower (in the case
of all other amounts);
(C)       in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.13, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
thereafter;
(D)       such assignment does not conflict with applicable Legal Requirements; and
(E)       with respect to a Non-Consenting Lender, the proposed amendment, waiver, consent or
release with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document has been approved by the
Required Lenders and such amendment, waiver, consent or release can be effected as a result
of the assignment contemplated by this Section.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a
result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Solely for purposes of effecting the
assignment required for a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.15 and to the extent permitted
under applicable Legal Requirements, each Lender hereby designates and appoints the
Administrative Agent as true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority,
for and on behalf of and in the name of such Lender to execute, acknowledge and deliver the
Assignment and Acceptance required hereunder if such Lender was a Defaulting Lender and
such Lender shall be bound thereby as fully and effectively as if such Lender had
50
personally executed, acknowledged and delivered the same.  In lieu of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent replacing a Defaulting Lender as provided in this Section 2.16, the
Borrower may terminate such Defaulting Lender's Commitment as provided in Section 2.04.
Section 2.17       Payments and Deductions to a Defaulting Lender.
(a)       If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
Section 2.01(a), Section 2.07(d), or Section 2.10(d) then the Administrative Agent may, in its
discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received
by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations
under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid in cash.
(b)       If a Defaulting Lender as a result of the exercise of a set-off shall have received a payment
in respect of its outstanding Advances or pro rata share of Letter of Credit Exposure which results
in its outstanding Advances and share of Letter of Credit Exposure being less than its Pro Rata
Share of the aggregate outstanding Advances and Letter of Credit Exposure, then no payments
will be made to such Defaulting Lender until such time as all amounts due and owing to the
Lenders have been equalized in accordance with each Lender’s respective pro rata share of the
aggregate outstanding Advances and Letter of Credit Exposure. Further, if at any time prior to the
acceleration or maturity of the Advances, the Administrative Agent shall receive any payment in
respect of principal of an Advance or a Reimbursement Obligation while one or more Defaulting
Lenders shall be party to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall apply such payment first
to the Borrowings for which such Defaulting Lender(s) shall have failed to fund its pro rata share
until such time as such Borrowing(s) are paid in full or each Lender (including each Defaulting
Lender) is owed its Pro Rata Share of all Advances then outstanding. After acceleration or
maturity of the Advances, subject to the first sentence of this Section 2.17(b), all principal will be
paid ratably as provided in Section 2.11.
(c)       If any Letter of Credit Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender
then:
(i)        such Letter of Credit Exposure shall be automatically reallocated among the Non-
Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share of such Defaulting
Lender's share of the Letter of Credit Exposure (and each Lender is deemed to have purchased
and assigned such participation interest in such reallocated portion of the Letter of Credit
Exposure) but only to the extent that (A) the sum of each Non-Defaulting Lender's outstanding
Advances plus its share of the Letter of Credit Exposure, after giving effect to the reallocation
provided herein, does not exceed the lesser of such Non-Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Borrowing Base and such Non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment, and (B) the conditions set
forth in Section 3.02 are satisfied at such time; provided that, subject to Section 9.17, no such
reallocation will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Lender or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender or
cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender;
(ii)       if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected,
then the Borrower shall, within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent,
cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s share of the Letter of Credit Exposure (after giving
effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.07(g) for so long as such Letter of Credit Exposure is outstanding;
(iii)      if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit
Exposure pursuant to this Section 2.17 then the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to
such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.08 (b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s
Letter of
51
Credit Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is cash
collateralized;
(iv)       if the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to
clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.08(b) shall be
adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Pro Rata Share;
(v)        if any Defaulting Lender’s share of the Letter of Credit Exposure is neither cash
collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to the preceding provisions, then, without prejudice to any
rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable
under Section 2.08(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s share of the Letter of Credit
Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Lender until such Letter of Credit Exposure is cash
collateralized and/or reallocated.
(d)       In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Lender each
agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to
be a Defaulting Lender, then (i) the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted
to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Commitment and on such date such Lender shall be
deemed to have purchased at par such of the Advances or participations in Letters of Credit of
the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for
such Lender to hold such Advances and Letter of Credit Exposure in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share, and (ii) if no Default exists, then any cash collateral posted by the Borrower pursuant
to clause (c)(ii) above with respect to such Lender shall be returned to the Borrower.

(a)       the following statements shall be true (and each of the giving of the applicable Notice of
Borrowing, Notice of Conversion or Continuation, or Letter of Credit Application and the
acceptance by the Borrower of the proceeds of such Borrowing or the issuance, increase, or
extension of such Letter of Credit shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower
or the reallocation of the Letter of Credit Exposure that on the date of such Borrowing or on the
date of such issuance, increase, or extension of such Letter of Credit or the date of such
reallocation, as applicable, such statements are true):
(i)        all representations and warranties contained in Article IV of this Agreement and the

the date of the issuance, increase, or extension of such Letter of Credit, before and after giving
effect to such Borrowing or to the issuance, increase, or extension of such Letter of Credit and to
the application of the proceeds from such Borrowing, as though made on and as of such date
(except in the case of representations and warranties which are made solely as of an earlier date
or time, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as

representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text
thereof);
(ii)       no Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from such Borrowing or from the
application of the proceeds therefrom, or would result from the issuance, increase, or extension of
such Letter of Credit; and
(iii)      at all times prior to the occurrence of the Junior Debt Payoff, the Borrower has certified to
the Administrative Agent that the incurrence of such Borrowing or the issuance, increase or
extension of such Letter of Credit would not cause the sum of (A) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all Advances hereunder plus (B) the aggregate Letter of Credit Exposure at
such time to exceed the then effective First Lien Cap (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).
(b)       the Administrative Agent shall have received such other approvals, opinions, or
documents as any Lender through the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
Each request for a Borrowing and each request for the issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit and each reallocation of Letter of Credit Exposure shall be
deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower on the date thereof as to the
matters specified in this Section 3.02.

(a)       The Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders copies of the
Financial Statements, and the Financial Statements are accurate and complete in all material
respects and present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of their respective dates and for their respective periods in
accordance with GAAP.  All projections, estimates, and pro forma financial information furnished
by the Borrower, whether pursuant to financial statements or in connection with other information
delivered to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, were prepared on the basis of assumptions,
data, information, tests, or conditions believed to be reasonable at the time such projections,
estimates, and pro forma financial information were made in light of current and foreseeable
conditions (it being understood that projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts
and that actual results may differ from projected results).
(b)       Since December 31, 2008, no event or circumstance that could cause a Material Adverse
Change has occurred.
Section 4.06       True and Complete Disclosure.  All factual information (excluding estimates)
heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in writing to any Lender or the Administrative Agent for purposes of or in
connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby is, and all other such factual information hereafter furnished by or on behalf of
the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries in writing to the Administrative Agent or any of the
Lenders shall be, true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such
information is dated or certified and does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading
at such time.
Section 4.07       Litigation; Compliance with Laws.
(a)       There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened action or proceeding
affecting the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries before any court, Governmental
Authority or arbitrator that could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change or
which purports to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement, any
Note, or any other Loan Document.  Additionally, there is no pending or, to the best knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened action or proceeding instituted against the Borrower or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries which seeks to adjudicate the Borrower or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries as bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts under any law relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for
relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee or other similar official for it or for any substantial
part of its Property.
(b)       The Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with
all material statutes, rules, regulations, orders, and restrictions of any Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of their
respective Property.  The offer, sale, and issuance of all outstanding Equity Interests in the
Borrower have been made in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, including
without limitation federal and state Legal Requirements relating to the offer and sale of securities.
Section 4.08       Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of the Advances will be used by the Borrower
for the purposes described in Section 5.09.  The Borrower is not engaged in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of
Regulation U).  No proceeds of any Advance will be used to purchase or carry any margin stock
in violation of Regulation T, U or X.
59
Section 4.09       Investment Company Act.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Section 4.10       Taxes.
(a)       Reports and Payments.  All Returns (as defined below in clause (c) of this Section)
required to be filed by or on behalf of the Borrower, its Restricted Subsidiaries, or any member of
the Controlled Group (hereafter collectively called the "Tax Group") have been duly filed on a
timely basis or appropriate extensions have been obtained,  except where the failure to so file
would not be reasonably expected to cause a Material Adverse Change and such Returns are
and will be true, complete, and correct in all material respects; and all Taxes shown to be
payable on the Returns or on subsequent assessments with respect thereto will have been paid
in full on a timely basis, and no other Taxes will be payable by the Tax Group with respect to
items or periods covered by such Returns, except in each case to the extent of (i) reserves
reflected in the Interim Financial Statements or (ii) taxes that are being contested in good
faith.  The reserves for accrued Taxes reflected in the financial statements delivered to the
Lenders under this Agreement are adequate in the aggregate for the payment of all unpaid
Taxes, whether or not disputed, for the period ended as of the date thereof and for any period
prior thereto, and for which the Tax Group may be liable in its own right, as withholding agent or
as a transferee of the assets of, or successor to, any Person.
(b)       Taxes Definition.  "Taxes" in this Section 4.10 shall mean all taxes, charges, fees, levies,
or other assessments imposed by any federal, state, local, or foreign taxing authority, including
without limitation, income, gross receipts, excise, real or personal property, sales, occupation,
use, service, leasing, environmental, value added, transfer, payroll, and franchise taxes (and
including any interest, penalties, or additions to tax attributable to or imposed on with respect to
any such assessment).
(c)       Returns Definition.  "Returns" in this Section 4.10 shall mean any federal, state, local, or
foreign report, estimate, declaration of estimated Tax, information statement or return relating to,
or required to be filed in connection with, any Taxes, including any information return or report
with respect to backup withholding or other payments of third parties.
Section 4.11       Pension Plans.  All Plans are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable provisions of ERISA.  No Termination Event has occurred with respect to any Plan,
and each Plan has complied with and been administered in all material respects in accordance
with applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code.  No "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred and there has been no excise tax imposed under
Section 4971 of the Code.  No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Multiemployer
Plan, and each Multiemployer Plan has complied with and been administered in all material
respects with applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code.  The present value of all benefits
vested under each Plan (based on the assumptions used to fund such Plan) did not, as of the last
annual valuation date applicable thereto, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to
such vested benefits.  Neither the Borrower nor any member of the Controlled Group has had a
complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan for which there is any withdrawal
liability.  As of the most recent valuation date applicable thereto, neither the Borrower nor any
member of the Controlled Group would become subject to any liability under ERISA if the
Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group has received notice that any Multiemployer
Plan is insolvent or in reorganization.  Based upon GAAP existing as of the date of this
Agreement and current factual circumstances, the Borrower has no reason to believe that the
annual cost during the term of this Agreement to the Borrower or any member of the Controlled
Group for post-retirement benefits to be provided to the current and former employees of the
Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group under Plans that are welfare benefit plans (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) could, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to cause a
Material Adverse Change.
60
Section 4.12       Condition of Property; Casualties.  Each of the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries has good and defensible title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, or has the right to

material Properties owned or leased by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the
continuing operations of the Borrower and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries are in good repair,
working order and operating condition (subject to normal wear and tear).  Since December 31,
2008, neither the business nor the material Properties of the Borrower and each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than the Properties of the Merger Company), taken as a whole, has been
materially and adversely affected as a result of any fire, explosion, earthquake, flood, drought,
windstorm, accident, strike or other labor disturbance, embargo, requisition or taking of Property
or cancellation of contracts, Permits, or concessions by a Governmental Authority, riot, activities
of armed forces, or acts of God or of any public enemy.  Since December 31, 2008, neither the
business nor the material properties of the Merger Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

extent any such change or event is disclosed in public filings made by the Merger Company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission since such date but prior to February 19, 2010
(including any such disclosure in respect of the nature, magnitude or consequences of such
change or event) and no event or circumstance that could cause a "Target Material Adverse
Effect" as defined in the Merger Agreement has have occurred.  Since the Effective Date, neither
the business nor the material Properties of the Borrower and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, has been materially and adversely affected as a result of any fire, explosion,
earthquake, flood, drought, windstorm, accident, strike or other labor disturbance, embargo,
requisition or taking of Property or cancellation of contracts, Permits, or concessions by a
Governmental Authority, riot, activities of armed forces, or acts of God or of any public enemy.

or corporate restriction or provision of applicable law or governmental regulation that could
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.  Neither the Borrower nor any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries is in default in any material respect under or with respect to any
contract, agreement, lease, or other instrument to which the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary is a party.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has received

61
(b)       Certain Liabilities.  To the Borrower's actual knowledge, none of the present or previously
owned, leased or operated Property of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, wherever
located, (i) has been placed on or proposed to be placed on the National Priorities List, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation Liability Information System list, or
their state or local analogs, or have been otherwise investigated, designated, listed, or identified

or could reasonably be expected to result in the need for Response that would cause a Material
Adverse Change.
(c)       Certain Actions.  Without limiting the foregoing, (i) all necessary notices have been
properly filed, and no further action  is required under current Environmental Law as to each
Response or other restoration or remedial project undertaken by the Borrower or its Restricted

Restricted Subsidiaries is subject to any Lien other than Permitted Liens.  On the date of this
Agreement, all governmental actions and all other filings, recordings, registrations, third party
consents and other actions which are necessary to create and perfect the Liens provided for in
the Security Instruments will have been made, obtained and taken in all relevant jurisdictions. 
Other than to the extent such could not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse
Change,  all leases and agreements for the conduct of business of the Borrower and its
Restricted Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting, in full force and effect and there exists no
default or event of default or circumstance which with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both
would give rise to a default by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, or to the Borrower's
knowledge, by any of the other parties thereto, under any such leases or agreements.  Neither
the Borrower nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or arrangement
(other than this Agreement, the Security Instruments, the Second Lien Loan Documents and the

ARTICLE V
AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS
So long as any Note or any amount under any Loan Document shall remain unpaid, any Letter of
Credit shall remain outstanding, or any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, the
Borrower agrees, unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing, to comply with
the following covenants.
Section 5.01       Compliance with Laws, Etc.  The Borrower shall comply, and cause each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements.  Without limiting the generality and coverage of the foregoing, the Borrower shall
comply, and shall cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects,
with all Environmental Laws and all laws, regulations, or directives with respect to equal
employment opportunity and employee safety in all jurisdictions in which the Borrower, or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries do business; provided, however, that this Section 5.01 shall not
prevent the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from, in good faith and with reasonable
diligence, contesting the validity or application of any such Legal Requirements by appropriate
legal proceedings.  Without limitation of the foregoing, the Borrower shall, and shall cause each
of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, (a) maintain and possess all authorizations, Permits, licenses,
trademarks, trade names, rights and copyrights which are necessary to the conduct of its
business and (b) obtain, as soon as practicable, all consents or approvals required from any
states of the United States (or other Governmental Authorities) necessary to grant the
Administrative Agent an Acceptable Security Interest in the Borrower's and its Restricted
Subsidiaries' Oil and Gas Properties.
Section 5.02       Maintenance of Insurance.
(a)       The Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, procure and
maintain or shall cause to be procured and maintained continuously in effect policies of
insurance in form and amounts and issued by companies, associations, or organizations
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, covering such casualties, risks, perils,
liabilities and other hazards reasonably required by the Administrative Agent.  In addition, the
Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, comply with all
requirements regarding insurance contained in the Security Instruments.
(b)       All certified copies of policies or certificates thereof, and endorsements and renewals
thereof shall be delivered to and retained by the Administrative Agent.  All policies of insurance
shall either have attached thereto a Lender's loss payable endorsement for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, as loss payee in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or
shall name the Administrative Agent as an additional insured, as applicable.  The Borrower shall
furnish the Administrative Agent with a certificate of insurance or a certified copy of all policies of
insurance required.  All policies or certificates of insurance shall set forth the coverage, the limits
of liability, the name of the carrier, the policy number,
64
and the period of coverage.  In addition, all policies of insurance required under the terms hereof
shall contain an endorsement or agreement by the insurer that any loss shall be payable in
accordance with the terms of such policy notwithstanding any act of negligence of the Borrower,
or a Restricted Subsidiary or any party holding under the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary
which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of the insurance and the further agreement of the
insurer waiving all rights of setoff, counterclaim or deductions against the Borrower and its
Restricted Subsidiaries.  All such policies shall contain a provision that notwithstanding any
contrary agreements between the Borrower, its Restricted Subsidiaries, and the applicable
insurance company, such policies will not be canceled, allowed to lapse without renewal,
surrendered or amended (which provision shall include any reduction in the scope or limits of
coverage) without at least 30 days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent.  In the event
that, notwithstanding the "lender's loss payable endorsement" requirement of this Section 5.02,
the proceeds of any insurance policy described above are paid to the Borrower or a Restricted
Subsidiary, except as permitted under Section 5.02(c) below, the Borrower shall deliver such
proceeds to the Administrative Agent immediately upon receipt.
(c)       Prior to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, (i) up to $5,000,000 of the

Environment that could reasonably be expected to result in Response activities and that could
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.
Section 5.08       Agreement to Pledge.  The Borrower shall, and shall cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to the Administrative Agent an Acceptable Security Interest in any Property of
the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary now owned or hereafter acquired promptly after receipt

or the Borrower be required to grant an Acceptable Security Interest in any Oil and Gas

Administrative Agent delivers the Borrower a form of Mortgage for such Oil and Gas Properties
(other than any exhibits or schedules thereto)) grant an Acceptable Security Interest in all of the
Borrower’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Oil and Gas Properties (whether or not such Oil and
Gas Properties constitute Proven Reserves).  Such form of Mortgage shall reaffirm any

actions and execute and deliver such documents and instruments as the Administrative Agent
shall require to ensure that the Administrative Agent shall, at all times, have received satisfactory
title information (including, if requested, supplemental or new title opinions addressed to it),
which title information (a) shall collectively cover at least 80% of the present value of the Proven
Reserves of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries as determined by the Administrative

Section 5.11       Further Assurances; Cure of Title Defects.  The Borrower shall, and shall cause
each Restricted Subsidiary to, cure promptly any defects in the creation and issuance of the
Notes and the
70
execution and delivery of the Security Instruments and this Agreement.  The Borrower hereby
authorizes the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to file any financing statements without the
signature of the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law in order to perfect or maintain
the perfection of any security interest granted under any of the Loan Documents.  The Borrower
at its expense will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, promptly execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent upon its reasonable request all such other documents, agreements and
instruments to comply with or accomplish the covenants and agreements of the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the Security Instruments and this Agreement, or to
further evidence and more fully describe the collateral intended as security for the Notes, or to
correct any omissions in the Security Instruments, or to state more fully the security obligations
set out herein or in any of the Security Instruments, or to perfect, protect or preserve any Liens
created pursuant to any of the Security Instruments, or to make any recordings, to file any notices
or obtain any consents, all as may be necessary or appropriate in connection therewith or to
enable the Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies with respect to
any Collateral.  Within 60 days after (a) a request by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to
cure any title defects or exceptions that are not Permitted Liens raised by such information or (b)
a notice by the Administrative Agent that the Borrower has failed to comply with Section 5.10
above, the Borrower shall (i) cure such title defects or exceptions that are not Permitted Liens or
substitute acceptable Oil and Gas Properties with no title defects or exceptions except for
Permitted Liens covering Collateral of an equivalent value and (ii) deliver to the Administrative
Agent satisfactory title evidence (including supplemental or new title opinions meeting the
foregoing requirements) in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its
reasonable business judgment as to the Borrower's and its Restricted Subsidiaries' ownership of
such Oil and Gas Properties and the Administrative Agent's Liens and security interests therein
as are required to maintain compliance with Section 5.10.  If, within such 60-day period, the
Borrower fails to cure any such title defect or exception as required under the foregoing clause
(a) or fails to deliver the title evidence required under the foregoing clause (b), such failure shall
not be a Default (other than if such failure otherwise constitutes a Default under Section 7.01(n)),
but instead the Administrative Agent shall have the right to exercise the following remedy in its
sole discretion from time to time, and any failure to so exercise this remedy at any time shall not
be a waiver as to future exercise of the remedy by the Administrative Agent.  To the extent that
the Administrative Agent is not satisfied with title to any portion of any Oil and Gas Property after
such 60-day period has elapsed, such unacceptable Oil and Gas Property shall not count
towards the 80% requirement under Section 5.10 above, and the Administrative Agent may send
a notice to the Borrower and the Lenders that the then effective Borrowing Base shall be reduced
by an amount as determined by the Administrative Agent or, if elected by the Required Lenders,
by the Required Lenders, to cause the Borrower to be in compliance with the requirement to
provide acceptable title information on 80% (by value) of the Borrower’s and its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ Oil and Gas Properties.  This new Borrowing Base shall become effective
immediately after receipt of such notice.  If the Borrowing Base is reduced pursuant to this
Section 5.11 and such a reduction causes a Borrowing Base Deficiency, then (x) Borrower shall
prepay the Advances or make deposits into the Cash Collateral Account to provide cash
collateral for the Letters of Credit, in three consecutive monthly installments each equal to one-
third of such Borrowing Base Deficiency with the first such installment due 30 days after the date
such deficiency notice is received by the Borrower from the Administrative Agent and each
following installment due 30 days after the preceding installment, with each prepayment of
Advances  accompanied by accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such
prepayment and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such
prepayment being made on such date, and (y) such title defect or exception giving rise to such
Borrowing Base reduction shall not constitute an Event of Default hereunder (other than to the
extent it constitutes a Default under Section 7.01(n)), unless such title defect or exception is
prohibited under Section 6.01.  For the avoidance of doubt and for all purposes under this
Agreement, if title to any of the Oil and Gas Property of the Borrower or Restricted Subsidiary (or
any material part thereof) shall become the subject matter of litigation before any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change
with respect to the Borrower's or such Restricted Subsidiary’s title to such Oil and Gas
Properties, taken as a whole, then such litigation may be deemed to
71
be a title defect or exception that is not a Permitted Lien regardless of whether the Borrower’s or
such Restricted Subsidiary’s record title is then effected.
Section 5.12       Material Agreements.  The Borrower shall, and shall cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, comply with all material terms, conditions, or covenants of any material contract or
agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which they
or their Properties may be bound except to the extent where the failure to do so could not
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.
Section 5.13       Leases; Development and Maintenance.  The Borrower will, and will cause its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, except to the extent failure to do any of the matters set forth below
would not have a Material Adverse Change:  (a) pay and discharge promptly, or cause to be paid
and discharged promptly, all rentals, delay rentals, royalties, overriding royalties, payments out of
production and other indebtedness or obligations accruing under, and perform or cause to be
performed each and every act, matter or thing required by each and all of, the oil and gas leases
and all other agreements and contracts constituting or affecting the Oil and Gas Properties of the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except where the amount thereof is being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings), (b) do all other things necessary to keep unimpaired its
rights thereunder and prevent any forfeiture thereof or default thereunder, and operate or cause to
be operated such Properties as a prudent operator would in accordance with industry standard
practices and in compliance with all applicable proration and conservation Legal Requirements
and any other Legal Requirements of every Governmental Authority, whether state, federal,
municipal or other jurisdiction, from time to time constituted to regulate the development and
operations of oil and gas properties and the production and sale of oil, gas and other
Hydrocarbons therefrom, and (c) maintain (or cause to be maintained) the Leases, wells, units
and acreage to which the Oil and Gas Properties of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries
pertain in a prudent manner consistent with industry standard practices.

Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into or maintain any Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract with any
Person other than Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts (i) with an Approved Counterparty and (ii) the
notional volumes for which (when aggregated with other Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts then in
effect other than basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged pursuant to other Hedge
Contracts) do not exceed, as of the date such Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract is executed or at any
time during the term of this Agreement, the percentage set forth below of the Borrower’s and
Guarantors’ Current Production for each month during the period during which such Hydrocarbon
Hedge Contract is in effect, for each of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, calculated
separately:
Calendar Year Hedged

provided, that, if at any time, the aggregate notional volumes of all the Borrower’s and its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ respective hedges of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas
(calculated separately) under all Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts corresponding to the delivery
dates of the Current Production exceeds the “Percentage Limitation” of Current Production, then
Borrower shall have the opportunity to cure such excess by (A) furnishing to Administrative
Agent, by no later than 5:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas, time) on the next Test Date, a detailed
calculation of such determination and such excess, in form, and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (B) no later than 15 days after such Test Date,
Borrower shall (1) furnish to Administrative Agent an updated Engineering Report (the "Updated
Engineering Report") in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
and (2) terminate, create off-setting positions or otherwise unwind existing Hydrocarbon Hedge
Contracts such that, after giving effect thereto, no more than “Percentage Limitation” of the
Borrower's and its Restricted Subsidiaries' aggregate Current Production of crude oil, natural gas
liquids and natural gas are covered by all Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts (it being understood
that volumes of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas are calculated separately and that
natural gas liquids may be hedged on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
by Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or a combination
thereof), and Borrower shall deliver a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent certifying to that effect; provided further that, if an Updated Engineering
Report is updating an Independent Engineering Report, such Updated Engineering Report shall
be an Independent Engineering Report.    No Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract shall have a tenor of
longer than 5 years.  For purposes of the foregoing volume limitations, floors and puts shall be
disregarded.
(d)       Acquisition Hedging.  With respect to anticipated production of Hydrocarbons which are
the subject of an Acquisition under which the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary is the
purchaser, the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries may enter into Hydrocarbon Hedge
Contracts covering such anticipated production prior to effecting such Acquisition (regardless of
the fact that such production is not yet owned by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary) so
long as (A) a binding purchase agreement has been executed by the Borrower or a Restricted
Subsidiary and the counterparties to such Acquisition, (B) at the time such Hydrocarbon Hedge
Contracts are entered into, the aggregate Unused Commitment Amount is greater than or equal
to 10% of the lesser of the Borrowing Base and the aggregate Commitments then in effect, (C)
the Borrower shall, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to terminate, unwind or otherwise
liquidate all such Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts upon the earliest of (1) the 90th day following
the full execution of the purchase agreement related to such Acquisition if the Acquisition has not
been
82
fully consummated by such date, (2) within 3 Business Days after the date upon on which such
purchase agreement is terminated by any party thereto, and (3) the date upon which the Borrower
or any Restricted Subsidiary believes, with reasonable certainty, that such Acquisition will not be
consummated, and (D) at the time such Hedge Contracts are entered into, but after giving pro
forma effect to such Acquisition (i.e. assuming that such Acquisition had gone into effect prior to
or as of the date such Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts are entered into and Engineering Report,
for purposes of calculating Current Production, includes any Engineering Report covering the
reserves that are the subject of such Acquisition)), such Hedge Contracts would be permitted
under subsection (b) above and such Hedge Contracts shall otherwise comply with the terms of
this Agreement.
Section 6.15       Post-Closing Hedging.  On or prior to two Business Days after the Effective
Date, the Borrower shall have entered into Hedge Contracts to effect the hedge positions for the
volumes, years and forecasted production necessary in order to create an additional $1,400,000

the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Borrower shall be taken into account in calculating this ratio)
(a) consolidated current assets to (b) consolidated current liabilities, to be less than 1.00 to
1.00.  For purposes of this calculation (i) "current assets" shall include, as of the date of
calculation, the Unused Commitment Amount (but only to the extent the Borrower is able to
borrow under this Agreement and be pro forma compliance with its financial covenants herein)
but shall exclude any asset representing a valuation account arising from the application of
SFAS 133 or 143, and (ii) "current liabilities" shall exclude, as of the date of calculation, the
current portion of long–term Debt existing under this Agreement, the Second Lien Credit
Agreement or any Third Lien Loan Document, and any liabilities representing a valuation
account arising from the application of SFAS 133 and 143.
Section 6.18       Leverage Ratio.  The Borrower shall not permit Leverage Ratio to exceed (a)

of principal (whether by redemption, purchase, retirement, defeasance, set-off or otherwise),
interest, premiums and fees in respect of the Second Lien Debt or (b) amend, supplement or
otherwise modify the terms of the Second Lien Debt if such amendment, supplement or

prepayments of principal of Second Lien Debt required pursuant to Section 2.06(c) of the Second
Lien Credit Agreement as in effect on the Amendment No. 11 Effective Date (along with any

fifteen days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent thereof and (b) granting to the
Administrative Agent to secure the Obligations an Acceptable Security Interest in the same
Property pursuant to Security Instruments in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.  In connection therewith, each Loan Party shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, execute

Advances are deposited into the Controlled Account; provided that from the Amendment No. 13
Effective Date until the date the Blocked Account Control Agreement is entered into and subject
to the other terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request that Advances in an

any funds are withdrawn from the Controlled Account (A) all representations and warranties
contained above in Article IV and all representations and warranties contained in the Security
Instruments, the Guaranties, and each of the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all
material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any
representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text
thereof) on and as of the date of such withdrawal and to the application of such funds, as though
made on and as of such date (except in the case of representations and warranties which are
made solely as of an earlier date or time, which representations and warranties shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date or time, except that such materiality qualifier
shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or
modified by materiality in the text thereof); (B) no Default has occurred and is continuing or would
result from the application of such funds; (C) for the avoidance of doubt, such funds will be used
only to the extent the proceeds of any Advance could be used under this Agreement, and (D) the
Borrower would be in pro forma compliance with Section 6.17 and Section 6.18 as of the most
recent fiscal quarter end for which financial statements have been delivered to the Administrative
Agent after giving effect to such withdrawal of funds; (ii) the Borrower has delivered to the
Administrative Agent an officer’s certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower

following Business Day the Borrower shall, or shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to, transfer
funds from such accounts to the Controlled Account in the amount of such excess.
(c)       From time to time, if a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, then notwithstanding other terms
provided in this Agreement permitting the Borrower to remedy such deficiency over a period of
time or by providing additional Collateral, the Borrower shall immediately apply funds then in the
Controlled Account to make a prepayment of the Advances, and if the Advances have been
repaid in full, make deposits into the Cash Collateral Account to provide cash collateral for the
Letter of Credit Exposure, in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i) the funds then in the
Controlled Account and (ii) the amount necessary to cure the Borrowing Base Deficiency.  Each
prepayment pursuant to this Section 6.25(c) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the
amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.12 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date.  Each prepayment
under this Section 6.25(c) shall be applied to the Advances as determined by the Administrative
Agent except that, with respect to a specific Borrowing Base Deficiency, if the Borrower elects to
cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency with five monthly installments as permitted under Section
2.05(b) then the prepayments under this Section 6.25(c) shall be applied as prepayments of such
remaining monthly installments on a pro rata basis.  To effectuate the payments and Cash
Collateral deposit required under this clause (c), the Borrower hereby authorizes Wells Fargo, as
a depository bank, to initiate debit entries to the Controlled Account to debit such required
amount from such account.  The Borrower represents that the Borrower is and will be the owner
of all funds in such Controlled Account.  Borrower, for itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges
that (x) such debit entries may cause an overdraft of such accounts which may result in Wells
Fargo’s refusal to honor items drawn on such accounts until adequate deposits are made to such
account, (y) Wells Fargo is under no duty or obligation to initiate any debit entry for any purpose,
and (z) if a debit is not made the payment may be late or past due.

(d)       Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the
Advances, Reimbursement Obligations and payment obligations then owing under Hedge
Contracts and Banking Services Obligations, ratably among the Lenders, the Issuing Lender, the
Swap Counterparties and the holders of the Banking Service Obligations in proportion to the
respective amounts described in this clause Fourth payable to them;
89
(e)       Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender, to cash

(f)       Sixth,  to the Second Lien Agent or the applicable administrative agent or secured party for
the Third Lien Debt, if any, as required under the Intercreditor Agreement;
(g)       Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to
the Borrower or as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Banking Services Obligations and Obligations arising under
Hedge Contracts shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative
Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as
the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable holder of such Obligation, as the case
may be.  Each holder of such Obligation not a party to this Agreement that has given the notice
contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have
acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms
of Article VIII for itself and its Affiliates as if a “Lender” party hereto.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 7.06 may not be amended, waived
or otherwise modified in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments or order of
application required hereunder without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely
affected thereby.
ARTICLE VIII
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE ISSUING LENDER
Section 8.01       Authorization and Action.  Each Lender that is an Existing Lender is deemed to
have appointed Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent and the issuing lender under
the Existing Credit Agreement; provided, however, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. does not assume and
shall not be obligated to pay, perform or discharge any claim, debt, obligation, expense or liability
of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., if any, of any kind, whether known or unknown, absolute or
contingent, under the Loan Documents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) or
otherwise, arising out of any act or omission occurring on or before the date hereof under the
Loan Documents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement).  The Borrower, the Existing
Lenders, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. agree that Section 8.06 of the
Existing Credit Agreement shall apply to MUFG Union Bank, N.A.'s resignation pursuant to the
Assignment; provided that, such parties hereby waive the 30 days prior written notice required
thereunder as to such resignation.  Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and of the
other Loan Documents, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  As to
any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including,
without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain
from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the
instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders
and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to
take any action that exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to
this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or applicable law.
Section 8.02       Administrative Agent's Reliance, Etc.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any
of its directors, officers, agents, or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken (INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S OWN NEGLIGENCE) by it or them under
or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for its or their own
gross negligence
90
or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative
Agent:  (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Administrative Agent
receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for
the Borrower), independent public accountants, and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice
of such counsel, accountants, or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender
and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties, or representations
made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (d) shall not have
any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document on the part of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries or to inspect the Property (including the books and records) of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency, or value of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document; and (f) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate, or other instrument or writing
(which may be by telecopier) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party
or parties.
Section 8.03       The Administrative Agent and Its Affiliates.  With respect to its Commitment, the
Advances made by it, and the Notes issued to it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Administrative Agent.  The term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless
otherwise expressly indicated, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.  The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee
under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any
such Subsidiary, all as if the Administrative Agent were not an agent hereunder and without any
duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
Section 8.04       Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on the Interim
Financial Statements and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it shall, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement.
Section 8.05       Indemnification.  THE LENDERS SEVERALLY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE ISSUING LENDER AND EACH AFFILIATE THEREOF
AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS (TO THE
EXTENT NOT REIMBURSED BY THE BORROWER), ACCORDING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE
PRO RATA SHARES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS,
LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES,
OR DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE WHATSOEVER WHICH MAY BE
IMPOSED ON, INCURRED BY, OR ASSERTED AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
AND THE ISSUING LENDER IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTION TAKEN OR OMITTED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
OR THE ISSUING LENDER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT (INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S AND THE ISSUING LENDER'S
OWN NEGLIGENCE), AND INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS
AND ANY LIABILITIES ARISING UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, PROVIDED THAT NO
LENDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY PORTION OF SUCH LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS,
LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES,
OR DISBURSEMENTS RESULTING FROM
91
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S OR THE ISSUING LENDER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AS DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION
BY FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT.  WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE
FOREGOING, EACH LENDER AGREES TO REIMBURSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
AND THE ISSUING LENDER PROMPTLY UPON DEMAND FOR ITS RATABLE SHARE OF
ANY OUT‑OF‑POCKET EXPENSES (INCLUDING COUNSEL FEES) INCURRED BY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION, EXECUTION,
DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, MODIFICATION, AMENDMENT, OR ENFORCEMENT
(WHETHER THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OR OTHERWISE) OF, OR
LEGAL ADVICE IN RESPECT OF RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER, THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE ISSUING LENDER IS NOT REIMBURSED FOR SUCH
BY THE BORROWER.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the preceding provisions of this Section
8.05 shall apply only to liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that were incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank in their respective capacities as such, or against any
Affiliate thereof, or any of such Person's or Affiliate's respective directors, officers, employees, or
agents, acting for the Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank in connection with such capacity.  To
the extent that the indemnity obligations provided in this Section 8.05 are for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent as the named secured party under the Liens granted under the Security
Instruments, each Lender hereby agrees that if such Lender ceases to be a Lender hereunder but
obligations owing to such Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender continue to be secured by such
Liens, then such Lender shall continue to be bound by the provisions of this Section 8.05 until
such time as such obligations have been satisfied or terminated in full and subject to the terms of
the last sentence of Section 9.09.  In such event, in determining the pro rata shares under this
Section 8.05, the Lenders shall include the aggregate amount (giving effect to any netting
agreements) that would be owing to such Swap Counterparty if such Hedge Contracts were
terminated at the time of determination.
Section 8.06       Successor Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender.  The Administrative Agent
or the Issuing Lender may resign at any time by giving not less than 30 days prior written notice
thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause
by the Required Lenders upon receipt of written notice from the Required Lenders to such
effect.  Upon receipt of notice of any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender with, if any Event of
Default has not occurred and is not continuing, the consent of the Borrower, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.  If no successor Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders with the consent of the Borrower, and shall have
accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's or Issuing
Lender's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring
Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender, then the retiring Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender
may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or
Issuing Lender, which shall be, in the case of a successor agent, a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 and, in the case of the Issuing Lender, a Lender;
provided that, if the Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall
nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative
Agent or Issuing Lender shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents (except that (A) in the case of any collateral security held by the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender under any of the Loan
Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until
such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed and (B) the retiring Issuing Lender
shall remain the Issuing Lender with respect to any Letters of Credit outstanding on the effective
date of its resignation or removal and the provisions affecting the Issuing Lender with respect to
such Letters of Credit shall inure
92
to the benefit of the retiring Issuing Lender until the termination of all such Letters of Credit) and
(2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
retiring Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Lender
directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent or
Issuing Lender, as applicable, as provided for above in this paragraph.  Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender by a successor Administrative Agent
or Issuing Lender, such successor Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender, and the retiring Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, except that the retiring Issuing Lender shall remain the Issuing Lender with respect
to any Letters of Credit outstanding on the effective date of its resignation or removal and the
provisions affecting the Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit shall inure to the
benefit of the retiring Issuing Lender until the termination of all such Letters of Credit.  After any
retiring Administrative Agent's or Issuing Lender's resignation or removal hereunder as
Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit
as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent or Issuing
Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Section 8.07       Additional Agents.  None of the agents (other than the Administrative Agent) or
arrangers referred to on the cover of this Agreement shall have any duties, obligations or
liabilities in their respective capacities as agents or arrangers.
Section 8.08       Collateral Matters.
(a)       Administrative Agent is authorized on behalf of the Secured Parties, without the necessity
of any notice to or further consent from the Secured Parties, from time to time, to take any actions
with respect to any Collateral or Security Instruments which may be necessary to perfect and
maintain Acceptable Security Interests in and Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the
Security Instruments.  Administrative Agent is further authorized on behalf of the Secured Parties,
without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from the Secured Parties, from time to
time, to take any action (other than enforcement actions requiring the consent of, or request by,
the Required Lenders as set forth in Section 7.02 or Section 7.03 above) in exigent
circumstances as may be reasonably necessary to preserve any rights or privileges of the
Secured Parties under the Loan Documents or applicable law.  By accepting the benefit of the
Liens granted pursuant to the Security Instruments, each Secured Party not party hereto hereby
agrees to the terms of this paragraph (a).
(b)       Each Secured Party irrevocably authorizes Administrative Agent to release any Lien
granted to or held by the Administrative Agent upon any Collateral and release any Guarantor
from its Guaranty: (i) upon termination of the Commitments, termination or expiration of all Letters
of Credit (other than Letters of Credit as to which other arrangements satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender have been made), termination of all Hedge
Contracts with Swap Counterparties that are secured by the Liens on the Collateral  (other than
Hedge Contracts with any Swap Counterparty with respect to which other arrangements
satisfactory to the Swap Counterparty and the Borrower have been made; provided that, unless a
Swap Counterparty notifies the Administrative Agent in writing at least 2 Business Days prior to
the expected termination of the Commitments that such arrangements have not been made, then
solely for purposes of this clause (b), it shall be deemed that such satisfactory arrangements
have been made),  and payment in full of all Obligations  (other than Obligations arising under
Hedge Contracts with any Swap Counterparty with respect to which other arrangements
satisfactory to the Swap Counterparty and the Borrower have been made; provided that, unless a
Swap Counterparty notifies the Administrative Agent in writing at least 2 Business Days prior to
the expected termination of the Commitments that such arrangements have not been made, then
solely for purposes of this clause (b), it shall be deemed that such satisfactory arrangements
have been made); (ii) as to release of Collateral, constituting Property sold or to
93
be sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (iii) as to release of Collateral, constituting Property
in which the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary owned no interest at the time the Lien was
granted or at any time thereafter (other than as a result of a transaction, event or circumstance
that is prohibited hereunder); (iv) as to release of Collateral, constituting Property leased to the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary under a lease which has expired or has been terminated
in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or is about to expire and which has not been,
and is not intended by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary to be, renewed or extended;
(v) as to a release of a Subsidiary from its respective Guaranty, upon such Subsidiary ceasing to
be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder; or (vi) if
approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the applicable Required Lenders or all the Lenders,
as the case may be, as required by Section 9.01.  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at
any time, the Secured Parties will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to
release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 8.08.  By accepting the
benefit of the Liens granted pursuant to the Security Instruments, each Secured Party not party
hereto hereby agrees to the terms of this paragraph (b).
(c)       Notwithstanding anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary, the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and each Secured Party hereby agree that no Secured Party
shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guaranty, it
being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the
Security Instruments may be exercised solely by Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured
Parties in accordance with the terms hereof.  By accepting the benefit of the Liens granted
pursuant to the Security Instruments, each Secured Party not party hereto hereby agrees to the
terms of this paragraph (c).
Section 8.09       Credit Bidding.
(a)       The Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties, shall have the right,
at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid and purchase for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties all or any portion of Collateral at any sale thereof
conducted by the Administrative Agent under the provisions of the UCC, including pursuant to
Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the UCC, at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the
United States Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 thereof, or a sale under a plan of
reorganization, or at any other sale or foreclosure conducted by the Administrative Agent
(whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements.  Such credit bid or purchase may be completed through one or more acquisition
vehicles formed by the Administrative Agent to make such credit bid or purchase and, in
connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is authorized, on behalf of itself and the other
Secured Parties, to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or
vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition
vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be
governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the
vote of at least the Required Lenders or their permitted Assignees under the terms of this
Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the
case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the
limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.01 of this Agreement), and
assign the applicable Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle in exchange for Equity Interests
and/or debt issued by the applicable acquisition vehicle (which shall be deemed to be held for
the ratable account of the applicable Secured Parties on the basis of the Obligations so assigned
by each Secured Party).
94
(b)       Each Lender hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates that is a Secured
Party, that, except as otherwise provided in any Loan Document or with the written consent of the
Required Lenders, it will not take any enforcement action (other than the exercise of set-off
rights), accelerate obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or exercise any right that it
might otherwise have under applicable Legal Requirements to credit bid at foreclosure sales,
UCC sales or other similar dispositions of Collateral.

institutions (or any other entity if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) in or to all or
a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it, its participation interest in the Letter of
Credit Obligations, and
97
the Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's  obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, its Commitments to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Notes for
all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender,
and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (v) such Lender shall not
require the participant's consent to any matter under this Agreement, except for any matter set
forth in the first proviso of Section 9.01.  The Borrower hereby agrees that participants shall have
the same rights under Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14(c), and 9.07 as a Lender to the extent of their
respective participations.
(f)       Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank
having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release
such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.
Section 9.07       Indemnification; Waiver.
(a)       Indemnification.    THE BORROWER SHALL INDEMNIFY THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, THE LENDERS, THE ISSUING LENDER, AND EACH AFFILIATE THEREOF AND
THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS (each, an
“Indemnified Party”) FROM, AND DISCHARGE, RELEASE, AND HOLD EACH INDEMNIFIED
PARTY HARMLESS AGAINST, ANY AND ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, OR
DAMAGES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON, INCURRED BY, OR ASSERTED AGAINST SUCH
INDEMNIFIED PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY ACTION TAKEN OR OMITTED BY
ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT (A) INCLUDING ANY SUCH LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, OR
EXPENSE INCURRED BY REASON OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S OWN NEGLIGENCE
OR STRICT LIABILITY, (B) INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS
AND ANY LIABILITIES ARISING UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, AND (C) INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SUCH OTHER LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, OR
EXPENSES RESULTING FROM ANY LITIGATION, LEGAL PROCEEDING OR OTHER TYPE
OF ACTION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS PARTY TO SUCH
LITIGATION, LEGAL PROCEEDING OR OTHER ACTION, BUT EXCLUDING ANY SUCH
LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, OR EXPENSES INCURRED BY REASON OF
THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE PERSON TO BE
INDEMNIFIED AS DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A
FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT.  In the case of an investigation, litigation or
proceeding to which the indemnity in this paragraph applies, such indemnity shall be effective
whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, any equityholder or creditor thereof, or an Indemnified Party.  The
Borrower hereby also agrees that no Indemnified Party will have any liability (whether direct or
indirect, in contract or tort, or otherwise) to the Borrower, any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, or any
equity holder or creditor thereof arising out of, related to or in connection with any aspect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such liability is determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
Indemnified Party’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Borrower shall not, nor
shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified
Party affected thereby (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle any threatened
or pending claim or action that would give rise to the right of any Indemnified Party to claim
indemnification hereunder unless such
98
settlement (a) includes a full and unconditional release of all liabilities arising out of such claim or
action against such Indemnified Party and (b) does not include any statement as to or an
admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.
(b)       Waiver of Damages.  No Indemnified Party will be liable to the Borrower, any Subsidiary
or Affiliate thereof, any equity holder or creditor thereof or any other Person for any indirect,
consequential or punitive damages that may be alleged as a result of this Agreement, any other
Loan Documents, or any element of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including
the Transactions.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert,
and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnified Party, on any theory of liability, for special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
any Advance or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnified Party referred
to in subsection (a) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended
recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications,
electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Section 9.08       Confidentiality.  The Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, and each Lender
(each a "Lending Party") agree to keep confidential any information furnished or made available
to it by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and identified by the Borrower as proprietary or
confidential; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Lending Party from disclosing such
information (a) to any other Lending Party or any Affiliate of any Lending Party, or any officer,
director, employee, agent, or advisor of any Lending Party or Affiliate of any Lending Party for
purposes of administering, negotiating, considering, processing, implementing, syndicating,
assigning, or evaluating the credit facilities provided herein and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) to any other Person if directly incidental to the administration of the credit facilities
provided herein, (c) as required by any Legal Requirement, (d) upon the order of any court or
administrative agency, (e) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority or in
connection with any pledge or assignment pursuant to Section 9.06(f), (f) that is or becomes
available to the public or that is or becomes available to any Lending Party other than as a result
of a disclosure by any other Lending Party prohibited by this Agreement, (g) in connection with
any litigation relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which such Lending Party
or any of its Affiliates may be a party, (h) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise
of any right or remedy under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and (i) to any actual or
proposed participant or assignee, in each case, subject to provisions similar to those contained
in this Section 9.08.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED
HEREIN, nothing in this Agreement shall (a) restrict any Lending Party from providing information
to any bank or other regulatory or governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board
and its supervisory staff; (b) require or permit any Lending Party to disclose to the Borrower or
any Affiliate thereof that any information will be or was provided to the Federal Reserve Board or
any of its supervisory staff; or (c) require or permit any Lending Party to inform the Borrower or
any Affiliate thereof of a current or upcoming Federal Reserve Board examination or any
nonpublic Federal Reserve Board supervisory initiative or action.
Section 9.09       Execution in Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.
99
Section 9.10       Survival of Representations, Etc.  All representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement or made in writing by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection herewith shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, the making of the
Advances and any investigation made by or on behalf of the Lenders, none of which
investigations shall diminish any Lender's right to rely on such representations and
warranties.  All obligations of the Borrower provided for in Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14(c), 9.04, and
9.07 and all of the obligations of the Lenders in Section 8.05 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and repayment in full of the Obligations.
Section 9.11       Severability.  In case one or more provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, the
validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or therein shall
not be affected or impaired thereby.
Section 9.12       Business Loans.  The Borrower warrants and represents that the Loans
evidenced by the Notes are and shall be for business, commercial, investment, or other similar
purposes and not primarily for personal, family, household, or agricultural use, as such terms are
used in Chapter One ("Chapter One") of the Texas Credit Code.  At all such times, if any, as
Chapter One shall establish a Maximum Rate, the Maximum Rate shall be the "indicated rate
ceiling" (as such term is defined in Chapter One) from time to time in effect.
Section 9.13       Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.  This Agreement, the Notes, and the
other Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Texas.  Without limiting the intent of the parties set forth above, (a)
Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended (relating to revolving loans and revolving
tri-party accounts), shall not apply to this Agreement, the Notes, or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) to the extent that any Lender may be subject to Texas law limiting the amount of
interest payable for its account, such Lender shall utilize the indicated (weekly) rate ceiling from
time to time in effect.  Each Letter of Credit shall be governed by either the Uniform Customs and
Practice for Documentary Credits (2007 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce
Publication No. 600, or the International Standby Practices (ISP98), International Chamber of
Commerce Publication No. 590 (and any subsequent revisions thereof approved by a Congress
of the International Chamber of Commerce and adhered to by the Issuing Lender).  The Borrower
hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Texas state or federal court sitting in
Houston, Texas in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court.  The Borrower hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any right it
may have to the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding.  The Borrower hereby agrees that service of copies of the summons and complaint
and any other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding may be made by
mailing or delivering a copy of such process to such Borrower at its address set forth in this
Agreement.  The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Section shall affect the rights of any Lender to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by the law or affect the right of any Lender to bring
any action or proceeding against the Borrower or its Property in the courts of any other
jurisdiction.
100

LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
OR THEREBY.

party thereto.
Section 9.16       USA Patriot Act.  Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined)
and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the
Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and
record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address
