JUDGMENT

1.      
This Appeal is concerned with a judgment of the Magistrates' Court, which had heard an appeal from an order of the Small Claims Tribunal, on a mention date.

2.      
The Appellant had filed a claim in the Small Claims Tribunal, claiming a sum of $ 1110.00 from the Respondent as damages caused by a taxi to the vehicle of the Appellant, which had been left for repairs in the Respondent's garage. The Small Claims Tribunal on 24th September, 2009, had made Order that the Appellant pay the sum claimed to the Respondent. 

3.      
On 10th September, 2010,the Learned Magistrate had delivered Judgment quashing the order made by the Referee, Small Claims Tribunal, on the ground that the referee had conducted the hearing in a manner unfair to the Respondent in terms of section 33(1)(a) of the Small Claims Tribunal Decree.

4.      
The copy record of the Magistrates' Court provides as following:

a)      
On 23rd March,2010,the Appellant and Respondent were present in Court. Since the Presiding Magistrate was indisposed, the case had been "Adjourned( to) 16 July,2010, to set hearing date". 

b)      
On 16 July,2010, the Appellant was not present in Court. A representative of the Respondent Company had been present and stated "I am relying on my appeal grounds. Seek Judgment by court". The Learned Magistrate had recorded "Judgment-10th September 2010".

c)      
Accordingly, as noted above, judgment was delivered on 10th September, 2010.

5.      
In my judgment, the Learned Magistrate erred in hearing the case on a mention date. 

6.      
In the circumstances, I set aside the judgment of the Learned Magistrate dated 10th September, 2010, and make Order that the hearing of the appeal be taken up in the Magistrates' Court upon notice being given to the Appellant and Respondent. I make no order as to costs.
