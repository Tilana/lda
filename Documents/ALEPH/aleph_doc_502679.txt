EnCana’s Business   
 
EnCana is a leading independent North American oil and gas company.  
 
EnCana operates two continuing businesses: 
 
•  Upstream,  which  includes  the  Company’s  exploration  for,  and  development  and  production  of,  natural  gas,  crude  oil,  and 
natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and other related activities. The majority of the Company’s Upstream operations are located in 
Canada  and  the  United  States.  Frontier  and  International  New  Ventures  exploration  is  mainly  focused  on  opportunities  in 
Chad, Brazil, the Middle East, Greenland and France; and
•  Market  Optimization,  which  is  focused  on  enhancing  the  sale  of  EnCana’s  production.  As  part  of  these  activities,  Market 
Optimization buys and sells third party products to enhance EnCana’s operating flexibility for transportation commitments, 
product type, delivery points and customer diversification.

The  warmer  than  normal  winter  weather  in  the  United  States  between  the  last  week  of  December  2005  and  the  first  week  of 
February 2006 left gas storage levels at historical highs.  This has partially offset concerns over the timing of the return of lost 
production  from  hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita  and  a  forecast  for  another  above  normal  hurricane  season  in  2006.    Although  the 
NYMEX gas price has trended downward since December 31, 2005, the second quarter of 2006 averaged $6.78/MMBtu, a slight 
increase over the same period in 2005. 
 
A 15 percent lower average AECO gas price in the second quarter of 2006 compared with the same period in 2005 can be attributed 
to a wider AECO basis differential from NYMEX and a stronger Canadian dollar. A similar 11 percent lower average Rockies gas 
price in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the second quarter of 2005 can be attributed to a wider Rockies basis differential 
from  NYMEX.  Continued  supply  growth  in  the  Rockies  has  put  further  strain on  an  already  highly  utilized  pipeline  grid. This 
combined with reduced demand during the shoulder season (April through June) has contributed to a wider basis differential in the 
Rockies. EnCana has mitigated its price risk with respect to its projected production from the region from the impact of further 
deterioration in the Rockies basis differential through the use of financial instrument hedging positions, the details of which are 
disclosed in Note 14 of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

U.S./Canadian Dollar Exchange Rates
Concerns over geopolitical events and U.S. gasoline supplies combined to propel the West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) price above 
the $70 per bbl level for most of the second quarter.  Concerns over Iran's nuclear program, shut-in of Nigerian production due to 
militant  attacks  and  the  ongoing  instability  in  Iraq  underscored  worries  about  crude  supplies.    Temporary  outages  in  Canadian 
synthetic  supply  and  specification  changes  in  the  U.S.  gasoline  pool  put  further  upward  pressure  on  North  American  crude  oil 
prices. 
 
Canadian heavy oil differentials in the second quarter were 15 percent narrower than the same period in 2005 due to significant 
strength in residual fuel oil and asphalt markets driving higher pricing on Canadian heavy crude oil. The Western Canadian Select 
(“WCS”) average sales price for the second quarter of 2006 was 75 percent of WTI, compared to 61 percent of WTI in the second 
quarter  of  2005  and  only  55  percent  of  WTI  in  the  first  quarter  of  2006.  The  strength  of  WCS  in  the  second  quarter  was  also 
supported by the initial flows of Canadian heavy crude oil delivered directly to the U.S. Gulf Coast by the Pegasus Pipeline and 
new deliveries of Canadian crude oil into the U.S. via the Spearhead Pipeline.

The impacts of currency fluctuations on EnCana’s results should be considered when analyzing the Interim Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The value of the Canadian dollar increased by 11 percent or $0.088 to an average of US$0.892 in the second quarter of 
2006 from an average of US$0.804 in the same period in 2005.  
 
As  a  result,  EnCana  has  reported  an  additional  $8.80  of  costs  for  every  hundred  Canadian  dollars  spent  on  capital  projects, 
operating expenses and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2006 relative to the second quarter of 2005. However, 
revenues  were  relatively  unaffected  by  fluctuations  in  the  U.S./Canadian  dollar  exchange  rate  because  the  commodity  prices 
received by EnCana are largely based in U.S. dollars or in Canadian dollars at prices which are closely tied to the value of the U.S. 
dollar.

Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 
In keeping with EnCana’s North American resource play strategy, the Company completed the following significant divestitures in 
the first six months of 2006: 
 
Three Months Ended March 31
The sale of the Entrega Pipeline located in Colorado on February 23 for approximately $244 million subject to post-closing 
adjustments; and  
The sale of its interests in Ecuador on February 28 for approximately $1.4 billion subject to post-closing adjustments.

Three Months Ended June 30
The  sale  of  the  first  stage  of  EnCana’s  gas  storage  business  on  May  12  for  approximately  $1.3  billion  subject  to  post-
closing adjustments. The second stage will close following receipt of California regulatory approvals, which are expected 
later this year.
Proceeds from these divestitures were directed primarily to a combination of the purchase of shares under EnCana’s NCIB and debt 
reduction. 
 
EnCana’s  previously  announced  sale  of  its  50  percent  interest  in  the  Chinook  heavy  oil  discovery  in  offshore  Brazil  for 
approximately $350 million is expected to close in the third quarter of 2006 following receipt of Brazil regulatory approvals.

CASH FLOW  
Cash  flow  measures  are  considered  non-GAAP  but  are  commonly  used  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  to  assist  management  and 
investors in measuring the Company’s ability to finance capital programs and meet financial obligations. The calculation of cash 
flow is disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 
Three Months Ended June 30 
EnCana’s second quarter 2006 cash flow was $1,815 million, an increase of $243 million or 15 percent from the same period in 
2005. This increase reflects higher crude oil prices and natural gas sales volumes in 2006 partially reduced by increased costs. The 
results of discontinued operations reduced EnCana’s cash flow by $24 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with a $70 
million increase in the same period of 2005. 
 
EnCana’s second quarter 2006 cash flow from continuing operations was $1,839 million, an increase of $337 million or 22 percent 
from the same period in 2005.  
 
The increase resulted from:
•  Average North American liquids prices, excluding financial hedges, increased 65 percent to $52.44 per bbl in the second
quarter of 2006 compared to $31.80 per bbl in the same period in 2005;
•  North American natural gas sales volumes in the second quarter of 2006 increased 5 percent to 3,361 MMcf/d from 3,212
MMcf/d in the same period in 2005; and
•  Realized  financial  commodity  hedging  gains  were  $106  million  after-tax  in  the  second  quarter  of  2006  compared  with
losses of $71 million after-tax in the same period in 2005.

Second quarter report  
for the period ended June 30, 2006
The increase in cash flow was partially reduced by:
•  Average North American natural gas prices, excluding financial hedges, decreased 7 percent to $5.84 per Mcf in the second
quarter of 2006 compared to $6.25 per Mcf in the same period in 2005;
•  North American liquids sales volumes decreased 2 percent to 153,470 bbls/d in the second quarter of 2006 compared to
157,108 bbls/d in the same period in 2005;
•  Operating expenses increased 25 percent to $395 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with $315 million in the
same period in 2005; and 
The current tax provision increased $228 million to $297 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with $69 million 
in the same period in 2005. In 2005, $591 million of additional cash tax was incurred in the second quarter resulting from 
the disposition of the Gulf of Mexico operations, which was included in cash flow from investing activities.
•
Six Months Ended June 30 
EnCana’s first six months 2006 cash flow was $3,506 million, an increase of $521 million or 17 percent from the same period in 
2005. This increase reflects higher commodity prices and sales volumes in 2006 partially reduced by increased costs. EnCana’s 
discontinued operations contributed $88 million to cash flow compared with $236 million in 2005. 
 
EnCana’s first six months 2006 cash flow from continuing operations was $3,418 million, an increase of $669 million or 24 percent 
from the same period in 2005.  
 
The increase resulted from:
•  Average North American natural gas prices, excluding financial hedges, increased 12 percent to $6.75 per Mcf in the first
six months of 2006 compared to $6.03 per Mcf in the same period in 2005;
•  Average North American liquids prices, excluding financial hedges, increased 39 percent to $42.93 per bbl in the first six
months of 2006 compared to $30.79 per bbl in the same period in 2005;
•  North American natural gas sales volumes in the first six months of 2006 increased 5 percent to 3,352 MMcf/d from 3,179
MMcf/d in the same period in 2005; and
•  Realized  financial  commodity  hedging  losses  were  $30  million after-tax  in  the  first  six  months  of  2006  compared  with
losses of $80 million after-tax in the same period in 2005.
The increase in cash flow was partially reduced by:
•
•  Operating expenses increased 31 percent to $807 million in the first six months of 2006 compared with $615 million in the
same period in 2005; and 
The  current  tax  provision  increased  $348  million  to  $628  million  in  the  first  six  months  of  2006  compared  with  $280 
million in the same period in 2005. In 2005, $591 million of additional cash tax was incurred in the first half of the year 
resulting from the disposition of the Gulf of Mexico operations, which was included in cash flow from investing activities.
NET EARNINGS  
EnCana’s first six months 2006 net earnings were $3,631 million compared with $794 million in the same period in 2005. Net 
earnings for the period includes unrealized mark-to-market gains after-tax of $990 million (2005 – losses after-tax of $419 million) 
and  the  effect  of  the  tax  rate  reduction  of  $457  million.  Net  earnings  also  increased  by  $384  million  to  $566  million  from 
discontinued operations mainly due to the gain on sale of the gas storage assets in the first half of 2006 offset partially by the 
Ecuador indemnity claim both of which are further discussed under the discontinued operations section. 
 
Three Months Ended June 30 
EnCana’s second quarter 2006 net earnings from continuing operations were $1,593 million, an increase of $819 million compared 
with 2005. In addition to the items affecting cash flow as detailed previously, significant items affecting net earnings were:
•  Unrealized mark-to-market gains of $161 million after-tax in 2006 compared with gains of $201 million after-tax in 2005;  
•  An  increase  in  DD&A  of  $121  million  as  a  result  of  the  higher  value  of  the  Canadian  dollar,  higher  DD&A  rates  and
increased sales volumes;
•  Unrealized  foreign  exchange  gains  of  $134  million,  after-tax  in  2006  compared  with  losses  of  $38  million,  after-tax  in
2005; and

OPERATING EARNINGS   
Operating Earnings and Operating Earnings from Continuing Operations are non-GAAP measures that adjust net earnings and net 
earnings from continuing operations by non-operating items that Management believes reduce the comparability of the Company’s 
underlying  financial  performance  between  periods.  The  following  reconciliation  of  Operating  Earnings  and  Operating  Earnings 
from Continuing Operations has been prepared to provide investors with information that is more comparable between periods.

Upstream Revenues 
 
Three Months Ended June 30 
Revenues, net of royalties, increased in the second quarter of 2006 compared with the same period in 2005 due to:
•  A 65 percent increase in North American liquids prices offset slightly by a 2 percent decrease in liquids sales volumes; and 
•  Realized financial commodity hedging gains totaled $155 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared to losses of $112
million for the same period in 2005.
Six Months Ended June 30 
Revenues, net of royalties, increased in the first six months of 2006 compared with the same period in 2005 as a result of: 
•  A 39 percent increase in North American liquids prices combined with a slight increase in liquids sales volumes;  
•  A 12 percent increase in North American gas prices combined with a 5 percent increase in natural gas sales volumes; and 
•  Realized financial commodity hedging losses totaled $49 million in the first six months of 2006 compared to losses of $134

Three Months Ended June 30 
The increase in liquids sales prices and natural gas realized financial commodity hedging gains accounts for the majority of the 
approximately 86 percent of the increase in revenues, net of royalties, in the second quarter of 2006 compared with the same period 
in 2005. The balance of the increase in revenues results from an increase in natural gas sales volumes. 
 
Produced  gas  volumes  in  Canada  increased  2  percent  in  the  second  quarter  of  2006  mainly  due  to  drilling  success  in  the  key 
resource plays of Cutbank Ridge in northeast British Columbia, Coalbed Methane (“CBM”) in central and southern Alberta and 
Bighorn in west central Alberta. Natural declines and the impact of wet weather in southern Alberta resulted in lower production 
volumes from the mature Shallow Gas key resource play as well as conventional properties.  
 
Produced gas volumes in the U.S. increased 10 percent in the second quarter of 2006 as a result of drilling success at Fort Worth, 
Jonah and Piceance as well as the impact of property acquisitions in the Fort Worth Basin in late 2005.
EnCana Corporation
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
12
Second quarter report  
for the period ended June 30, 2006
North American crude oil and NGLs volumes decreased 2 percent as a result of a property payout, the dispositions of  non-core 
Canadian conventional producing assets in June 2005 and natural production declines. EnCana’s Pelican Lake property reached 
payout in April 2006 which increased the royalty payments to the Alberta Government and reduced Encana’s net revenue interest 
crude  oil  volumes  by  approximately  6,000  bbls/d  from  the  point  of  payout.  Decreases  were  offset  somewhat  by  production 
increases at the Foster Creek heavy oil project. 
 
Six Months Ended June 30 
The increase in sales prices accounts for approximately 80 percent of the increase in revenues, net of royalties, in the first half of 
2006 compared with the same period in 2005. The balance of the increase in revenues results from an increase in sales volumes. 
 
Produced gas volumes in Canada increased 3 percent in the first half of 2006 mainly due to drilling success in the key resource 
plays of Cutbank Ridge in northeast British Columbia, CBM in central and southern Alberta and Bighorn in west central Alberta. 
Natural declines and the impact of wet weather in southern Alberta resulted in lower production volumes from the mature Shallow 
Gas key resource play as well as conventional properties. 
 
Produced gas volumes in the U.S. increased 9 percent in the first half of 2006 as a result of drilling success at Fort Worth, Jonah, 
Piceance and East Texas as well as the impact of property acquisitions in the Fort Worth Basin in late 2005. 
 
North American crude oil and NGLs volumes increased slightly as a result of production increases at the Foster Creek and Pelican 
Lake heavy oil properties. These increases were offset somewhat by Pelican Lake reaching payout early in the second quarter of 
2006, the dispositions of non-core Canadian conventional producing assets in June 2005 and natural production declines.

Sales volumes from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2006 increased 3 percent or 127 MMcfe/d from the comparable 
period in 2005 for the following reasons:
Production from EnCana’s key resource plays increased 12 percent; 13 percent for natural gas and 5 percent for crude oil;
• 
•  Drilling success in the key resource gas plays of Cutbank Ridge, CBM, Bighorn, Fort Worth, Jonah and Piceance offset
somewhat by natural declines at Shallow Gas and the impact of wet weather in southern Alberta; and  
Expansion of Foster Creek facilities partially offset by the Pelican Lake heavy oil project reaching payout in April 2006.
•

EnCana’s North American natural gas price for the second quarter of 2006, excluding the impact of financial hedges, was $5.84 per 
Mcf, a decrease of 7 percent compared to the same period in 2005. North American realized financial commodity hedging gains on 
natural gas for the second quarter of 2006 were approximately $203 million or $0.66 per Mcf compared to losses of approximately 
$42 million or $0.14 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2005.  
 
Natural gas per unit production and mineral taxes, which are generally calculated as a percentage of revenues, have decreased $0.02 
per Mcf or 20 percent in Canada for the second quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005, mainly due to lower natural 
gas prices offset partially by the higher value of the Canadian dollar.  Natural gas per unit production and mineral taxes in the U.S. 
decreased $0.43 per Mcf or 66 percent in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 mainly as a result of 
accrual to actual adjustments based on the receipt of ad valorem tax assessments for Colorado properties. 
 
Natural gas per unit transportation and selling costs for the U.S. increased $0.08 per Mcf or 19 percent for the second quarter of 
2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily as a result of higher transportation costs on operated wells from West Texas 
and certain Colorado properties. 
 
Natural gas per unit operating expenses in Canada for the second quarter of 2006 were 24 percent or $0.15 per Mcf higher than the 
comparable period in 2005 as a result of increased industry activity and the higher value of the Canadian dollar. Natural gas per unit 
operating expenses in the U.S. increased 40 percent or $0.20 per Mcf for the second quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 
2005 mainly as a result of increased industry activity, higher water disposal costs, workovers and repairs and maintenance expenses 
primarily in the Piceance area. 
 
Six Months Ended June 30 
EnCana’s North American natural gas price for the first six months of 2006, excluding the impact of financial hedges, was $6.75 
per Mcf, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period in 2005. North American realized financial commodity hedging 
gains on natural gas for the first half of 2006 were approximately $44 million or $0.07 per Mcf compared to gains of approximately 
$9 million or $0.02 per Mcf in the first six months of 2005.  
 
Natural gas per unit production and mineral taxes increased $0.03 per Mcf or 30 percent in Canada for the first six months of 2006 
compared  to  the  same  period  in  2005,  mainly  due  to  higher  natural  gas  prices, increased  production  from  properties  which  are 
subject to freehold mineral tax and the higher value of the Canadian dollar. Natural gas per unit production and mineral taxes in the 
U.S. decreased $0.10 per Mcf or 16 percent in the first half of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 mainly as a result of 
accrual to actual adjustments based on the receipt of ad valorem tax assessments for Colorado properties. 
 
Natural gas per unit transportation and selling costs in Canada during the first half of 2006 decreased $0.02 per Mcf or 5 percent 
from the comparable period in 2005 mainly due to a higher proportion of Canadian gas volumes being sold in Canada, rather than 
shipped to and sold in the U.S. partially offset by the higher value of the Canadian dollar. Natural gas per unit transportation and 
selling costs for the U.S. increased $0.06 per Mcf or 14 percent for the first six months of 2006 compared to the same period of 
2005 primarily as a result of higher transportation costs on operated wells from Fort Worth, certain Colorado properties and West 
Texas. Natural gas transportation and selling costs in the U.S. include $14 million for the one time charge for the buyout of a third

Three Months Ended June 30 
The increase in EnCana’s North American crude oil price for the second quarter of 2006, excluding the impact of financial hedges, 
reflects  the  64  percent  increase  in  the  benchmark  WCS  crude  oil  price  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2005.  North  American 
realized financial commodity hedging losses on crude oil were approximately $48 million or $3.43 per bbl of liquids for the second 
quarter of 2006 compared to losses of approximately $70 million or $4.88 per bbl of liquids for the comparable period in 2005. 
 
Heavy oil sales in the second quarter of 2006 increased to 66 percent of total oil sales from 62 percent in the comparable period of 
2005.  This  increase  was  mainly  due  to  an  increase  in  heavy  oil  production  from  Foster  Creek  offset  by  Pelican  Lake  reaching 
payout  in  April  2006.  Dispositions  of  non-core  conventional  assets  in  June  2005  primarily  producing  light/medium  oil  also 
contributed to the increase. 
 
North American crude oil per unit production and mineral taxes increased 33 percent or $0.22 per bbl in the second quarter of 2006 
compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to the impact of higher overall prices, increased production from the Weyburn 
property in Saskatchewan which is subject to freehold mineral tax and the higher value of the Canadian dollar.  
 
North American crude oil per unit transportation and selling costs increased 34 percent or $0.39 per bbl in the second quarter of 
2006  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2005  primarily  due  to  a  higher  proportion  of  Canadian  heavy  crude  oil  volumes  being 
delivered to the U.S. Gulf Coast to capture higher selling prices and the higher value of the Canadian dollar. 
 
North American crude oil per unit operating costs for the second quarter of 2006 increased 19 percent or $1.24 per bbl compared to 
the  same  period  in  2005  mainly  due  to  the  higher  value  of  the  Canadian  dollar  and  increased  industry  activity.  The  increased 
proportion of crude oil volumes from SAGD projects, which have higher operating costs compared to EnCana’s other properties, 
increased the overall crude oil per unit operating costs. 
 
Six Months Ended June 30 
The increase in EnCana’s North American crude oil price for the first six months of 2006, excluding the impact of financial hedges, 
reflects  the  38  percent  increase  in  the  benchmark  WCS  crude  oil  price  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2005.  North  American 
realized financial commodity hedging losses on crude oil were approximately $93 million or $3.27 per bbl of liquids for the first 
half of 2006 compared to losses of approximately $143 million or $5.03 per bbl of liquids for the comparable period in 2005.

Second quarter report  
for the period ended June 30, 2006
Heavy oil sales in the first half of 2006 increased to 66 percent of total oil sales from 62 percent in the comparable period of 2005. 
This increase was mainly due to an increase in heavy oil production from the Foster Creek and Pelican Lake properties combined 
with dispositions of non-core conventional assets in June 2005 primarily producing light/medium oil. The increase in Pelican Lake 
production as  a result  of the  positive  waterflood  response  in  2005  has  been  partially  offset  as  a  result  of  the  property  reaching 
payout in April 2006. 
  
North American crude oil per unit production and mineral taxes increased 31 percent or $0.18 per bbl in the first six months of 2006 
compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to the impact of higher overall prices, increased production from the Weyburn 
property  in  Saskatchewan  which  is  subject  to  freehold  mineral  tax  and  Saskatchewan  resource  tax  and  the  higher  value  of  the 
Canadian dollar. 
 
North American crude oil per unit transportation and selling costs increased 9 percent or $0.12 per bbl in the first six months of 
2006  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2005  primarily  due  to  a  higher  proportion  of  Canadian  heavy  crude  oil  volumes  being 
delivered to the U.S. Gulf Coast and the higher value of the Canadian dollar. 
 
North American crude oil per unit operating costs for the first six months of 2006 increased 19 percent or $1.16 per bbl compared to 
the  same  period  in  2005  mainly  due  to  the  higher  value  of  the  Canadian  dollar,  higher  electricity,  workovers  and  repairs  and 
maintenance  expenses.  The  increased  proportion  of  crude  oil  volumes  from  SAGD  projects,  which  have  higher  operating  costs 
compared to EnCana’s other properties, increased the overall crude oil per unit operating costs.

The increase in NGLs realized prices in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 generally correlates with 
higher WTI oil prices.  
 
U.S. NGLs per unit production and mineral taxes in the U.S. decreased 41 percent or $1.77 per bbl in the second quarter of 2006 
compared to the same period in 2005 mainly as a result of accrual to actual adjustments based on the receipt of ad valorem tax 
assessments for Colorado properties.

Upstream Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
DD&A  expenses  in  the  first  six  months  of  2006  increased  $204  million  or  16  percent  from  the  same  period  in  2005  for  the 
following reasons:
•  North American sales volumes increased 4 percent; and 
•  Unit of production DD&A rates were $1.92 per Mcfe in the first half of 2006 compared to $1.73 per Mcfe in the same 
period  in  2005.  Rates  were  higher  in  the  first  six  months  of  2006  compared  to  the  same  period  of  2005  as  a  result  of 
increased future development costs and the higher value of the Canadian dollar partially reduced by the effect of the Gulf of  
Mexico sale in May 2005.

On January 1, 2006, EnCana adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Abstract No. 04-13 – Accounting for Purchases and 
Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. The effect is to record purchases and sales of inventory that are entered into in 
contemplation of each other with the same counterparty on a net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This change has 
been  adopted  prospectively  and  has  no  effect  on  the  earnings  of  the  reported  periods.  These  purchases  and  sales  are  used  to 
optimize  transportation  or  fulfill  marketing  arrangements.  As  a  result  of  the  adoption  of  this  policy,  reported  revenues  and 
purchased product costs for the first half of 2006 included offsets of $1,641 million.

Price volatility has impacted net earnings as a result of EnCana’s price risk management activities. On June 30, 2006 the forward 
price  curve  for  the  remainder  of  2006  had  increased  from  December  31,  2005  by  18  percent  to  $75.54  per  bbl  for  WTI  and 
decreased by 33 percent to $7.15 per Mcf for NYMEX gas.  
 
DD&A includes provisions for corporate assets such as computer equipment, office furniture and leasehold improvements. 
 
Administrative  expenses  increased  $9  million  in  the  second  quarter  and  $6  million  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2006 
compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2005.  The  year-to-date  increase  is  primarily  due  to  the  change  in  the  U.S./Canadian  dollar 
exchange rate of $11 million, partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses. Administrative expenses in the first half of 
2006 were $0.17 per Mcfe, unchanged from the same period in 2005.  
 
Interest  expense  in  the  second  quarter  of  2006  decreased  by $18  million as  a  result  of  lower  outstanding  debt  primarily  due  to 
repayments  with  the  proceeds  received  from  the  sale  of  the  Ecuador  and  gas  storage  interests.  EnCana’s  total  long-term  debt, 
including current portion, decreased by $944 million to $5,832 million at June 30, 2006 compared with $6,776 million at December 
31, 2005. EnCana’s 2006 year-to-date weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 5.6 percent, up from an average of 
approximately 5.4 percent in the same period in 2005 as a result of a higher proportion of fixed rate debt outstanding as well as 
increases in interest rates.  
 
The  foreign  exchange  gain  of  $158  million  in  the  first  half  of 2006  is  primarily  due to  the change  in  the  U.S./Canadian  dollar 
exchange rate applied to U.S. dollar denominated debt issued from Canada and by other miscellaneous gains, offset by a foreign 
exchange loss on repayments of debt between EnCana and self-sustaining operations. Under Canadian GAAP, EnCana is required 
to translate long-term debt issued from Canada and denominated in U.S. dollars into Canadian dollars at the period-end exchange 
rate. Resulting unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Other foreign 
exchange gains and losses result from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation of EnCana’s monetary 
assets and liabilities. 
 
Income Tax 
 
The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 2006 is 23.0 percent compared to 24.4 percent for the equivalent period in 
2005.    The  decrease  is  largely  due  to  a  decrease  in  future  income  tax  expense  of  $457  million  as  a  result  of  reductions  in  the 
Canadian federal and Alberta corporate tax rates which were enacted in the second quarter of 2006.  The Canadian federal tax rate 
is to be reduced by approximately three percentage points over the period 2008 - 2010.  The Alberta tax rate has been reduced from 
11.5 percent to 10.0 percent effective April 1, 2006.  
 
Cash taxes included in cash flow for the first half of 2006 were $628 million compared to $280 million in the same period in 2005; 
an increase of $348 million due to the increased taxable income in 2006. In addition, in 2005, $591 million of additional cash tax 
was incurred in the second quarter that resulted from the disposition of the Gulf of Mexico operations and is included in investing 
activity in the statement of cash flows. 
  
Further information regarding EnCana’s effective tax rate can be found in Note 8 to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Income tax is an annual calculation and EnCana’s effective rate in any year is a function of the relationship between the amount of 
net earnings before income taxes for the year and the magnitude of the items representing “permanent differences” that are excluded

from the earnings which are subject to tax, either current or future. There are a variety of items of this type, including:
The effects of asset dispositions where the tax values of the assets sold differ from their accounting values;
• 
•  Adjustments for the impact of legislative tax changes which have a prospective impact on future income tax obligations; 
• 
•
The non-taxable half of Canadian capital gains or losses; and 
Items such as resource allowance and non-deductible crown payments where the income tax treatment is different from the 
accounting treatment.
Tax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate are 
subject to change. As a result, there are usually some tax matters under review. The Company believes that the provision for taxes is 
adequate.

EnCana’s capital investment was funded by cash flow and a portion of the proceeds from dispositions.  
 
Upstream Capital Expenditures 
Capital spending during the second quarter and first six months of 2006 was primarily focused on North American resource play 
drilling programs. Natural gas capital expenditures mainly related to continued development of the Company’s key resource plays 
in Greater Sierra, Cutbank Ridge, Bighorn, CBM and Shallow Gas in Canada, and Jonah, Piceance, East Texas and Fort Worth in 
the United States. Crude oil capital spending was concentrated on expansion of the Company’s SAGD projects located at Foster 
Creek and Christina Lake. 
 
The $0.3 billion increase in Upstream core capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due 
to:
•  Canadian  core  capital  expenditures  increased  $0.1  billion  to  $0.9  billion  mainly  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  the
U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate; and
•  U.S. core capital expenditures increased $0.2 billion to $0.6 billion primarily due to higher drilling and completion costs at 
Fort Worth related to the development of the Barnett Shale play, increased activity at Jonah upon receipt of the Bureau of 
Land Management Record of Decision approving further development of the field and the drilling of several deep gas wells 
at the Deep Bossier play in East Texas.
The $0.7 billion increase in Upstream core capital expenditures for the first six months of 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily 
due to:
•  Canadian core capital expenditures increased $0.4 billion to $2.3 billion. The increased expenditures were mainly due to the 
change in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate, higher drilling and completion costs as a result of industry activity levels 
and  higher  facility  costs  relating  to  plant  expansions  at  Foster  Creek  and  Bighorn,  construction  of  a  new  gas  plant  at 
Cutbank Ridge and increased well tie-ins; and
•  U.S. core capital expenditures increased $0.3 billion to $1.2 billion primarily due to higher drilling and completion costs at 
Fort Worth related to the development of the Barnett Shale play, increased activity at Jonah upon receipt of the Bureau of 
Land Management Record of Decision approving further development of the field and the drilling of several deep gas wells 
at the Deep Bossier play in East Texas.

Market Optimization Capital Expenditures 
Expenditures were mostly focused on the completion of construction for the Entrega Pipeline prior to the sale in February 2006. 
 
Corporate Capital Expenditures 
Corporate  capital  expenditures  have  generally  been  directed  to  business  information  systems  and  leasehold  improvements.  The 
increase in spending in 2006 includes certain lands purchased for the development of a Calgary office complex.  
 
Acquisitions, Dispositions and Discontinued Operations 
Acquisitions included minor property acquisitions in 2006 and 2005 while dispositions included the sale of the Entrega Pipeline in 
Colorado in 2006 and minor property dispositions in 2005.  
 
Included  in  Discontinued  Operations  are  the  dispositions  of  EnCana’s  Ecuador  and  gas  storage  assets  (discussed  in  the 
Discontinued Operations section of this MD&A) in 2006 with the proceeds reduced by capital spending prior to the sales. 
 
Discontinued Operations 
 
Discontinued operations in the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements include:
Ecuador
• 
•  Midstream
EnCana’s 2006 net earnings for the six months ended June 30 from discontinued operations were $566 million compared to $182 
million  in  2005 and  includes  realized  financial  hedge  gains  of  $3  million after-tax  and  unrealized  financial  hedge  gains  of  $14 
million after-tax.  
 
Ecuador  
On February 28, 2006 EnCana completed the sale of its interests in Ecuador operations for $1.4 billion and recorded a loss on sale 
of $47 million. During the second quarter, the Government of Ecuador seized the Block 15 assets, in which EnCana previously held 
a 40 percent economic interest, from the operator which is an event requiring indemnification under the terms of EnCana’s sale 
agreement  with  Andes  Petroleum  Company.  The  purchaser  requested  payment  and  EnCana  has  accrued  the  maximum  amount, 
calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement, of approximately $265 million. At this point EnCana does not expect that 
any further significant indemnification payments relating to any other business matters addressed in the share sale agreements will 
be required to be made to the purchaser.

On March 6, 2006 EnCana announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its gas storage business interests for approximately 
$1.5 billion. The sale, to a single producer, is subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close in two 
stages. The first stage of the sale closed on May 12, 2006 for proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The second stage is expected 
to close following receipt of California regulatory approvals which are expected to be received later this year.

In accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, DD&A expense for the natural gas storage business has not been recorded 
in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for discontinued operations.
2006 Midstream net earnings from discontinued operations mainly results from the gain on sale of the gas storage operations in 
May 2006 which totaled $814 million after-tax. The remaining earnings are from the natural gas storage operations for the first six 
months  of  the year.  The  2005 comparative  amounts  also  included  the  NGLs  processing  business,  which  was  sold  in  December 
2005.

Operating Activities  
Cash flow from continuing operations was $1,839 million during the second quarter of 2006 compared to $1,502 million for the 
same period in 2005. On a year-to-date basis cash flow from continuing operations was $3,418 million compared to $2,749 million 
for the same period in 2005. This increase in cash flow from continuing operations in 2006 was primarily due to increased revenues 
driven by higher liquids prices and natural gas sales volumes partially reduced by increased expenses. Cash flow from continuing 
operations comprises most of EnCana’s cash provided by operating activities. 
 
Investing Activities 
Net cash of $1,166 million was used for investing activities in the second quarter of 2006, which includes $1,064 million of net 
cash received from discontinued operations, an increase of $1,745 million compared to the same period in 2005. The 2005 net cash 
provided by investing activities included proceeds generated by the sale of the Gulf of Mexico operations in the second quarter of 
2005. Capital expenditures, including property acquisitions, increased $466 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006. On a 
year-to-date basis cash flow used in investing activities was $1,363 million compared to $770 million for the same period in 2005. 
 
Financing Activities 
Total long-term debt as at June 30, 2006, including current portion, was reduced by revolving long-term debt repayments of $982 
million since December 31, 2005. EnCana’s net debt adjusted for working capital was $6,492 million as at June 30, 2006 compared 
with $7,970 million at December 31, 2005. During the first half of 2006, EnCana purchased 43.7 million of its Common Shares for 
a total consideration of $2,073 million. The working capital deficit at June 30, 2006 was $733 million compared to a deficit of 
$1,267 million as at December 31, 2005.  
 
EnCana had available unused committed bank credit facilities in the amount of $4.1 billion and unused shelf prospectuses for up to 
$4.4 billion at June 30, 2006.  
 
EnCana maintains investment grade credit ratings on its senior unsecured debt. Standard & Poor's has assigned a rating of A- with a 
'Negative Outlook', Dominion Bond Rating Services has assigned a rating of A(low) with a 'Stable Trend' and Moody's has assigned 
a rating of Baa2 'Stable'.

Contractual Obligations and Contingencies  
 
EnCana has entered into various commitments primarily related to debt, demand charges on firm transportation agreements, capital 
commitments and marketing agreements.  
 
Included  in  EnCana’s  total  long-term  debt  commitments  of  $5,832  million  at  June  30,  2006  are  $443  million  in  commitments 
related to Commercial Paper. These amounts are fully supported and Management expects that they will continue to be supported 
by revolving credit and term loan facilities that have no repayment requirements within the next year. Further details regarding 
EnCana’s long-term debt are described in Note 9 to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
As at June 30, 2006, EnCana remained a party to long-term, fixed price, physical contracts with a current delivery of approximately 
38 MMcf/d with varying terms and volumes through 2017. The total volume to be delivered within the terms of these contracts is 
132 Bcf at a weighted average price of $3.91 per Mcf. At June 30, 2006 these transactions had an unrealized loss of $330 million. 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 
EnCana  does  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  financing arrangements  that  have  or  are  reasonably  likely to  have  an effect  on its 
results of operations or financial condition. 
 
Leases 
As a normal course of business, EnCana leases office space for personnel who support field operations and for corporate purposes. 
 
Legal Proceedings  
EnCana  is  involved  in  various  legal  claims  associated  with  the  normal  course  of  operations  and  believes  it  has  made  adequate 
provision for such legal claims.  
 
Discontinued Merchant Energy Operations 
California  
As disclosed previously, in July 2003, the Company’s indirect wholly owned U.S. marketing subsidiary, WD Energy Services Inc. 
(“WD”), concluded a settlement with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) of a previously disclosed CFTC 
investigation whereby WD agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $20 million without admitting or denying the 
findings in the CFTC’s order. 
 
EnCana  Corporation  and  WD  are  defendants  in  a  lawsuit  filed  by  E.  &  J.  Gallo  Winery  in  the  United  States  District  Court  in 
California, further described below.  The Gallo lawsuit claims damages in excess of $30 million. California law allows for the 
possibility that the amount of damages assessed could be tripled.   
 
Along  with  other  energy  companies,  EnCana  Corporation  and  WD  are  defendants  in  several  other  lawsuits  relating  to  sales  of 
natural gas in California from 1999 to 2002 (some of which are class actions and some of which are brought by individual parties 
on their own behalf). As is customary, these lawsuits do not specify the precise amount of damages claimed. The Gallo and other 
California lawsuits contain allegations that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy with unnamed competitors in the natural gas and 
derivatives market in California in violation of U.S. and California anti-trust and unfair competition laws. 
 
In  the  Gallo  action,  the  decision  dealing  with  the  issue  of  whether  the  scope  of  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission’s 
exclusive jurisdiction over natural gas prices precludes the plaintiffs from maintaining their claims is on appeal to the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The Gallo lawsuit is stayed pending this appeal. 
 
Without admitting any liability in the lawsuits, WD has agreed to pay $20.5 million to settle the class action lawsuits that were 
consolidated  in  San  Diego  Superior  Court  subject  to  final  documentation  and  approval  by  the  San  Diego  Superior  Court.  The 
individual parties who had brought their own actions are not parties to this settlement.  WD has also agreed to pay $2.4 million to 
settle the class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court in California, without admitting any liability in the lawsuits, 
subject to final documentation and approval by the United States District Court.   
 
New York 
WD was a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court in New York. The consolidated 
New York lawsuit claims that the defendants’ alleged manipulation of natural gas price indices affected natural gas futures and 
option  contracts  traded  on  the  NYMEX  from  2000  to  2002.  EnCana  Corporation  was  dismissed  from  the  New  York  lawsuit, 
leaving WD and several other companies unrelated to EnCana Corporation as the remaining defendants. Without admitting any 
liability  in  the  lawsuit,  WD  agreed  to  pay  $8.2  million  to  settle  the  New  York  class  action  lawsuit.  Final  documentation  and 
approval by the New York District Court have been obtained and WD has paid the stated settlement amount. 
 
Based  on  the  aforementioned  settlements,  a  total  of  $31  million  has  been  accrued.  EnCana  Corporation  and  WD  intend  to 
vigorously  defend  against  the  remaining  outstanding  claims;  however,  the  Company  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  these

proceedings or any future proceedings against the Company, whether these proceedings would lead to monetary damages which 
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, or whether there will be other proceedings arising out of 
these allegations. 
 
 
Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted EITF Abstract No. 04-13 – Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the 
Same Counterparty. As of January 1, 2006, purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in 
contemplation of each other are recorded on a net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This change has been adopted 
prospectively and has no effect on the net earnings of the reported periods. 
 
 
Risk Management  
 
EnCana’s results are affected by
• 
• 
• 
•
financial risks (including commodity price, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit risks) 
operational risks 
environmental, health, safety and security risks 
reputational risks
EnCana partially mitigates its exposure to financial risks through the use of various financial instruments and physical contracts. 
The use of derivative instruments is governed under formal policies and is subject to limits established by the Board of Directors. 
As a means of mitigating exposure to commodity price risk volatility, the Company has entered into various financial instrument 
agreements.  EnCana  does  not  use  derivative  financial  instruments  for  speculative  purposes.  The  details  of  these  instruments, 
including  any  unrealized  gains  or  losses,  as  of  June  30,  2006,  are  disclosed  in  Note  14  to  the  Interim  Consolidated  Financial 
Statements. 
 
EnCana has in place policies and procedures with respect to the required documentation and approvals for the use of derivative 
financial instruments and specifically ties their use, in the case of commodities, to the mitigation of price risk to achieve targeted 
investment returns and growth objectives, while maintaining prescribed financial metrics. 
 
With  respect  to transactions  involving  proprietary  production  or  assets,  the  financial  instruments  generally  used  by  EnCana are 
swaps,  collars  or  options  which  are  entered  into  with  major  financial  institutions,  integrated  energy  companies  or  commodities 
trading institutions.  
 
Commodity Price  
To partially mitigate the natural gas commodity price risk, the Company entered into swaps which fix the AECO and NYMEX 
prices and collars and put options which fix the range of AECO and NYMEX prices. To help protect against widening natural gas 
price differentials in various production areas, EnCana has entered into swaps to fix the AECO and Rockies price differential from 
the NYMEX price. Physical contracts relating to these activities had an unrecognized gain of $20 million at June 30, 2006.  
 
EnCana has also entered into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas as part of its daily ongoing operations of the Company’s 
proprietary production management. Physical contracts associated with this activity had an unrecognized gain of $29 million at 
June 30, 2006. 
 
For  crude  oil  price  risk,  the  Company  has  partially  mitigated  its  exposure  to  the  WTI  NYMEX  price  for  a  portion  of  its  oil 
production with fixed price swaps, purchased call options to allow participation at higher WTI levels, three-way put spreads and put 
options.  
   
Foreign Exchange  
As  a  means  of  mitigating  the  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  the  U.S.  to  Canadian  exchange  rate,  EnCana  may  enter  into  foreign 
exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts in conjunction with crude oil marketing transactions. 
Gains or losses on these contracts are recognized when the difference between the average month spot rate and the rate on the date 
of settlement is determined. 
 
EnCana also maintains a mix of both U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar debt which helps to offset the exposure to the fluctuations in 
the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate. In addition to direct issuance of U.S. dollar denominated debt, the Company has entered 
into cross currency swaps on a portion of its debt as a means of managing the U.S./Canadian dollar debt mix.

Second quarter report  
for the period ended June 30, 2006
Interest Rates 
The Company partially mitigates its exposure to interest rate changes by maintaining a mix of both fixed and floating rate debt. 
EnCana has entered into interest rate swap transactions from time to time as an additional means of managing the fixed/floating rate 
debt portfolio mix. 
 
Credit Risk 
EnCana is exposed to credit related losses in the event of default by counterparties. This credit exposure is mitigated through the 
use of Board-approved credit policies governing the Company’s credit portfolio and with credit practices that limit transactions 
according to counterparties credit quality and transactions that are fully collateralized. A substantial portion of EnCana’s accounts 
receivable is with customers in the oil and gas industry.  
 
Operational Risks  
EnCana  mitigates  operational  risk  through  a  number  of  policies  and  processes.  As  part  of  the  capital  approval  process,  the 
Company’s projects are evaluated on a fully risked basis, including geological risk and engineering risk. In addition, the asset teams 
undertake a process called Lookback and Learning. In this process, each asset team undertakes a thorough review of their previous 
capital  program  to  identify  key  learnings,  which  often  includes  operational  issues  that  positively  and  negatively  impacted  the 
project’s results. Mitigation plans are developed for the operational issues which had a negative impact on results. These mitigation 
plans are then incorporated into the current year plan for the project. On an annual basis, these Lookback results are analyzed for 
EnCana’s capital program with the results and identified learnings shared across the Company.  
 
Projects include a Business Risk Burden that is intended to account for the unforeseen risks. The amount of Business Risk Burden 
that is used on a particular project depends on the project’s history of Lookback results and the type of expenditure. A peer review 
process  is  used  to  ensure  that  capital  projects  are  appropriately  risked  and  that  knowledge  is  shared  across  the  Company.  Peer 
reviews are undertaken primarily for exploration projects and early stage resource plays, although they may occur for any type of 
project. 
 
EnCana also partially mitigates operational risks by maintaining a comprehensive insurance program. 
 
Environment, Health, Safety and Security Risks 
These risks are managed by executing policies and standards that are designed to comply with or exceed government regulations 
and industry standards. In addition, EnCana maintains a system that identifies, assesses and controls safety and environmental risk 
and  requires  regular  reporting  to  senior  management  and  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Corporate  Responsibility,  Environment, 
Health  &  Safety  Committee  of  EnCana’s  Board  of  Directors  recommends  approval  of  environmental  policy  and  oversees 
compliance  with  government  laws  and  regulations.  Monitoring  and  reporting  programs  for  environmental,  health  and  safety 
performance in day-to-day operations, as well as inspections and assessments, are designed to provide assurance that environmental 
and  regulatory  standards  are  met.  Contingency  plans  are  in  place  for  a  timely  response  to  an  environmental  event  and 
remediation/reclamation strategies are utilized to restore the environment.  
 
Security risks are managed through a Security Program designed to protect EnCana’s personnel and assets. EnCana has established 
an Investigations Committee with the mandate to address potential violations of Company policies and practices and an Integrity 
Hotline that can be used to raise any concerns regarding EnCana’s operations.
Climate Change 
The Kyoto protocol, ratified by the Canadian Federal Government in December 2002, came into force on February 16, 2005. The 
protocol commits Canada to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels over the period 2008 – 2012. There 
is currently no clear direction post 2012. The previous Federal Government released a framework outlining its Climate Change 
action  plan  on  April  13,  2005.  The  plan  as  released  contains  few  technical  details  regarding  the  implementation  of  the 
Government’s greenhouse gas reduction strategy.  
 
With  the  change  in  the  Federal  Government,  EnCana  is  unable  to  predict  the  total  impact  of  the  potential  regulations  upon  its 
business; however, it is possible that the Corporation could face increases in operating costs in order to comply with greenhouse gas 
emissions  legislation.  However,  a  July  16,  2005  Canada  Gazette  notice  partially  addressed  the  uncertainty  associated  with  a 
greenhouse gas regulation for existing facilities by providing the oil and gas sector with limits on cost (a price assurance mechanism 
of C$15/tonne for compliance) and emission reductions targets that will not exceed 12 percent lower than business as usual levels 
of  total  covered  emissions  for  a  given  sector.  It  also  made  a  commitment  to  targets  based  on  the  “best  available  technology 
economically achievable”  for  new  facilities.  Based  on  these  commitments  and  EnCana’s  activity  on  geological sequestration  of 
CO2, we do not anticipate that the cost implications of government climate change plans will have a material impact on operations 
or future growth plans.

Second quarter report  
for the period ended June 30, 2006
EnCana, via the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers will continue to work with the Federal and Alberta Governments to 
develop  an  approach  to  deal  with  climate  change  issues  which  protects  the  industry’s  competitiveness,  limits  the  cost  and 
administrative burden of compliance and supports continued investment in the sector. 
 
EnCana  is  committed  to  transparency  with  its  stakeholders  and  will  keep  them  apprised  of  how  these  issues  affect  operations. 
Additional detail on EnCana’s greenhouse gas emissions is available in the Corporate Responsibility Report that was published in 
the second quarter of 2006. The Report is available on www.encana.com.   
 
Reputational Risks 
EnCana takes a pro-active approach to the identification and management of issues that affect the Company’s reputation and has 
established consistent and clear procedures, guidelines and responsibility for identifying and managing these issues. Issues affecting 
or  with  the  potential  to  affect  EnCana’s  reputation  are  generally  either  emerging  issues  that  can  be  identified  early  and  then 
managed or unforeseen issues that arise unexpectedly and must be managed on an urgent basis. 
 
Outlook  
 
EnCana  plans  to  continue  to  focus  principally  on  growing  natural  gas  production  from  unconventional  resource  plays  in  North 
America and developing its high quality in-situ oilsands resources. EnCana is continuing to evaluate marketing, development and 
other options that will help expand the development of the oilsands resources. 
 
Volatility in crude oil prices is expected to continue throughout 2006 as a result of market uncertainties over supply and refining 
disruptions, continued demand growth in China, OPEC actions, demand destruction from high energy prices and the overall state of 
the world economies. In the near term, the new pipeline capacity to the U.S. Gulf Coast should reduce the volatility on Canadian 
crude oil relative to world oil prices. 
 
Natural gas prices are primarily driven by North American supply and demand, with weather being the key factor in the short term. 
EnCana believes that North American conventional gas supply has peaked in the past two years and that unconventional resource 
plays  can  at  least  partially  offset  conventional  gas  production  declines.  The  industry’s  ability  to  respond  to  the  gas  supply 
constrained situation in North America remains challenged by land access and regulatory issues.  
 
The Company expects its 2006 core capital investment program to be funded from cash flow. 
 
Proceeds from the sales of non-core assets are expected to be used for purchases of common shares under the Company’s NCIB 
program and repayments of long-term debt.  
 
EnCana’s results are affected by external market factors, such as fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as 
movements in foreign currency exchange rates and inflationary pressures on service costs. 
 
  
Advisories  
 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
In  the  interest  of  providing  EnCana  shareholders  and  potential  investors  with  information  regarding  the  Company  and  its 
subsidiaries, including management’s assessment of EnCana’s and its subsidiaries’ future plans and operations, certain statements 
contained in this MD&A constitute forward-looking statements or information (collectively referred to herein as “forward-looking

Acceptances  and  Commercial  Paper  Program  will  continue  to  be  fully  supported  by  committed  credit  facilities  and  term  loan 
facilities;  the  projected  amounts  of  and  likelihood  of  making  certain  indemnity  payments  in  respect  of  the  Ecuador  share  sale 
agreements and projections relating to North American conventional natural gas supplies and the ability of unconventional resource 
plays to partially offset future conventional gas production declines. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-
looking statements, as there can be no assurance that the plans, intentions or expectations upon which they are based will occur. By 
their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both general 
and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will 
not occur, which may cause the Company’s actual performance and financial results in future periods to differ materially from any 
estimates or projections of future performance or results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and 
uncertainties  include,  among  other  things:  volatility  of  and  assumptions  regarding  oil  and  gas  prices;  assumptions  based  upon 
EnCana’s  current  guidance;  fluctuations  in  currency  and  interest  rates;  product  supply  and  demand;  market  competition;  risks 
inherent in the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ marketing operations, including credit risks; imprecision of reserve estimates and 
estimates of recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and liquids from resource plays and other sources not currently classified as 
proved; the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to replace and expand oil and gas reserves; risks associated with technology; its 
ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its current and future obligations; the Company’s ability to access 
external  sources  of  debt  and  equity  capital;  the  timing  and  the  costs  of  well  and  pipeline  construction;  the  Company’s  and  its 
subsidiaries’ ability to secure adequate product transportation; changes in environmental and other regulations or the interpretations 
of such regulations; political and economic conditions in the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate; the risk 
of  international  war,  hostilities,  civil  insurrection  and  instability  affecting  countries  in  which  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries 
operate and terrorist threats; risks associated with existing and potential future lawsuits and regulatory actions made against the 
Company and its subsidiaries; and other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in the reports and filings made with 
securities regulatory authorities by EnCana. Statements relating to “reserves” or “resources” or “resource potential” are deemed to 
be  forward-looking  statements,  as  they  involve  the  implied  assessment,  based  on  certain  estimates  and  assumptions  that  the 
resources  and  reserves  described  exist  in  the  quantities  predicted  or  estimated,  and  can  be  profitably  produced  in  the  future. 
Although EnCana believes that the expectations represented by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no 
assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of important factors is not 
exhaustive.  Furthermore,  the  forward-looking statements  contained  in  this  MD&A  are  made as  of  the  date  of  this  MD&A,  and 
except as required by law EnCana does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking statements contained in 
this MD&A are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. 
 
OIL AND GAS INFORMATION 
EnCana's disclosure of reserves data and other oil and gas information is made in reliance on an exemption granted to EnCana by 
Canadian  securities  regulatory  authorities  which  permits  it  to  provide  such  disclosure  in  accordance  with  U.S.  disclosure 
requirements. The information provided by EnCana may differ from the corresponding information prepared in accordance with 
Canadian  disclosure  standards  under  National  Instrument  51-101  (“NI  51-101”).  The  reserves  quantities  disclosed  by  EnCana 
represent  net  proved  reserves  calculated  using  the  standards  contained  in  Regulation  S-X  of  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission. Further information about the differences between the U.S. requirements and the NI 51-101 requirements is set forth 
under the heading "Note Regarding Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information" in EnCana's Annual Information Form. 
 
Crude Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Conversions 
In this MD&A, certain crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) volumes have been converted to millions of cubic feet equivalent 
(“MMcfe”) or thousands of cubic feet equivalent (“Mcfe”) on the basis of one barrel (“bbl”) to six thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”). 
Also,  certain  natural  gas  volumes  have  been  converted  to  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  (“BOE”),  thousands  of  BOE  (“MBOE”)  or 
millions of BOE (“MMBOE”) on the same basis. MMcfe, Mcfe, BOE, MBOE and MMBOE may be misleading, particularly if 
used  in  isolation.  A  conversion  ratio  of  one  bbl  to  six  Mcf  is  based  on  an  energy  equivalency  conversion  method  primarily 
applicable at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent value equivalency at the well head.  
 
Resource Play, Estimated Ultimate Recovery, and Unbooked Resource Potential 
EnCana uses the terms resource play, estimated ultimate recovery and unbooked resource potential. Resource play is a term used by 
EnCana to describe an accumulation of hydrocarbons known to exist over a large areal expanse and/or thick vertical section, which 
when compared to a conventional play, typically has a lower geological and/or commercial development risk and lower average 
decline rate. As used by EnCana, estimated ultimate recovery (“EUR”) has the meaning set out jointly by the Society of Petroleum 
Engineers and World Petroleum Congress in the year 2000, being those quantities of petroleum which are estimated, on a given 
date,  to  be  potentially  recoverable  from  an  accumulation,  plus  those  quantities  already  produced  therefrom.  EnCana  defines 
Unbooked Resource Potential as quantities of oil and gas on existing landholdings that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but 
which EnCana believes may be moved into the proved reserves category and produced in the future. EnCana employs a probability-
weighted  approach  in  the  calculation  of  these  quantities,  including  statistical  distributions  of  resource  play  potential  and  areal 
extent. Consequently, EnCana’s unbooked resource potential necessarily includes quantities of probable and possible reserves and 
contingent resources, as these terms are defined in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook.

CURRENCY, NON-GAAP MEASURES AND REFERENCES TO ENCANA  
All information included in this MD&A and the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and comparative information is shown 
on a U.S. dollar, after-royalties basis unless otherwise noted. Sales forecasts reflect the mid-point of current public guidance on an 
after royalties basis. Current Corporate Guidance assumes a U.S. dollar exchange rate of $0.88 for every Canadian dollar. 
 
Non-GAAP Measures 
Certain measures in this MD&A do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by Canadian generally accepted accounting 
principles (“Canadian GAAP”) such as Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, Cash Flow, Cash Flow per share-diluted, Operating 
Earnings and Operating Earnings per share-diluted, Operating Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted EBITDA and 
therefore are considered non-GAAP measures. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by 
other issuers. These measures have been described and presented in this MD&A in order to provide shareholders and potential 
investors with additional information regarding the Company’s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. 
Management’s use of these measures has been disclosed further in this MD&A as these measures are discussed and presented.
