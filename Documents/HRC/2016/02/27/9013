<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In its resolution 7/20 the Human Rights Council invited the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council at its tenth session on the human 
rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the activities the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has undertaken in the country. 
In its resolution S-8/1, the Human Rights Council invited the High Commissioner to report to the 
Council at its tenth session on the human rights situation in eastern Congo and on the activities 
her Office has undertaken in the region.  
</p>
<p> The human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains of grave 
concern. Acute conflicts and long-standing structural challenges have worsened the already 
precarious living conditions of the Congolese. This report provides an overview of the human 
rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the activities of OHCHR in the 
country, including in eastern Congo. 
</p>
<p> During the reporting period, in eastern Congo, Government control was often challenged 
or replaced by various armed groups, resulting in or perpetuating conflicts that have engendered 
serious violations of human rights, such as arbitrary executions, sexual violence, abductions and 
pillaging.  
</p>
<p> While international attention has focused on the conflict in eastern Congo, the public space 
for protests and criticism in the rest of the country has diminished considerably, with the 
authorities often repressing those critical of their policies. Mainly as a result of inadequate 
wages, police and army officers commonly use their position to extract payment from civilians, 
often through the use of arbitrary arrests and physical force. The judiciary faces enormous 
challenges, ranging from a profound lack of resources to widespread corruption and political and 
military interference. The lack of an independent judiciary deprives citizens of an effective legal 
framework through which to lodge complaints and seek redress. 
</p>
<p> During the reporting period, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (UNJHRO) - which is composed of the Human Rights 
Division of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(known by its French acronym as MONUC) and OHCHR in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo - has stepped up its monitoring and advocacy activities. In areas of armed conflict, 
UNJHRO took part in joint protection teams established by MONUC to enhance its capacity to 
protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence. In order to assist the Government on 
judicial and disciplinary follow-up to violations committed by State agents, committees were 
established with the participation of the Forces arm&#233;es de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo 
(FARDC), the Police nationale Congolaise (PNC) and the judiciary. UNJHRO has intensified 
efforts to fight impunity in the area of sexual violence, amongst other things through systematic 
trial monitoring and implementation of various capacity-building programmes. The OHCHR-led 
mapping exercise, currently underway, will make an important contribution to addressing justice 
and accountability issues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by creating an inventory of 
the most serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed 
between 1993 and 2003, and making recommendations in the area of transitional justice. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been of grave 
concern throughout the period under review. Mass killings, sexual violence and other serious 
human rights and international humanitarian law violations were perpetrated as conflict resumed 
in North Kivu in August 2008 and unprecedented attacks by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army of 
Uganda (LRA) were carried out against civilians in Oriental Province resulting in several 
hundreds of deaths. The launching in January 2009 of an unprecedented joint military operation 
by the Forces Arm&#233;es de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo (FARDC) and the Rwandan 
army to disarm Rwandan Hutu rebels in eastern Congo put a halt to the ongoing conflict between 
Government forces and the Congr&#232;s National pour la D&#233;fense du Peuple (CNDP), but raised new 
concerns about protection of civilians and the issue of accountability being sidelined in the 
reintegration of CNDP forces - now led by Bosco Ntaganda, an indictee of the International 
Criminal Court (ICC) - into the FARDC.  
</p>
<p>2. During the reporting period the fight against impunity made no progress, mainly due to 
lack of capacity, political will and interference from the authorities. The continued practice of 
appointing and promoting, among the ranks of the FARDC, human rights violators undermined 
the fight against impunity and perpetuated the cycle of violence by preserving or enhancing the 
power of human rights abusers. In the most dramatic setback, the Congolese Government was 
considering appointing Bosco Ntaganda to a senior position within the FARDC. Despite several 
requests by the Security Council, most recently in resolution 1856 of 22 December 2008, the 
Congolese authorities have yet to establish a vetting mechanism to screen senior military and 
police officers alleged to be responsible for serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>3. While international attention has focused mainly on the conflicts in eastern Congo, the 
public space for protests and criticism has diminished considerably throughout the country 
during the reporting period. In spite of relatively recent presidential, national and provincial 
elections, rather than fostering public debate, central and local authorities have attempted to stifle 
those critical of their policies. The clashes in Bas-Congo province in February-March 2008 
between the Police nationale Congolaise (PNC) and the local politico-religious movement Bundu 
Dia Kongo (BDK), which caused over 100 deaths, are the most striking examples of such 
repression. Members of other political groups or parties, such as the Movement de lib&#233;ration du 
Congo (MLC) have also been the targets of threats, arbitrary arrests followed by incommunicado 
detention, torture and other forms of intimidation or repression. At the time of writing, an 
estimated 160 political detainees continue to be kept in pre-trial or illegal detention.  
</p>
<p>4. Mainly as a result of inadequate wages for law enforcement agents, police and army 
officers commonly use their position to obtain financial or other benefits by using arbitrary 
arrests and physical force. Equally underfunded is the management of prisons and detention 
centers, where the lack of food and health care has led to an alarming number of starvation cases 
and even more escapes during the reporting period. The judiciary is endowed with similar flaws 
of underfunding. As a consequence, the judicial system is hampered by corruption and by the 
interference of external actors such as agents of the executive branch. The lack of an independent 
and impartial judiciary deprives citizens of a functioning legal or official framework through 
which to lodge complaints or seek redress. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>5. Sexual violence has reached pandemic proportions in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. Far from being limited to the context of armed conflict, it occurs throughout the country. 
Despite the reinforcement of laws punishing sexual violence and the increased attention given to 
the problem of sexual violence in eastern Congo by the Government and the international 
community, cases of sexual violence, often perpetrated by members of the FARDC, PNC and 
armed groups, remain widespread. 
</p>
<p><b>II. HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE CONTEXT OF 
ARMED CONFLICTS IN EASTERN CONGO 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Massive human rights violations committed  
by all forces in North Kivu 
</b></p>
<p>6. In spite of the Goma Peace Agreements, signed in early 2008, large scale violations of 
human rights and international humanitarian law occurred in North Kivu both before and after 
open hostilities resumed on 28 August 2008 involving the FARDC, the CNDP, the Patriotes 
R&#233;sistants Congolais (PARECO) Mayi-Mayi and the FDLR. Fighting between the FARDC and 
the CNDP subsided with the launching in January 2009 of a joint Congolese-Rwandan operation 
to disarm the FDLR and the planned reintegration of CNDP forces into the FARDC.  
</p>
<p>7. On 5 November 2008, in the deadliest massacre of the conflict which had pitted the CNDP 
against the FARDC and pro-Government Mayi-Mayi forces, the CNDP arbitrarily executed at 
least 64 people in the town of Kiwanja, mainly young men accused of being members of the 
Mayi-Mayi or of collaborating with them. There are strong indications that the death toll was 
higher, but the UNJHRO has been unable to confirm additional deaths due to concerns for the 
safety of victims and witnesses and the volatile security situation in Kiwanja. The CNDP 
occupied Kiwanja after FARDC soldiers retreated from the locality. Camps for internally 
displaced persons in Kiwanja and neighbouring Rutshuru were dismantled. During the same 
period, 65 men were abducted by the CNDP, of which more than half were later released 
following contacts between the UNJHRO and CNDP authorities in Rutshuru. UNJHRO also 
obtained first-hand witness testimony of other human rights abuses, including forced 
recruitment, forced disappearance, rape, castration, arbitrary arrest, looting and destruction of 
property.  
</p>
<p>8. FARDC troops were also responsible for serious human rights violations during the recent 
conflict in North Kivu. As the CNDP expanded its control over the region north of Goma 
throughout September and October 2008, fleeing FARDC elements committed numerous human 
rights violations including 11 cases of arbitrary killing, 2 cases of summary execution and 
49 cases of rape, according to an UNHJRO investigation. FARDC troops also pillaged houses, 
shops, medical centres, schools and humanitarian convoys along their way. During investigation 
missions carried out in November 2008, the UNJHRO observed evidence of pillaging in various 
locations on the Kanyabayonga-Lubero axis. Members of eight FARDC brigades, for instance, 
looted private property between 10 and 20 November 2008 in Kanyabayonga, a village which at 
the time had been under their control for over three weeks. 
</p>
<p>9. UNJHRO investigations also point to serious abuses committed by FDLR forces. More 
than 100 retaliatory killings by the FDLR against civilians attempting to flee their villages or 
resist looting are alleged to have taken place since the beginning of the aforementioned </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Congolese-Rwandan military operation. For example, since 26 January 2009 at least 29 civilians 
were allegedly killed and 30 wounded by FDLR elements in three villages located near Kibua. 
The FDLR also killed a prominent traditional chief in Pinga, Walikale territory, on 14 February, 
and committed 28 rapes in the same area since the beginning of February 2009.  
</p>
<p>10. The UNJHRO has also confirmed reports of an FDLR attack on Kanyatsi 
village, 140 kilometres south-west of Butembo, on 19 February 2009. During the attack, the 
FDLR gang-raped eight women and looted village homes. As a result of the above-mentioned 
attacks, many families have fled towards the towns of Kirumba, Kayna and Kanyabayonga. On 
20 February 2009 in Mukeberwa village, also in southern Lubero territory, the FDLR allegedly 
killed three men who were working in their fields.   
</p>
<p>11. On 21 February 2009, the UNJHRO participated in a MONUC multidisciplinary 
humanitarian assessment mission to Remeka, in South Masisi which confirmed the presence 
there of more than 3,000 internally displaced persons. Reportedly, more than 20 villages in 
Walikale and Masisi territories have been vacated due to recent FDLR attacks.  
</p>
<p>12. Previously, on 4 June 2008, some 20 FDLR militiamen led by an individual known as 
Colonel Soki attacked the Kinyandoni II camp for internally displaced persons, firing 
indiscriminately. The attackers then moved towards the Kinyandoni I camp for internally 
displaced persons. Encountering opposition from the FARDC, they fled the area, once again 
firing indiscriminately and looting as they did so. Four civilians were killed and 15 civilians 
were injured. 
</p><p>13. The UNJHRO also documented seven arbitrary executions and four rapes in Kahunga, near 
Kiwanja, reportedly carried out by members of the FDLR. On 26 November, a group of four 
men, including 12 and 15 year-old boys, and eight women, including a 16 year-old girl, were on 
their way to cultivate their fields in Kahunga, near Kiwanja, when they were intercepted by six 
unidentified armed men. The armed men led the 12 persons into a nearby forest where, according 
to eye witnesses, they killed the four men, raped four of the women, and beat the remaining four 
women, three of whom died as a result of the beatings.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Unprecedented attacks against civilians by the  
Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army in Oriental Province 
</b></p>
<p>14. In the months of September and October 2008, the LRA considerably intensified its 
attacks against civilians in Oriental Province, first targeting villages north of Dungu and 
infiltrating the town itself between 1 and 2 November 2008. During those attacks, at least 
76 civilians were killed and 177 children abducted, according to information gathered by the 
UNJHRO.  
</p>
<p>15. While the LRA seems to have been dispersed during the &#8220;Lightning Thunder&#8221; joint 
operation launched by the FARDC, the Uganda People&#8217;s Defence Force (UPDF) and the South 
Sudan army in December 2008, they have not refrained from committing subsequent, massive 
abuses, as evidenced by the massacres of several hundreds of civilians during a series of attacks 
between 25 to 27 December 2008 in the town of Faradje and the villages of Doruma and Gurba, 
in the Haut-Uele district of Oriental Province. The UNJHRO has also obtained information 
indicating that at least 30 civilians from the territories of Dungu and Faradje have been killed by 
the LRA in subsequent incidents since the beginning of February 2009.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. The UNJHRO has also received information indicating that a series of LRA attacks on 
civilians in the Bas-Uele and Ituri districts on 14-15 February resulted in the killing of at least 
six persons and the abduction of more than 20. 
</p>
<p><b>II. OVERALL HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Generalized impunity - a main contributing factor  
to violations 
</b></p>
<p>17. During the reporting period, efforts to combat impunity in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo suffered serious setbacks. Examples illustrating this situation include the lack of a judicial 
investigation into the violent quelling by the PNC in early 2007 and 2008 of a series of 
demonstrations by members of the BDK politico-religious movement, which led to more than 
200 deaths, as documented by the UNJHRO, and the failure of the authorities to investigate the 
Kinshasa events of 22-25 March 2007, during which at least 300 persons were killed, including 
by arbitrary executions and disproportionate use of force.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>18. Cases where the UNJHRO has participated in joint investigation missions with Congolese 
prosecutorial authorities have often been left incomplete. In those cases where the authorities did 
proceed to arrest persons suspected of having committed human rights abuses, the latter&#8217;s trials 
often did not register any progress over the reporting period. Several Ituri warlords arrested in 
March 2005, for instance, remain in prolonged detention in Kinshasa with no indication of an 
upcoming trial.  
</p>
<p>19. The passivity of the judiciary can often be ascribed to a combination of lack of political 
will, capacity and interference from the authorities. An example of the latter is the FARDC&#8217;s 
occasional practice of promoting perpetrators of human rights abuses rather than sanctioning 
them or preventing escapes in those cases where they have been sentenced. An illustrative case is 
that of Justin Matata Wanaloki, known as Cobra Matata. Investigations conducted by several 
entities and organizations, including the UNJHRO, confirmed that Cobra Matata was one of the 
key rebel commanders involved in the Nyakunde massacre of September 5, 2002, during which 
at least 1,200 civilians were killed. Matata was later promoted to the rank of Colonel in the 
FARDC. 
</p>
<p>20. Security Council resolution 1856 of 22 December 2008 reiterated the Security Council&#8217;s 
past requests to the Congolese authorities to &#8220;establish a vetting mechanism to take into account 
when they select candidates for official positions, including key posts in the armed forces, 
national police and other security services, the candidates&#8217; past actions in terms of respect for 
international humanitarian law and human rights&#8221;. No such process has been formally initiated. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  MONUC Human Rights Division and OHCHR, <i>Special Investigation into the Kinshasa Events 
</i></p>
<p><i>of March 2007 and their Aftermath: Preliminary Findings</i>, June 2007, published by OHCHR in 
January 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>On the contrary, the process of reintegration of CNDP forces into the FARDC, which began in 
February 2009, did not take into account issues of accountability, despite the fact that several 
high-ranking CNDP officers are alleged to have been responsible for serious human rights 
abuses.  
</p>
<p>21. In the most significant setback, current CNDP leader Bosco Ntaganda, indicted by the ICC 
for the enlistment, conscription and active use of children in hostilities in Ituri between July 2002 
and December 2003 while he was chief of military operations for the Union des patriotes 
Congolais (UPC) was being considered for a senior position in the FARDC.  
</p>
<p>22. Similarly, there is no indication that Laurent Nkunda, the former CNDP leader 
apprehended in Rwanda in January 2009, will be brought to justice. Nkunda is one of the most 
well known perpetrators of human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Several human rights investigations point to his responsibility for a massacre in Kisangani in 
2002 and for the widespread summary executions, rape and looting that followed the invasion by 
his forces of Bukavu in June 2004, among other incidents.  
</p>
<p>23. Given the difficulties experienced at the national level in prosecuting perpetrators of 
human rights abuses and execute sentences when pronounced, investigations undertaken by the 
ICC are a welcome complementary endeavor in efforts to combat impunity. The ICC has 
undertaken several steps throughout the reporting period in the context of its proceedings 
regarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, the former 
commander of the Front des Nationalistes et Int&#233;grationnistes (FNI), was arrested on 
6 February 2008, and on the following day he was surrendered by the Congolese authorities and 
transferred to the Hague. He will stand trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The 
trial of Thomas Lubanga, who was the first suspect to be transferred to the ICC and is facing 
charges related to the recruitment and use of child soldiers, opened on 26 January 2009. Besides, 
former Congolese Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba was arrested on 24 May 2008 by Belgian 
authorities pursuant to an ICC arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity 
allegedly committed by his Mouvement pour la lib&#233;ration du Congo (MLC) troops in Central 
African Republic between 15 October 2002 and 20 March 2003. 
</p>
<p>24. One critical development in terms of efforts to combat impunity was the launching in 
July 2008 of the OHCHR-led Mapping Exercise aimed at creating an inventory of the most 
serious human rights and international humanitarian law violations in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo from 1993 to 2003. The team carrying out the Mapping Exercise, a collaborative 
effort between OHCHR and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) which follows 
a request by the Secretary-General, is also mandated by the Security Council to make an 
assessment of the judicial system in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to formulate 
options for transitional justice, and will play a crucial role in assisting the Congolese authorities 
to devise a strategy to address the enormous volume of war crimes and crimes against humanity 
perpetrated during the period covered by the exercise. The Mapping Exercise entered its 
operational phase in October 2008 and is scheduled to end in June 2009 with the submission of a 
report, through the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Under-Secretary-General for 
Peacekeeping Operations, to the Secretary-General. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Increasing political repression and related human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>25. Two years after presidential, national and provincial elections, a climate of intimidation 
has expanded and seriously hampers any form of critical dialogue, political tolerance or free 
expression. More than 100 members of the politico-religious movement BDK in Bas-Congo died 
in February and March 2008 as a result of unwarranted and excessive use of force and in some 
cases arbitrary executions by the PNC. The PNC operation was launched to address increasing 
incidents of violence, including killings, by BDK members and serious cases of usurpation of 
state power. In addition to the massacre of BDK members, state security forces have been 
increasingly implicated in a climate of impunity in politically-motivated human rights 
violations against human rights defenders, journalists and members of opposition parties. Most 
notably, several members of the Mouvement de Lib&#233;ration du Congo (MLC) of former 
Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba have been targets of political repression.  
</p>
<p>26. Throughout May 2008, several persons from Equateur - Bemba&#8217;s home province - were 
detained by various branches of the security forces (the Garde r&#233;publicaine, or Republican 
Guard, the Special Services Branch of the PNC, and Military Intelligence) following a wave of 
arrests. Most of them were former officers of Jean-Pierre Bemba&#8217;s security detail (the DPP), 
FARDC and PNC officers. The exact number of persons arrested remains unknown. Some of the 
arrests have been officially acknowledged by the authorities. However, despite several attempts, 
the security services have declined to provide MONUC with information on their status and 
whereabouts. On 1 September 2008, 13 of the officers arrested in May 2008 were transferred to 
the Centre p&#233;nitentiare et de reeducation de Kinshasa (CPRK), the city&#8217;s main prison. 
Similarly, since October 2008, dozens of new cases of arbitrary detention of persons affiliated 
with the MCL were reported. Most of these are being held at the PNC headquarters in 
Kinshasa, known as Kin Mazi&#232;re, to which the UNJHRO has been denied access despite 
MONUC&#8217;s mandate. In late December 2008, 46 of the prisoners were transferred to the CPRK. 
The majority of them were allegedly tortured and submitted to cruel, inhumane and degrading 
treatment.  
</p>
<p>27. Several persons who were arrested due to their ethnicity or perceived affiliation to the 
CNDP are also detained in Kinshasa. Between 9 December 2007 and 11 January 2008, 
79 persons, including 75 civilians - of whom 31 were minors - commonly referred to as &#8220;les 
Rwandais&#8221;, i.e. &#8220;the Rwandans&#8221;, were arrested by Military Intelligence in Goma and transferred 
to Military Intelligence and Agence nationale de renseignements (ANR) facilities in Kinshasa. 
The UNJHRO was not granted access to those of the detainees who were kept at Kin Mazi&#232;re. 
The minors were released in April 2008 following sustained efforts by MONUC. 
</p>
<p>28. These political detainees added to the backlog of hundreds of political detainees including 
several groups arrested towards the end of the second Congolese war (2004) and after the 
March 2007 events in Kinshasa. Finally on 25 July 2008, a governmental commission 
comprising the Minister of Justice, the Deputy Minister for Human Rights, military and public 
prosecutors, and the penitentiary administration of the CPRK began a process of releasing more 
than 200 detainees belonging to the two above-mentioned categories that had been held illegally 
or in pre-trial detention at the CPRK.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>29. Besides opposition members or supporters, others have also been subjected to threats and 
ill-treatment. Human rights activists and journalists regularly face death threats, intimidation and 
harassment, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary arrests and detention and 
violations of their rights to freedom of movement, speech and association. Since mid-2007, the 
UNJHRO has documented 149 cases of human rights violations committed against human rights 
activists and journalists, in particular those who are actively involved in the fight against 
impunity. The main perpetrators were political and administrative authorities, especially in 
remote areas, elements of the FARDC, the Republican Guard, the PNC, ANR and other security 
forces.  
</p>
<p>30. The most emblematic case in this context is that of the murder, on 17 June 2007 of 
Radio Okapi journalist Serge Maheshe by unidentified gunmen in Bukavu, South Kivu. On 
18 June 2007 the police arrested two FARDC soldiers suspected of carrying out the killing, and 
the Bukavu Military Tribunal held a public hearing at which these suspects appeared alongside 
10 civilians. Two weeks later, however, two friends of the victim, who had been considered the 
only eyewitnesses to the crime, were arrested as the main suspects in the case, along with 
two other civilians who had allegedly confessed to the crime. On 28 August 2007, the Bukavu 
Military Tribunal convicted and sentenced the four civilians to death and acquitted the 
two FARDC suspects originally accused of the crime. The defense appealed the decision. On 
8 September 2007, the two accused who had confessed to having committed the crime retracting 
their statements, accusing two magistrates from the Office of the Military Prosecutor of Bukavu 
of having pressured them into making false statements.  
</p>
<p>31. On 17 September 2007, MONUC addressed a letter to the authorities calling for a thorough 
investigation into the allegations brought against the magistrates, but no such investigation was 
conducted. MONUC prepared a detailed report on the trial which was transmitted to the 
Congolese authorities. The report concluded that the Bukavu Military Tribunal did not conduct 
an impartial trial in accordance with national and international due process standards. The report 
documented the lack of an in-depth investigation, important contradictions in the declarations of 
the accused who confessed to the crime, the persistent refusal of the tribunal to investigate other 
credible leads and to proceed with ballistic and medico-legal verifications which MONUC 
offered to facilitate.  
</p>
<p>32. The appeal trial, which began on 6 February 2008, was characterized by similar 
irregularities. No further investigations were conducted by the Court and no ballistic evidence 
was presented. Defense lawyers were frequently interrupted or prevented from speaking to the 
Court or to their clients, and were systematically censored when trying to question the Court&#8217;s 
partiality. The trial was conducted in a climate of intimidation; several independent observers 
from local and international NGOs, as well as three lawyers for the defense, received death 
threats. On 21 May 2008, the Court upheld the convictions and death penalties handed down to 
the two civilians accused of carrying out the murder, and acquitted the two eyewitnesses to the 
crime. Bizarrely, a third civilian, who had been acquitted in the original trial, was also sentenced 
to death for criminal conspiracy. On 22 May 2008, the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo issued a joint communiqu&#233; welcoming the release of Maheshe&#8217;s two friends, but 
criticizing the death sentences handed down to the three civilians. They also denounced 
irregularities in the trial, stating that the Court had refused to explore credible leads in the case 
and to ask for ballistic expertise.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>33. While the Maheshe trial is the most emblematic recent example of the dangers facing 
journalists and human rights defenders, journalists have also been targeted in other actions by 
state agents. On 3 November 2007, a female journalist with Radio Okapi was briefly arrested and 
subjected to ill-treatment by Republican Guard soldiers in Kinshasa. The soldiers ordered her to 
lie down; one of them held her by her hair, kicked her and verbally abused her. 
</p>
<p>34. Events such as the above are not limited to Kinshasa. In Kasa&#239; Oriental province, for 
instance, the UNJHRO has documented numerous cases of journalists who were threatened by 
PNC agents for their presumed collaboration with the UNJHRO. Two cases involved journalists 
who were arbitrarily arrested by the PNC after they had criticized the state security services, 
including the PNC. Another case concerned two journalists with Radio Okapi as well as 
one journalist from a local radio station who were threatened after they had made comments on 
air about sensitive issues such as the theft and embezzlement of state funds. 
</p>
<p>35. A similar pattern of repression exists with regard to human rights defenders. Whether 
activists operate locally or at the national level, authorities often react aggressively to their 
activities, carrying out arbitrary arrests or using disproportionate force. On 1 April 2008, an 
airplane transporting four members of a human rights NGO from Lubumbashi, Katanga to the 
site of a massacre was not authorized to take off by local authorities, thus preventing the 
members of the NGO from seeking additional evidence for use in a trial against the Anvil 
Mining company taking place in Australia. Human rights defenders are also targeted by the 
authorities in other areas. Here again, the situation in Kasa&#239; Orientale stands out. One recent 
example is that of a local human rights defender who was arrested on 7 November 2008 by ANR 
agents in Bulongo, 280 kilometres from Kananga, after conducting a seminar on the rights of 
detainees. Neither his family nor the UNJHRO have been able to obtain information on his 
whereabouts.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>36. Sexual violence remains widespread in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Far from 
being limited to the context of armed conflict, it occurs throughout the country, both as a result 
of unbalanced power relations between state agents and civilians, and within the civilian 
population itself. Despite the enactment of laws which provide for harsher punishments for 
crimes of sexual violence and the increased coverage given to sexual violence in eastern Congo 
by the international media, members of the FARDC, the PNC and armed groups make up a large 
proportion of the perpetrators. Few perpetrators of sexual violence are arrested, and many are 
subsequently released through the intervention of local authorities or by corrupt police officers. 
Victims&#8217; families are often encouraged to engage in out-of-court settlements known as 
&#8220;arrangements &#224; l&#8217;amiable&#8221;. In other cases, military and police commanders refuse to hand over 
subordinates to the military justice system.  
</p><p>37. On more than one occasion during the reporting period, PNC officers have committed acts 
of sexual violence during what could be described as punitive actions against civilians. This 
problem is recurrent in Equateur province, where several such incidents appear to have 
deliberately targeted the civilian population. One of these was the incident in Ngele village on 
13 May 2008. Two PNC officers had severely beaten two young men for walking shirtless in 
public. In reaction, the population threw stones at the policemen, who in turn fired warning </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>shots. A few days later, 28 police officers, led by the local PNC Deputy Commander, conducted 
a raid on the village. The PNC officers raped 19 women, including six children, and looted 
homes in the village.  
</p>
<p>38. There have, however, been some encouraging developments, in the form of the 
numerous public commitments made by the authorities, beginning in November 2007, to fight 
impunity for sexual violence. In addition, on 18 February 2008, in Lifumba Waka, Equateur 
province, the Mbandaka Military Tribunal convicted six police officers for mass rape and other 
crimes committed in the area between 17 and 19 March 2006. While some progress has thus 
been noted in the prosecution of junior officials suspected of having committed acts of sexual 
violence, fighting impunity at higher levels of the police and military hierarchy remains a 
challenge.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Arbitrary arrests, torture and appalling detention conditions 
</b></p>
<p>39. Arbitrary arrests are frequent occurrences in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The 
FARDC continues to arrest people without the legal power to do so. Likewise, PNC officers 
arrest and detain persons for civil matters such as non-payment of debts and property disputes, in 
disregard of Article 11 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which 
DRC is a party, which stipulates that no one shall be arrested solely for their inability to carry out 
a contractual obligation. When unable to locate the alleged perpetrator of a criminal offence, the 
PNC regularly arrests family members or others who are not involved in, or entirely unaware of, 
the affair in question. Conversely, a large percentage of the relatively few perpetrators of sexual 
violence who are arrested are released through the intervention of local authorities or by corrupt 
police officers who encourage the families of victims to engage in out-of-court settlements, 
which are expressly forbidden by the new laws governing cases of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>40. Upon their arrest, detainees are commonly denied the guarantees to which they are entitled 
under Congolese law. Firstly, they are generally not properly registered: record-keeping is often 
incomplete or outdated. There is a reluctance to uphold the new Proc&#232;s-verbal de saisie des 
pr&#233;venus (PVSP), a document issued by the Prosecutor General stipulating that detainees should 
be informed of their rights and of the charges imputed to them. In addition, detainees are 
commonly denied the right to be brought before a judge within the 48-hour time period 
stipulated by the Congolese constitution, which has led to the proliferation of <i>h&#233;berg&#233;s</i>, inmates 
who are detained solely on the basis of the PVSP. This is true both for detentions carried out by 
both the PNC and the ANR. In the case of the ANR, very few cases are transferred to the offices 
of the Public or Military Prosecutor, and most detainees are released after paying fines that are 
not officially recorded.  
</p>
<p>41. Under these circumstances, it is unsurprising that there are many more remand inmates 
than convicts in Congolese prisons. It is estimated that more than 80% of inmates are on remand 
or awaiting trial. According to figures obtained in June 2008, approximately 75% of the 
4,000 inmates at the CPRK (built to accommodate 1,000 inmates) are in pre-trial detention. 
Long-term pre-trial detention undermines the rule of law and the protection of fundamental 
human rights, including the rights of the victim to seek redress and the right to presumption of 
innocence enshrined in the Congolese constitution and in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. This situation is attributable to the dysfunctional state of the criminal justice 
system and is also a contributing factor in recurring disturbances and escapes. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. Due to the high number of arbitrary detentions without subsequent review by judicial 
authorities and the lack of funding for the building of new detention centers, Congolese prisons 
are generally overcrowded, compounding the appalling conditions already prevailing within 
them. Reports also indicate that suspects in custody are routinely subjected to violations of their 
physical integrity, including rape, torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment.  
</p>
<p>43. Torture and ill-treatment in ANR and Republican Guard detention facilities are all the 
more worrisome in that these entities remain almost inaccessible to outside observers. In relation 
to ANR facilities, judicial authorities are barred from carrying out inspections, in clear 
contradiction with the laws of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This state of affairs is 
compounded by ANR agents&#8217; consistent refusal to allow the UNJHRO access to their facilities in 
several parts of the country, particularly Kinshasa, South Kivu, Bas-Congo, North Kivu and 
Oriental Province, despite MONUC&#8217;s mandate and the existence of a directive from President 
Joseph Kabila dated 5 July 2005 ordering all security forces, intelligence services and judicial 
authorities to provide unhindered access to UNJHRO staff. Likewise, access to detention 
facilities operated by the Republican Guard continued to be denied to judicial authorities and 
civil society organizations as well as to UNJHRO staff. 
</p>
<p>44. In addition to the cases of torture and ill-treatment described above, confinement in a 
Congolese prison in itself often amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Regular visits 
by UNJHRO field offices to state-run prisons throughout the country indicate that dilapidated 
cells, the lack of food and medical supplies, overcrowding, corruption, unqualified prison staff 
and a lack of rehabilitation programs for inmates remain the norm. During the reporting period, 
at least 65 inmates have died due to severe overcrowding, malnutrition, lack of health care and 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>III. ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS JOINT HUMAN RIGHTS 
OFFICE IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO  
</b></p>
<p>45. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(UNJHRO) comprises the Human Rights Division of MONUC and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The two offices have been fully 
integrated and the UNJHRO functions in accordance with their two mandates.  
</p>
<p>46. The Human Rights Division of MONUC is mandated by United Nations Security 
Council resolutions 1756 of 15 May 2007 and 1794 of 21 December 2007 as well as 1856 
of 22 December 2008 to assist in the promotion and protection of human rights, with particular 
attention to women, children and vulnerable persons, investigate human rights violations with a 
view to putting an end to impunity, assist in the development and implementation of a 
transitional justice strategy, and cooperate in national and international efforts to bring to justice 
perpetrators of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The Human 
Rights Division is also mandated to assist the Government to establish a vetting process within 
the security forces to ensure that members who have committed serious violations of human 
rights and international human rights law are not given key posts but are suspended, replaced and 
brought to justice. The Human Rights Division also trains members of the security forces, 
members of parliament and civil society organizations in human rights standards.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>47. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, established in 1996 following the signing of an agreement between the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo is mandated, inter alia, to monitor the human rights situation in the 
country and to strengthen the capacity of national institutions working on human rights issues in 
order to ensure that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is able to fully comply with 
provisions of international and regional treaties to which it is party. 
</p>
<p>48. During the reporting period, the UNJHRO has taken both responsive and proactive 
measures to address human rights violations occurring in areas of armed conflict as well as 
challenges of a more structural nature that are hindering the enjoyment of rights. In this light, the 
UNJHRO has strengthened both its monitoring and advocacy activities. In areas of armed 
conflict, human rights officers have been deployed in special joint protection teams established 
by MONUC to enhance its capacity to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical 
violence.  
</p>
<p>49. In order to assist the Government with judicial and disciplinary follow-up of serious 
human rights violations, follow-up committees have been established by the Ministries of 
Defense and Interior at the national and provincial level with the participation of the FARDC, 
the PNC and the judiciary. One of the major activities carried out by the UNJHRO was to 
actively follow up on human rights violations committed by state agents on a case-by-case basis, 
in particular through participation in these committees. For other state institutions, similar 
committees have not been established, making collaboration more difficult. This is particularly 
the case for the ANR and the Republican Guard. 
</p>
<p>50. Both within the follow-up committees and through activities targeting the broader public, 
special attention is devoted to cases relating to sexual violence. The UNJHRO has also 
intensified efforts to fight impunity in the area of sexual violence by continuing its trial 
monitoring activities.  
</p>
<p>51. In late 2008 the Senior United Nations Advisor and Coordinator for Sexual Violence in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, in consultation with relevant United Nations agencies and 
MONUC, finalized a comprehensive strategy to combat sexual violence in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. The strategy consists of a plan of action for each of four priority 
components, one of which, related to combating impunity, is led by the UNJHRO: The three 
main objectives of this component are (1) the development of an effective penal policy 
specifically targeting sexual violence and adopting a victim-centered approach, (2) the 
improvement of access to justice for victims; and (3) the removal of existing obstacles to the 
implementation of the sexual violence law passed by the Congolese parliament in 2006. 
</p>
<p>52. Two initiatives related to UNJHRO-led component are currently being 
implemented: 1) advocacy for the prosecution of alleged perpetrators of sexual violence crimes; 
2) follow-up with the Ministry of Justice on the implementation of a &#8220;Roadmap against impunity 
for sexual violence&#8221;. This document, developed in March 2008, consists of a six-point 
programme proposing quick-impact measures to advance judicial responses to crimes of sexual 
violence: 1) enactment of a Presidential decree exempting victims of sexual violence from 
paying court costs; 2) adoption of a standardized medical certificate for victims of sexual </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>violence; 3) increased recruitment and promotion of female judicial personnel; 4) provision of 
compensation for victims of the 2003 mass rape in Songo Mboyo, Equateur province, who 
despite a court ruling in 2006 have yet to receive reparations; 5) adoption of a circular addressed 
to Congolese judicial staff clarifying certain provisions of the aforementioned law on sexual 
violence, in particular with respect to the maximum procedural delay for completion of sexual 
violence trials; and 6) creation of a specialized judicial body to investigate and try sexual 
offences. 
</p>
<p>53. Also within the framework of the recently finalised comprehensive United Nations strategy 
on sexual violence for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the UNJHRO is responsible for 
implementing the legal components of joint UNFPA-UNICEF-OHCHR projects that aim to 
reduce impunity for perpetrators of sexual violence by providing legal assistance to victims of 
rape and other forms of sexual violence through the provision of legal aid clinics in several 
provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  
</p>
<p>54. In addition to measures taken in response to human rights violations, the UNJHRO has 
continued its efforts to promote human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by 
carrying out a broad range of activities with relevant stakeholders. The UNJHRO has conducted 
round tables, training sessions and workshops, and distributed national and international human 
rights texts to a wide range of actors, including lawyers, military and police personnel, and 
members of parliament and civil society.  
</p>
<p>55. During the reporting period, technical cooperation activities and advocacy work have 
increasingly focused on specific thematic issues. Amongst these activities were a series of 
seminars aimed at advocating for the establishment of a national human rights institution in 
compliance with the Paris Principles.<b>2</b> A draft law on the establishment of a national human 
rights commission was adopted by the Senate on 6 June 2008 and submitted to the National 
Assembly. The UNJHRO is seeking to ensure that the Paris Principles are fully reflected in the 
draft law. A project carried out in partnership with UNAIDS has aimed to enhance the protection 
of persons living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. In the context of this project, the UNJHRO 
carried out awareness-raising activities with members of parliament in order to facilitate the 
adoption of a law on the rights of persons living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. The law was 
passed on 24 June 2008, and the UNJHRO has since engaged in further activities to raise 
awareness of the new law amongst relevant stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>56. The UNJHRO has assisted the establishment of a national network of human rights NGOs 
specialized in the field of protection and has provided training for its members. NGOs have 
organized themselves in protection networks in all provinces of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, save Bas-Congo and Bandundu. Victims and witnesses in cases implicating members of 
the PNC and ANR were amongst those to benefit from this new network. In such cases, victims 
were relocated and provided with medical, psycho-social, socio-economic and legal assistance.

</p>
<p>The work also included the protection of victims and witnesses in several sensitive cases such as

for the assassination of Serge Maheshe in South Kivu, and during the judicial investigations

and 6 August 2008.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The successful conclusion of the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo in 2007 raised hopes that this vast war-torn country could enter a period of stability. 
However, in eastern Congo, in particular in North Kivu and in Oriental Province, where 
armed groups have remained active, mass-scale killings and other serious violations of 
human rights and international humanitarian law have continued to be perpetrated in 
impunity. In order to better prevent atrocities in the short term, the utmost priority should 
be given by the FARDC and MONUC to enhancing the protection of civilians by 
anticipating potential attacks on the basis of lessons learnt from past atrocities. Moreover, 
ongoing peace negotiations should aim at addressing the root causes of conflict such as 
illegal exploitation of natural resources and integrating mechanisms that take into account 
records of abuses committed by individual commanders in past conflicts. This could, 
inter alia take the form of a realistic vetting mechanism which effectively sanctions those 
with particularly worrying human rights records, better funding and training of FARDC 
personnel in order to create a more professional army that fulfils its constitutional role of 
providing security for the Congolese population, and increased efforts to combat impunity, 
including at the higher levels of the military hierarchy.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>In light of the lack of progress made in the fight against impunity, the aforementioned 
OHCHR-led Mapping Exercise will be of critical importance to addressing the issue of 
accountability. The Mapping Exercise&#8217;s recommendations on transitional justice will need 
full political backing. The international community as a whole must employ all its leverage 
to ensure that justice and accountability underpin the quest for durable peace in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. </b> 
</p>
<p>59. <b>Even in regions relatively free of conflict, serious human rights violations continue to 
be committed frequently by state agents. Many of these violations derive from the current 
and previous Congolese Government&#8217;s lack of progress in efficiently and transparently 
collecting and redistributing the country&#8217;s vast natural resources wealth, which in turn has 
led to practices that have become structurally embedded in many state agencies. After 
decades of underfunded public services, state agents such as the FARDC and the PNC 
regularly abuse their power to extract financial and other benefits from the civilian 
population. Most worrying is the climate of increasing political repression affecting the 
democratic space that had begun to emerge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Peace, development and the emergence of democracy in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo will remain difficult to achieve unless the challenges outlined in this report are 
tackled as a matter of priority. Crucially, new impetus must be given to efforts to address </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>the issue of impunity. The Congolese Government, with the active assistance of the 
international community, must be prepared to deal with this issue in a forceful manner to 
discourage those who would resort to violence to gain or keep political and economic 
influence. Following the successful holding of a series of free and fair elections in the 
country in the recent past, Congolese citizens held high expectations that their lives would 
noticeably improve. These expectations must not be let down.</b>   
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>61.  <b>The High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo: 
(i) Enhance the efficiency of, and increase transparency over, the collection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>state resources and prioritize the allocation of these resources to further 
the realization of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Increase financial means for the professionalization of state services, in 
particular through training and awareness-raising on the constitutional 
mandate of army officials in the context of the Disarmament, 
Demobilization and Reintegration process and of police officers in the 
context of the Security Sector Reform process; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Further implement the circulars issued by the Minister of Defense and the 
Minister of Interior on the establishment of follow-up committees for 
human rights violations committed by members of the FARDC and PNC, 
in particular in those provinces where the committees are not yet fully 
operational; encourage a constructive dialogue between all members of 
these committees; and take measures to enable a better follow-up for cases 
of violations involving senior officers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Give priority to enacting legislation establishing a credible and 
independent national human rights commission; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Enable the judiciary to fulfill its constitutional role in full independence, 
inter alia through the strengthening of the Conseil Sup&#233;rieur de la 
Magistrature and the payment of adequate salaries for magistrates; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Ensure that the UNJHRO has access to all prisons and detention centers in 
accordance with MONUC&#8217;s mandate and with the presidential directive 
dated 5 July 2005 instructing all security forces, intelligence services and 
judicial authorities to provide MONUC human rights officers with 
unhindered access to detention facilities throughout the country, including 
those administered by the ANR and the Republican Guard; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vii) Further the fight against impunity for international crimes in cooperation 
with the ICC by taking all necessary measures to execute arrest warrants </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>issued by the International Criminal Court and by combating impunity 
domestically, inter alia through the adoption of legislation implementing 
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and by giving 
positive injunction for priority to be given to the prosecution of alleged 
perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity regardless of 
their hierarchical rank; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(viii) Allocate adequate resources to the penitentiary system, inter alia to 
guarantee food and health care supplies and their equal distribution 
among prisoners and detainees and to enable prison officials to maintain 
rigorous records of the charges pending against individual detainees and 
the sentences to be carried out by prisoners; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ix) Clarify charges against persons held in pre-trial detention; release those 
who are detained solely for their opinions, for their belonging to 
opposition parties or for civil matters beyond the scope of national and 
international criminal law; provide expeditious judicial review for all 
others; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) Encourage and enable public dialogue and scrutiny in order to ensure the 
sustainability and advancement of the democratic process; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(xi) Increase efforts to combat sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, inter alia through the recently adopted Comprehensive 
Strategy to Combat Sexual Violence in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The international community: 
(i) Strengthen its efforts to assist the Government o f the Democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of the Congo in carrying out comprehensive and sustainable 
reforms of the justice and security sectors, including through the 
implementation of a transitional justice strategy based on the 
recommendations of the OHCHR-led Mapping Exercise of human rights 
violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Encourage and assist the Congolese authorities in controlling resources 
derived from the extractive industry and other business activities, inter 
alia by refraining from participation in the illegal exploitation of 
Congolese natural resources and by holding accountable state and 
non-state actors involved in such illegal exploitation and trade; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Avoid implication in military operations likely to have a detrimental effect 
on the human rights situation in conflict zones, inter alia by encouraging a 
reorientation of peacekeeping activities towards the protection of the 
civilian population on the basis of lessons learnt from past atrocities; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(iv) Actively engage with the Congolese authorities and armed groups in 
efforts to reach a sustainable peace agreement that includes 
comprehensive mechanisms to deal with past human rights violations and 
that will enable more rigorous scrutiny of any future abuses; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Ensure that adequate resources be allocated in order to implement the 
recently adopted Comprehensive Strategy to Combat Sexual Violence in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
