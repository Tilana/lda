SUMMARY
1.1
Introduction
The Pampas El Peñon Property is a gold-silver exploration property in the Antofagasta Region
(II)  of  northern  Chile  subject  to  an  agreement  where  Rouge  Resources  Ltd.  (‘Rouge‘  or  the
‘Company’),  purchases  100%  of  Arena  Minerals  Inc.’s  (‘Arena’)  interest  in  4-year  option
agreement to earn an 80% interest in Pampas El Peñon Property, plus the remaining 20% of the
property held by the underlying owner Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (‘SQM’).
At the request of Rouge Resources Ltd., James A. McCrea, P. Geo., carried out an independent
review  of  the  Pampas  El  Peñon  Property  (the  ‘Property’)  in  the  Municipality  of  Antofagasta,
Antofagasta Region (II), Chile.  The author conducted a property examination, reviewed available
exploration results and prepared this independent technical report (the ‘Report’) in accordance
with the requirements of National Instrument 43-101 (‘NI 43-101’) and Form 43-101F1 (Standards
of Disclosure for Mineral Properties) to be a comprehensive review of the exploration activities on
the property, and, if warranted, to provide recommendations for future work.  For the purposes of
NI 43-101, the Property is considered an early-stage exploration property.
The  sources  of  information  for  this  technical  report  are  the  results  from  the  site  visit;  internal
company reports from the Property owner, internal company reports from the Vendor, reports from
the operating mines in the area, plus other published government reports and scientific papers.
  Information  concerning  the  mining  concessions  comes  from  Arena  and  has  not  been
independently verified by the author.
1.2
Property Description and Ownership
The  Property  consists  of  two  groups  of  contiguous  mining  concessions  containing  13  mining
concessions  and  totalling  approximately  3,400  hectares.    The  concessions  are  all  mining
concessions and are owned by Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. under option to Rouge.
  The  concessions  optioned  to  Rouge  are  listed  in  Table  4.1.    The  concessions  are  shown  in
Figure 4.2.
1.2.1
Description of the Transaction
Rouge Resources has executed a Letter of Intent (‘LOI’), dated May 26, 2016, to purchase 100%
of Arena Minerals’ interest in a four-year definitive option agreement (‘SQM Option Agreement’)
to acquire between 85% and 100% of various claim blocks in the Pampas El Peñon project on
February 11, 2013.  To earn this interest, Rouge will pay Arena 9,550,000 common shares and
assume  Arena‘s  requirement  to  pay  to  the Sociedad  Química  y  Minera  de  Chile  S.A.  certain
annual  payments  and  complete  certain  minimum  work  commitment  expenditures  over  the
remainder of the four year period on a per hectare basis.  Rouge will issue 5,350,000 common
shares to Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. for consideration of a waiver by SQM of the
exploration commitments under the option agreements and for the purchase of a 15% ownership
in 1700 hectares bringing Rouges final interest in the Property to 100%.  The waiver limits the
total work commitment as not more than $1.83 million.  Rouge is required to pay SQM $225,000
and complete the work commitment of not more than $1.83 million by July 27, 2017.

1.3
Accessibility and Physiography
The Property is located 140 km southeast of the City of Antofagasta and access to the Property is
via Route CH-28 to Route CH-5, which is part of the Pan-American Highway and then east on
Route  B-55  which  passes  just  north  of  the  Augusta  Victoria  North  concession  group.    The
Property is readily accessible from a paved highway and hence on dirt roads across the desert to
access the individual prospects.  Total travel time from Antofagasta to the Property is about two
and a half hours.  The City of Antofagasta, the capital of Antofagasta Region and Province with a
population  of  345,420  (2012,  Wikipedia),  can  be  accessed  via  numerous  daily  flights  from
Santiago  and  other  centres  in  the  north  of  the  country  and  from  Lima,  Peru.    Flight  time  from
Santiago  to  Antofagasta  is  2  hours.    The  Pan-American  Highway  connects  Antofagasta  with
Santiago, 1,100 km to the south and the rest of Chile.
1.4
History
SQM historically exploited and explored for non-metallic minerals such as nitrates, sulphates and
iodine  on  the  Property.    The  modern  form  of  this  exploration  was  by  drilling  short  reverse
circulation holes on a 200 to 300 m grid, in a similar fashion to the early exploration programs
using hand-dug pits.  The holes were drilled mainly in the areas of the pampas (plains).  The
holes were concentrated in areas where they believed they would find caliche and so they were
generally away from areas of obvious rock outcrop.
SQM held the Property for non-metallic minerals and possibly conducted preliminary exploration
for nitrates on the Property but no evidence was seen in the field for hand dug pits or short, grid
drilled, RC holes which are the common methods used by SQM to explore for nitrites.  The author
does not know the timing of this preliminary exploration.  The possible reason for limited nitrate
exploration on the Property appears to be related to the geomorphology not being ideal for the
formation of caliches.
Recent  exploration,  in  2010-2011  was  focused  on  epithermal  gold-silver  vein  systems.    This
exploration,  which  included  prospecting,  geochemical  sampling,  trenching,  mapping  and  RC
drilling, was carried out only on the western concession group, as the northern concession group
has no outcrop.
1.5
Geological Setting and Mineralization
The Paleocene to early Eocene belt, hosting the third largest copper concentration in the central
Andes, extends for ~1,900 km from southern Peru to central Chile (lat 17º–32º S) and averages
30 to 50 km in width (Figure 7.2).  The belt is defined principally by porphyry-type deposits but
also  includes  associated  epithermal  deposits  like  the  high-sulphidation  epithermal  enargite-
bearing vein deposit at El Guanaco and epithermal gold-silver at El Peñon and at Faride.  The
most important epithermal deposit in the belt is El Peñon.
1.6
Exploration and Drilling
The initial exploration work was designed to verify the validity of previous work carried out on the
Property and review the existing exploration targets.  Existing trenches were visited and selected
samples were collected to verify the previously reported anomalies of trace elements. The RC
chips from the short drill hole program carried out by the previous owners were reviewed and the
existing geology mapping was reviewed.
There is no current drilling on the Property.  The SQM RC drill program in 2010-2011 is the last
drilling done on the property and is discussed in the history section.
The  Property  is  considered  prospective  for  the  discovery  of  new  epithermal  gold-silver
mineralization.

Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
There are currently no metallurgical studies for the Property.
1.8
Mineral Resources
There are currently no 43-101-compliant Mineral Resource estimates for the Property.
1.9
Interpretations and Conclusions
The  Pampas  El  Peñon  Property  displays  styles  of  mineralization  characteristic  of  the  low  to
intermediate sulphidation epithermal deposits similar to El Peñon where the veins do not crop
out on surface.  The Central Andean Paleocene belt is ~1900 kilometres long and extends from
southern Peru to central Chile.  Mineralization is associated with an orogen-parallel metallogenic
belt of highly prospective Jurassic and Paleocene-Early Miocene volcanic and intrusive rocks.
  This  suite  of  rocks  hosts  the  Lomas  Bayas,  Spence,  Sierra  Gorda,  El  Peñon,  and  Mantos
Blancos mines from the Antofagasta Region of Northern Chile and the region accounts for almost
18% of world copper production (2011) and significant gold production.
Current  exploration  on  the  Property  has  identified  five  priority  targets  with  geochemical  and
geological features similar to the productive low- to intermediate-sulphidation epithermal veins
found on Yamana Gold’s Pampa Augusta Victoria mine located immediately to the East of the
property limit.
The author has been unable to verify this information about Pampa Augusta Victoria and that the
information may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.
The Property is in the early exploration stage, the risks and uncertainties associated with this
stage  of  exploration  are  the  challenges  in  discovering  new,  potentially  economic,  epithermal
systems  on  a  property  where  the  majority  of  the  property  is  covered  by  recent  colluvial  and
alluvial deposits.  The foreseeable impacts of these risks and uncertainties would be the failure
to discover additional mineralization that would limit its exploration potential.
The Pampas El Peñon property warrants further exploration for epithermal gold-silver systems
with the potential of discovering a low to intermediate sulphidation epithermal deposit.
1.10
Recommendations
The recommended exploration and work programs, in US dollars, for the five drill targets on the
Property, are as follows:
Phase I $889,000
·
Geophysical survey $7,000
Ground Magnetic Survey
·
6,500 m RC drill program $715,000

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION and LOCATION
4.1
Property Location
The Pampas El Peñon Property is located in the Antofagasta Region (II) of northern Chile, 140
kilometres southeast of the city of Antofagasta in the Province and Municipality (Commune) of
Antofagasta.    The  geographic  coordinates  near  the  centre  of  the  Property  are  approximately
latitude 24° 11’ S by longitude 69o 26’ W or in WGS 84 Zone 19S, at 7,326,000 m North by
456,000 m East. The Property location is shown in Figure 4.1 along with local infrastructure and
highways.
4.1
Property Description
The Property is located in an area with extensive mining development and neighbouring world-
class  gold  and  copper  mines.    The  property  covers  a  poorly  tested  portion  of  the  highly
prospective  Paleocene-Early  Eocene  magmatic  arc  rocks  known  as  the  Paleocene  belt.    The
Property is adjacent to the epithermal Pampa Augusta Victoria (PAV) deposit of Yamana Gold’s
El Peñon mine and contains similar geochemical and structural features, which are prospective
for  the  discovery  of  low  to  intermediate  epithermal  gold/silver  systems  similar  to  those  in
production at El Peñon.
The author has been unable to verify this information about Pampa Augusta Victoria and that the
information may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.
The  property  consists  of  two  groups  of  contiguous  mining  concessions  containing  13
concessions and totalling approximately 3,400 ha.  The concessions are all mining concessions
and  are  owned  by  SQM  under  option  to  Rouge.    The  concessions  are  permitted  mining
concessions  and  maintenance  of  the  concessions  requires  the  payment  of  an  annual  tax  or
canon to the Chilean government.  The annual tax has been paid for 2016.  The concessions
optioned to Rouge are listed in Table 4.1 and shown in Figure 4.2.

Underlying Agreements
4.4.1
Rouge Resources and Arena Minerals
Arena Minerals Inc. executed with Rouge Resources Ltd. a letter of intent, dated May 26, 2016,
regarding the acquisition by Rouge of 100% of Arena Minerals’ interest in an option agreement to
acquire  between  85%  and  100%  of  various  claim  blocks,  collectively  called  the  Pampas  El
Peñon  project  on  February  11,  2013.    To  earn  this  interest,  Rouge  will  pay  Arena  9,550,000
common shares and assume Arena‘s requirement to pay to the Sociedad Química y Minera de
Chile  S.A.  certain  annual  payments  and  complete  certain  minimum  work  commitment
expenditures over the remainder of the four year period on a per hectare basis.  Rouge will issue
5,350,000  common  shares  to Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. for consideration of a
waiver  by  SQM  of  the  exploration  commitments  under  the  option  agreements  and  for  the
purchase of a 15% ownership in 1700 hectares bringing Rouges final interest in the Property to
100%.  The waiver limits the total work commitment as not more than $1.83 million.  Rouge is
required to pay SQM $225,000 and complete the work commitment of not more than $1.83 million
by July 27, 2017.
Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. sent the author a signed consent letter for the transfer
of Arena’s interest in the Property to Rouge.
4.4.2
Arena Minerals and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile
Arena Minerals, formally Antofagasta Gold, entered into an option agreement dated February 21,
2013  with Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (‘SQM’, the “Vendor”) to acquire between
85% and 100% of various claim blocks, collectively called the Pampas El Peñon  property.  The
Pampas El Peñon  property has been reduced to two groups of claims, the worked claims and
the greenfield claims, based on the mineral exploration work completed by the Vendor.
Pursuant  to  the  option  agreement  entered  into  between  the  Company  and  the  Vendor  with
respect to the 4,300 hectares of worked claims, the Company may acquire a 100% interest in
the  property  by  making  aggregate  cash  payments  to  the  Vendor  and  incur  exploration  and
development expenditures on the worked claims over the option term as listed in Table 4.2.

4.5
Chile Mining Regulations
Chile’s  mining  policy  is  based  on  legal  provisions  that  were  enacted  as  part  of  the  1980
Constitution.  These were established to stimulate the development of mining and to guarantee
the  property  rights  of  both  local  and  foreign  investors.    According  to  Chilean  Constitution  and
relevant laws, such as the Constitutional Organic Law on Mining Concessions, enacted in 1982
and the Mining Code, enacted in 1983, the State owns all mineral resources, but exploration and
exploitation of these resources by private parties is permitted through mining concessions, which
are granted by the courts (Morales & Besa, 2015).
The  National  Geology  and  Mining  Service  (“SERNAGEOMIN”)  is  the  Government  agency  in
charge of providing geological information, technical assistance to public and private interests
and to regulate the mining industry in Chile.

4.5.1
Mineral Tenure
Mining concessions grant both rights and obligations, as defined by the Constitutional Organic
Law on Mining Concessions and the Mining Code.  Concessions, as soon as they are registered,
can  be  mortgaged  or  transferred  and  the  concession  holder  has  full  ownership  of  the  rights.
 Once the concessions are granted, the holder is entitled to obtain the necessary easements and
rights of way to facilitate the exploration and exploitation.  In addition, the concession holder has
the  right  to  defend  his  ownership  against  the  State  and  third  parties,  including  the  owner  of
surface  rights,  as  detailed  below.    A  concession  includes  all  relevant  minerals  that  may  exist
within an area, and is obtained by filing a claim application and processing it through a judicial
procedure.1 Many of the steps involved in the constitution of mining concession are published
weekly in Chile’s Official Mining Bulletin for the relevant region.
Mining rights in Chile are acquired in the following stages:
Pedimento:
A Pedimento is an initial exploration claim whose position is well defined by UTM coordinates
defining north-south and east-west boundaries.  The minimum size of a Pedimento is 100 ha,
and the maximum size is 5,000 ha, with a maximum length-to-width ratio of 5:1.
The duration of an exploration concession is for a maximum period of 2 years; however, at the
end of this 2 year period, the holder of the concession may apply for an extension of 2 additional
years if he resigns at least 50% of the total surface of the original concession. The holder of the
concession  must  pay  a  yearly  mining  property  payment  every  March.    If  this  obligation  is  not
fulfilled  properly,  the  holder  may  still  restore  it  to  good  standing  by  paying  twice  the  annual
property payment before the concession is taken to auction.  After that, the concession could be
bought by a third party or declared terminated by the relevant court.
N e w Pedimentos  are  allowed  to  overlap  with  pre-existing  ones;  however,  the  underlying
(previously staked) claim or granted exploration concession have a preference right over the new
claims  or  granted  exploration  concessions.    If  a  third  party  wants  to  measure  or  survey
(“Mensurar”) over the area, the holder of the underlying claim or granted exploration concession
must object to the new claim in the relevant time period, otherwise he will lose his preference
right to obtain an exploitation concession over the area where eventually the court may grant the
third party an exploitation concession.
Manifestación:
A  Manifestación  is  an  initial  exploitation  claim  whose  position  is  well  defined  by  UTM
coordinates  defining  north-south  and  east-west  boundaries.    The  minimum  size  of  a
Manifestación is 1 ha, and the maximum size is 10 ha.  One Manifestación (claim) can contain
one or more pertenencias (exploitation applications) but the Manifestación cannot exceed in total
1.000 ha.
________________________________
1 According to the Constitution minerals are classify  into three groups: (i) Minerals which only the
State can take advantage of, such as lithium, oil and other minerals expressly set forth by the
Law; (ii) Minerals which are not considered as such by the Law, therefore, belong to the owner of
the surface/land, such as the superficial clays and others also stated by the Law; and (iii) The
remaining  minerals  which  are  not  included  in  the  previous  groups,  which  can  be  subject  to
exploration or exploitation concessions.

The duration of an exploitation concession is undefined as long as the holder pays the mining
property payments.  Furthermore, the holder must pay a yearly mining property payment every
March.  In case this obligation is not fulfilled properly, the holder could restore it to good standing
by paying twice the annual property payment before the concession is taken to auction.  After
that, the concession could be bought by a third party or declared terminated by the relevant court.
A Manifestación could be the result of exercising the preference right granted by an exploration
concession or it could be filed by any person who was not necessarily the previous holder of an
exploration concession.
Within 220 days of filing a Manifestación, the applicant must file a request for survey (”Solicitud
de Mensura”) before the relevant court, in which case the court will order its publication in the
Official Mining Bulletin.  Subsequently, third parties may oppose the survey (“Mensura”) within 30
days from the request for survey publication.
Mensura:
The time period to do the Mensura will depend on the filing of objections by third parties.  If no
objection has been filed, the survey can be made once the period of time to file objections has
expired and within 15 months from the application of the Manifestación.  If an objection has been
filed, the survey can only be executed once the opposition trial had ended by a final resolution of
the relevant court.  In this last event, even though the term of 15 months mentioned before does
not  apply,  the  procedure  must  not  be  suspended  for  more  than  three  months.    Otherwise,  the
court will declare the expiration of the procedure.  Once surveyed and the Survey Certificate and
map presented to the court and reviewed by the National Mining Service (“SERNAGEOMIN”),
the application is granted by the court as a permanent property right (“Pertenencia”),  which  is
equivalent to a “patented claim” or exploitation right.
Claim Processes:
At each of the stages of the claim-acquisition process, several steps are required (application
filing,  publication  and  registration,  fees  payments,  proportionate  property  payment  and  survey
application) before court grants a mining concession in favor of the applicant.  A full description of
this process is documented in Chile’s Mining Code.
Many of the steps involved in granting the claim are published in Chile’s Official Mining Bulletin
for the relevant region (published weekly).  At the Mensura stage if third party oppositions are
filed, a process for resolution of conflicting claims is allowed.  Most companies in Chile retain a
mining claim specialist to review the weekly mining bulletins and ensure that their land position
is kept secure.
Fees:
There are two types of mining payments.  The first type, the holder of a mining concession has to
pay a yearly license fee equivalent to a fiftieth % of the Monthly Tax Unit (UTM) per hectare in the
case of exploration concessions, and the equivalent to a tenth % of a UTM per hectare in the
case of exploitation concessions.  The payment must be made in the month of March of each

year.  Failure to pay the annual property payment may result in the loss of the mining concession
title. Nevertheless, the holder could pay after the expiration of the legal term but charged with the
double amount and before the auction.
The second type of mining payment refers to a proceeding fee that the holder of the claim must
pay before the application for the granting judgement, in the case of an exploration concession,
or before the survey application, in case of exploitation concessions.  This fee is equivalent to
half, two, three or four hundredths of a UTM depending on if the Pedimento has less than 300 ha,
less than 1.500 ha, less than 3.000 or more than 3,000 ha, respectively, and the equivalent to
one, two, four, or five hundredth of a UTM depending on if the Manifestación has less than 100
ha, less than 300, less than 600, or more than 600 ha, respectively.
The owner of an exploration or an exploitation concession is not obligated to do mining works or
expend  work  or  money  on  such  activities.    The  only  obligation  of  the  owner  has  to  retain  the
concession is to pay the annual license fee.
4.5.2
Surface Rights
Concession owners are not required to have surface rights over the underlying land; however,
they do have the right to explore or mine the concession.  Articles 120 to 125 of the Chilean
Mining Code refer to mining easements.  Mining laws recognize the necessity of easements for
exploring and mining a project, and, therefore, the law seeks to facilitate their constitution.  In
case there is no agreement with the owner of the surface rights, the law establishes a summary
procedure  through  the  Courts  for  obtaining  easements  and  determine  the  amount  of  the
compensation to be paid to the owner of surface rights.  Easements must be established for the
particular purpose of benefit to the concession.  Therefore, easements are essentially temporary
and will expire with the concession or be restricted or extended according to the activities for
which the easements were granted.
4.5.3
Rights of Way
The Mining Code also grants the holder of a mining concession general rights to establish rights
of way, subject to payment of reasonable compensation to the owner of the surface land.  Rights
of way are granted through a private agreement or court decision, which indemnifies the owner of
the surface land or any person that might be affected by the easement.  A right of way must be
established for a particular purpose and will expire after cessation of activities for which the right
of way was granted.  The owners of mining easements are also obliged to allow owners of other
mining properties the benefit of rights of way, as long as this does not affect their own exploitation
activities and for the appropriate compensation.
4.5.4
Water Rights
Pursuant  to  the  Water  Code  the  use  of  continental  waters  -whether  from  superficial  or
underground sources- is subject to the prior application for a water rights concession (derecho de
aprovechamiento  de  aguas),  granted  by  the  General  Waters  Bureau  (Dirección  General  de
Aguas). This conditioning obeys to the nature of the waters as a “national good for public use”-
jointly with the need for a rational first allocation of the available sources.  The administrative
procedure  before  the  General  Waters  Bureau  includes  publications  in  the  official  gazette,
technical reports and, eventually, the settlement of the opposition from third parties, to finally end
with a resolution granting or rejecting –totally or partially - the applied water rights. It´s relevant to
mention that only three requirements are necessary for the concession of water rights: (1) that no
legal impediments exist; (2) that technical evidence exists that there are

sufficient water resources at the natural source; and (3) that there is no overlapping with existing
concessionaires.
According  to  the  characteristics  of  the  water  rights,  they  may  be  consumptive  or  non
consumptive,  permanently  or  eventually  exercisable,  and  continuously,  discontinuously  or
alternately exercisable. Moreover, water rights are freely transferable to third parties.
Additionally, articles 110 and 111 of the Chilean Mining Code establishes that the owner of a
mining concession is entitled, by the sole operation of the law, to use waters found in the works
within the limits of a mining concession, to the extent said waters are required for exploration,
exploitation and processing works that may are needed pursuant to the type of concession in
use.  The main characteristics of such water rights are the following: (i) they can only be used for
mining purposes; (ii) they cannot be sold; and (iii) they are temporary, as they are inseparable
from mining concession.
4.5.5
Safety Considerations
The Supreme Decree No 132, issued on 2002 by the Mining Ministry (Mine Safety Regulation),
establishes  the  main  safety  regulatory  framework  applicable  to  the  mining  industry.  Such
regulations are enforced by the SERNAGEOMIN, which develops authorization processes and
inspections over mining projects.
Pursuant to the Mine Safety Regulation, prior starting or restarting operations, mining companies
must submit for SERNAGEOMIN´s approval an exploitation plan or its modification, along with a
closure plan as describe below.
Moreover  the  Mine  Safety  Regulation  establishes  several  rules  for  the  mining  companies,
applicable  mainly  to  operational  procedures,  machinery,  ventilation  conditions,  workers  safety
equipment, works procedures, risk prevention, among others, which every mine site must fulfill
considering its nature (open or underground mine).
The  infringements  to  the  above  regulations  could  be  sanctioned  by  the  SERNAGEOMIN  with
fines up to 50 UTM. Additionally, in case of persistence or serious infringements the mine site
could be temporary or definitively close.
4.5.6
Mine Closure
Law No 20.551, for Mine Closure, issued on 2011, established the legal framework applicable to
closure of mining operations, as part of the life cycle of a mining project. The SERNAGEOMIN is
entrusted with the approval and enforcement of the closure plans.
Per the Mine Closure Law, prior starting operations, the owner of a mining project must submit a
closure  plan  before  the  SERNAGEOMIN.  The  approval  procedure  varies  upon  the  project
capacity: i) large operations with a capacity of more than 10,000 tonnes per month are required to
submit a detail closure plan and a financial guarantee to ensure full compliance; ii) operations
equal or less than 10,000 tonnes per month and exploration projects are subject to a simplified
authorization procedure and no guaranty is required.
The financial guarantee for large projects should comply with the following requirements:
v
The amount of the guarantee must cover the total value of the cost for the closure plan including
post-closure, and is determined by an estimate of the current costs of the plan.
v
The guarantee must be updated from time to time.

v
The guarantee must be paid in full within the first two-thirds of the estimated life of the project if
less than 20 years or within a period of 15 years if the estimated life of the project is more than 20
years.
v
The  granting  of  the  guarantee  must  begin  from  the  date  of  the  communication  made  to  the
SERNAGEOMIN of the start of operations. Within 30 days from the mentioned communication
and during the first year, the value of the guarantee must be equal to 20% of the total closure
costs. From the second year on, the payment must be proportional and pro rata to the period
which  remains  for  the  complete  amount.    The  guarantee  increases  until  the  total  value  of  the
closure costs is deposited.  The instruments of guarantee must be liquid and easy to execute.
The financial guarantee can be gradually released as the closure plan is executed.
v
Once the closure is complete and a certificate of final closure is issued by SERNAGEOMIN all
guarantees will be released.
v
The  sufficiency  of  the  guarantee  will  be  determinate  by  the  SERNAGEOMIN  along  with  the
Security  and  Insurance  Superintendence  in  accordance  with  the  nature  of  the  guaranties
proposed.
Mining companies that are obliged to provide a guarantee have a period of two years to estimate
the  cost  of  the  closure  plan.  The  closure  plan  must  be  approved  under  the  Mining  Safety
Regulations and the environmental impact assessment system, if applicable.

Taxation
4.6.1
Income Taxes
4.6.1.1
Taxation on Dividends
1.
General.
Regardless of the form of the entity through which a business may be conducted in Chile, such
business will be subject to the corporate tax (the “Corporate Tax”) which is assessed on the net
accrued taxable income of such business, currently at a flat rate of 22.5% (year 2015).  Likewise,
any  and  all  profit  distributions  by  a  Chilean  entity  to  non-residents  are  subject  to  a  35%
withholding tax (“WHT”) upon remittance abroad.
Depending on the type of taxation system ultimately chosen (which we explain below) and the
jurisdiction in which the foreign investor has residence, all or part of the Corporate Tax paid at the
local entity level may be credited against the WHT.

2.
Periods 2015 and 2016.
In accordance to the tax reform recently enacted (“Tax Reform”), in the periods 2015 and 2016
distributions to non-domiciled or non-resident shareholders or partners (other than non-taxable
income or capital reimbursement) are subject to WHT at a 35% rate regardless of the type of
Chilean entity distributing or remitting dividends or profits.2 A credit against such WHT for the
Corporate Tax paid by the Chilean entity is available.  The rate of the Corporate Tax for year
2016 is 24%.
Under this regime the WHT applies by the time the dividends or profits are remitted, distributed,
credited  to  the  account,  placed  at  the  disposal  or  paid  to  the  corresponding  shareholder  or
partner.
3.
Period 2017 and onwards.
As of January 1st, 2017, Chilean companies may opt between two tax systems: (i) an attributed
income system or (ii) a partially integrated system.
Please note that under the attributed income system and the partially integrated system the WHT
will  apply  regardless  of  the  existence  of  taxable  profits  and  regardless  of  the  type  of  Chilean
entity generating and remitting the respective dividends or profits.
i.
Attributed income system: under this system, companies will be subject to a Corporate Tax that
will  gradually  increase  to  25%  over  the  course  of  the  subsequent  three  years,  having
commenced in 2014 (increasing each year from 20 to 21%, 22.5% in 2015, 24% in 2016 and
25% in 2017).  At the shareholder or partner level, a 35% WHT will apply on an “attributed basis”
from year 2017.  As a result, any non-Chilean resident shareholder or partner will be required to
pay  a  35%  WHT  while  Chilean  resident  shareholders  will  be  required  to  pay  the  progressive
Impuesto Global Complementario (“Complementary Global Tax”), with rates ranging between
0% and 35%, regardless of whether the Chilean company makes a profit distribution or dividend
payment.  The Corporate Tax paid by such company will be creditable against the WHT and the
progressive Complementary Global Tax.  The actual income distribution to the shareholders or
partners will not be taxable.
Therefore, under this regime the overall tax burden on Chilean source income will be 35%, since
100% of the Corporate Tax paid will be available as credit.
ii.
Partially  integrated  system:  under  this  system,  shareholders  or  partners  will  be  taxed  by  the
profits actually distributed by a company.  In this case, for the year 2017, the Corporate Tax will
be 25.5%, and from year 2018 and onwards the Corporate Tax will be 27%.  When the income is
actually  withdrawn  from  a  company,  non-Chilean  resident  shareholders  or  partners  will  be
subject to a 35% WHT (while Chilean resident shareholders or partners will be required to pay
the progressive Complementary Global Tax, with rates ranging between 0% and 35%) against
which  65%  of  the  Corporate  Tax  already  paid  by  such  company  will  be  used  as  a  credit.
 However, shareholders or partners resident in a country
_________________________
2 Please note that in accordance to the provisions in force until December 31, 2014, distributions
to a non-resident partner (other than non-taxable income or capital reimbursement) made from
limited liability companies and branches were subject to WHT at a 35% rate, provided they do
not exceed the Corporate Tax taxable profits.  WHT on the excess was deferred up to the next tax
year when such taxable profits were available.  This is no longer available.

with  which  Chile  has  agreed  a  double  taxation  treaty  will  have  the  right  to  deduct  a  credit  of
100% of the Corporate Tax already paid on the relevant income.
Therefore,  under  this  system  from  year  2018  and  onwards  the  overall  tax  burden  on  Chilean
source income for foreign investors resident or domiciled in non-treaty countries will be increased
from 35% to 44.45% as the full Corporate Tax credit will be included in the taxable base of the
corresponding WHT, but only 65% of said Corporate Tax is actually creditable.3 Nevertheless,
regarding foreign investors resident or domiciled in countries with which Chile has a tax treaty in-
force, the overall tax burden will remain at 35% as these taxpayers are allowed to use as credit
100% of the Corporate Tax.
Although the applicability of a treaty executed under the OECD model does not reduce the WHT
rate  to  be  applied  in  Chile  on  dividends  or  profits  (35%),  this  situation  allows  the  foreign
shareholder or partner to have a total tax burden of 35%, even in the case the Chilean entity opts
to  the  partially  integrated  system  referred  to  above.    Therefore,  please  note  that  having  a
shareholder or partner domiciled in a country with which Chile has a tax treaty would compare
favorably against the alternative of investing through a jurisdiction with no OECD treaty.
Currently Chile has 25 treaties in force under the OECD model, with the following jurisdictions:
Australia,  Belgium,  Brazil,  Canada,  Colombia,  Croatia,  Denmark,  Ecuador,  France,  Ireland,
Korea,  Malaysia,  Mexico,  Norway,  New  Zeeland,  Paraguay,  Peru,  Poland,  Portugal,  Russia,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
4.6.1.2
Taxation on Capital gains
1.
General.
Generally, any gains obtained in the transfer of shares or equity rights will be taxable in Chile.
 Due to the changes introduced by the Tax Reform, which will be fully in force in year 2017, there
are special and provisory regimes for years 2015 and 2016.  As explained below, under certain
circumstances, double taxation treaties provide for reduced taxation on capital gains derived from
the transfer of shares or equity rights.
2.
Periods 2015 and 2016.
The taxable gain is the sales price less the acquisition value adjusted by inflation.  When the
owner of shares is a foreign investor that has registered its investment under DL 600, the tax
basis  corresponds  to  the  higher  between  purchase  price  adjusted  for  inflation  or  the  amount
originally brought in, converted into Chilean pesos at the date of the sale.
Generally,  the  gain  would  be  taxable  with  an  overall  tax  burden  of  35%,  composed  by  the
Corporate Tax at a rate of 22.5% (for year 2015) or 24% (for year 2016), plus the 35% WHT, but
with the Corporate Tax being a credit against the WHT.
Alternatively, the gain may be subject to the Corporate Tax as single tax treatment at a rate of
22.5%  (for  year  2015)  or  24%  (for  year  2016).    The  sale  will  be  eligible  for  this  regime  if  the
following three conditions are met: (i) the shares have been held for more than one year; (ii) the
seller is not habitual (i.e., it is not deemed to participate in the business of buying and selling
shares); and (iii) the sale is to an unrelated entity.
____________________________
3  For  year  2017  only,  the  overall  tax  burden  on  Chilean  source  income  for  foreign  investors
resident or domiciled in non-treaty countries will be increased from 35% to 43.925%.

There is a special tax regime allowing for exemption for the gain obtained on the sale of shares
of  publicly  traded  companies  with  trading  presence,  when  the  sale  has  been  performed  in  a
Chilean stock exchange or in another stock exchange authorized by the SVS (Chilean SEC) or
in a public offer process, and provided they were purchased in a stock exchange or in a public
offer  process  or  in  the  placement  of  shares  of  first  issue  due  to  an  incorporation  or  capital
increase, or as a result of the exchange of bonds convertible into shares.
3.
Period 2017 and onwards.
The tax basis is the same, this is, the sale price less the acquisition value adjusted by inflation.
 However, taxpayers subject to the attributed income system which provides for a full integration
(explained above) are entitled to deduct from the gain the portion of undistributed direct income
(i.e.  income  that  has  been  previously  attributed  to  shareholders  and  taxed)  corresponding
proportionally to the shares sold.
The Tax Reform eliminates the possibility of having the capital gains realized either by residents
or non-resident taxpayers on the disposition of shares or equity rights qualify for a sole capital-
gain tax at the rate of the Corporate Tax.
Under the new rules, the capital gain realized by non-resident will be subject to WHT at a rate of
35% on net gain in all cases.  However, there are two possible scenarios, which at the end result
in the same tax burden of 35%, having the only difference of the moment in which the taxes have
to be paid and declared.  These scenarios are: (a) in case the sale of shares or equity rights is
made  within  one  year  of  its  acquisition,  the  capital  gain  will  be  subject  to  Corporate  Tax  and
WTH, on a cash or accrual basis; and (b) if the sale of shares or equity rights is made after 1 year
of its acquisition, the capital gain will be subject to WHT with a rate of 35% as single tax on a
cash or accrual basis. The difference is that under scenario (a) the Corporate Tax is paid in the
month following the sale, and the shortfall between the Corporate Tax paid and the WHT, will
have to be paid in April of the year following the sale.  In scenario (b) the WHT as single tax, has
to be paid in April of the year following the sale.
It  should  be  noted  that  the  applicability  of  several  treaties  executed  under  the  OECD  model
reduces  the  WHT  rate  to  be  applied  in  Chile  on  capital  gains.    Under  certain  circumstances
described in detail in each of the treaties, Spain, United Kingdom, France, Australia, Belgium,
Ireland, Portugal and Sweden limits the WHT at 16%; Colombia and Switzerland limits the WHT
at 17%, and Korea and Croatia limits the WHT at 20%.
4.6.1.3
Investments under Decree Law 600 (“DL 600”)
As an alternative, until 31 December 31st 2015, an investment contract can be signed between a
foreign investor and the government, allowing the investor to choose a tax rate that is effectively
fixed at 42% for a period of 10 years.  This period can be extended up to 20 years if the Foreign
Investment Committee grants to the foreign investor the rights contained in Article 11 bis of DL
600.  The investor can choose to return to the normal tax regime only once.
Foreign investors and their local companies are subject to the generally applicable indirect taxes
(value-added  taxes)  and  import  duties.    However,  investors  may  request  that  their  foreign
investment contracts include a clause providing that, for the term they are authorized to make the
investment,  the  rates  of  both  the  value-added  taxes  and  import  duties  applicable  to  the
importation  of  machinery  and  equipment  not  produced  in  Chile  will  be  kept  invariable,  to  the
extent that these goods are included in a list prepared for this purpose by the Ministry of

Economy, i.e., “grandfathered.” In such cases, the invariability will also apply to the companies
receiving the foreign investment.
In addition, investments on capital assets made by foreign investors under DL 600 that meet all
the  requirements  listed  above  will  be  exempt  from  the  value-added  tax  applied  on  imported
goods.
It should be noted that DL 600 provides for further tax benefits depending on the amount of the
respective investment project:
1.
Special tax regime for projects exceeding USD$50 million (Article 11 bis of DL 600): Under this
regime, for investments of more than USD$50 million, the purpose of which is the development of
industrial or extractive projects, including mining schemes, the following terms and rights may
apply, if included in the foreign investment agreement: (a) the 10 year period referred to may be
extended  to  20  years;  (b)  investors  may  effectively  freeze  all  tax  legal  provisions,  as  well  as
interpretative  resolutions  of  the  Chilean  Internal  Revenue  Service  in  force  at  the  date  of
execution of the contract, which relate to asset depreciation regimes, carrying forward of losses
and  start-up  and  organizational  expenses;  (c)  investors  may  carry  their  accounting  records  in
foreign currency; and (d) other benefits to be applied on projects involving the export of goods.
In order to authorize this special regime, the Foreign Investment Committee must have previously
received  a  favourable  report  issued  by  the  Council  of  the  Central  Bank,  which  sets  out  the
operational  guidelines  and  conditions  regarding  access  to  foreign  currency  markets  to  remit
capital and profits abroad.  Compliance with these guidelines and conditions is supervised by the
Central Bank.
2.
Special tax regime for mining projects exceeding USD$50 million (Article 11 ter of DL 600: In the
case  of  investments  of  at  least  USD$50  million,  the  purpose  of  which  is  the  development  of
mining projects, the following terms and rights may apply for a term of 15 years, starting from the
commencement  of  operations  of  the  company,  provided  that  they  are  included  in  the  foreign
investment agreement: (a) investors can stipulate that the legal provisions regarding the specific
tax on mining activities referred to in Articles 64 bis and 64 ter of the Income Tax Law applying at
the time the foreign investment contract is signed, are invariable; (b) investors will not be affected
by new taxes, including royalties or similar tax burdens, applied specifically on mining activities
established  after  the  signature  of  a  foreign  investment  agreement;  (c)  investors  will  not  be
affected by amendments to the amount or method of calculation of the exploration or exploitation
mining licenses established in the Mining Code.
The rights established in Article 11 ter are not compatible with those granted by Article 11 bis and
the  invariable  tax  regime  for  income  tax  indicated  above,  except  for  the  right  to  maintain
accounting in foreign currency.
4.6.1.4
Customs Duties
Generally a flat rate of 6% is applicable on the cost, insurance and freight (C.I.F.) value for goods
imported to Chile.  Goods which are considered as an original product from countries with which
Chile has special free trade agreements are subject to lower import taxes or may be tax exempt.
4.6.1.5
Value Added Tax
A  19%  Value  Added  Tax  ("VAT")  applies  to  sales  and  other  transactions  involving  tangible
personal property, payments for certain services and certain real estate transactions.

Page 22
VAT applies to the sales of all movable physical assets sold by a person who is a customary
seller, and to certain services rendered by business entities, as opposed to professionals.
The  tax  basis  for  VAT  purposes  is  the  price  of  the  goods  or  services,  including  monetary
correction, interests, finance charges and penalty interest.
All persons and entities that engage in activities related to goods or services subject to VAT must
register with the tax authorities, and must issue stamped and registered receipts or invoices for
every transaction.
The VAT liability is determined on a monthly basis, and is calculated over the amount of VAT
charged by the taxpayer on all sales made and services rendered (VAT debit), minus a credit for
VAT paid by the taxpayer on acquisitions and services received during the same period (VAT
credit).
The VAT credit must be evidenced with the appropriate and duly stamped invoices issued by the
suppliers of goods and services.  If the credit during a given month is greater than the tax due, the
difference  can  be  carried  forward  and  credited  against  future  payments,  after  being  adjusted
according to the Chilean inflation. Declaration and payment of VAT is made on a monthly basis
with special forms provided by the Treasury Service.
DL 600 establishes that foreign investments in tangible assets shall be subject to the general tax
regulations  and  valued  added  tax.    However,  foreign  investors  may  freeze  the  VAT  (19%  at
present) as well as the taxes for imported capital equipment at the prevailing rates as of the date
of investment.  This special regime applies throughout the period authorized for the investment.
 Some capital goods (such as machinery or equipment) are exempt from VAT when these are not
produced in Chile and are considered to be in the interests of the country.  These capital goods
are published in a list issued by the Ministry of Economy.
4.6.1.6
Mining Taxation and Royalties
The Chilean Law establishes a royalty for mining companies, which has a progressive rate and
is  calculated  based  on  two  concepts  defined  by  law:  (a)  the  “Mining  Operational  Taxable
Income”, which is the net income that is calculated by the taxpayer deducing from the total mining
revenues, the cost and expenses, and making the adjustments indicated in the Income Tax Law
for the application of the Corporate Tax; and (b) the “Mining Operational Profit Margin” this is the
Mining  Operational  Taxable  Income  divided  by  the  mining  operational  revenue,  multiplied  by
100.
Mining  companies  whose  annual  sales  exceeds  the  value  of  50,000  tons  of  fine  copper  are
subject to a progressive tax rate on their Mining Operational Taxable Income that ranges from 5%
to 34.5%, depending on the respective Mining Operational Profit Margin.  In this respect, mines
with operating margins at a 35 index or below are subject to a 5% rate.  In the case of mines with
a Mining Operational Profit Margin of higher than an 85 index, a 14% rate would apply over the
part  that  exceeds  the  85  index.    Since  it  is  a  progressive  rate,  each  level  of  the  Mining
Operational  Profit  Margin  index  is  taxed  with  a  different  rate.    The  Law  provides  rates  of  8%,
10.5%, 13%, 15.5%, 18%, 21%, 24%, 27.5%, 31% and 34.5%, which varies depending on the
Mining Operational Profit Margin index.

Mining companies whose annual sales have a value between 12,000 tons and 50,000 tons of
fine  copper  are  subject  to  a  progressive  tax  on  their  “operational  taxable  income”  that  ranges
between  0.5%  and  4.5%.    Mining  companies  whose  annual  sales  are  equivalent  to  less  than
12,000 tons of fine copper are not subject to this specific mining tax.

Highlights of the Environmental Regulatory Framework
The  Chilean  Constitution  grants  all  citizens  the  right  to  live  in  a  pollution-free  environment.  It
adds that the State is duty bound to assure that such right will not be impaired and to provide for
the conservation of nature. It further provides that the law may specifically limit other legal rights
in order to protect the environment.
The General Environmental Law (Law No. 19,300), enacted in 1994, set forth the framework and
principles for a more integrated approach towards environmental protection and management.
Therefore,  the  General  Environmental  Law  created  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment
System  (“SEIA”),  emission  and  quality  standards  and  prevention  and  decontamination  plans.
Also introduced a civil liability system, based in negligence or fault, for environmental damage.
Strict liability systems, contained in special laws, remains in force.
The General Environmental Law was substantially amended in January 2010 pursuant to Law
No.  20,417.  The  revisions  provided  for  the  establishment  of  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Environment
(Ministerio  del  Medio  Ambiente),  responsible  for  developing  environmental  policies  and
regulations,  (ii)  the  Environmental  Assessment  Service  (Servicio  de  Evaluación  Ambiental  or
“SEA”),  responsible  for  administrating  the  SEIA,  and  (iii)  the  Environmental  Superintendence,
entrusted  with  conducting  environmental  compliance  and  enforcement  of  projects  approved
under the SEIA, emission and quality standards, prevention and decontamination plans and any
other environmental instruments established by law.
Lately, on June 28, 2012, Congress enacted Law No. 20,600, providing for the creation of three
environmental  courts,  subject  to  the  Supreme  Court’s  supervision,  in  charge  of  hearing  and
deciding on environmental disputes.
v
The SEIA
The SEIA, regulated by Law 19,300 and the SEIA Regulations (Supreme Decree No 40/2013), is
aimed  at  ensuring  the  environmental  sustainability  of  projects  and  activities  performed  by  the
public and private sectors.
The Environmental Assessment Service is responsible for implementing and administrating the
SEIA,  and  coordinating  the  project´s  assessment  with  the  other  Chilean  public  environmental
institutions.    Only  listed  investment  projects  or  activities  must  be  submitted  an  Environmental
Impact Statement (Declaración de Impacto Ambiental or “DIA”) for assessment. If the project´s
impacts are significant, an Environmental Impact Study (Estudio de Impacto Ambiental or “EIA”)
is  required.    The  final  approval  of  the  DIA  or  EIA,  as  applicable,  is  granted  by  the  Regional
Environmental  Assessment  Commissions  or  the  National  Director  of  the  Environmental
Assessment Service, if the project affects more than one Region of Chile.
Pursuant to Law 19,300 and the SEIA Regulations mining exploitation projects with a capacity of
more  than  5,000  ton/month  must  be  submitted  to  the  SEIA.  In  the  case  of  pre-exploitation
activities, only advance exploration works (prospections), which consider more than 40 platforms
with their relevant drilling holes must be submitted to the SEIA. Exploration activities,

such as discovery works, surveys and drilling works that consider less platforms are not required
for an environmental assessment.
The  SEIA  process  begins  with  the  DIA  or  EIA  submittal  to  the  SEA  of  the  Region  where  the
works included in the project or activity will be carried out or the National Director, if affects more
than one Region.  After an admissibility test, the SEA delivers the DIA or EIA to the sectorial
environmental  authorities,  which  must  review  and  revert  with  comments  and  clarifications,  if
applicable.  The SEA will consolidate the requests and send them back to the project holder,
who must reply by means of one or two addenda to the DIA or EIA. The EIA´s assessment has a
mandatory process of public participation.  Also, projects assessed through a DIA that generate
environmental burdens, such as landfills or sewage treatment plants, could be subject to a public
participation process. After public participation and the assessment by the sectorial authorities is
completed,  the  SEA  must  elaborate  a  consolidated  report  (ICE)  containing  the  project´s
description,  identified  impacts  and  it´s  mitigation,  compensation  and  compensatory  measures.
  Finally  the  Regional  Environmental  Assessment  Commission  or  the  National  Director,  as
applicable, must render a resolution approving (Resolución de Calificación Ambiental or “RCA”)
or rejecting the project or activity.
The project owner is entitled to file a complaint, in case the final decision rejects the DIA or EIA
or imposes conditions or additional requirements. Also, individuals and legal entities that took
part in the public participation are entitled to contest the environmental approval. The complaint
must be filed before the National Director in case of a DIA and before a committee of Ministers
(Comité de Ministros) in case of an EIA. The rulings of the National Director or the committee of
Ministers may be challenged before the corresponding Environmental Courts.
Another remedy granted by the Constitution, is the “Recurso de Protección”, in which the affected
party can file it before the Court of Appeals with jurisdiction over the competent environmental
authority, which is empowered to rule on the adoption of the measures it deems necessary to
reestablish the law and ensure the protection of the affected party. Usually, if the Court finds that
there  was  an  illegal  or  arbitrary  environmental  approval,  it  can  invalidate  such  resolution  and
order  that  a  new  environmental  impact  assessment  be  carried  out.  Nevertheless  with  the
environmental courts in place it is expected that the admissibility of this constitutional remedy
shall be limited to exceptional circumstances.
4.7.1
Sectorial Environmental Permits
The RCA authorizes to start the project´s construction and operation stages, subject to different
environmental  requirements.    Additionally  some  sectorial  environmental  permits  (“PAS”)  and
other sectorial permits are required to develop the project.
The  Environmental  Law  Regulations  establish  the  requirements  of  environmental  nature  that
must  be  incorporated  to  the  DIA  or  EIA  in  order  to  obtain  the  corresponding  PAS  during  the
environmental assessment.
If  the  RCA  approves  the  issuance  of  a  sectorial  environmental  permit  during  the  assessment
process  it  means  that  such  PAS  was  granted  only  from  an  environmental  perspective.
  Accordingly,  the  project  owner  shall  still  require  the  granting  of  the  PAS  before  the  relevant
sectorial authorities.  Nevertheless, such authorities shall not be allowed to deny the PAS based
on environmental issues, but could make requirements or observations of different nature (non-
environmental).

4.7.2
Indigenous Consultations
Chile ratified Convention No 169, concerning Indigenous and Tribal People on 2008.  For the
implementation of the Convention, was enacted Decree No 66, issued on March 4, 2014 by the
Ministry  of  Social  Development,  which  regulates  the  procedure  for  consultations  regarding
legislative and administrative decisions that may affect indigenous people.
Moreover, according to the SEIA, indigenous consultations are only required for projects that are
assessed  through  and  EIA,  as  they  may  produce  significant  impact  over  indigenous
communities.
4.7.3
Land Use
Chile’s  zoning  and  urban  planning  are  governed  by  the  General  Law  of  Urban  Planning  and
Construction  (Ley  General  de  Urbanismo  y  Construcciones).    This  law  contains  several
administrative provisions that are applicable to different geographical and hierarchical levels and
sets specific standards for both urban and inter-urban areas.
In addition to complying with the Environmental Law and other legal environmental requirements,
projects must also comply with urban legislation governing the different types of land use.  Land
use regulations are considered part of the Chilean environmental legal framework.
Land  use  regulatory  requirements  are  diverse  and  operate  at  different  levels,  the  main
instruments are the inter-community regulatory plans (Planes Reguladores Intercomunales, PRI)
and  the  community  regulatory  plans  (Planes  Reguladores  Comunales,  PRC).    The  PRI’s
regulate territories of more than one municipality, including urban and rural territory.
4.8
Foreign Investment
Under Chilean law there are no limitations to foreign investors who want to wholly own a Chilean
company.  Foreign companies and individuals can invest in all productive activities and sectors
of  the  economy.    There  are,  however,  restrictions  in  certain  areas,  such  as  coastal  trade,  the
mass media, fishing, and real estate property in border zones.
Certain economic activities considered relevant to national security are restricted to the State,
such as the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits in coastal waters under national
jurisdiction or in areas classified as important to national security, and the production of nuclear
energy. However, in certain circumstances foreign companies can invest in these areas.
Potential foreign investors have two legal mechanisms for bringing their capital into Chile.  These
are  alternative  and  parallel  mechanisms  which,  in  both  cases,  serve  to  register  the  entry  of
foreign capital.  Foreign investors can freely choose one of these alternatives when materializing
an investment: (i) Chapter XIV of the Chilean Central Bank’s Compendium of Foreign Exchange
Regulations; or (ii) Foreign Investment Statute established in DL 600.
Chapter XIV of the Chilean Central Bank:  Under this administrative system, the entry of foreign
capital  is  registered  by  commercial  banks  which,  in  turn,  coordinate  with  the  Central  Bank  of
Chile,  as  provided  by  Chapter  14  of  the  Central  Bank  Foreign  Exchange  Regulations  (the
“Foreign Exchange Regulations”).  A minimum of USD$10,000 can be brought in through this
mechanism in the form of currency or loans.  This mechanism does not imply signing a contract
with the State of Chile, nor limit or restrict the repatriation of capital invested in Chile or

of the profits obtained from the investment. Capital entering Chile under Chapter XIV is subject to
the general Chilean regulations and cannot apply to be subject to the provisions of DL 600.
Foreign  Exchange  Regulations  impose  two  basic  restrictions  on  foreign  loans,  deposits,
investments and capital contributions:
- They must be made through the Formal Exchange Market; and
- The parties must inform the Central Bank by filing in the appropriate registration forms.
Foreign  Investment  Statute  or  Decree  Law  600  (DL  600):    DL  600  applies  to  investments
made  in  Chile  by  foreign  individuals  and  foreign  public  and  private  legal  entities  (including
companies, foundations, foreign states and international organizations), as well as by Chilean
individuals  domiciled  abroad.    Under  DL  600  foreign  investors  enter  into  a  legally-binding
contract  with  the  Chilean  State,  which  cannot  be  modified  unilaterally  by  the  State.  However,
investors may request the amendment of the contract to increase the amount of the investment,
change its purpose, or assign its rights to another foreign investor.
Under DL 600, a “foreign investment” can be made in the form of:
-  Freely  convertible  foreign  currency  brought  into  the  country  through  an  entity  authorized  to
operate within the Formal Foreign Exchange Market (Mercado Cambiario Formal);
- Tangible assets, in any form, which are valued according to the general procedures applying to
imports;
- Technology in its various forms, provided it can be capitalized and provided certain conditions
regarding its valuation are met. Ownership or rights to the use of technology forming part of a
foreign  investment  under  DL  600  cannot  be  sold  separately  from  the  entity  to  which  it  was
contributed, nor can the technology be subject to amortization or depreciation;
- Loans associated with foreign investments that are authorized by the Central Bank, including
the corresponding  terms, conditions and interest, as well as the charges on the total cost borne
by the borrower;
- Capitalization of loans and foreign debt in freely convertible currency that have been obtained
with due authorization; and/or
- Capitalization of profits, which can be remitted abroad.
To  have  access  to  this  mechanism,  the  minimum  investment  amount  is  USD$5  million  for
investments made in foreign currency and associated loans.  For investments in tangible assets,
technology, or capitalization of loans and foreign debt, the minimum amount is USD$2.5 million.
 The Foreign Investment Committee retains the right to modify these amounts.
In order to proceed under DL 600, the foreign investor’s investment must be authorised by the
Foreign  Investment  Committee,  a  governmental  agency.    To  obtain  this  approval,  the  foreign
investor  must  submit  an  application  which  includes  basic  information  about  the  investing
company or individual, a description of the project to be undertaken in Chile, the amount and
composition of the investment, and other details.

Upon receiving approval from the Committee, the foreign investor enters into a foreign investment
contract with the Chilean State, by public deed, before a Notary Public in Chile.  Although not a
lengthy or complicated document, the standard term foreign investment contract establishes the
respective  rights  and  obligations  of  the  parties  under  DL  600,  particularly  the  guarantees
provided to the investor.
In the case of investments in foreign currency, an investor can only execute a foreign exchange
operation once a foreign investment contract has been signed with the Chilean State.  However,
when submitting the application, the investor can request special authorization to exchange its
currency  immediately.    Any  other  type  of  capital  contribution  requires  the  foreign  investment
contract to be duly signed.
The foreign investment contract shall specify the period during which the foreign investor may
bring  its  investment  into  Chile.    This  period  shall  not  exceed  8  years  in  the  case  of  mining
investments and 3 years in all other areas.  However, the Foreign Investment Committee may
extend these limits to a maximum of 12 years, in case of mining investments that require previous
exploration,  and  up  to  8  years,  in  case  of  investments  in  industrial  and  non-mining  extractive
projects for amounts of no less than USD$50 million, considering the nature of the project.
As  a  matter  of  policy,  from  time  to  time  the  Foreign  Investment  Committee  sets  limitations
regarding the funding of the projects it approves.  Currently, the Committee requires a 75:25 debt
to  equity  ratio.    This  means  that  equity  must  constitute  at  least  25%  of  the  approved  total
investment amount of each project and the remaining 75% may be raised by the company in the
form of international debt finance ( “associated credit”) or domestic debt finance ( “internal credit”).
Article  11  of  DL  600  authorizes  the  Foreign  Investment  Committee  to  impose  restrictions  on
access to local financing or internal credit.  Currently there are no such restrictions.
DL 600 provides the following rights to foreign investors:
v
Discrimination complaint mechanisms
DL  600  prohibits  discriminatory  treatment  of  foreign  investors,  guaranteeing  that  they  will  be
subject  to  the  same  laws  and  regulations  as  local  investors  in  the  same  area,  except  where
regulations limit access to internal loans for foreign investments under DL 600.  This prohibition
parallels the general prohibition on discrimination contained in the Chilean Constitution.  In the
event a foreign investor believes it is being discriminated  against, under DL 600 it can pursue a
claim with either the Foreign Investment Committee, through an administrative procedure, or if
the Committee is unable to resolve the claim, with the Chilean courts.
v
Repatriation of capital and profits
DL 600 guarantees the foreign investor the right to remit equity capital overseas after a period of
one  year  from  its  entry  into  Chile,  but  only  from  profits  or  from  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  or
liquidation  of  all  or  part  of  the  assets,  business,  shares  or  rights  representing  the  investment.
 Reinvested profits are not subject to this one year restriction, and may be repatriated at any time.
No tax or other levy applies to such remittances up to the amount of the materialised investment.

DL  600  guarantees  foreign  investors  access  to  the  Formal  Foreign  Exchange  Market,  for  the
repatriation  of  the  capital  investment  and/or  profits.    Access  to  the  Formal  Foreign  Exchange
Market for remitting capital or profits abroad requires a prior certificate from the Executive Vice-
President of the Foreign Investment Committee stating the amount to be remitted.  This certificate
is granted or refused for an express cause within 10 days from the date an application is filed.
v
Tax regime
Under a foreign investment contract, foreign investors may have access to certain tax benefits
(please see tax section above).
Termination of DL 600 regime and new mechanism applicable to foreign investments over
USD $5,000,000.
The possibility for a foreign investor to have access to the DL 600 foreign investment agreement
mechanism will be available until December 31, 2015, as provided by Law No. 20,780.
All foreign investment agreements executed before such date will be valid and enforceable, and
foreign  investors  will  keep  all  its  rights,  duties  and  special  regime  associated  with  DL  600
mechanism.
To replace DL 600 regime, a new law is under discussion in Chilean parliament.

5.1
Accessibility
The Property is located 140 km southeast of the City of Antofagasta and access to the Property is
via Route CH-28 to Route CH-5, which is part of the Pan-American Highway and then east on
Route  B-55  which  passes  just  north  of  the  Augusta  Victoria  North  concession  group.    The
Property is readily accessible from a paved highway and hence on dirt roads across the desert to
access the individual prospects.  Total travel time from Antofagasta to the Property is about two
and a half hours.  The City of Antofagasta, the capital of Antofagasta Region and Province with a
population  of  345,420  (2012,  Wikipedia),  can  be  accessed  via  numerous  daily  flights  from
Santiago  and  other  centres  in  the  north  of  the  country  and  from  Lima,  Peru.    Flight  time  from
Santiago  to  Antofagasta  is  2  hours.    The  Pan-American  Highway  connects  Antofagasta  with
Santiago, 1,100 kms to the south and the rest of Chile.
5.2
Climate
The climate in the area is typical of the Atacama Desert region between 1000 and 2000 metres
elevation.  The Atacama Desert is renowned for being the driest desert in the world.  Average
annual  rainfall  is  reported  as  1  to  3  mm  per  year  with  coastal  regions  receiving  an  annual
average  of  3.4  mm  (Antofagasta).    Some  weather  stations  in  the  Atacama  Desert  have  never
reported rainfall.
The average annual temperature is 16.8 C.  The average daily low temperature in the warmest
month,  January,  is  17.5°C  while  the  average  daily  high  temperature  is  23.2°.    The  coldest
month, July, sees an average low temperature of 11.8 C and an average high temperature of
16.5°C (Antofagasta,  Wikipedia).  The  climate  permits  exploration  and  development  activities
year round on the Property
Due to the warm and extremely arid climate, there is practically no natural vegetation or animal
life on the Property
5.3
Local Resources and Infrastructure
The population of the Antofagasta Region, where the concessions are located, is 530,879 (2012)
where 65% of this population lives in the capital of Antofagasta.  The city of Antofagasta, is the
regional  source  of  skilled  and  unskilled  labour,  mining  contractors  and  mining/exploration
suppliers  for  the  eight  large  operating  copper-molybdenum/gold  mines  nearby  and  the  nitrate
operations of SQM.  Food and basic supplies can be obtained in Antofagasta, the closest major
centre and a two-and-a-half-hour drive from the Property.
With  the  Pampa  Augusta  Victoria  deposit  of  Yamana  Gold’s  El  Peñon  mine  adjacent  to  the
Property, power is available in the area.  Ground water may be available in some areas of the
property but water for future mineral processing would most likely be seawater.  West of the town
of  Sierra  Gorda  (144  kms  north),  the  new  400  MW  thermo-solar  power  complex  is  under
construction, intended to provide power for future mine expansions in the area.  Surface rights
are not required for the future mining operations under Chilean law as concession holders have
the right to explore or exploit the concession.  Mining rights are dominant to surface rights and the
Mining Code grants the owner of the mineral estate liberal rights to use the surface subject to the
payment of reasonable compensation to the surface rights owner.  The area of the concessions is
sufficient for any future exploration and development activities.

HISTORY
The  early  mining  history  of  the  Antofagasta  region  and  the  Property  are  related  to  the  nitrate
industry of northern Chile as described in the following sections.
6.1
Caliche Exploitation in Northern Chile
The following text has been modified after Garcés, 2000.
The first shipment of caliche from Tarapacá went to the region of Concepcion, before 1800, in
order  to  provide  alkali  in  the  manufacture  of  soap.    Tadeus  Haenke,  a  Polish  scientist  who
entered Peru in 1794, contributed to Tarapaquenian industrial technology in 1808 when he gave
the formula known in Europe to convert the caliche of Tarapacá to potassium nitrate.  On July 21,
1830, Chile started exporting nitrate to major world markets as this is the date on which the first
vessel-carrying nitrate arrived in the port of Liverpool.  The industrialization stage began in 1853
with  the  incorporation  of  the  steam  engine  patented  by  Pedro  Gamboni,  starting  exports  of
sodium nitrate and causing the construction of new plants and diversifying other operations.  At
that time, all caliche was produced in Tarapacá, then part of Peru and now in the Chilean Region
1.
The process then, was to place the previously milled caliche in iron containers, and then adding
mother liquor, obtained in a previous cycle.  This was vigorously stirred and heated to boiling.
 The clays were then decanted to produce a sodium chloride precipitate.  The remaining liquor
was  placed  in  wooden  trays,  which  crystallized  sodium  nitrate  upon  cooling.    Based  on  this
process, several plants were built in San Antonio de Zapiga, east of Pisagua, located 127 road
kilometres northeast of Iquique.  The increased production between 1809 and 1812 of 1,140 tons
of nitrates were shipped to Lima for  the manufacture of explosives.  In 1810, nitrate mines were
built in Pampa Negra, Zapiga and Negreiros.
The nitrate process was used with minor modifications until 1880 when Chilean Pedro Gamboni
(CORFO, 1989), replaced the fuel used in the process with direct steam injection.  Twenty years
later the Englishman, James T. Humberstone introduced indirect steam injection and adopted the
countercurrent leaching process developed by Shanks, for the production of soda ash by the Le
Blanc process.  This "Shank" caliche process allowed using material with less than 15% nitrate,
compared with 50% used in the above processes, thus translating into expanded exploitation of
caliches that peaked with some 300 operations. Thus, the nitrate industry had become the main
economic activity of the country.
Following the application of additional taxes to the Chilean mining companies in the area, the
territory  was  occupied  by  Chile  in  February  1879  resulting  in  the  Pacific  War  involving  Chile,
Bolivia  and  Peru.    As  a  consequence  of  this  war,  the  Peruvian  Tarapacá  province  and  the
Bolivian Pacific territories became part of Chile (Simon et al., 2005).
The  export  of  nitrate  caused  a  large  influx  of  money  into  the  country  with  the  production  of  2
million tons in 1909.  In 1916, there were 97 nitrate operations in Iquique, 10 in Tocopilla, 30 in
Antofagasta, 14 in Aguas Blancas and 19 in Taltal, where the nitrate was known as ‘white gold’.
The development of synthetic nitrates in 1909 (Wikipedia) along with the economic recession of
the  30’s  severely  impacted  the  nitrate  industry  causing  a  drop  in  the  price  of  nitrate  and  the
Shanks process became uneconomical under these conditions.  This was followed by the

closing of operations and the beginning of the worst period experienced by the domestic industry.
 On May 16, 1944, with the closing of Santa Laura operation, a symbolic date for Chilean people
of  the  pampas,  only  four  nitrate  operations  were  kept  in  production  until  1978  when  Oficina
Victoria ceased operations.
Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile, SOQUIMICH (SQM) was created in 1968 as part of a plan
to reorganize the nitrate industry in Chile.  Initially, the ownership of the company was shared
between the state (CORFO) and a private entity (Cia. Salitrera Anglo Lautaro SA).  In 1971, the
company was taken over by the state, and in 1983, CORFO began privatizing the company until
1988.    Today  SQM  operates  a  thriving  industry  that  not  only  sells  natural  nitrates  but  has
developed  new  products.    SQM  offers  to  world  markets:  potassium  nitrate,  sodium  sulfate,
sodium nitrate, iodine and derivatives, potassium chloride, boric acid, lithium carbonate, and all
mixtures  of  specialty  fertilizers,  industrial,  technical  grade,  etc.    In  recent  years,  the  caliche-
related mining industry has expanded.  Modern processing plants have appeared in the desert,
often  very  close  the  ruins  of  the  old  oficinas.    Chile  became  the  first  iodine  and  lithium  world
supplier, as well as one of the major ulexite (hydrated sodium calcium borate hydroxide)  and
natural nitrate producers.
6.2
Property History
SQM held the Property for non-metallic minerals and possibly conducted preliminary exploration
for nitrates on the Property but no evidence was seen in the field for hand dug pits or short, grid
drilled, RC holes which are the common methods used by SQM to explore for nitrites.  The author
does not know the timing of this preliminary exploration.  The possible reason for limited nitrate
exploration on the Property appears to be related to the geomorphology not being ideal for the
formation of caliches.
In  2010  and  2011,  SQM  completed  an  exploration  program  on  the  Augusta  Victoria  West
concession group, focused on epithermal gold-silver vein systems similar to Yamana’s adjacent
Pampas Augusta Victoria deposit.
The author has been unable to verify this information about Pampa Augusta Victoria and that the
information may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.
The program included:
i)
Geologic mapping at a scale of 1:5,000, which covered an area of 25 km2, and traced thirteen
faults on the Property.  The mapping covered some 74% of the Property’s 34 km2.
ii)
Excavations of nineteen trenches, the trenches were reported oriented to crosscut the mapped,
north trending, geologic structures.  In total 2,857 metres of trenches were excavated.
iii)
Systematic one-metre sampling of the trenches produced 1,288 samples.
iv)
Surface geochemical sampling of geologic structures following quartz float and this produced 22
samples.
v)
Drilling of 26 RC holes for 1,710 m drilled. The drill holes were sampled on one-metre intervals
producing 963 samples. The holes were drilled to between 50 and 162 metres depth. The drill
holes showed anomalous values for arsenic and antimony. No significant results for gold or silver
were recorded from the drilling and this is possibly due to short drill hole depths (Vega E., 2012).

GEOLOGICAL SETTING and MINERALIZATION
The  Pampas  El  Peñon  Property  is  located  in  Region  II  of  northern  Chile,  140  kilometres
southeast of Antofagasta in the Province and Municipality (Commune) of Antofagasta.  This area
of  northern  Chile  and  the  rest  of  the  central  Andes  have  been  known  as  a  preeminent
metallogenic province for more than 100 years.  The central Andes currently produce some 40
percent of world-mined copper (2011), as well as significant gold production

The Cordillera Domeyko is bounded to the west by the Central Depression and to the east lies
the Preandean depression.
This region is part of the approximately 6,000-km-long Andean Copper province and comprises
several long and markedly linear, orogen-parallel metallogenic belts, each developed during a
restricted  metallogenic  epoch.    In  the  central  Andes,  from  southern  Peru  to  central  Chile  and
contiguous Argentina, an incipiently developed belt of late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic porphyry
copper  mineralization  is  partly  overlapped  by  four  east-ward-younging  copper  belts,  namely:
  middle  to  late  Mesozoic  (Middle-late  Jurassic  to  Early  Cretaceous)  on  the  Pacific  coast,
Paleocene to early Eocene, middle Eocene to early Oligocene, and, along the eastern border of
the  orogen,  Miocene  to  early  Pliocene,  all  but  the  first  dominated  by  porphyry  copper
mineralization and associated deposit types.  Porphyry copper deposits in the northern part of the
Paleocene to early Eocene belt, in southern Peru, and the southern part of the premier middle
Eocene  to  early  Oligocene  belt,  in  northern  Chile,  coincide  with  major  orogen-parallel  fault
systems that underwent syn-mineralization reverse displacement.  The middle to late Mesozoic
belt  also  contains  major  orogen-parallel  faults  but  with  normal  and  normal-oblique  motions
synchronous  with  copper  mineralization  of  iron  oxide-copper-gold,  manto-type  copper  (Manos
Blancos), and subordinate porphyry copper types.  In contrast, remaining portions of the Tertiary
Copper belts, along with the central Chile segment of the Miocene to early Pliocene belt, lack
evidence for such clear-cut structural control on deposit location (after Sillitoe et al., 2005)
The geology of the Cordillera Domeyko and the Central Depression are dominated by products
of Late Cretaceous to early Eocene magmatic arcs that developed to the east of the Jurassic to
Early Cretaceous magmatic arc following a Middle Cretaceous orogeny (Coira et al., 1982; Boric
et al., 1990; Davidson and Mpodozis, 1991).  These rocks are part of the Paleocene belt (Figure
7.2) which comprises basaltic to rhyolitic lavas and tuffs, subvolcanic porphyritic intrusions, and
granitoid stocks that extend from southern Peru to central Chile and range in age from 72 to 40
Ma (Boric et al., 1990; Marinovic et al., 1995; SERNAGEOMIN, 2003).
The  Paleocene  belt  between  latitudes  22°45’  and  25°15’S  is  characterised  by  abundant
exposures of felsic volcanic rocks and is host to several epithermal deposits, including El Peñón
and the recently discovered Pampa Augusta Victoria deposit, which lies just east of the Property
concession  boundary.  North  of  this  part  of  the  belt,  exposures  of  felsic  to  intermediate
subvolcanic  and  intrusive  rocks  are  associated  with  Paleocene  porphyry  Cu-Mo  deposits  at
Spence, Sierra Gorda, Cerro Colorado, and Mocha. To the south, the geology is characterised by
exposures  of  intermediate-composition  volcanic  rocks  between  latitudes  25°15’  and  26°30’S,
intermediate  and  felsic  volcanic  rocks  between  26°30’  and  27°30’S,  and  dominantly  felsic  to
intermediate subvolcanic and intrusive rocks south of 27°30’S. The distribution of volcanic and
intrusive rocks and occurrences of porphyry Cu deposits indicate uplift and erosion to relatively
deep levels north and south of that part of the Paleocene belt which hosts Yamana’s El Peñón
and other epithermal deposits (Sillitoe, 1991; SERNAGEOMIN, 2003).
The author has been unable to verify this information about Pampa Augusta Victoria and that the
information may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.
Bedrock exposure is generally poor and concealed by caliche made up of massive crystalline
salts and chusca, powdery low-solubility residual sulfates at the surface.  Basaltic to rhyolitic,
pyroclastic and flow units, subvolcanic rhyolites, and volcaniclastic breccias of Late Cretaceous
to early Eocene age and of inferred Early Cretaceous age are the main rock types in the district.

Inferred  Early  Cretaceous  rocks  consist  of  several,  distinct,  thin  rhyolitic  pyroclastic  units  and
dacitic  to  andesitic  flow  units  that  are  exposed  only  in  the  northern  part  of  the  district.    In  the
western part of the district, voluminous, rhyolitic pyroclastic rocks with minor dacitic to andesitic
flows of Late Cretaceous age overlie inferred Early Cretaceous rocks.  In this area, both the Early
and Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks are intruded by 67 ± 2 Ma dioritic to monzodioritic rocks and
locally by Late Cretaceous dacite domes.  Paleocene and early Eocene volcanic rocks host the
El Peñón Mine and Pampa Augusta Victoria deposit.
The author has been unable to verify this information about Pampa Augusta Victoria and that the
information may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.
This stratigraphy consists of a lower sequence of volcanic breccia and andesitic to basaltic flows
overlain  by  a  sequence  of  rhyolitic  to  dacitic  pyroclastic  rocks  (59.2  ±  1.6  Ma;  Cornejo  et  al.,
2003),  dacitic  to  andesitic  flows,  and  volcanic  breccia.    These  rocks  are  intruded  by,  and  the
upper parts intercalated with, rhyolitic flows and domes (54-55 Ma; Cornejo et al., 2003).  The
mostly flat-lying to gently east- and south-dipping volcanic rocks are intruded by minor andesitic
dikes of likely early Eocene age that appear to be coeval with Au-Ag mineralisation at El Peñón
mine (Robbins, 2000). Andesites south of the district have ages (50.5 ± 1.7 to 52.9 ± 1.8 Ma, K-
Ar; Cornejo et al., 2003) that partly overlap the age of Au-Ag vein formation at El Peñón (Pearson
and Rennie, 2008).
The Paleocene and early Eocene volcanic rocks  are  locally  intruded  by  48.2  ±  1.3  Ma  (K-Ar;
Rojas, 1994) diorite that is exposed in the eastern and southern parts of the district, locally in fault
contact with the Augusta Victoria Formation.  The dominant faults in the district controlled the
margins  of  a  graben  containing  Paleocene  and  early  Eocene  rocks.    On  the  west  side  of  the
district, Falla Dominador trends north-northeast and places Early and Late Cretaceous volcanic
rocks and Late Cretaceous intrusive rocks against Paleocene and Early Eocene volcanic rocks.
 North-trending faults with up to hundreds of meters of displacement define the eastern margin of
the  graben  and  place  Eocene  intrusions  against  Paleocene  and  Early  Eocene  rocks.
 Throughout the district, faults displaying both normal and, less commonly, reverse displacement
exhibit offsets of meters to tens of meters and trend north-south, northeast, or northwest.
Veins  and  dikes  indicate  the  orientation  of  dilational  structures  active  during  their  formation.
North-trending faults host the highest-grade Au-Ag-bearing veins, northeast trending faults host
veins with generally lower Au-Ag grades, and northwest-trending faults host mostly barren quartz
and  calcite  veins  (Robbins,  2000).    The  dominant  orientations  of  andesitic  dikes  are  north,
northwest to north-northwest, and east to east-northeast.
The  simplified  geology  map  of  the  Antofagasta  Region  (II)  is  shown  in  Figure  7.3

Local Geology
The  rocks  on  the  Augusta  Victoria  property  correspond  mainly  to  an  acid  volcanic  sequence
made up of dacites, rhyodacites and lesser rhyolite domes and dykes of the Augusta Victoria
Formation.    The  sequence  generally  has  a  shallow  dip  to  the  west,  to  the  west  of  the
concessions, and the composition tends to become slightly more mafic with andesite making up
about half the outcrops found on the Augusta Victoria West concession group.
Intrusive rocks correspond to rhyolite domes and dykes that are considered favorable targets to
host  mineralized  veins  as  found  on  Yamana  Gold’s  Pampa  Augusta  Victoria  mine  located
immediately east of the Property and at the main El Peñon  mine some thirty kilometres to the
south.    There  are  five  areas  with  rhyolite  domes  and  dykes  on  the  Augusta  Victoria  West
concession group and all of these areas contain anomalous trace element values similar those
reported on Yamana’s PAV property to the east.  The Augusta Victoria North concession group
has no bedrock outcrop and geologic mapping  was  completed  based  on  float.    Details  of  the
recent geochemical sampling program are reported in the exploration section of this report.
The author has been unable to verify this information about Pampa Augusta Victoria and that the
information may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.

DEPOSIT TYPES
Page 43
The  principal  deposit  type  on  the  Property  is  low  sulphidation  epithermal  gold-silver  deposits
hosted  in  steeply  dipping  fault  controlled  veins  (Pearson  and  Rennie,  2008)  and  potentially
intermediate epithermal systems as well.  Both deposit types are related to porphyry intrusive
magmatic activity along the “West Fissure” or Precordillera fault system (Ruetter ert el., 1993).
Porphyry copper systems commonly host skarn, carbonate replacement, sediment-hosted gold-
silver  and  high,  intermediate  and  low  sulphidation  epithermal  deposit  types  in  addition  to  the
porphyry  deposits  (Figure  8.1).    These  deposit  types  are  centred  on  plutons  that  form  at
convergent plate boundaries (Sillitoe, 2010).  Porphyry copper deposits are an important source
of copper supply and commonly rank among the largest copper deposits in the world.
The  intrusive  rocks  that  host  porphyry  copper  deposits  are  typically  intermediate  to  felsic  in
composition,  porphyritic  in  texture  and  are  often  associated  with  multiple  intrusive  events  that
form composite intrusion centres (Seedorff et al., 2005).  There is a typical alteration zoning that
exists  in  porphyry  copper  deposits  with  potassic  (K-feldspar-  biotite)  at  the  core  followed  by
sericitic  (muscovite/sericite  ±  chlorite)  and  clay  dominant  assemblages  with  distance  from  the
centre (Seedorff et al., 2005).  Much of the mineralization in porphyry deposits is contained within
veins that include veins with sulphides associated with potassic alteration and pyritic veins with
sericite halos (Seedorf, 2005).  Veins may also form stockworks, which are a common feature of
porphyry style mineralization.  In addition to copper, porphyry deposits commonly contain gold,
molybdenum, tungsten and tin.
Copper skarns are one sub-type of a diverse group of deposits formed dominantly through the
metasomatism of carbonate rocks.  The degree of metasomatism involved in skarn formation can
vary from negligible, in the case of metamorphism of carbonate to produce calc-silicate hornfels,
to complete, resulting in the formation of a metasomatic, coarse grained skarn (Meinert, 1993a).
 It is this high degree of metasomatism where the composition of the metasomatic fluid controls
the resulting skarn and ore mineralogy that often results in the most economic skarn deposits
(Meinert, 1993a).  Copper skarns are the  most  abundant  skarn  type,  and  include  some  of  the
world’s largest skarns (Einaudi et al., 1981; Meinert, 1993b).
Epithermal deposits form at shallower depths (<1.5km) and lower temperatures (<300oC)  than
porphyry deposits (Simmons et al., 2005).  Various classification schemes have been used for
epithermal  deposits  but  three  types  are  generally  recognized.    High  sulphidation  deposits  are
formed  from  acidic,  dominantly  magmatic  fluids  and  have  associated  alunite,  kaolinite,
pyrophyllite  and  residual  (vuggy)  quartz.    Low  sulphidation  deposits  are  associated  with  near
neutral,  primarily  meteoric 
(±illite-calcite)
assemblages.  Intermediate sulphidation deposits are associated with quartz-calcite with minor
chalcedony and adularia, manganese carbonate fluorite, gypsum/anhydrite.  Gold or silver may
be the dominant economic metal, although gold may be minor in some deposits.  Zinc and lead
are commonly about 1% and copper and minor tin may increase at depth (White, 2011).

EXPLORATION
9.1
Aster Alteration Image Mapping
The exploration program during 2013/2014 started with an initial phase of target selection using
satellite imagery (ASTER) to identify exposed alteration zones and main structural features and
trends.  The Pampas El Peñon area was analyzed but the image interpretations did not produce
any  priority  targets  on  the  Property  for  field  follow-up  with  prospecting  and  sampling.    The
Augusta  Victoria  concessions  do  not  have  surface  alteration  of  interest  for  field  follow-up
detectable by Aster and the possible reasons for the lack of Aster targets are that the potential
targets lie under cover or have only small outcrop expressions (less than the 25 m resolution of
ASTER images).
9.2
Geochemical Sampling
The  surface  field  program  started  in  December  of  2013  and  continued  intermittently  for  five
months.  The five rhyolite domes were systematically sampled with particular attention paid to the
fault contacts and any mineralized or alteration zones including sections of the SQM trenches.
 Following the sampling, a preliminary geological map was made of the area.  A total of 460 rock
chip or float samples were collected during the program of exploration and areas with potential
for epithermal gold-silver mineralization were identified as future drill targets.  Anomalous values
for  silver,  arsenic,  lead,  antimony  and  zinc  were  encountered  and  the  interpretation  of  these
results are discussed in the next section.  The results of the geochemical sampling are shown in
Figures 9.1 to 9.5.  The figures also show the proposed drill targets labelled from A to E.
Two different types of surface rock sampling have been used:
1.
Grab samples - chips/pieces of rock taken from outcrop, float or dumps;
2.
Panel samples - composite chip samples taken over an area of between 0.5x0.5m to 1x0.5m;
All rock samples are placed into plastic sample bags, labelled and securely closed with single
use ties as the samples are taken.
The sample quality is good and the samples appear to be representative with no biases known to
the author.  Sampling quality control is discussed in Section 11.

Exploration Results and Interpretation
There are five areas with rhyolite domes and dykes on the Augusta Victoria West concession
group.  All of these areas contain anomalous trace element values similar in range to that found
on Yamana Gold’s mine property to the east.  Arsenic, antimony and to some extent zinc show
anomalous  distributions  similar  to  that  found  on  the  Yamana  mine  property  (see  geochemical
distribution maps above).
The author has been unable to verify this information about Pampa Augusta Victoria and that the
information may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.
Target D also has a very strong manganese and goethite content within a hydrothermal breccia
(possibly a diatreme) which is a common component of the veins at the PAV mine (see Photo 2).
In  addition  to  the  geochemical  signatures,  the  selected  targets  have  the  favorable  geological
context consisting of alteration, geochemical anomaly and a structure cutting or in close contact
with the rhyolite/dacite-andesite sequence as described below:
·
Rhyolite dome (Target B): a prominent rhyolite dome is located just two kilometres southwest of
Yamana’s Pampa Augusta Victoria pit.  The rhyolite is greyish in color, slightly porphyritic, with
argillic alteration.  Two prominent north-south striking structures with anomalous arsenic values
intersect the dome.  A zone of highly siliceous chert is located on the west side of the dome (see
Photo 3) indicating possible proximity to the contact with the country rock although the contact is
not  seen.    Such  contact  zones  are  considered  highly  favorable  exploration  targets  at  the  El
Peñon mine (Arsenseau, V., personal comm.)
·
A zone of anomalous As-Sb in trenches and drill holes is located just over one km north of the
dome  above  (Target  A).    Short  exploration  drill  holes  in  this  area  cut  strong  iron  oxides  with
rhyolitic  sections  in  contact  with  dacite  and  quartz  veining.    Although  no  rhyolite  crops  out  at
surface, the area is considered favorable for locating mineralized veins at depth.
·
A contact between andesite/dacite and rhyolite (Target C) with anomalous As and strong iron
oxides in an SQM drill hole and a related structure was located during the re- mapping of the
property.  This target is interpreted as the northern continuation of the structure located on the
west side of the main rhyolite dome (target B) one kilometre to the south.
·
Target D: Near the west boundary of the claim block is an area of strong manganese and iron
oxides within a major silicified hydrothermal breccia striking roughly N-S.  The breccia has a very
fine matrix with heavy manganese and hematite.  Large blocks of the breccia are made up of a
porous silica network possibly representing a gaseous phase.  This area has some of the highest
As values on the property and is similar in appearance to zones hosting productive veins at the
El Peñon mine.
·
The structure-hosting target D is interpreted to continue north one kilometre to Target F where it
cuts into a possible rhyolite dome with high As values at surface.
Although there are other structures on the property, none are associated with known occurrences
of breccia or rhyolite dykes and domes.  For this reason, these structures are considered low
priority exploration targets and not recommended for testing in the first phase of drilling.  Sections
of the proposed drilling are shown in Figure 9.7.

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY
11.1
Arena 2013/2014 Program
This description is of the sampling procedure, security and analysis for samples from the 2013
exploration program carried out by Arena Minerals.  Information regarding sample preparation,
analyses and security for the historic programs of SQM was not disclosed to the author.
Two different types of surface rock sampling have been used by Arena to date:
1.
Grab samples - chips/pieces of rock taken from outcrop, float or dumps;
2.
Panel samples - composite chip samples taken over an area of between 0.5 x 0.5 m to 1 x 0.5 m;
All rock samples are placed into plastic sample bags, labelled and securely closed with single
use ties as the samples are taken.
All  samples  were  securely  stored  in  the  Barquedano  office  prior  to  shipment  to  the  Acme
preparation laboratory in Copiapó by contract transportation personnel.  Samples were prepared
in Copiapó and splits of the pulps were couriered to Acme Labs in Santiago and Vancouver for
assay.    Acme's  Santiago  and  Vancouver  facilities  are  ISO  9001:2000  registered  laboratories.
 Samples are analyzed for gold by fire assay followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)
finish  and  by  gravimetric  finish  for  samples  exceeding  the  upper  limit  of  analysis  (over  limit).
 Silver, copper, molybdenum, lead and zinc, together with 30 other elements, were assayed by
inductively  coupled  plasma-mass  spectrometry  (ICP-MS) 
following  aqua  regia  (partial)
dissolution of each pulp
The  author  knows  of  no  relationship  between  Acme  Labs  (now  part  of  Bureau  Veritas
(Inspectorate)) and Arena other than the provision of analytical services.
11.2
Quality Control Measures
Arena has established a comprehensive QA/QC program that is applied to all of the company’s
sampling activities whether from drilling, surface sampling, mapping, or trenching.  The control
samples represent approximately fifteen percent of all samples taken in any given program and a
summary of the procedure is provided below.
The overall objective of the QA/QC program is to ensure that results are representative of the
actual values for any given medium (drill core, RC chips, trench or hand samples, etc) and to
detect  possible  contamination  and  errors  in  accuracy  or  precision  at  the  laboratory.    The
procedures implemented by Arena were taken from generally accepted procedures available in
the industry and were audited by outside consultants to ensure that they comply with generally
accepted industry standards as well as current NI 43-101 requirements.  Control samples are
included  in  the  sampling  stream,  before  shipment  to  the  assay  laboratory,  according  to  the
following procedures:

General procedures
·
Site geologists are responsible for ensuring that standards and blanks are inserted in the correct
positions within the sample stream.
·
Site geologists are responsible for the selection of the twin and duplicate samples.
·
The field description-sampling template must include the correct code of the standards, as well
as the identification of blanks and duplicates.
·
Sample tags must be visible on all bags and the sample number must always be written with a
permanent marker on the outside of each bag.
·
Surface samples (rocks, soil, sediments, etc) should not weigh more than 2.0 kg.
·
Site  geologists  are  responsible  for  selecting  which  standard  to  include  in  the  sample  stream.
 Standards must be mixed and the same standard should not be used in all batches.
·
In order to ensure adequate control on the “chain of custody”, samples were transported from site
to the laboratory by private transport used exclusively for the company’s samples.
·
Samples were packed in large sealed sacks that have a separate numbered tag to ensure that
samples are not manipulated during transport.
11.2.2
Definitions
·
Field duplicate samples (2%) Duplicates are obtained by splitting the half core into quarters, or
taking a second channel sample parallel to one that has already been taken in order to obtain a
second sample as close as possible to the original.  Both samples should be collected under the
same conditions, prepared and assayed by the same laboratory. Each sample must have its own
sample number and ideally be analysed in the same batch.  Twin samples are taken 1 in 50.
·
Coarse  preparation  duplicates  (2%)  These  are  duplicates  taken  immediately  after  the  first
stage  of  crushing  and  splitting,  which  are  analysed  at  the  same  laboratory  but  with  different
sample numbers.  The samples are used to evaluate errors in splitting or sub-sampling.  The
frequency is also 1 in 50 and personnel from the laboratory are used to prepare these samples.
  An  empty  sample  bag  prepared  with  its  sample  number  and  a  note  indicating  that  it  is  for  a
coarse preparation duplicate is included in the sample stream at site.
·
Coarse blanks (2%) These are made up of coarse sterile material that must be submitted for the
entire  assay  procedure  in  the  same  sample  stream  as  regular  exploration  samples.    Coarse
blanks are to be inserted, normally, immediately following

mineralized samples to check for potential contamination at the laboratory but at no less than a
ratio of 1 in 50.
·
Pulp duplicate (2%) These are duplicates of regular samples that have been pulverized, split
and assigned a different sample number from the original sample.  These samples are to verify
the analytical precision of the laboratory and are inserted by laboratory personnel as instructed
by the site geologist in the same way as for the coarse duplicates (1 in 50).
·
Fine blanks (2%)  These  are  pulverized  sterile  material  that  are  also  to  be  inserted,  normally,
immediately  following  mineralized  samples  but  at  no  less  than  a  ratio  of  1  in  50  to  check  for
potential contamination at the laboratory during the assay procedure.  Fine and coarse blanks
are to be inserted in the sampling stream, one immediately following the other in all cases.
·
Certified standards (5%) They are samples prepared under controlled conditions by specialized
companies,  which  must  form  part  of  the  regular  sample  stream  analysed  by  the  primary
laboratory as well as the secondary laboratory (if it applies). Standards are included at a rate of 1
in 20 in the sampling stream.
The standards used in the 2013-2014 exploration program were manufactured by WCM Minerals
of Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.  The standards used in the program are listed in Table
11.1  and  the  number  submitted  to  the  assay  lab  as  well  as  percent  difference  from  the
recommended values for those standards analyzed are shown in Table 11.2.

The total number of standards analyzed was 25 and, of those, no failures were reported.
During the program 22 blanks were analyzed with the samples, of those 11 were coarse blanks
and 11 were fine blanks.  The results from the coarse blanks were reported at the detection limit
for gold and silver.  The copper analyses of coarse blanks showed some low-grade scatter and
three contaminated blanks.  Results from the fine blanks were similar with the reported values at
detection limit for gold, silver, and again low-grade scatter for copper but with two anomalous
values reported.
Duplicates  analyzed  during  the  program  were  16  field  duplicates  and  8  of  both  coarse
preparation and pulp duplicates.  No anomalies were noted on visual inspection.

There were no remedial measures taken by the company to correct for the weakly anomalous
copper values encountered in the blanks. The decision was taken in view of the relatively low
values encountered and that the focus of the program was on Au and Ag which didn’t show any
evidence of contamination.
The samples from the 2016 verification sampling were delivered by the author to ALS Global’s
preparation laboratory in Antofagasta.  Samples were collected in the field by the author as grab
samples from surface subcrop or as a chip sample from a trench.  The samples were bagged,
labelled and sealed at the time they were collected.  The samples remained in the custody of the
author until they were delivered to ALS Global’s preparation laboratory in Antofagasta.
Samples delivered to ALS Global’s preparation laboratory in Antofagasta used the same assay
procedures as described for the program in Section 11.1.
No QA/QC was included with the two verification samples.
The  author  believes  the  sample  handling,  preparation  and  analyses  of  these  samples  is
adequate for this stage of exploration on the Property.

Conclusions
It  is  the  opinion  of  the  author  that  the  sample  preparation,  security,  analytical  procedures  and
analyses  are  consistent  with  industry  best  practice  and  are  adequate  for  the  purposes  of  this
technical report.

DATA VERIFICATION
12.1
Verification Sampling Results
The  trench  chip  sample  and  the  surface  grab  sample  confirm  the  presence  of  geochemically
anomalous zones and mineralization related to epithermal vein systems on the property.  The
author’s  verification  samples  were  taken  from  two  drill  targets  on  the  3,400  ha  property.    It
appears that the data is adequate for the purposes of this technical report.  Sample locations are
shown in Figure 12.1.  Photograph 4 shows the material sampled in sample 2 and Photograph 5
shows sample 1.  Sample results are listed in Table 12.1.
Data verifications for this report included examination and sampling of the mineral showings on
the property, review of the results of previous exploration programs and confirmation of the option
agreement and concession tiles by Arena Minerals’ lawyers.  The author believes that these data
verifications are sufficient for this exploration stage property.

INTERPRETATION and CONCLUSIONS
The  Pampas  El  Peñon  Property  displays  styles  of  mineralization  characteristic  of  the  low  to
intermediate sulphidation epithermal deposits similar to El Peñon where the veins do not crop
out on surface.  The Central Andean Paleocene belt is ~1900 kilometres long and extends from
southern Peru to central Chile.  Mineralization is associated with an orogen-parallel metallogenic
belt of highly prospective Jurassic and Paleocene-Early Miocene volcanic and intrusive rocks.
 This suite of rocks hosts the Lomas Bayas, Spence, Sierra Gorda, El Peñon, Faride and Mantos
Blancos mines from the Antofagasta Region of Northern Chile and the region accounts for almost
18% of world copper production (2011) and significant gold production.
The author has been unable to verify this information about El Peñon and that the information
may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.
The initial exploration work was designed to verify the validity of previous work carried out on the
property and review the existing exploration targets. Existing trenches were visited and selected
samples were collected to verify the previously reported anomalies of trace elements. The RC
chips from the short drill hole program carried out by the previous owners were reviewed and the
existing geology mapping was reviewed.
Current  exploration  on  the  Property  has  identified  five  priority  targets  with  geochemical  and
geological  features  similar  to  productive  low-sulphidation  epithermal  veins  found  on  Yamana
Gold’s Pampa Augusta Victoria mine located immediately to the East of the property limit.
The author has been unable to verify this information about Pampa Augusta Victoria and that the
information may not be indicative of the mineralization on the Property.
The Property is in the early exploration stage, the risks and uncertainties associated with this
stage  of  exploration  are  the  challenges  in  discovering  new,  potentially  economic,  epithermal
systems  on  a  property  where  the  majority  of  the  property  is  covered  by  recent  colluvial  and
alluvial deposits.  The foreseeable impacts of these risks and uncertainties would be the failure
to discover additional mineralization that would limit its exploration potential.
The Pampas El Peñon property warrants further exploration for epithermal gold-silver systems
with the potential of discovering a low sulphidation epithermal deposit.
