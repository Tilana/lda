<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on the human rights situation 
and the activities of her Office in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 16/35, invited the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a report to its nineteenth session. In line with 
her two previous reports, the present report outlines the main human rights developments 
and describes the activities of her Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It 
reiterates some of the most important recommendations made by several United Nations 
human rights mechanisms and assesses the progress made by the Government of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo in implementing these recommendations. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner commends the Government&#8217;s efforts to implement some of 
the recommendations made by her Office and by other human rights mechanisms with a 
view to fighting impunity, strengthening State institutions and improving the human rights 
situation in the country. However, she regrets that, throughout 2011, there was little 
improvement in the situation of the population. Her Office continues to document serious 
human rights violations, in particular in the east of the country. 
</p>
<p> The report highlights the root causes for the persistence of human rights violations 
within the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The structural weaknesses of State 
institutions, in particular the judicial system and security forces, together with practices of 
corruption and the presence of armed groups, result in impunity and foster systemic human 
rights violations. These include arbitrary and summary executions, arbitrary and illegal 
arrests and detentions, ill-treatment, torture, sexual violence and looting. Prisoners are often 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>detained in conditions susceptible to ill-treatment and torture, and the death rate in 
detention continues to be high. The High Commissioner further notes with particular 
preoccupation that the number of cases of sexual violence remains high and that several 
incidents of mass rapes took place during the reporting period. The enjoyment of socio-
economic rights is also structurally impeded. 
</p>
<p> In the run-up to the presidential and legislative elections of 2011, the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s Office noted a concerning number of human rights violations committed 
</p>
<p>against political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders, who continue to face 
various threats and are victims of human rights violations, including arbitrary and illegal 
arrest and detention. The Office found that the majority of these violations were committed 
by security forces, manipulated by political actors. However, the High Commissioner 
welcomes the initiatives taken by the Government to protect public liberties, such as 
through the establishment of the Conseil Sup&#233;rieur de l&#8217;Audiovisuel et de la 
</p>
<p>Communication (CSAC) and the announcement of the creation of a protection cell for 
human rights defenders. She hopes that such mechanisms become fully operational and 
effective as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner notes with satisfaction that there has been some 
improvement in bringing soldiers, agents and officers of the Armed Forces of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and of the Congolese National Police (PNC) 
to justice. She notes with grave concern the staggering number of cases of sexual and 
gender-based violence and calls for a doubling of efforts to ensure continued progress in 
this area. She also commends the adoption of the law explicitly criminalizing torture. 
However, other necessary reform initiatives in the penitentiary and judicial systems have 
either stalled or are poorly and inconsistently implemented. In this respect, the High 
Commissioner observes that the root causes of human rights violations impede, at the same 
time, the implementation of the recommendations made in her previous reports. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner therefore stresses the urgent need to implement a coherent 
series of measures for the implementation of all the recommendations. Throughout this 
process, the Government should actively cooperate with the international community and 
Congolese civil society. The High Commissioner and her Office in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo will continue to support the Government in this undertaking.

rights violations directly related to the elections, targeting political opponents and the 
general population. Almost 70 per cent of the violations were attributed to PNC and ANR 
agents, who often abused their prerogatives to serve political ends. Supporters of the 
political opposition were often subjected to arbitrary and illegal arrests and detentions, 
further limiting their freedom of expression. The High Commissioner is particularly 
worried by such manipulation of the State&#8217;s security and intelligence sectors by political 
actors. Motives related to State security or defamation of the Head of State are regularly 
evoked by the authorities in an attempt to justify arbitrary arrests and detentions.  
</footnote>2 Inadequate resources 
prevent cases from being treated promptly and efficiently, make magistrates potentially 
susceptible to corruption and force them to request user fees from civilians seeking judicial 
recourse. This renders the justice system inaccessible to the majority of the population, 
undermines its neutrality and impartiality, and consequently erodes trust in the system. 
Often, when a judicial decision is issued, justice remains undone due to the systematic 
failure to enforce these decisions.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 16/35 
entitled &#8220;The human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 
strengthening of technical cooperation and advisory services.&#8221; In line with the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s two previous reports,1 this report, which covers the reporting period 
January to October 2011, gives an overview of the current human rights situation and the 
activities of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office2 (UNJHRO) in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. It reiterates some of the most important recommendations made by 
several United Nations human rights mechanisms and assesses the progress made by the 
Government in implementing those recommendations.<footnote name="3">The recommendations referred to are drawn from the following documents: Conclusions and 
recommendations of the Committee against Torture (CAT/C/DRC/CO/1); Report of the Human 
Rights Division of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(MONUC) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (January&#8211;June 2007); Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences (A/HRC/7/6/Add.4); Report submitted by the Representative of the Secretary-
General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin, Mission to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (A/HRC/8/6/Add.3); Concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child (CRC/C/COD/CO/2); reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights and the activities of her Office in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (A/HRC/10/58, A/HRC/13/64 and A/HRC/16/27); joint reports of seven United Nations 
experts on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (A/HRC/10/59, A/HRC/13/63, 
A/HRC/16/68); Report of the Special Rapporteur  on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions - 
Mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3); Concluding observations of 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/COD/CO/4); recommendations in 
the Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/8) and in the 
UNJHRO report on human rights during the pre-electoral period in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, 9 November 2011. In order to avoid repetition, the sources of the recommendations will not 
be cited again in the report. </footnote> The Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), particularly through UNJHRO, stands ready 
to support the Government with the implementation of these recommendations which are 
aimed at improving the human rights situation throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>2. During the period under review, in the run-up to the presidential and legislative 
elections, UNJHRO documented election-related human rights violations involving 
political party members, journalists and human rights defenders. Their fundamental 
freedoms of expression and assembly and their right to liberty and security were most 
affected. The violations were often committed by State security forces and intelligence 
agencies instrumentalized by political actors.  
</p>
<p>3. The High Commissioner is particularly concerned by the situation in the east of the 
country, especially in Orientale and Kivu provinces, where soldiers of the Armed Forces of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) continued to subject the local population 
to arbitrary executions, sexual violence, arbitrary and illegal arrests and detentions, torture 
and ill-treatment, extortion, looting and forced labour. Combatants of various armed groups 
also continued to commit serious human rights abuses against civilians, including murders, 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/13/64 and A/HRC/16/27. 
 2 The Human Rights Division of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic 
</p>
<p>of the Congo (MONUC) and OHCHR in the Democratic Republic of the Congo merged on 1 
February 2008, creating the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO) which functions 
according to their respective mandates. 
</p>

<p>rapes and abductions. Sexual violence continued to be a major source of concern 
throughout the reporting period.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Measures and response to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Arbitrary and illegal arrests and detentions 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>4. The powers of arrest of the various State security services should be restricted and 
the State should ensure that the Congolese National Police (PNC) is the primary law 
enforcement agency. Moreover, the State should investigate all cases of arbitrary arrest, 
prosecute those responsible and provide compensation to the victims. UNJHRO should be 
granted unfettered access to all prisons and detention centres in the country.4 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since the High Commissioner&#8217;s last report, the Government has still not taken 
significant action to reduce arbitrary arrests and detentions. On a regular basis, civilians are 
arrested for actions that do not constitute criminal offences, such as unpaid debts or alleged 
sorcery. Agents of the National Intelligence Agency (ANR) and the Direction g&#233;n&#233;rale de 
migration (DGM) arrest people for reasons outside the scope of their respective mandates. 
Moreover, civilians arrested are often denied their constitutional right to have a judge 
decide the lawfulness of their detention. The absence of judicial control over these 
detainees and the perceived normality of these unofficial procedures, especially in security-
related cases, enable the powers of intelligence and security officers to go unchecked and 
renders the officers highly susceptible to corruption. Throughout 2011, civilians were also 
frequently arrested for political reasons, resulting in intimidation and limits on the right to 
freedom of expression.5 Arbitrary arrests and detentions are often used by police officers to 
extort money from civilians.  
</p>
<p><b>  Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>6. In cooperation with national prosecutors, UNJHRO has continued its efforts to visit 
detention centres throughout the country to ensure that international and Congolese laws 
regulating the deprivation of liberty are respected. In this way, UNJHRO has brought 
numerous cases of arbitrary arrest or illegal detention to the attention of the judicial 
authorities, which in turn has led to the release of a large number of victims. During the 
reporting period, UNJHRO also organized several awareness-raising activities and training 
sessions for Congolese security forces to increase their knowledge of and respect for the 
laws on the subject. It should be recalled that, despite several Security Council resolutions6 
and a presidential directive of 5 July 2005, UNJHRO human rights officers are still denied 
the right to access the large majority of detention facilities of the National Intelligence 
Agency (ANR) and the Republican Guard.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>

<p>detentions tend to be either financially motivated or political in nature. Both kinds of 
arbitrary arrests are facilitated and perpetuated by the structural weaknesses of the criminal 
justice system, including the lack of resources.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Prison conditions, torture and ill-treatment in detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>8. Immediate steps should be taken to improve penitentiary conditions and to reduce 
overcrowding. Moreover, it was recommended that the State adopt a law and take effective 
measures to protect persons reporting torture or ill-treatment from threats or intimidation. 
The High Commissioner further called on the Government to allocate adequate resources to 
the penitentiary system, inter alia, to guarantee food and health-care supplies.7 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>9. Albeit diminishing since 2010, the number of deaths in prison remains high. 
Between January and September 2011, UNJHRO documented 41 cases of death in 
detention as a result of chronic malnutrition, severe ill-treatment or lack of access to basic 
health care. This decrease is largely due to initiatives taken at the local level by prison 
personnel and NGOs. The State is obliged to provide food to the inmates; however, no 
prison in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been allotted a sufficient budget for 
this purpose and prisoners remain almost completely dependent on food brought by 
families or charities. Besides the scarcity of food, prison conditions are rendered even 
harsher by the lack of basic infrastructure, abject sanitary conditions and the heavily 
overcrowded environment. Moreover, inmates remain vulnerable to torture and ill-
treatment by penitentiary personnel.  
</p>
<p>10. The deplorable living conditions of the detainees and the dilapidated prison 
infrastructure continue to prompt riots and prison escapes<b>. </b>These escapes are undermining 
efforts of the judiciary to fight impunity. For example, on 7 September 2011, 967 inmates, 
including 271 accused of sexual violence and rape, escaped from Kasapa prison in 
Lubumbashi, Katanga, following an attack on the prison by unidentified armed men.  
</p>
<p>11. Despite legislative progress, the overall implementation of reform initiatives remains 
weak. On 20 July 2011, a law was promulgated by the President explicitly criminalizing 
torture.8 Throughout the reporting period, some steps were made towards restructuring the 
management and human resources allocated to the penitentiary system. However, these 
efforts were not accompanied by sufficient budget efforts. As a result, penitentiary staff 
remain severely underpaid, undedicated and susceptible to corruption.  
</p>
<p>12. Prison administration continues to be highly dysfunctional. Consequently, pre-trial 
detainees are frequently forgotten and the legislation on conditional release remains highly 
underused. Overall, the lack of coherence and consistency in the implementation of reform 
initiatives undermines their efficiency. In this respect, the encompassing Strategic Prison 
Reform Plan, devised in 2009 by the Ministry of Justice in cooperation with MONUSCO,9 
has still not been introduced in Parliament. 
</p>

 8 Loi du 20 juillet 2011 portant criminalisation de la torture<i>.</i> 
 9  As of 1 July 2010, MONUC was renamed the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in 
</p>
<p>the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). </p>


<p><b>  Action taken by UNJHRO 
</b></p>
<p>13. During the period under review, UNJHRO continued to organize frequent visits to 
detention facilities all over the country, in collaboration with the Congolese authorities and 
other partners, although it was denied access to some detention facilities, as mentioned in 
paragraph 11 above. UNJHRO continued to conduct prison visits and monitor individual 
cases of detainees. In cooperation with the corrections unit of MONUSCO, UNJHRO 
advised prison directors on human rights-related issues. Also in collaboration with this unit 
and with funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), UNJHRO 
is rehabilitating Kangbayi prison in Beni, North Kivu, and the central prison in Kalehe, 
South Kivu.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>14. As few significant measures have been taken since the High Commissioner&#8217;s last 
report, there is little improvement in the situation.10 The penitentiary system is poorly 
funded and corruption networks have taken root. These networks are resisting reform 
initiatives that might render their activities less profitable or tend to capitalize on them. 
Although the law penalizing torture has been adopted, its consistent application remains a 
significant challenge, given the lack of capacity and the need to train penitentiary, judicial 
and security personnel. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Democratic Republic of the Congo should abolish all provisions of national law 
that discriminate against women. State institutions should denounce publicly and 
unequivocally all forms of violence against women, including marital violence and rape. 
Custom, traditions or religious considerations must not be invoked to temper these 
denunciations. The Government should establish and promote an effective mechanism to 
receive complaints of sexual violence, including at custodial facilities. The High 
Commissioner, among others, has called on the Government to provide victims with 
psychological and medical care. Furthermore, the Government has to ensure that members 
of the State security forces know and comply with the laws on sexual violence and that 
perpetrators are brought to justice without delay. Finally, the State should pay damages to 
all victims of sexual violence committed by State agents and create a fund for this purpose 
in the national budget.11 
</p>
<p><b>  Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>16. The number of victims registered by UNJHRO remained high over the course of 
2011. The High Commissioner is particularly preoccupied by the high incidence of rape of 
minors and by several<b> </b>grave cases of mass rapes committed by FARDC soldiers and 
various armed groups. For instance, between the end of April and the beginning of May 
2011, UNJHRO conducted, with judicial authorities, several missions to camps of 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Katanga province. During these missions, UNJHRO 
documented allegations of rape, including gang-rape, of at least 102 women and one girl by 
combatants of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) between 
November 2010 and January 2011. In July 2011, UNJHRO published two reports on mass 
</p>

<p>rapes and other human rights violations committed between 30 July and 2 August 2010 in 
the Kibua-Mpofi axis, Walikale territory, North Kivu, and on 31 December 2010 and 1 
January 2011 in Bushani and Kalambahiro, Masisi territory, North Kivu, respectively.12  
</p>
<p>17. Between January and July 2011, mobile hearings of the military courts and tribunals 
made an essential contribution to the fight against impunity for sexual offences. For 
example, from 10 to 21 February 2011, mobile hearings were held in Baraka, South Kivu, 
in the case of mass rapes and other human rights violations which took place on 1 and 2 
January 2011 in Fizi, South Kivu. These hearings enabled the conviction by the South Kivu 
military court of nine accused officers, including Lieutenant-Colonel Kibibi Mutware. The 
High Commissioner especially welcomes the efforts made by the Congolese judicial 
authorities in this regard.  
</p>
<p>18. Despite progress in holding perpetrators of rape to account, relatively few rape cases 
result in conviction of the perpetrators. Moreover, alleged perpetrators often benefit from 
provisional release, causing impediments in the judicial procedure. In cases where the 
perpetrators are condemned to pay damages to their victims, who very rarely &#8211; if ever &#8211; 
receive them. Not only are the perpetrators often insolvent, but the execution of awards 
requires the payment of additional fees that often prohibit follow up by victims. Even when 
the State is condemned to pay damages<i> in solidum</i>, the victims rarely receive them because 
of a general lack of legal assistance, despite programmes developed with the support of the 
international community, including UNJHRO, and because the State has not allocated funds 
for this purpose. 
</p>
<p>19. In order to redress this situation, the Minister of Justice and Human Rights devised a 
draft law concerning the creation of a fund to enable the State to pay such damages. 
Although this draft law was written in 2009, it has yet to be introduced in Parliament.  
</p>
<p><b>  Activities of the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the reporting period, UNJHRO continued to closely monitor incidents of and 
investigate cases of sexual violence as well as support judicial authorities in the prosecution 
of those responsible. UNJHRO provides technical advice and logistical support to mobile 
hearings, as well as to judicial authorities in their investigations. Currently, a project is 
being prepared to train and deploy 25 women in Prosecutor&#8217;s offices nation-wide to 
strengthen their respective sexual violence units. The criminal justice system is also 
receiving office equipment, including computers, to strengthen its capacity. This support is 
funded by CIDA and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). 
UNJHRO is also raising awareness about sexual violence and conducting campaigns to 
disseminate the 2006 law on sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>21. In order to lower the barriers for victims of sexual violence to seek judicial redress, 
UNJHRO is implementing two projects in partnership with CIDA and SIDA to establish 
legal clinics that will assist victims free-of-charge throughout the judicial process. Between 
January and October 2011, 15 additional legal clinics were established, bringing the total to 
25 clinics operating in all provinces of the country, except for Orientale.  
</p>
<p>  
 12 Report on the investigation missions of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office into the mass 
</p>
<p>rapes and other human rights violations committed in the villages of Bushani and Kalambahiro, 
Masisi territory, North Kivu, on 31 December 2011 and 1 January 2011; and Final report of the fact-
finding missions of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office into the mass rapes and other 
human rights violations committed by a coalition of armed groups along the Kibua-Mpofi axis in 
Walikale territory, North Kivu, from 30 July to 2 August 2011. </p>


<p>22. In March 2011, a high-level panel that went to the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo in October 2010, at the request of the High Commissioner, to examine remedies and 
reparations provided to victims of sexual violence, presented an elaborate report containing 
recommendations to the Government.13 In follow-up to that report, UNJHRO, in close 
cooperation with UN Women and with funding from the Government of Brazil, is putting 
in place a project to devise mechanisms that will enable the State to implement the 
recommendations. Particular attention is paid to mechanisms that would enable the State to 
fulfil its legal obligation to financially compensate victims of sexual violence committed by 
State agents and pilot projects on reparation to be implemented in local communities.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles to the implementation of existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>23. Despite some progress, high-profile perpetrators are still rarely prosecuted and the 
criminal justice system remains structurally dysfunctional. However, obstacles to the fight 
against sexual violence go beyond the weakness of State institutions and are related to 
cultural and socio-economic issues. Victims are often reluctant to disclose what has taken 
place and to initiate legal processes, fearing rejection by their community. Out-of-court 
settlements, although prohibited by the 2006 law on sexual violence, are still often pursued 
by victims and their families. Apart from strengthening State responses to cases of sexual 
violence, the root causes must be addressed, notably women&#8217;s precarious and 
disadvantaged socio-economic position in Congolese society. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violation of economic and social rights and illegal exploitation of

<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>24. Various recommendations have been made to the Congolese Government to take 
comprehensive measures to address the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the 
country and increase transparency in revenue collection, in particular by mapping those 
actors exploiting natural resources in the east. The High Commissioner also recommended 
that the Government prioritize the allocation of its resources to progressively realize human 
rights, in particular economic and social rights, including free access to primary education 
and affordable basic health care.14 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>25. In an effort to curb illegal exploitation of natural resources, the Government decided 
on 20 September 2010 to suspend mining activities in Maniema, and in North and South 
Kivu.15 This suspension had a limited deterrent effect and, in fact, proved to be detrimental 
to the livelihoods of thousands of artisanal miners and the local economy. The suspension 
was lifted by the Government on 1 March 2011. In May 2011, the Government also took 
measures to improve transparency in both the origins of minerals, through developing

</p>
<p>26. Budget allocations for education and health have been considerably increased in 
2011. The High Commissioner commends the Government for this important step. 
However, health centres and schools continue to depend on user fees for funding, which 
systematically excludes the poorest households and puts a tremendous strain on the 
livelihoods of many others. Between 24 July and 5 August 2011, the independent expert on 
foreign debt and human rights conducted a mission in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, with a particular view to assessing the impact of the country&#8217;s debt burden on 
economic, social and cultural rights.17 
</p>
<p><b>  Activities of the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>27. UNJHRO continued to monitor human rights violations linked to the illegal 
exploitation of natural resources. In the framework of the STAREC programme,18 mineral 
trading centres (<i>comptoirs</i>) have been established in the Kivu provinces by MONUSCO, in 
collaboration with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, the 
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Fund. The project seeks to ensure the legal exploitation of natural resources 
and to remove armed groups and FARDC battalions from the commodity chain. 
</p>
<p>28. UNJHRO continues to raise awareness about the illegal exploitation of natural 
resources and is actively trying to engage civil society in this area. For instance, on 28 and 
29 September 2011, in Goma, the Office of the High Commissioner organized, in 
cooperation with the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, organized in 
Goma a series of training sessions for journalists and civil society members on regional 
initiatives in the fight against the illegal exploitation of resources and on the economic and 
social rights of the local population. 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>29. Economic and social rights and the initiatives taken by the Government in this 
regard are still hampered by the obstacles highlighted in the High Commissioner&#8217;s previous 
reports.19 For instance, ministries responsible for collecting taxes deriving from natural 
resource extraction suffer from lack of capacity and endemic corruption, which 
substantially depletes revenue collection from this activity. Due to the chronic 
underpayment of civil servants in all Government sectors, corruption practices have taken 
root, compromising State efficiency in realizing economic and social rights. The budget 
allocated to basic economic and social rights remains very low. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b> E. Situation of journalists, human rights defenders, victims and witnesses 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>30. State institutions should encourage the democratic process and respect the country&#8217;s 
international obligations related to freedom of expression and freedom of the press. The 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders recommended that the 
Government adopt laws on the protection of human rights defenders, as well as  organize 
awareness-raising activities for the police, military and judicial officials on the role and 
activities of human rights defenders, including women, with technical assistance from 
OHCHR and NGOs. The Government should further remove all obstacles that impede the 
work of human rights defenders and journalists, protect them from reprisals and take 
proactive measures to support their work. In particular, the High Commissioner urged the 
Government to promptly and rigorously investigate the death of Chebeya Bahizire and to 
spare no efforts to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice.<footnote name="20">03, but was never discussed. The current proposal was presented in the National Assembly on 23 
April 2008. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>31. During the period under review, the situation of journalists and human rights 
defenders remained highly precarious. On 1 and 2 February 2011, the president and vice-
president of the Association africaine de d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme (ASADHO) were 
threatened with death following a press conference, during which they denounced the 
constitutional reform and political intolerance of the Government towards the political 
opposition. Journalists touching on sensitive subjects such as corruption, extortion of the 
population by security forces or the elections are especially prone to harassment by State 
authorities.  
</p>
<p>32. On 23 June 2011, the Military Court of Kinshasa/Gombe rendered its judgment in 
the emblematic case concerning the killing of human rights defender, Floribert Chebeya, 
and his driver, Fid&#232;le Bazana. Four policemen were convicted, including three in absentia, 
and sentenced to the death penalty, and a fifth to life imprisonment. Three of the accused 
were acquitted for lack of evidence.  All those convicted launched an appeal. UNJHRO will 
continue to closely monitor the appeal case, in particular with a view to verifying the 
standards of fair trial. 
</p>
<p>33. The High Commissioner commends the willingness of the Government and the 
initiatives it has taken to create a legal and institutional framework contributing to the 
protection of human rights defenders. On 27 May 2011, the Government introduced a draft 
law in Parliament on the protection of human rights activists.21 The High Commissioner 
hopes that it will be adopted without undue delay. By a Ministerial Decision of 13 June 
2011, the Minister of Justice and Human Rights established a protection cell for human 
rights defenders.22 It will be created within the same Ministry and will liaise with the 
authorities and non-governmental protection initiatives to follow up on individual cases.<b>

</p>

<p><b>  Activities of the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>34. UNJHRO continues to closely monitor cases involving journalists, human rights 
defenders, victims and witnesses, to ensure that their rights are respected and that the 
judiciary is not used as a tool of repression. Active care was taken to broaden the protection 
networks established in partnership with local NGOs beyond the cities into territories 
further afield.<b> </b>In so doing, UNJHRO and its partners were able to offer various forms of 
protection to six journalists, 36 human rights defenders, three witnesses and 38 victims over 
the first six months of 2011. The people concerned were offered advice on protective 
measures, received temporary shelter at MONUSCO field bases or were relocated as 
necessary. UNJHRO provided technical assistance in the drafting of amendments to the 
draft law on human rights defenders, and is actively following up the parliamentary 
procedure in collaboration with the parliamentary network on human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>35. The obstacles mentioned in the High Commissioner&#8217;s previous report remain.23 
Efforts are required to ensure in particular that the judicial and security authorities fully 
understand and appreciate the value of the work of journalists and human rights defenders. 
Democratic space is often limited due to the instrumentalization of security and intelligence 
officials by politicians.24  
</p>
<p><b> F. Public liberties and elections 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>36. In the past, several recommendations had been made related to the strengthening of 
democratic space. The regime of information governing the exercise of the right to freedom 
of peaceful assembly (article 26 of the Constitution) should be respected without any 
arbitrary interference from the executive. A number of press offences should be 
decriminalized and the draft law on the Conseil Sup&#233;rieur de l&#8217;Audiovisuel et de la 
Communication (CSAC) should be adopted. More generally, the Government should 
encourage and enable public dialogue and scrutiny in order to ensure the sustainability and 
advancement of the democratic process. The High Commissioner also urged the 
Government not to prohibit or impede any political demonstration and other public 
expressions of political opinion that are peaceful and do not incite to violence.25  
</p>
<p><b>  Measures taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>

<p>38. Although the 2006 Constitution abolished the obligation to request authorization for 
the organization of demonstrations and substituted it with a system of prior notification, 
authorities still treat demonstrations which appear to be contrary to their interests as 
prohibited. On 1 September 2011, for example, PNC agents and FARDC soldiers dispersed 
a demonstration by the Union pour la d&#233;mocratie et le progr&#232;s social (UDPS) in Mbuji-
Mayi, Kasai Oriental; they allegedly used tear gas and shot live rounds in the air. 
Reportedly, 35 civilians were arrested, several of whom were wounded as a result of ill-
treatment in detention. During demonstrations, journalists are regularly harassed, beaten 
and their equipment is confiscated. 
</p>
<p>39. In several instances, the Government directly interfered with the freedom of the 
media. On 9 July 2011, for instance, the Minister of Communications and Media prohibited 
the broadcasting of Radio Lisanga Television, an opposition-owned broadcasting station. 
The signal was re-established on 14 July 2011, following a new ministerial decision. Since 
the establishment of the CSAC in August 2011, this media-regulating body is the only 
institution with the authority to impose administrative sanctions on the media and regulate 
their deontological ethics.26 The High Commissioner therefore welcomed its establishment, 
but was concerned that it was being established too close to the election date to be fully 
operational during the pre-electoral period.<b> </b>  
</p>
<p>40. On 9 November 2011, UNJHRO published a report on human rights and 
fundamental freedoms during the pre-electoral period in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo,27 in which it denounced a number of human rights violations and acts of violence 
targeting political party members, journalists and human rights defenders since November 
2010. The report warned that such incidents could endanger the democratic process and 
lead to post-electoral violence; it formulated recommendations, including for the Congolese 
Government, to put an end and prevent the commission of further violations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Activities of the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>41. Throughout the entire pre-electoral period, UNJHRO organized activities aimed at 
strengthening monitoring activities throughout the country, including by human rights 
NGOs, and preventing elections-related human rights violations. In this respect, UNJHRO 
held workshops in the provinces to reach officials, political parties and the media. Round 
tables were organized to bring together judicial and military authorities, journalists and 
human rights defenders to improve the protection of the latter before, during and after the 
elections. Police forces were provided training, in cooperation with other United Nations 
entities, including the United Nations Police (UNPOL).  
</p>
<p>42. Monitoring activities to document and verify election-related human rights incidents 
were reinforced in cooperation with national human rights organizations. UNJHRO 
facilitated coordination and the exchange of information between MONUSCO, 
international organizations and national NGOs with a view to timely identifying and 
addressing incitation to violence or hate speech as early as possible. Moreover, trials 
involving members of political opposition parties and journalists were closely monitored to 
determine whether the judiciary was being used a political tool. Once determined, 
UNJHRO followed up individual cases of human rights violations and tried to find 
appropriate redress through advocacy for the release of political detainees or supporting 
judicial authorities.

<p><b>  Obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>43. As a result of various factors, including impunity, security forces and law 
enforcement and intelligence agents remain susceptible to instrumentalization by political 
actors. Moreover, economically disadvantaged and socially excluded groups, especially 
youth, are prone to incitation to violence by political leaders, who often do not call on their 
supporters to abide by the laws and respect public order during demonstrations. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Administration of justice and fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>44. It has been recommended that the Government strengthen its judicial and law 
enforcement systems and that Parliament give priority to the adoption of fundamental laws 
to reform the judicial system, in order to bring it in line with international standards. The 
High Commissioner, inter alia, called on the Government to adopt legislation implementing 
the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It should also enable the judiciary to work 
independently, inter alia, by improving the working conditions of the judicial personnel. 
The Government should increase the budget allocated for the functioning of the justice 
system to at least 2 per cent of the national budget. Moreover, the Government should 
ensure that the military courts and tribunals only try the military for military offences, in 
accordance with applicable international norms.28 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>45. In follow-up to the report on the most serious violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
between March 1993 and June 2003,29 and its recommendations, the Minister of Justice and 
Human Rights devised a draft law concerning the creation and organization of a specialized 
court, composed of national and international judges, to deal with crimes committed during 
the aforementioned period. On 22 August 2011, the Senate decided to return the draft law 
to the Government for review. The draft laws on the incorporation of the Statute of the 
International Criminal Court into national legislation and on the establishment of a national 
commission for the promotion and protection of human rights in accordance with the Paris 
Principles are still under discussion in Parliament.30  
</p>
<p>46. By January 2012, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights planned to have trained 
and deployed approximately 1,000 additional magistrates all over the country. The judiciary 
would thus be reinforced by almost 2,000 extra magistrates as compared to the beginning of 
2010. However, the general budget of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights has not 
been increased correspondingly. As a result, the working conditions of these magistrates in 
the provinces remain dire. 
</p>
<p>47.<b> </b>As mentioned in the High Commissioner&#8217;s previous report, the human rights liaison 
body (entit&#233; de liaison des droits de l&#8217;homme) is not yet functioning properly,31 inter alia, 
</p>
<p>  
 28 See footnote 3.

</i></p>
<p><i>and international humanitarian law committed within the territory of the Democratic Republic of the 
</i></p>
<p><i>Congo between March 1993 and June 2003</i>, August 2010. 
 30 A first draft law to incorporate the Rome Statute in national legislation was submitted to Parliament in 
</p>

<p>due to lack of funding. The High Commissioner welcomes the call made by the Minister of 
Justice and Human Rights to establish liaison bodies in the provinces; none has yet been 
created. Parliament has still not adopted the draft law concerning the establishment of a 
national commission for the promotion and protection of human rights in accordance with 
the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b>  Activities of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>48. UNJHRO has developed several tools to assist the Government and judicial 
authorities in strengthening the criminal justice system. Besides following up on the 
parliamentary proceedings concerning the draft laws to reform the criminal justice system, 
such as the draft law on the specialized court, UNJHRO is involved in advising 
parliamentarians on the content of the draft laws and on possible amendments.  
</p>
<p>49. The High Commissioner dispatched an OHCHR mission to the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo from 27 to 31 March 2011 to step up discussions with the Government and 
other partners to follow-up on the report on the most serious violations of human rights and 
international law committed in the country between March 1993 and June 2003. The 
mission discussed the transitional justice options contained in the report and stressed the 
need for constitutional change in order to abolish the judicial privileges and immunities of 
high-ranking military and civilian authorities suspected of having committed international 
crimes. OHCHR also shared comments on the draft law establishing specialized chambers 
with the Government, members of Parliament and civil society. At the time, OHCHR 
expressed concerns about some of the provisions of the law, including those related to the 
lack of independence of the judges, the lack of clarity with regard to the role of the 
Prosecutor, the applicable legal framework, the unconstitutional nature of some of the 
provisions, as well as the possibility of applying capital punishment. OHCHR stressed that 
failure of the law to comply with international standards would undermine the credibility of 
the specialized court and, consequently, the willingness of key donors and international 
judges to support and participate in this process. The mission also pointed out that the 
establishment of a specialized court should also contribute to a broader effort to strengthen 
national capacity in the area of the rule of law and administration of justice.   
</p>
<p>50. In cooperation with MONUSCO, United Nations Development Program (UNDP) 
and other partners, UNJHRO is providing logistical and technical support to the judiciary. 
In order to enable the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights and the Prosecutor&#8217;s offices to 
</p>
<p>better monitor and implement improvements in judicial activity, UNJHRO, in partnership 
with the Government, is developing a database which will increase the efficiency of the 
administrative processing of cases and enable analysis of the outcome of cases and the 
performance of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles 
</b></p>

<p><b> H. Fight against impunity for Congolese security forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Existing recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Government should firmly implement its zero-tolerance policy33 for all human 
rights violations. Judicial authorities should pursue in-depth investigations of all members 
of the security forces suspected of having committed human rights violations and hold to 
account those found responsible. Moreover, superior officers should impose strict rules of 
discipline. Appropriate action has to be taken to remove army officers and battalions 
implicated in serious human rights violations from the FARDC, and to bring them to 
justice.34 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>53. During the period under review, the implementation of the zero-tolerance policy 
announced by the President in July 2009, including with regard to grave violations of 
human rights committed by the FARDC, gained momentum. A considerable number of 
mobile hearings were held by various military courts and tribunals, notably in South-Kivu, 
where between January and August 2011, hearings led to rape convictions of 52 FARDC 
soldiers, including several officers.35 The High Commissioner welcomes this important 
progress. 
</p>
<p>54. Many officers, however, still evade justice and are rarely, if ever, prosecuted for 
their command responsibility. For the zero-tolerance policy to be effective, military 
commanders must not only impose rigid discipline but also have to be held accountable 
themselves for not preventing or responding to human rights violations committed by their 
subordinates.  
</p>
<p>55. With regard to the five army officers involved in serious human rights violations, 
including sexual violence, whose name were on a list given to the President by a Security 
Council delegation in May 2009,  two are being detained, one of whom will be brought 
before a judge. The trial of General Kakwavu for the war crime of rape, which started on 25 
March 2011 before the Military High Court, is ongoing, while on 21 October 2011, the 
Military Court of Kinshasa/Gombe acquitted another Colonel of rape charges for lack of 
evidence. The whereabouts of the remaining two officers are unknown. 
</p>
<p>56. An adequate vetting mechanism must be put in place to ensure that those responsible 
for gross human rights violations are removed from the army and not permitted into the 
chain of command. Although the Security Council called on the Government to implement 
such a mechanism in several resolutions,36 and despite the Government&#8217;s commitment to do 
so during the universal periodic review,37 no steps have been taken to date.  
</p>
<p>57.  In January 2011, the FARDC started an internal reconfiguration of its units in the 
Kivu provinces. During this process, soldiers were transferred to training centres before 
being reassigned to restructured regiments. As the soldiers were transferred, entire areas 
were left without effective military control, creating a power vacuum which provided 
armed groups, including the FDLR, the opportunity to regain territory and commit 
</p>
<p>  
 33 On 5 July 2009, President Kabila issued an edict defining a policy of zero tolerance for violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights, particularly acts sexual violence, committed by members of the armed forces. 
 34 See footnote 3. 
 35 See para. 20 above. 
 36 See, for example, Security Council resolution 1906 (2009), para. 32; and resolution 1991 (2011), 
</p>
<p>para. 16. 
 37 A/HRC/13/8, para. 94, recommendation 44. </p>


<p>exactions and human rights violations against the local population. Moreover, as FARDC 
soldiers were moving to and from the training centres, they could no longer be identified by 
victims or witnesses for human rights violations committed by them, which contributed to 
impunity for human rights violations committed by FARDC soldiers during the 
reconfiguration operation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Activities of the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>58. With a view to fighting impunity, UNJHRO continues to conduct several types of 
monitoring activities. Trials, including mobile hearings, are monitored for fair trial 
standards and the security of victims and witnesses is continuously followed up. In case of 
conviction, UNJHRO follows up the enforcement of the rulings and assists the Government 
in this process, inter alia, through improving prison security and offering support in 
developing reparation mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>59. UNJHRO is further continuing to assist judicial authorities by providing support for 
their investigation of alleged human rights violations. For instance, a team was deployed to 
investigate allegations of rape of nine women, and torture, cruel and degrading treatment of 
17 other civilians, reportedly all committed by FARDC soldiers in Kikozi (45 km south 
west of Uvira), South Kivu, during the night of 26 to 27 March 2011. The rule of law 
section of MONUSCO is furthermore establishing prosecution support cells to advise the 
military prosecutor&#8217;s offices in prosecuting alleged perpetrators of serious violations of 
human rights law. With support for the deployment of 12 mobile courts between January 
and July 2011, military courts and tribunals handled 118 cases on sexual violence and other 
serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>60. In compliance with the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy on United Nations 
support to non-United Nations security forces, UNJHRO continued to screen FARDC 
battalion commanders for past human rights violations before any logistical and other 
support can be provided in the framework of jointly planned military operations. Since the 
beginning of 2011, MONUSCO has suspended support to three FARDC units as corrective 
action had not been taken by FARDC to redress the human rights violations allegedly 
committed by them. UNJHRO has also played an important role in the development and 
implementation of modes of intervention to meet protection challenges, such as the support 
provided, through funding from the Government of the United States of America, in the 
deployment of international staff to reinforce joint protection teams in the eastern part of 
the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>61. The difficulties mentioned in the previous reports of the High Commissioner 
regarding the issue of impunity for security forces remain topical. Another important factor 
for the continued human rights abuses is the absence of background checks for new 
recruits, such as former combatants of armed groups, and the lack of an established vetting 
mechanism.  Moreover, as long as discipline is not imposed by commanders, impunity will 
continue to prevail despite initiatives taken by the Government and its international 
partners. Furthermore, as long as FARDC soldiers are not paid regularly and sufficiently, 
they will be prone to engage in pillaging and forced labour. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Over the course of the reporting period, despite some important measures 
taken by the government, little improvement in the human rights situation on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>ground was observed. The population remains subject to grave human rights </b></p>


<p><b>violations, linked to the various armed conflicts and the weakness of State institutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The High Commissioner commends the initiatives taken by the Government, such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>the draft laws introduced and agencies or entities created towards the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights. However, the High Commissioner is preoccupied by the often stalled 
</b></p>
<p><b>parliamentary process, the difficulties to implement these initiatives and their ill-
</b></p>
<p><b>funding. Beyond budgetary constraints, major and fundamental obstacles to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>improvement of the human rights situation remain, notably corruption and impunity. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendation to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Congo and the international community 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The High Commissioner welcomes the steps taken by the Congolese 
Government to implement some of the recommendations made by the Office of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>High Commissioner and other human rights mechanisms, as well as the commitments 
</b></p>
<p><b>made by the Government during the universal periodic review. In order for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the recommendations to be effective, a coherent and consolidated 
</b></p>
<p><b>action plan needs to be further developed, and measures included in this plan further 
</b></p>
<p><b>specified as previously recommended. The High Commissioner therefore recommends 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the Government further enhance its dialogue and cooperation with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights mechanisms. The High Commissioner calls upon the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community to assist the Congolese Government in this process.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendation to the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Human Rights Council should remain actively seized of the human rights 
situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and ensure that the situation is 
</b></p>
<p><b>continuously monitored by human rights mechanisms. The Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also call on the Government to step up its dialogue with the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community to further concretize and implement the plan of action for the 
</b></p>
