The right to food 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous General Assembly and Council resolutions on the right to 
food, in particular Assembly resolution 64/159 of 18 December 2009 and Council 
resolution 10/12 of 26 March 2009, as well as all resolutions of the Commission on Human 
Rights on the issue,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the holding of its seventh special session, at which it analysed the 
negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the realization of the right to 
food for all, as well as its resolutions S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 9/6 of 18 September 2008 and 
12/10 of 1 October 2009,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition 
and the United Nations Millennium Declaration,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from hunger is 
recognized,  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.10-12333 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted in Rome 
on 13 June 2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 
November 2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the 
Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-
importing Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national 
food security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006, <i>Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation 
that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration 
of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument 
of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 
international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from 
unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations and that endanger food security, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and 
capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of 
Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize 
collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked 
institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities 
are essential, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food 
insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made on 
reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, 
determined and concerted action is taken,  
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis are not over and that 
they continue to have serious consequences on the most vulnerable people, particularly in 
developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and 
financial crisis,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading 
system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, 
thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
factors contributing to destitution and desperation and have a negative impact on the 
realization of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern </i>at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of 
life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in 
developing countries, </p>


<p>GE.10-12333 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development 
assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official 
development assistance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to 
agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food does not only entail an 
increase in productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder 
and traditional farmers and the most vulnerable groups and national and international 
policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the need to increase investment in agriculture from all relevant sources 
for the realization of the right to food, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council, and 5/2 on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity 
and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and 
international levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious 
food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be 
free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and 
mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the fact that the world food crisis continues to 
seriously undermine the realization of the right to food for all, and especially for one sixth 
of the world population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, who suffer 
from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Considers it intolerable </i>that, according to an estimation by the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the 
age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are 
undernourished has grown to about 1.02 billion worldwide, and that there is an additional 1 
billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food 
crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough 
food to feed 12 billion people, that is, twice the world&#8217;s current population;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and 
discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from 
malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice 
as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> all States to take action to address gender inequality and 
discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of 
women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to 
food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and 
water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and 
technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Stresses </i>the need to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to land 
rights for smallholders, traditional farmers and their organizations, including in particular 
rural women and vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to ensure the 
mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12333 
</p>
<p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations 
bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate and 
effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective into their 
relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reaffirms </i>the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious 
food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> States to mainstream a human rights perspective in building and 
reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to food for all, and to take 
steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as 
possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing 
appropriate institutional mechanisms, in order to:  
</p>
<p> (a) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, emerging threats to the right to 
adequate food, with a view to facing them; 
</p>
<p> (b) Strengthen the overall national human rights protection system with a view to 
contributing to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> (c) Improve coordination between the different relevant ministries and between 
national and subnational levels of government;  
</p>
<p> (d) Improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the 
setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that 
require progressive implementation; 
</p>
<p> (e) Ensure adequate participation, particularly of the most food-insecure 
segments of the population; 
</p>
<p> (f) Pay specific attention to the need to improve the situation of the most 
vulnerable segments of society; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses</i> that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the 
right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated 
response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional 
efforts by providing the necessary assistance for increasing food production, particularly 
through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop 
rehabilitation assistance and food aid, with a special focus on the gender-sensitive 
dimension;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Calls upon </i>States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, 
paragraph 2 thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Calls upon </i>States, individually and through international cooperation and 
assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all 
necessary measures to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human 
rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative 
impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free 
from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Stresses </i>that improving access to productive resources and investment in 
rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 
developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-
scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to 
droughts; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Recognizes </i>that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural 
areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, and that these people are </p>


<p>GE.10-12333 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the 
fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an 
increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural 
policies are important tools to achieve food security and rural development; and that 
support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is a key 
element to food security and provision of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 
national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land 
degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to 
the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those countries experiencing serious 
drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Recalls </i>the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and 
challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take 
special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and 
malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Requests </i>all States and private actors, as well as international organizations 
within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the 
effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in 
different fields;  
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Encourages </i>all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a 
human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security;  
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Recognizes </i>the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, 
towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop 
national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of 
hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food;  
 21. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt 
relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable 
food security policies; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in 
order to enhance the contribution development cooperation and food aid to the realization 
of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views of all 
stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Stresses </i>that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries;  
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Recalls </i>the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty;  
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Recognizes </i>that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while 
recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States, international 
financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-12333 
</p>
<p>funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 
2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from hunger, as stated in 
Millennium Development Goal 1, as well as the right to food, as set out in the Rome 
Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Reaffirms </i>that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all 
people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their 
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive 
effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Urges </i>States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 28. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of international cooperation and development 
assistance, as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of 
agriculture and its environmental sustainability and to the provision of humanitarian food 
assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to 
food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country 
has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and 
strategies in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 29. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive 
impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the 
implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the 
fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on 
the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 30. <i>Encourages</i> developing countries to establish regional arrangements with the 
support of the international community and development partners to ensure adequate food 
production and thereby contribute to ensuring food security, in particular in developing 
countries and in those countries that have scarce fertile land; 
</p>
<p> 31. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution 
of the private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of 
ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; 
</p>
<p> 32. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue his collaboration with 
relevant International Organizations and United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, 
in particular the Rome-based ones, including the United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food 
Programme, in order to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further 
within these organizations, in accordance with their respective mandates, including for the 
advancement of smallholders and agricultural workers in both developing and least 
developed countries; 
</p>
<p> 33. <i>Recognizes </i>the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to adequate 
food of insufficient purchasing power and of increased volatility of prices of agricultural 
commodities on the international markets, particularly on people in developing countries 
and on net food-importing countries; 
</p>
<p> 34. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur, within his existing mandate, to explore, 
in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders, ways and means of raising 
the capacity of countries, particularly developing countries, including least developed and </p>


<p>GE.10-12333 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>net food-importing developing countries, to ensure the realization and protection of the 
right to adequate food for their populations, and to report on his findings to the Council; 
</p>
<p> 35. <i>Takes note with appreciation </i>of the report of the Special Rapporteur 
(A/HRC/13/33) and of the addendum thereto on large-scale land acquisitions and leases: a 
set of minimum principles and measures to address the human rights challenge 
(A/HRC/13/33/Add.2);   36. <i>Decides </i>to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, for a period of 
three years, to continue to work in accordance with the mandate established by the Council 
in its resolution 6/2 of 27 September 2007<i>; 
</i></p>
<p> 37. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur, as part of his mandate, to continue to 
monitor the evolution of the world food crisis and, in the context of his regular reports, to 
maintain the Council informed of the impact of the crisis on the enjoyment of the right to 
food and to alert it to possible further actions in this regard;  
</p>
<p> 38. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to continue to provide all the necessary human and financial resources 
for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 39. <i>Welcomes </i>the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general comment 
No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the 
right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and 
is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill 
of Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of 
appropriate economic, environmental and social policies at both the national and 
international levels, oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human 
rights for all; 
</p>
<p> 40. <i>Recalls </i>general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right to 
water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant), in which the Committee noted, inter alia, the 
importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture 
in the realization of the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 41. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization 
of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security represent a practical 
tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, contribute to the achievement of 
food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the attainment of internationally 
agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 42. <i>Acknowledges </i>the work being carried out by the Advisory Committee on the 
right to food and, in that regard, welcomes its submission to the Council of the preliminary 
study on discrimination in the context of the right to food, including an identification of 
good practices of anti-discriminatory policies and strategies (A/HRC/13/32);  
 43. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to collect the views and 
comments of all Member States, all relevant United Nations special agencies and 
programmes and all other relevant stakeholders on the good practices of anti-discriminatory 
policies and strategies set out in the preliminary study, so that the Advisory Committee take 
them into account for the conclusion of the study; 
</p>
<p> 44. <i>Requests </i>the Advisory Committee to continue to work on the issue of 
discrimination in the context of the right to food and, in that regard, to undertake a 
preliminary study on ways and means to further advance the rights of people working in 
rural areas, including women, in particular smallholders engaged in the production of food </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-12333 
</p>
<p>and/or other agricultural products, including from directly working the land, traditional 
fishing, hunting and herding activities, and to report thereon to the Council at its sixteenth 
session; 
</p>
<p> 45. <i>Welcomes </i>the continued cooperation of the High Commissioner, the 
Advisory Committee and the Special Rapporteur, and encourages them to continue their 
cooperation; 
</p>
<p> 46. <i>Calls upon </i>all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special 
Rapporteur in his task to supply all necessary information requested by him and to give 
serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the Special Rapporteur to 
visit their countries to enable him to fulfil his mandate more effectively;  
</p>
<p> 47. <i>Recalls </i>the requests made by the General Assembly, in its resolution 64/159, 
that the Special Rapporteur submit to the Assembly an interim report at its sixty-fifth 
session on the implementation of that resolution and to continue his work, including by 
examining the emerging issues with regard to the realization of the right to food within his 
existing mandate; 
</p>
<p> 48. <i>Invites </i>Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes, treaty bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental 
organizations, as well as the private sector, to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur 
in the fulfilment of his mandate through, inter alia, the submission of comments and 
suggestions on ways and means of realizing the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 49. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of 
the present resolution to the Council at its sixteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 50. <i>Decides </i>to continue consideration of this matter under the same agenda item
