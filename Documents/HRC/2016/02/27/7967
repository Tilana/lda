<p>Alleged arrest warrants related to human rights work. According 
to the information received, Mr. Julfikar Ali is a District Human 
Rights Monitor in the NGO MASUM. On 2 January 2011, a 
police officer from Raninagar Police Station allegedly came to 
Mr. Ali&#8216;s house, informing his family that he should immediately 
surrender related to an incident which reportedly took place on 11 
January 2008, at the Kaharpara Border Security Force (BSF) 
outpost. Mr. Ali was reportedly not in the vicinity of the outpost 
that night. On 11 February, Mr. Ali went to the District Court to 
surrender, in order to settle the issue, and to be able to continue 
his work. The District Court granted anticipatory bail. On 14 
February, the District Court granted another anticipatory bail to 
Mr. Ali in relation to another complaint. In this case, Mr. Ali&#8216;s 
name reportedly did not appear in the complaint filed by the BSF. 
Mr. Ali was the subject of an earlier communication (see 
A/HRC/10/12/Add.1, para 1196).
