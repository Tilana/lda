Registration Statement and the most recent Preliminary Prospectus.
17
(k)                                           In respect of any statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto used by the Company or any Underwriter, as the case may be, made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Selling Stockholder specifically for use in connection with the
preparation thereof, such Selling Stockholder hereby makes the same representations and warranties to each
Underwriter as the Company makes to such Underwriter under Sections (1)(f), (g), (h) and (i); it being understood and
agreed that the foregoing applies only to such information furnished by such Selling Stockholder to the Company,
which consists of (A) the legal name, address and the number of shares of Common Stock owned by such Selling
Stockholder, and (B) the other information with respect to such Selling Stockholder (excluding percentages) which
appear in the table (and corresponding footnotes) under the caption “Principal and Selling Stockholders”  (collectively,
the “Selling Stockholder Information”).
(l)                                               Such Selling Stockholder is not prompted to sell shares of Stock by any information
concerning the Company that is not set forth in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the
Prospectus.
(m)                                       Except as disclosed in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus, the Selling Stockholder has
not taken, directly or indirectly, any action that is designed to or that has constituted or that could reasonably be
expected to cause or result in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company in
connection with the offering of the shares of the Stock.
Any certificate signed by any officer of such Selling Stockholder and delivered to the Representatives or counsel for
the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Stock shall be deemed a representation and warranty by such
Selling Stockholder, as to matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter.
3.                                      Purchase of the Stock by the Underwriters.  On the basis of the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement, the Company agrees to sell
5,000,000 shares of the Firm Stock and each Selling Stockholder agrees to sell the number of shares of the Firm
Stock set forth opposite its name in Schedule II hereto, severally and not jointly, to the several Underwriters, and
each of the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase the number of shares of the Firm Stock set
forth opposite that Underwriter’s name in Schedule I hereto.  Each Underwriter shall be obligated to purchase from the
Company and from each Selling Stockholder, that number of shares of the Firm Stock that represents the same
proportion of the number of shares of the Firm Stock to be sold by the Company and by each Selling Stockholder as
the number of shares of the Firm Stock set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I represents to
the total number of shares of the Firm Stock to be purchased by all of the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement. 
The respective purchase obligations of the Underwriters with respect to the Firm Stock shall be rounded among the
Underwriters to avoid fractional shares, as the Representatives may determine.
18
In addition, the Company grants to the Underwriters an option to purchase up to 750,000 additional shares of Option
Stock and each Option Stock Selling Stockholder grants to the Underwriters an option to purchase up to the number
of shares of Option Stock set forth opposite such Selling Stockholder’s name in Schedule II hereto, severally and not
jointly. Such options are exercisable in the event that the Underwriters sell more shares of Common Stock than the
number of shares of Firm Stock in the offering and as set forth in Section 5 hereof.  Any such election to purchase
Option Stock shall be made in proportion to the maximum number of shares of Option Stock to be sold by each
Selling Shareholder as set forth in Schedule II hereto.  Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase
the number of shares of Option Stock (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional shares as the
Representatives may determine) that bears the same proportion to the total number of shares of Option Stock to be
sold on such Delivery Date as the number of shares of Firm Stock set forth in Schedule I hereto opposite the name of
such Underwriter bears to the total number of shares of Firm Stock.
The purchase price payable by the Underwriters for both the Firm Stock and any Option Stock is $[ · ] per share, less,
in the case of the Option Shares, an amount per share equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the
Company on its Common Stock and payable on the Firm Stock but not on the Option Stock.
Neither the Company nor the Selling Stockholders shall be obligated to deliver any of the Firm Stock or Option Stock
to be delivered on the applicable Delivery Date, except upon payment for all such Stock to be purchased on such
Delivery Date as provided herein.
4.                                      Offering of Stock by the Underwriters.  Upon authorization by the Representatives of the release
of the Firm Stock, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Stock for sale upon the terms and conditions to
be set forth in the Prospectus.
5.                                      Delivery of and Payment for the Stock.  Delivery of and payment for the Firm Stock shall be
made at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the third full business day following the date of this Agreement or at such
other date or place as shall be determined by agreement between the Representatives and the Company.  This date

The options granted in Section 3 will expire 30 days after the date of this Agreement and may be exercised in whole

which the options are being exercised, the names in which the shares of Option Stock are to be registered, the
denominations in which the shares of Option Stock are to be issued and the date and time, as determined by the
Representatives, when the shares of Option Stock are to be delivered; provided, however, that this date and time
shall not be earlier than the Initial Delivery Date nor earlier than the second business day after the date on which the
options shall have been exercised nor later than the fifth business day after the date on which the options shall have
been exercised unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and the Representatives.  Each date and time the
shares of Option Stock are delivered is sometimes referred to as an “Option Stock Delivery Date,” and the Initial
Delivery Date and any Option Stock Delivery Date are sometimes each referred to as a “Delivery Date.”

relating thereto and if at such time any events shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then
amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made
when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary to amend or
supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act, to notify the Representatives and, upon their
request, to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in

Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary to amend or supplement any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus, to notify the Representatives and, upon their request, to file such document and to prepare and furnish
without charge to each Underwriter as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request

Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is,
individually or in the aggregate, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Stock being delivered on such
Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
(m)                             Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any of
the following:  (i) (A) trading in securities generally on any securities exchange that has registered with the
Commission under Section 6 of the Exchange Act (including the New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global
Select Market, The NASDAQ Global Market or The NASDAQ Capital Market), or (B) trading in any securities of the
Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market, shall have been suspended or materially limited or the
settlement of such trading generally shall have been materially disrupted or minimum prices shall have been
established on any such exchange or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by any other regulatory
body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall
have been declared by federal or state authorities, (iii) the United States shall have become engaged in hostilities,
there shall have been an escalation in hostilities involving the United States or there shall have been a declaration of
a national emergency or war by the United States, or (iv) there shall have occurred such a material adverse change in
general economic, political or financial conditions, including, without limitation, as a result of terrorist activities after
the date hereof (or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such),
as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering
or delivery of the Stock being delivered on such Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the
Prospectus.
(n)                                 The New York Stock Exchange shall have approved the Stock for inclusion, subject only to
official notice of issuance.
29
(o)                                 The Lock-Up Agreements between the Representatives and the officers, directors and
stockholders of the Company set forth on Schedule III, delivered to the Representatives on or before the date of this
Agreement, shall be in full force and effect on such Delivery Date.
(p)                                 On or prior to each Delivery Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters such
further certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for
the Underwriters.
10.                               Indemnification and Contribution.
(a)                                 The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates,
directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or
liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability
or action relating to purchases and sales of Stock), to which that Underwriter, affiliate, director, officer, employee or
controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in (A) any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any amendment or
supplement thereto, (B) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, (C) any
Permitted Issuer Information used or referred to in any “free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) used or referred to by any Underwriter, (D) any materials or information provided to investors by, or
with the approval of, the Company in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Stock, including any “road
show” (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) not constituting an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any
Written Testing-the-Waters Communication (“Marketing Materials”), or (E) any Blue Sky application or other
document prepared or executed by the Company (or based upon any written information furnished by the Company for
use therein) specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Stock under the securities laws of any state or
other jurisdiction (any such application, document or information being hereinafter called a “Blue Sky Application”) or
(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Permitted
Issuer Information, any Marketing Materials or any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each
such affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, affiliate,
30
director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend
against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action
arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus
or in any such amendment or supplement thereto or in any Permitted Issuer Information, any Marketing Materials or
any Blue Sky Application, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter
furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion
therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 10(f).  The foregoing indemnity
agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any affiliate,
director, officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter.
(b)                                 Each of the Selling Stockholders, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any
Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and
against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited
to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Stock), to which that Underwriter,
affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Permitted
Issuer Information, any Marketing Materials, any Blue Sky Application or any “free writing prospectus” (as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (any such “free writing prospectus” that was prepared by or on behalf of the Selling
Stockholder or used or referred to by the Selling Stockholder in connection with the offering of the Stock in violation of
Section 7(c) being referred to as a “Selling Stockholder Free Writing Prospectus”), or (ii) the omission or alleged
omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Permitted Issuer Information, any Marketing
Materials, any Blue Sky Application or any Selling Stockholder Free Writing Prospectus, any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse each Underwriter,
its affiliates, directors, officers and employees and each such controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, its affiliate, directors, officers and employees or controlling
persons in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action as such expenses are incurred, but in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Preliminary
Prospectus, Registration Statement, the
31
Prospectus, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the amendment or supplement, the Permitted Issuer Information, the
Marketing Materials, the Blue Sky Application or the Selling Stockholder Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Selling Stockholder expressly for use
therein.  The aggregate liability of each Selling Stockholder under this Section 10(b) and Section 10(e) or any claim for
breach of representations and warranties of the Selling Stockholder contained in Section 2 shall be limited to the net
proceeds, after underwriting discounts but before deducting expenses received by the Selling Stockholders, received
by the Selling Stockholder from the Shares sold by such Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement, as set forth
in the Prospectus.
(c)                                  Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each
Selling Stockholder, their respective directors, officers, employees, and each person, if any, who controls the
Company or such Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof,
to which the Company, such Selling Stockholder or any such director, officer or controlling person may become
subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or
is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary
Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or
supplement thereto or in any Marketing Materials or Blue Sky Application, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to
state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus
or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Marketing Materials or Blue Sky Application, any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the
extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the
Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, which information is limited to the
information set forth in Section 10(f).  The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any
Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company, such Selling Stockholder or any such director, officer, employee or
controlling person.
(d)                           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
indemnifying party under this Section 10, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of
that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have under this Section 10 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture
of substantive rights and defenses) by such failure and, provided, further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this
Section 10.  If any such claim or action shall be brought against an
32
indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  After notice from the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that the indemnified party shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly
the indemnified party and those other indemnified parties and their respective directors, officers, employees and
controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought under this Section 10 if (i) the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have so mutually agreed;
(ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party and its directors, officers, employees and controlling persons shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those
available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the indemnified parties or their respective directors, officers, employees or controlling persons, on the
one hand, and the indemnifying party, on the other hand, and representation of both sets of parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, and in any such event the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party.  No indemnifying party shall
(x) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action,
suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
such indemnified party, from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include a
statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or
(y) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment for the
plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from
and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if
at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for
fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 10(a) or (b) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it
shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is
entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such
indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request or disputed in
33
good faith the indemnified party’s entitlement to such reimbursement prior to the date of such settlement.
(e)                                  If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 shall for any reason be unavailable to or
insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 10(a), 10(b) or 10(c) in respect of any loss, claim,
damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of
such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the
Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Stock, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not
permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in
clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the
Underwriters, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or
liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits
received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with
respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of
the Stock purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling
Stockholders, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus, on the one hand, and the total
underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the shares of the Stock
purchased under this Agreement, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus, on the other hand. 
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling
Stockholders or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the
Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 10(e) were to be
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein.  The amount paid
or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof,
referred to above in this Section 10(e) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 10(e), any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(e), in no event shall (x) an Underwriter be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions
received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Stock exceeds the amount of any damages that such
Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission or (y) a Selling Stockholder be required to contribute any
34
amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds (exclusive of expenses) received by the Selling
Stockholder from the Shares sold by such Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (as set forth in the
Prospectus) exceeds any damages which such Selling Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Selling
Stockholders under Section 10(b) and 10(e) and for any claim for any claim for breach of representations and
warranties of the Selling Stockholders contained in Section 2 exceed the limit set forth in Section 10(e).  No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters’ obligations
to contribute as provided in this Section 10(e) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and
not joint.
(f)                                   The Underwriters severally confirm that the statements regarding delivery of shares by the
Underwriters set forth on the cover page of, and the concession and reallowance figures and the paragraph relating to
stabilization by the Underwriters appearing under the caption “Underwriting” in, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus
and the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing
to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement
thereto or in any Marketing Materials.
11.                               Defaulting Underwriters.
(a)                                 If, on any Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in its obligations to purchase the Stock that it
has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion
arrange for the purchase of such Stock by the non-defaulting Underwriters or other persons satisfactory to the
Company on the terms contained in this Agreement.  If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the
non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Stock, then the Company shall be entitled to a
further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to
purchase such Stock on such terms.  In the event that within the respective prescribed periods, the non-defaulting
Underwriters notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Stock, or the Company notifies
the non-defaulting Underwriters that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Stock, either the non-defaulting
Underwriters or the Company may postpone such Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect
any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to
promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any such other
document or arrangement that effects any such changes.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Underwriter” includes,
for all purposes of
35
this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule I hereto that, pursuant to this
Section 11, purchases Stock that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b)                                 If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Stock of a defaulting Underwriter
or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the total
number of shares of the Stock that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the total number of shares
of all the Stock, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the total
number of shares of Stock that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter’s pro rata share
(based on the total number of shares of Stock that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Stock of
such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; provided that the non-
defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the total number of shares of Stock that
it agreed to purchase on such Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 3.
(c)                                  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Stock of a defaulting
Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above,
the total number of shares of Stock that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the total number of shares of
all the Stock, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement
shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters.  Any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will
continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Sections 8 and 13 and except that the provisions of
Section 10 shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d)                                 Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the
Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
12.                               Termination.  The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the
Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders prior to delivery of and
payment for the Firm Stock if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 9(l) and 9(m) shall have
occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Stock for any reason permitted under this Agreement.
13.                               Reimbursement of Underwriters’ Expenses.  If (a) the Company or any Selling Stockholder shall
fail to tender the Stock for delivery to the Underwriters for any reason, or (b) the Underwriters shall decline to purchase
the Stock for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company and the Selling Stockholders will reimburse
the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Underwriters) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Stock,
and upon demand the Company and the Selling Stockholders shall pay the
36
full amount thereof to the Representatives.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11 by reason of the
default of one or more Underwriters or the purchase of the Stock is not consummated as a result of the occurrence of
any of the events described in Section 9(m) (other than the occurrence of an event described in Section 9(m)(i)(B)),
neither the Company nor any Selling Stockholder shall be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on
account of those expenses.
14.                               Research Analyst Independence.  The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters’ research
analysts and research departments are required to be independent from their respective investment banking divisions
and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that such Underwriters’ research analysts may hold
views and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the
Company and/or the offering that differ from the views of their respective investment banking divisions.  The
Company and the Selling Stockholders hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims
that the Company or the Selling Stockholders may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of
interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research
departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company or the
Selling Stockholders by such Underwriters’ investment banking divisions.  The Company and the Selling Stockholders
acknowledge that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to
applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long
or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies that may be the subject of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
15.                               No Fiduciary Duty.  Each of the Company and the Selling Stockholders acknowledges and agrees
that in connection with this offering, sale of the Stock or any other services the Underwriters may be deemed to be
providing hereunder, notwithstanding any preexisting relationship, advisory or otherwise, between the parties or any
oral representations or assurances previously or subsequently made by any Underwriter:  (a) no fiduciary or agency
relationship between the Company, the Selling Stockholders and any other person, on the one hand, and any
Underwriter, on the other, exists; (b) no Underwriter is acting as advisor, expert or otherwise, to the Company or the
Selling Stockholders, including, without limitation, with respect to the determination of the public offering price of the
Stock, and such relationship between the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and any
Underwriter, on the other, is entirely and solely commercial, based on arms-length negotiations; (c) any duties and
obligations that any Underwriter may have to the Company or Selling Stockholders shall be limited to those duties and
obligations specifically stated herein; and (d) each Underwriter and its respective affiliates may have interests that
differ from those of the Company and the Selling Stockholders.  The Company and the Selling Stockholders hereby
waive any claims that the Company or the Selling Stockholders may have against the Underwriters with respect to
any breach of fiduciary duty in connection with this offering.
16.                               Notices, etc.  All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and:
37
(a)         if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to Barclays Capital Inc., 745
Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Registration (Fax: (646) 834-8133), with a copy, in

Stockholder at the address set forth on Schedule II hereto.
Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof.  The Company
and the Selling Stockholders shall be entitled to act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement given or
made on behalf of the Underwriters by Barclays Capital Inc. and the Company and the Underwriters shall be entitled to
act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement given or made on behalf of the Selling Stockholders by
the Custodian.
17.                               Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Stockholders and their respective personal
representatives and successors.  This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only
those persons, except that (a) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company and the
Selling Stockholders contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the directors, officers
and employees of the Underwriters and each person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and (b) the indemnity agreement of the Underwriters contained in
Section 10(c) of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of the directors, officers and employees of the
Company or any Selling Stockholder, and any person controlling the Company or a Selling Stockholder within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act.  Nothing in this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to in this Section 17, any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.
18.                               Survival.  The respective indemnities, rights, contribution, representations, warranties and
agreements of the Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by
or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Stock
and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any

BARCLAYS CAPITAL INC.
[ · ]
As Representatives of the several
Underwriters named in Schedule I,
c/o Barclays Capital Inc.
745 Seventh Avenue
New York, New York 10019
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The undersigned understands that you and certain other firms (the “Underwriters”) propose to enter into an
Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) providing for the purchase by the Underwriters of shares
(the “Stock”) of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), of RSP Permian, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”), and that the Underwriters propose to reoffer the Stock to the public (the “Offering”).
In consideration of the execution of the Underwriting Agreement by the Underwriters, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the undersigned hereby irrevocably agrees that, without the prior written consent of Barclays Capital
Inc., on behalf of the Underwriters, the undersigned will not, directly or indirectly, (1) offer for sale, sell, pledge, or
otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the
disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation,
shares of Common Stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and shares of Common Stock that may be issued
upon exercise of any options or warrants) or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common
Stock (other than the Stock to be sold in the Offering), (2) enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of shares of Common
Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common
Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise, (3) make any demand for or exercise any right or cause to be filed a
registration statement, including any amendments thereto, with respect to the registration of any shares of Common
Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or any other securities of the
Company, or (4) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing for a period commencing on the date hereof
and ending on the 60th day after the date of the final prospectus relating to the Offering (such 60-day period, the
“Lock-Up Period”).
Exhibit A-1
The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to (a) transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities
acquired in the open market after the completion of the Offering, (b) bona fide gifts, sales or other dispositions of
shares of any class of the Company’s capital stock, in each case that are made exclusively between and among the
undersigned or members of the undersigned’s family, or affiliates of the undersigned, including its partners (if a
partnership) or members (if a limited liability company), or to a trust the beneficiaries of which are the undersigned or
members of the undersigned’s family; provided that it shall be a condition to any transfer pursuant to this clause
(b) that (i) the transferee/donee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Lock-Up Letter Agreement (including, without
limitation, the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence) to the same extent as if the transferee/donee were a
party hereto, (ii) each party (donor, donee, transferor or transferee) shall not be required by law (including without
limitation the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act”), and the
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) to make, and shall agree to not voluntarily make, any filing
or public announcement of the transfer or disposition prior to the expiration of the 60-day period referred to above, and
(iii) the undersigned notifies Barclays Capital Inc. at least two business days prior to the proposed transfer or
disposition, (c) the exercise of warrants or the exercise of stock options granted pursuant to the Company’s stock
option/incentive plans or otherwise outstanding on the date hereof; provided, that the restrictions shall apply to shares
of Common Stock issued upon such exercise or conversion, (d) the establishment of any contract, instruction or plan
that satisfies all of the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 (a “Rule 10b5-1 Plan”) under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that no sales of Common Stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Common
Stock, shall be made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan prior to the expiration of the Lock-Up Period (as the same may
be extended pursuant to the provisions hereof); provided further, that the Company is not required to report the
establishment of such Rule 10b5-1 Plan in any public report or filing with the Commission under the Exchange Act
during the lock-up period and does not otherwise voluntarily effect any such public filing or report regarding such
Rule 10b5-1 Plan, and (e) any demands or requests for, exercise any right with respect to, or take any action in
preparation of, the registration by the Company under the Act of the undersigned’s shares of Common Stock, provided
that no transfer of the undersigned’s shares of Common Stock registered pursuant to the exercise of any such right
and no registration statement shall be filed under the Act with respect to any of the undersigned’s shares of Common
Stock during the Lock-Up Period.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and its transfer agent are hereby authorized to decline to make any
transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Lock-Up Letter Agreement.
It is understood that, if the Company notifies the Underwriters that it does not intend to proceed with the Offering, if
the Underwriters notify the Company that they do not intend to proceed with the Offering, if the Underwriting
Agreement does not become effective, or if the Underwriting Agreement (other than the provisions thereof which
survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to payment for and
Exhibit A-2
delivery of the Stock, the undersigned will be released from its obligations under this Lock-Up Letter Agreement.
The undersigned understands that the Company and the Underwriters will proceed with the Offering in reliance on this
Lock-Up Letter Agreement.
Whether or not the Offering actually occurs depends on a number of factors, including market conditions.  Any
Offering will only be made pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, the terms of which are subject to negotiation
between the Company the Selling Stockholders named therein and the Underwriters.
This Lock-Up Letter Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur, if any, of (1) the termination
of the Underwriting Agreement before the sale of any Stock to the Underwriters or (2) 60 days, in the event that the
Underwriting Agreement has not been executed by that date.
[Signature page follows]
Exhibit A-3
The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to enter into this
Lock-Up Letter Agreement and that, upon request, the undersigned will execute any additional documents necessary
in connection with the enforcement hereof.  Any obligations of the undersigned shall be binding upon the heirs,
personal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned.
