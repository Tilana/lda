6.      
Law

According to section 291 (1) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009; A person commits a summary offence if he or she dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the property.

The offence of theft carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.

Tariff

Tariff for the offence of theftwas discussed in several cases. It was held in Tikoitoga v State (2008, FJHC 44, HAM 088 2007) The Tariff for larceny is 18 months to 2 years. Learned Judge Daniel Gounder held in State v Vatunalaba (2010, FJHC 99; HAC 134.2008) that the tariff for theft offences arising from breach of trust range from 18 months to 3 years imprisonment. Suspended sentences are reserved for cases where the offenders have shown remorse or the value of the property is small. In Waisale Vakarauvanua v State (2002) FJHC 116; HAA 51J.2004S the Court accepted between 2 to 9 months as tariff for simple theftand in in State vs Chaudhry HAC 69 of 2007 as 2 to 12 months imprisonment.

In the case of Niudamu HAA28.2011the Justice Paul K. Madigan held that the tariff for theftby a first offender should be between two to nine months.

Shameem J. in Jone Saukilagi HAC21. 2004 are most helpful. Her Ladyship said this:

"the tariff for simple larceny on a first conviction is from two to nine months and on a second conviction a sentence in excess of nine months. In cases of larceny of large amounts of money sentences of 18 months to three years have been upheld by the High Court. (Sevanaia Via Koroi HAA31.2001). Much depends on the value of the money stolen and the nature of the victim and defendant. The method of stealing is also relevant."

7.      
Sentence

In sentencing you the Court acknowledges the factors:

i.      
Pleaded Guilty at the first available opportunity to save the Court's time and Prosecution's time in calling witnesses for a full trial.
ii.     
Previous good character.
iii.    
Remorseful 

In Sentencing the Accused, I note that the stolen 2 x [600mm x 120cm] Brass Metal Sheets valued at $3,000.00 not recovered and willing to compensate the $3000.00 that you stole but to pay in instalments. 
Now, I do consider whether your "intention" of restitution can consider as a mitigating factor in your favour. Your mitigation submission states you are willing to fully compensate the complainant. I note that the said offence committed in April 2012 but until to date you did not take any measures to restitution the complainant apart from expressing your intention to reinstitute. However, Restitution can be considered if it is made as a measure of true remorse, but not to buy the offender's way out of prison. (The State v Simeti Cakau HAA 125 of 2004S, Shameem J). In this case the mere intention to pay the amount obtained by an accused cannot be considered as remorse. Hussein v State [2012] FJHC 1085; HAA006.2012 (16 May 2012, Fernando J) 

In sentencing you I note that there are no special aggravating factors as your actions constitute the elements of the offence. But lack of restitution can be considered as an aggravating factor. [Thoman v State [2011] FJHC471;HAA022.2011(17 August 2011).

Upon considering the general principle of sentencing and objectives of sentencing under Section 15 (3), 4 (1) and 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, I now consider appropriate sentences on you.

The intention of sentencing you for the offence of theft in pursuant of section 4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstance, to protect the community from offenders in this nature, to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature, more importantly to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences.

Upon considering above mentioned legal precedents on Tariff for the offence of Theft, I select 18 months as a starting point for your sentence. 

In considering your early guilty plea in the first available opportunity I reduce 06 months In view of aforementioned aggravating factor I increase 03 months, to reach the period of 15 months and I further reduce 03 months for the mitigating factors. For your previous good character I furthermore reduce 04 months to reach the period of 08 months. 

Accordingly, I sentence you 08 months imprisonment period for the offence of theft contrary to section 291(1) of Crime Decree No 44 of 2009. 

I note that you are a first offender and I am of the view of that you should not be sentence to imprisonment and given an opportunity to reform. Therefore the imprisonment period and suspend it for 03 years.

If you commit any crime during the period of 3 years and found guilty by the court you are liable to be charge and prosecute for an offence in pursuant to section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

In addition I order that the, recovered item which is in police custody is to be returned to the owner.

28 days to appeal
