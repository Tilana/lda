NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
CORPORATE INFORMATION
NOTE 1: 
 
The  financial  report  of  Legend  Mining  Limited  (the  Company)  for  the  half-year  ended  30  June  2016  was 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 30 August 2016. 
 
Legend  Mining  Limited  is  a  company  incorporated  and  domiciled  in  Australia  whose  shares  are  publicly 
traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. 
 
The  nature  of  the  operations  and  principal  activities  of  the  Group  are  exploration  for  nickel  and  copper, 
deposits in Australia. 
 
NOTE 2:
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  half-year  financial  report  does  not  include  all  notes  of  the  type  normally  included  within  the  annual 
financial  report  and  therefore  cannot  be  expected  to  provide  as  full  an  understanding  of  the  financial 
performance,  financial  position  and  financing  and  investing  activities  of  the  consolidated  entity  as  the  full 
financial report. 
 
The  half-year  financial  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Annual  Financial  Report  of  Legend 
Mining Limited for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
 
It  is  also  recommended  that  the  half-year  financial  report  be  considered  together  with  any  public 
announcements  made  by  Legend  Mining  Limited  and  its  controlled  entities  during  the  half-year  ended  30 
June  2016  in  accordance  with  the  continuance  disclosure  obligations  arising  under  the  Corporations  Act 
2001. 
 
(a)  Basis of preparation 
 
The half-year financial report is  a general-purpose condensed financial report,  which has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting.  
The  half-year  financial  report  has  been  prepared  on  a  historical  cost  basis  except  for  certain  financial 
instruments, which have been measured at fair value. 
 
The half-year financial report is presented in Australian dollars and all values are expressed as whole dollars. 
 
For  the  purpose  of  preparing  the  half-year  financial  report,  the  half-year  has  been  treated  as  a  discreet 
reporting period. 
 
(b)  Adoption of new and revised Accounting Standards
The Company has adopted all new and revised Australian Accounting Standards issued by the AASB which 
are mandatory to apply to the current period as listed below: 
 

AASB  2014-3  Amendments  to  Australian  Accounting  Standards  –  Accounting  for  Acquisitions  of 
Interests in Joint Operations [AASB 1 & AASB 11];

AASB 2014-4 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (Amendments to 
AASB 116 and AASB 138);

Financial Statements;

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)


AASB 2015-2 Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to AASB 101; and
AASB 2015-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Withdrawal of AASB 
1031 Materiality.
Significant accounting policies
These standards have introduced new disclosures for the interim report but did not have a material effect on 
the entity’s accounting policies or on any of the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 
 
The Group has not elected to early adopt any other new Standards or amendments that are issued but not 
yet effective. 
 
(c) 
 
The half-year financial report has been prepared using the same accounting policies as used in the annual 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
 
(d)  Estimates 
 
The  preparation of  the  half-year  financial  report  requires  management  to make judgements,  estimates  and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.

As  the  Group  has  made  a  loss  for  the  half-year  ended  30  June  2016,  all  options  on  issue  are 
considered  antidilutive  and  have  not  been  included  in  the  calculation  of  diluted  earnings  per  share. 
These options could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
NOTE 5: 
 
AASB  8  requires  operating  segments  to  be  identified  on  the  basis  of  internal  reports  that  are  used  by  the 
chief  operating  decision  maker  (“CODM”)  in  order  to  allocate  resources  to  the  segment  and  to  assess  its 
performance. The CODM of the Group is the Board of Directors. 
 
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are provided to the CODM 
on  a  regular  basis.  The  Group  has  one  reportable  segment  being  exploration  and  evaluation  activities  in 
Australia.

The  expenditure  written-off  during  the  current  period  of  $462,119  related  to  tenements  E28/2342, 
E28/2408  and  E28/2415  that  were  surrendered  or  withdrawn  from  during  the  period.  The  carrying 
value  of exploration and evaluation assets of the  affected tenements was  written-off to nil due to the 
loss of tenure. 
The  future  recoverability  of  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is  dependent  on  a 
number  of  factors,  including  whether  the  Group  decides  to  exploit  the  related  lease  itself  or,  if  not, 
whether it successfully recovers the related exploration and evaluation asset through sale.

To the members of Legend Mining Limited
Report on the half-year financial report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Legend Mining Limited, which comprises
the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement
of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting
policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity
comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the half-year end or from time to time during the
half-year.
Directors’ responsibility for the half-year financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the
basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the
financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair view
of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its performance for the half-year
ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and
the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Legend Mining Limited and the entities it controlled
during the half-year, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the
audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001. We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the Directors’ Report.

Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us believe
that the half-year financial report of Legend Mining Limited is not in accordance with the Corporations Act
2001, including:
a)
b)
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of
its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations
Regulations 2001.
