<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur, in chapter I of the present report, lists his key activities 
from 1 August to 15 December 2009. The main report, contained in chapter II, highlights 
several concerns of the Special Rapporteur regarding the protection of the right to privacy 
in the fight against terrorism. The importance of the right to privacy and data protection is 
highlighted in section A.  
</p>
<p> Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is flexible 
enough to enable necessary, legitimate and proportionate restrictions to the right to privacy. 
The Special Rapporteur argues, in section B, that article 17 should be interpreted as 
containing elements of a permissible limitations test. In this context, he calls upon States to 
justify why a particular aim is legitimate justification for restrictions upon article 17, and 
upon the Human Rights Committee to adopt a new general comment on article 17. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur highlights the erosion of the right to privacy in the fight 
against terrorism in section C. This erosion takes place through the use of surveillance 
powers and new technologies, which are used without adequate legal safeguards. States 
have endangered the protection of the right to privacy by not extending pre-existing 
safeguards in their cooperation with third countries and private actors. These measures have 
not only led to violations of the right to privacy, but also have an impact on due process 
rights and the freedom of movement &#8212; especially at borders &#8212; and can have a chilling 
effect on the freedom of association and the freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p> Without a rigorous set of legal safeguards and a means to measure the necessity, 
proportionality and reasonableness of the interference, States have no guidance on 
minimizing the risks to privacy generated by their new policies. The Special Rapporteur 
has identified, in section D, some of the legal safeguards that have emerged through 
policymaking, jurisprudence, policy reviews and good practice from around the world. 
</p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.09-17804 
</p>
<p> The concluding section makes recommendations to various key actors (domestic 
legislative assemblies, domestic executive powers and the United Nations) in order to 
improve the protection of the right to privacy in the fight against terrorism.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/185 and Human Rights Council 
resolution 10/15. The main report lists the activities of the Special Rapporteur from 1 
August to 15 December 2009 and focuses thematically on the right to privacy as a human 
right in the counter-terrorism context. The addenda contain a communications report 
(A/HRC/13/37/Add.1) and a report on the fact-finding mission to Egypt from 17 to 21 
April 2009 (A/HRC/13/37/Add.<footnote name="2">4
 A/HRC/10/3, para. 30. </footnote>). 
2. Regarding upcoming country visits, the Special Rapporteur hopes to conduct a 
mission to Tunisia prior to presenting this report. The Special Rapporteur has suggested 
dates in late January and early February 2010 and is awaiting a response from the 
Government. The Special Rapporteur also hopes to conduct official visits to Chile and Peru 
in 2010. There are outstanding visit requests for Algeria, Malaysia, Pakistan, the 
Philippines and Thailand.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b>3. On 18 and 19 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur convened an expert group 
meeting at the European University Institute in Florence to discuss thematic issues related 
to his mandate.1 The meeting partly coincided with a public event on the &#8220;Fight against 
Terrorism: Challenges for the Judiciary&#8221;, jointly organized with the Venice Commission 
and the Sub-Committee on Crime Problems of the Council of Europe. The event was co-
funded by the &#197;bo Akademi University Institute for Human Rights, through its project to 
support the mandate of the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>4. On 29 and 30 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur, along with the other mandate 
holders involved, participated in informal consultations in Geneva regarding a global joint 
study on secret detention (A/HRC/13/42). He also met with representatives of the 
Permanent Missions of Egypt and Tunisia in regard to country visits conducted or planned. 
</p>
<p>5. On 2 and 3 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in a Wilton Park 
Conference on &#8220;Terrorism, security and human rights: opportunities for policy change&#8221; and 
was a panellist for the discussion on the role of international organizations in response to 
terrorism and the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. On 4 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur delivered a keynote address on the 
occasion of the inauguration of the academic year at the Faculty of Law at the University of 
the Basque Country (Universidad del Pa&#237;s Vasco) in Bilbao, Spain.  
7. From 12 to 14 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in two events in 
Vienna: the International Workshop of National Counter-Terrorism Focal Points and the 
Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) Retreat. The workshop was jointly 
organized by a number of member States and the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime, in close cooperation with the CTITF Office and the Counter-Terrorism Executive 
Directorate (CTED). It provided a forum to exchange views on how to better link global 
and national counter-terrorism efforts by fostering greater networking among national

<p>counter-terrorism focal points and facilitating their role as interface between national, 
regional and global counter-terrorism efforts. The CTITF retreat focused on ways forward 
to expand and strengthen partnerships between member States, the United Nations system, 
regional and other organizations and civil society in implementing the United Nations 
Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.<footnote name="2">0
 See Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 27 (1999). </footnote> 
</p>
<p>8. On 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur was represented at a seminar in 
Brussels on &#8220;Strengthening the UN Targeted Sanctions through Fair and Clear Procedures&#8221;, 
organized by the Belgian Federal Public Service for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and 
Development Cooperation. 
</p>
<p>9. From 26 to 28 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur was in New York to present to 
the Third Committee of the General Assembly his report,3 which focused on the gender 
impact of counter-terrorism measures. The Special Rapporteur had a formal meeting with 
the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council and met with the 
Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED). The Special Rapporteur 
was a panellist at a side event &#8220;Engendering Counter-Terrorism and National Security&#8221; 
hosted by the Centre for Human Rights and Global Justice of the New York University 
School of Law. He also met with a number of non-governmental organizations and gave a 
press conference. 
</p>
<p>10. On 29 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur met with the Assistant Secretary for 
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and other officials of the United States State 
Department in Washington D.C., to discuss current and future legal developments with the 
new Administration, in follow-up to his visit to the United States of America in 2007,4 and 
more general issues concerning international humanitarian and human rights law in the 
counter-terrorism context.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The right to privacy 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The right to privacy as enshrined in constitutions and international 
human rights treaties 
</b></p>
<p>11. Privacy is a fundamental human right that has been defined as the presumption that 
individuals should have an area of autonomous development, interaction and liberty, a 
&#8220;private sphere&#8221; with or without interaction with others and free from State intervention 
and free from excessive unsolicited intervention by other uninvited individuals.5 The right 
to privacy has evolved along two different paths. Universal human rights instruments have 
focused on the negative dimension of the right to privacy, prohibiting any arbitrary 
interference with a person&#8217;s privacy, family, home or correspondence,6 while some regional 
and domestic instruments have also included a positive dimension: everyone has the right to

</p>
<p>respect for his/her private and family life, his/her home and correspondence,7 or the right to 
have his/her dignity, personal integrity or good reputation recognized and respected.8 While 
privacy is not always directly mentioned as a separate right in constitutions, nearly all 
States recognize its value as a matter of constitutional significance. In some countries, the 
right to privacy emerges by extension of the common law of breach of confidence, the right 
to liberty, freedom of expression or due process. In other countries, the right to privacy 
emerges as a religious value. The right to privacy is therefore not only a fundamental 
human right, but also a human right that supports other human rights and forms the basis of 
any democratic society.  
</p>
<p>12. The State&#8217;s ability to develop record-keeping facilities was enhanced with the 
development of information technology. Enhanced computing power enabled previously 
unimaginable forms of collecting, storing and sharing of personal data. International core 
data protection principles were developed, including the obligation to: obtain personal 
information fairly and lawfully; limit the scope of its use to the originally specified 
purpose; ensure that the processing is adequate, relevant and not excessive; ensure its 
accuracy; keep it secure; delete it when it is no longer required; and grant individuals the 
right to access their information and request corrections.9 The Human Rights Committee 
provided clear indications in its general comment No. 16 that these principles were 
encapsulated by the right to privacy,10 but data protection is also emerging as a distinct 
human or fundamental right. Some countries have recognized data protection even as a 
constitutional right, thereby highlighting its importance as an element of democratic 
societies. The detailed article 35 of the 1976 Constitution of Portugal can be seen as an 
example of best practice here. 
</p>
<p>13. The right to privacy is not an absolute right. Once an individual is being formally 
investigated or screened by a security agency, personal information is shared among 
security agencies for reasons of countering terrorism and the right to privacy is almost 
automatically affected. These are situations where States have a legitimate power to limit 
the right to privacy under international human rights law. However, countering terrorism is 
not a trump card which automatically legitimates any interference with the right to privacy. 
Every instance of interference needs to be subject to critical assessment.

<p>14. Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is the most 
important legally binding treaty provision on the human right to privacy at the universal

<p>GE.09-17804 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Article 4 of the Covenant allows States parties to derogate from some provisions of the 
Covenant, including article 17. Derogations can be made only during a state of emergency 
threatening the life of the nation and they are subject to several conditions.12 During the 
more than 30 years since the entry into force of the Covenant in 1976, fewer than 10 States 
parties have introduced a state of emergency with reference to acts, or the threat of, 
terrorism.13 Four of them have in that context sought to derogate also from article 17 of the 
Covenant.14 Another eight States have announced derogation from article 17 without an 
explicit reference to terrorism as the cause for a state of emergency.15 However, the 
notifications in question have remained rather generic, instead of specifying, in line with 
the requirements under article 4, what concrete measures derogating from article 17 are 
necessary within the exigencies of the situation.16 Overall, there is not a single case of a 
State seeking to derogate from article 17 with reference to terrorism that would demonstrate 
compliance with all requirements of article 4. Further, only one State has announced 
derogation from the Covenant with reference to the current (related to the events of 11 
September 2001) threat of international terrorism.17 The situation is similar in respect of 
reservations to article 17. Although international law generally allows for reservations by 
States to human rights treaties, provided such reservations are not incompatible with the 
object and purpose of the treaty,18 only one State party has submitted a reservation to article 
17.19 
</p>
<p>15. Consequently, it appears that States have only rarely resorted to the acknowledged 
mechanisms available under international law in general, and the Covenant in particular, for 
unilateral exceptions to the right to privacy. Even when notifications of derogation from 
article 17 have been submitted, those notifications have remained generic, instead of 
referring to practical measures and specific forms of derogation. To the Special Rapporteur, 
the State practice reported above demonstrates that, generally, States appear to be content 
that the framework of article 17 is flexible enough to enable necessary, legitimate and 
proportionate restrictions to the right to privacy by means of permissible limitations, 
including when responding to terrorism. The Special Rapporteur supports this view. Article 
17 is written in a manner that allows States parties the possibility to introduce restrictions or 
limitations in respect of the rights enshrined in that provision, including the right to privacy. 
Such restrictions and limitations will therefore be subject to the monitoring functions of the 
Human Rights Committee as the treaty body entrusted with the task of interpreting the 
provisions of the Covenant and addressing the conduct of States parties in respect of their 
treaty obligations. The main mechanisms for the exercise of those functions are the 
mandatory reporting procedure under article 40 of the Covenant and, for those 113 States

</p>
<p>that have ratified the First Optional Protocol to the Covenant, the procedure for individual 
complaints. 
</p>
<p>16. The wording of article 17 of the Covenant prohibits &#8220;arbitrary or unlawful&#8221; 
interference with privacy, family or correspondence, as well as &#8220;unlawful attacks&#8221; on a 
person&#8217;s honour and reputation. This can be contrasted with the formulation of such 
provisions as article 12, paragraph 3; article 18, paragraph 3; article 19, paragraph 3; article 
21 and article 22, paragraph 2, which all spell out the elements of a test for permissible 
limitations. In its most elaborate form, this test is expressed in article 21 and article 22, 
paragraph 3, as consisting of the following three elements: (a) restrictions must be 
prescribed by national law; (b) they must be necessary in a democratic society; and (c) they 
must serve one of the legitimate aims enumerated in each of the provisions that contain a 
limitations clause. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that, despite the differences in wording, 
article 17 of the Covenant should also be interpreted as containing the said elements of a 
permissible limitations test. Restrictions that are not prescribed by law are &#8220;unlawful&#8221; in the 
meaning of article 17, and restrictions that fall short of being necessary or do not serve a 
legitimate aim constitute &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; interference with the rights provided under article 17. 
Consequently, limitations to the right to privacy or other dimensions of article 17 are 
subject to a permissible limitations test, as set forth by the Human Rights Committee in its 
general comment No. 27 (1999). That general comment addresses freedom of movement 
(art. 12), one of the provisions that contains a limitations clause. At the same time, it 
codifies the position of the Human Rights Committee in the matter of permissible 
limitations to the rights provided under the Covenant. The permissible limitations test, as 
expressed in the general comment, includes, inter alia, the following elements:  
</p>
<p> (a) Any restrictions must be provided by the law (paras. 11&#8211;12); 
 (b) The essence of a human right is not subject to restrictions (para. 13);  
 (c) Restrictions must be necessary in a democratic society (para. 11);  
 (d) Any discretion exercised when implementing the restrictions must not be 
unfettered (para. 13);  
 (e) For a restriction to be permissible, it is not enough that it serves one of the 
enumerated legitimate aims; it must be necessary for reaching the legitimate aim (para. 14);  
 (f) Restrictive measures must conform to the principle of proportionality; they 
must be appropriate to achieve their protective function; they must be the least intrusive 
instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result; and they must be 
proportionate to the interest to be protected (paras. 14&#8211;15);  
 (g) Any restrictions must be consistent with the other rights guaranteed in the 
Covenant (para. 18).20  
18. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that these considerations apply also in respect 
of article 17 of the Covenant, as elaborations of the notions of &#8220;unlawful&#8221; and &#8220;arbitrary&#8221;. 
Where the textual difference between article 17 and the Covenant provisions that explicitly 
introduce a limitations test nevertheless matters is in the absence of an exhaustive list of 
legitimate aims in article 17. Here, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States to justify why a 
particular aim is legitimate as justification for restrictions upon article 17, and upon the 
Human Rights Committee to continue monitoring measures undertaken by States parties, 
including through the consideration of periodic reports and of individual complaints. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>GE.09-17804 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the Human Rights Committee should draw up 
and adopt a new general comment on article 17, replacing current general comment No. 16 
(1988). The existing general comment is very brief and does not reflect the bulk of the 
Committee&#8217;s practice that has emerged during the more than 20 years since its adoption. 
Nevertheless, many of the elements for a proper limitations clause, presented above in the 
light of the subsequent general comment No. 27, were already present in 1988.21 In its 
subsequent case law under the Optional Protocol, the Committee has emphasized that 
interference with the rights guaranteed in article 17 must cumulatively meet several 
conditions, i.e., it must be provided for by law, be in accordance with the provisions, aims 
and objectives of the Covenant, and be reasonable in the particular circumstances of the 
case.22 Further, in finding violations of article 17, the Committee has applied the 
requirements of legitimate aim, necessity and proportionality.23  
</p>
<p><b> C. Erosion of the right to privacy by counter-terrorism policies 
</b></p>
<p>20. When considering current counter-terrorism policies, States often contend that there 
are two new dynamics that must be considered alongside privacy protection. First, States 
claim that their ability to prevent and investigate terrorist acts is linked intimately with 
increased surveillance powers. The majority of counter-terrorism legislation activities since 
the events of 11 September 2001 have therefore focused on expanding Governments&#8217; 
powers to conduct surveillance. Second, States claim that since terrorism is a global 
activity, the search for terrorists must also take place beyond national borders, with the help 
of third parties which potentially hold extensive amounts of information on individuals, 
generating a rich resource for identifying and monitoring terrorist suspects. States that 
previously lacked constitutional or statutory safeguards have been able to radically 
transform their surveillance powers with few restrictions. In countries that have 
constitutional and legal safeguards, Governments have endangered the protection of the 
right to privacy by not extending these safeguards to their cooperation with third countries 
and private actors, or by placing surveillance systems beyond the jurisdiction of their 
constitutions. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Increasing surveillance measures 
</b></p>
<p>21. The range of surveillance operations runs from the specific to the general. At the 
specific level, legal systems are capable of authorizing and overseeing: undercover 
operations and covert surveillance to identify illegal conduct; the accumulation of 
intelligence on specific individuals to identify breaches of law; and targeted surveillance of 
individuals to build a legal case. The Special Rapporteur had earlier specified that States 
may make use of targeted surveillance measures, provided that it is case-specific 
interference, on the basis of a warrant issued by a judge on showing of probable cause or 
reasonable grounds. There must be some factual basis, related to the behaviour of an 
individual, which justifies the suspicion that he or she may be engaged in preparing a 
terrorist attack.24 Worldwide, there has been a rise in communications surveillance through 
the interception of communications by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. There is 
a remarkable convergence in the types of policies pursued to enhance surveillance powers

<p>to respond to terrorism threats. Most of these policies rely upon existing or new 
technologies, such as &#8220;bugs&#8221; and tracing technologies that can access the geographical 
position of mobile phones, technology that reports to Governments the contents of private 
text conversations of users of voice over Internet protocol,25 or that installs spyware on 
suspects&#8217; computers in order to enable remote computer access.26 In some countries, 
security services have even proposed banning communication technologies that are more 
difficult to intercept, such as smartphones.27 The Special Rapporteur is also concerned 
about the tracking of cross-border communications without judicial authorization.28  
22. In the name of countering terrorism, States have expanded initiatives to identify, 
scan and tag the general public through the use of multiple techniques which might violate 
an individual person&#8217;s right to privacy. When surveillance occurs of places and larger 
groups of people, the surveillance is typically subject to weaker regimes for authorization 
and oversight. Human rights standards have been tested, stretched and breached through the 
use of stop-and-searches; the compilation of lists and databases; the increased surveillance 
of financial, communications and travel data; the use of profiling to identify potential 
suspects; and the accumulation of ever larger databases to calculate the probability of 
suspicious activities and identify individuals seen as worthy of further scrutiny. More 
advanced techniques are applied as well, such as the collection of biometrics or the use of 
body scanners that can see through clothing.29 Some intrusions into people&#8217;s lives can be 
permanent as people&#8217;s physical and biographical details are frequently centralized in 
databases. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Stop and search powers 
</i>23. States have expanded their powers to stop, question, search and identify individuals, 
and have reduced their controls to prevent abuse of these powers. These powers have given 
rise to concerns regarding racial profiling and discrimination in Europe30 and the Russian 
Federation31 and concerns that these powers antagonize the relationship between citizens 
and the State. Equally, the proportionality requirement in the limitations test to the right to 
privacy raises questions whether blanket stop and search powers in designated security 
zones, such as in the Russian Federation32 or the United Kingdom,33 are really necessary in 
a democratic society. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) The use of biometrics and dangers of centralized identity systems 
</i>24. A key component to new identity policies is the use of biometric techniques, such as 
facial recognition, fingerprinting and iris-scanning. While these techniques can, in some 
circumstances, be a legitimate tool for the identification of terrorist suspects, the Special

<p>Rapporteur is particularly concerned about cases where biometrics are not stored in an 
identity document, but in a central database, thereby increasing the information security 
risks and leaving individuals vulnerable. As the collection of biometric information 
increases, error rates may rise significantly.34 This may result in the wrongful 
criminalization of individuals or social exclusion. Meanwhile, unlike other identifiers, 
biometrics cannot be revoked: once copied and/or fraudulently used by a malicious party, it 
is not possible to issue an individual with a new biometric signature.35 In this context, it has 
to be noted that, contrary to its scientific objectivity, DNA evidence can also be falsified.36 
25. Centralized collection of biometrics creates a risk of causing miscarriages of justice, 
which is illustrated by the following example. Following the Madrid bombings of 11 March 
2004, the Spanish police managed to lift a fingerprint from an unexploded bomb. 
Fingerprint experts from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) declared 
that a lawyer&#8217;s fingerprint was a match to the crime-scene sample. The person&#8217;s fingerprint 
was on the national fingerprint system because he was a former soldier of the United States. 
The individual was detained for two weeks in solitary confinement, even though the 
fingerprint was not his. Examiners failed to sufficiently reconsider the match, a situation 
that was made worse for him when it was discovered that he, as a lawyer, had defended a 
convicted terrorist, was married to an Egyptian immigrant, and had himself converted to 
Islam.37  
</p>
<p><i> (c) The circulation of secret watch lists 
</i>26. Another available technique is watch-list monitoring. The most common type of 
watch-list monitoring is the &#8220;no-fly/selectee&#8221; list. Such lists are circulated to airlines and 
security officials with instructions to detain and question any passenger with a certain 
name. Little is known of the extent to which these lists are being used, but where these 
systems are publicly overseen, a number of errors and privacy concerns have arisen, 
particularly in the United States38 and Canada.39 Data integrity issues remain, as the lists 
have to be continually checked for errors and the identification processes must be 
performed with great care. These lists are frequently kept secret as they could tip off 
suspected terrorists, but at the same time this secrecy gives rise to problems of individuals 
being continually subject to scrutiny without knowing that they are on some form of list, 
and without effective independent oversight. Such secret surveillance could constitute a 
violation of the right to privacy under article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>27. Where terrorist lists have been made public, article 17 of the Covenant is triggered 
in another form. The Human Rights Committee has concluded that the unjustified inclusion 
of a person on the United Nations 1267 Committee&#8217;s Consolidated List constituted a 
violation of article 17. It considered that the dissemination of personal information

<p>constituted an attack on the honour and reputation of the listed persons, in view of the 
negative association that would be made between the names and the title of the sanctions 
list.40  
</p>
<p>28. Public and secret watch lists often also breach fundamental principles of data 
protection. Information generated for one purpose is reused for secondary purposes, and 
sometimes shared with other institutions, without the knowledge or consent of the 
individuals concerned. Erroneous information is used to make decisions about people, 
which result in restrictions on travel. These individuals may be refused a visa, turned away 
at a border or prevented from boarding a plane, without having been presented with 
evidence of any wrongdoing.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Checkpoints and borders 
</i>29. Through the use of new technologies and in response to rising concerns regarding 
terrorism, States are increasing the monitoring, regulation, interference and control of the 
movement of people at borders. Now, with the use of more advanced technologies and 
data-sharing agreements, States are creating comprehensive profiles on foreign travellers to 
identify terrorists and criminals even in advance of their arrival at borders, by accessing 
passenger manifests and passenger reservation records from carriers. States analyse this 
information to identify patterns that correspond to those of terrorists or criminals. At the 
border, individuals are subjected to further &#8212; potentially invasive &#8212; information collection 
practices.  
</p>
<p>30. Many States now require carriers to submit passenger manifests prior to departure. 
States are also seeking access to passenger name records, which include identification 
information (name, telephone number), transactional information (dates of reservations, 
travel agent, itineraries), flight and seat information, financial data (credit card number, 
invoice address), choice of meals and information regarding place of residence, medical 
data, prior travel information, and frequent-flyer information. This information is used for 
profiling and risk-assessing passengers, usually by submitting queries to various multi-
agency law enforcement and terrorist databases and watch lists. As a result, foreign carriers 
may be restricted from issuing an individual with a boarding pass solely on the basis of the 
results of a database query in the destination country, without due process. 
</p>
<p>31. The increased monitoring of immigrants and travellers for various purposes gives 
rise to a number of privacy challenges. States are gaining information on travellers from 
third parties who are compelled to comply lest they be refused landing rights or given 
punitive fines, even though privacy guarantees may not meet the requirements of domestic 
privacy laws. Moreover, foreigners might not be granted equal access to judicial remedies 
in these countries and rights at borders are usually significantly restricted. The United 
States Government policy on access to travellers&#8217; laptops is a useful example. Despite the 
need to meet constitutional due process requirements for searching a laptop within the 
United States, the Department of Homeland Security has approved the accessing of 
travellers&#8217; computers without judicial authorization.41   
32. Lastly, States are establishing additional information requirements. Individuals can 
be prevented from entering States for refusing to disclose information, and States may insist 
upon disclosure without ensuring that there is lawful authority to require this information. 
Additionally, information collected for one purpose is now being used for additional 
purposes; for example, the European Union&#8217;s European Dactyloscopie system

<p>(EURODAC) for managing applications of asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants through 
the use of fingerprints is now proposed to be extended to aid the prevention, detection, and 
investigation of terrorist offences and other serious offences. The European Data Protection 
Supervisor has expressed doubts as to whether these proposals are legitimate under the right 
to privacy.42 
</p>
<p><b> 2. How surveillance has affected other rights 
</b></p>
<p>33. Surveillance regimes adopted as anti-terrorism measures have had a profound, 
chilling effect on other fundamental human rights. In addition to constituting a right in 
itself, privacy serves as a basis for other rights and without which the other rights would not 
be effectively enjoyed. Privacy is necessary to create zones to allow individuals and groups 
to be able to think and develop ideas and relationships. Other rights such as freedom of 
expression, association, and movement all require privacy to be able to develop effectively. 
Surveillance has also resulted in miscarriages of justice, leading to failures of due process 
and wrongful arrest. 
</p>
<p>34. In many nations around the world, users are being monitored to review what sites 
they are visiting and with whom they are communicating. In Germany, the Federal 
Intelligence Service was found in 2006 to have been illegally spying on journalists using 
communications surveillance and placing spies in newsrooms.43 In Colombia, the 
Administrative Department of Security was found, in 2009, to have been conducting illegal 
surveillance of members of the media, human rights workers, Government officials and 
judges, and their families for seven years.44 In numerous countries across the world, internet 
users must show identification and their sessions are recorded for future use by authorities. 
For instance, in Internet service providers in Bangladesh were required in 2007 to turn over 
records of their users&#8217; identities, passwords and usage to the authorities. Some users were 
then visited by the authorities, who searched though their computers and contact lists.45 In 
the United States, the FBI counter-terrorism unit monitored the activities of peace activists 
at the time of the 2004 political conventions.46 These surveillance measures have a chilling 
effect on users, who are afraid to visit websites, express their opinions or communicate with 
other persons for fear that they will face sanctions.47 This is especially relevant for 
individuals wishing to dissent and might deter some of these persons from exercising their 
democratic right to protest against Government policy. 
</p>
<p>35. In addition to surveillance powers, many anti-terrorism laws require individuals to 
proactively disclose information and provide broad powers for officials to demand 
information for investigations. In this context, the Special Rapporteur has earlier expressed 
his concerns about the use of national security letters in the United States.48 Some countries 
have expanded this power to require the disclosure of information originally collected for 
journalistic purposes. In Uganda, the 2002 Anti-Terrorism Act allows for wiretapping and

<p>searches of the media if there are &#8220;special reasonable grounds&#8221; that the information has 
&#8220;substantial value&#8221; in an anti-terrorism investigation.49 The Special Rapporteur stresses that 
the legitimate interest in the disclosure of confidential materials of journalists outweighs the 
public interest in the non-disclosure only where an overriding need for disclosure is proved, 
the circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature and the necessity of the 
disclosure is identified as responding to a pressing social need.50 
</p>
<p>36. The rights to freedom of association and assembly are also threatened by the use of 
surveillance. These freedoms often require private meetings and communications to allow 
people to organize in the face of Governments or other powerful actors. Expanded 
surveillance powers have sometimes led to a &#8220;function creep&#8221;, when police or intelligence 
agencies have labelled other groups as terrorists in order to allow the use of surveillance 
powers which were given only for the fight against terrorism. In the United States, 
environmental and other peaceful protestors were placed on terrorist watch lists by the 
Maryland State Police before political conventions in New York and Denver.51 In the 
United Kingdom, surveillance cameras are commonly used for political protests and images 
kept in a database.52 A recent poll in the United Kingdom found that one third of 
individuals were disinclined to participate in protests because of concern about their 
privacy.53  
</p>
<p>37. Freedom of movement can also be substantially affected by surveillance. The 
creation of secret watch lists, excessive data collection and sharing and imposition of 
intrusive scanning devices or biometrics, all create extra barriers to mobility. As described 
in previous sections, there has been a substantial increase in the collection of information 
about people travelling both nationally and internationally. Information is routinely shared 
and used to develop watch lists that have led to new barriers to travel. When profiles and 
watch lists are developed using information from a variety of sources with varying 
reliability, individuals may have no knowledge of the source of the information, may not 
question the veracity of this information, and have no right to contest any conclusions 
drawn by foreign authorities. A mosaic of data assembled from multiple databases may 
cause data-mining algorithms to identify innocent people as threats.54 If persons are 
prohibited from leaving a country, the State must provide information on the reasons 
requiring the restriction on freedom of movement. Otherwise, the State is likely to violate 
article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.55<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>38. One of the most serious effects of surveillance measures is that they may lead to 
miscarriages of justice and violate due process guarantees. The challenge of gaining access 
to judicial review is that some legal regimes may prevent access to the courts unless 
individuals can show that interference has taken place, which is precluded by the secretive

<p>nature of the surveillance programmes. Individuals may not be able to prove or demonstrate 
that they are actually under surveillance. As a result, individuals may not be able to appeal 
to courts for remedy. In relevant cases, courts have ruled that individuals lack standing 
because they cannot demonstrate that they were under surveillance and any injuries have 
been considered speculative.56 In other cases, where interference can be proven, States have 
sometimes applied the &#8220;State secrets&#8221; privilege to avoid scrutiny of illegal surveillance 
projects.57 The Special Rapporteur commends the approach of the European Court of 
Human Rights (ECHR) where individuals do not need to prove that such measures 
necessarily had applied to them.58 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Extending legal boundaries 
</b></p>
<p>39. Mutual legal assistance treaties are established to permit countries to cooperate in 
investigations and to share information in specific cases.59 Agreements have also been 
established to permit the sharing of information on individuals engaged in activities, e.g., 
all passengers travelling to another country or all individuals conducting interbank financial 
transactions. More opaque are the agreements between intelligence agencies to share 
databases and intelligence data. These databases are often subject to wide-ranging 
exemptions from the domestic legal system. Even if domestic legislation applies, the data 
may refer to foreign nationals who may not be permitted to exercise any rights in domestic 
courts. Individuals may not be aware of the fact that they are subject to surveillance &#8212; e.g., 
that they are on a list of suspected terrorists &#8212; because intelligence-driven lists are not 
publicly available and therefore they may not appeal for review. When that list is shared 
internationally individuals may not be able to identify why they were first placed on it, or 
otherwise be able to remove themselves from the multiplicity of lists that have emerged 
since then. 
</p>
<p>40. States have increased not only their cooperation with each other in the fight against 
terrorism, but also with private third parties that have personal information of individuals in 
order to identify and monitor terrorist suspects. Some Governments have subsequently 
endangered the protection of the right to privacy by not extending domestic privacy 
safeguards to their cooperation with third countries and private actors. 
</p>
<p>41. Third parties, such as banks, telephone companies or even cybercafes, now hold 
extensive personal information about individuals. Access to this information therefore 
provides significant details about the private lives of individuals. At the same time, 
government agencies may gain access to this information with fewer restrictions than if the 
information was held by individuals themselves, in the home, or even by other government 
agencies. In the United States, for instance the Supreme Court has ruled that, as data 
provided to third parties such as banks or telephone companies is shared &#8220;freely&#8221; with these 
parties, individuals may not reasonably expect privacy.60 Where there is a lack of 
constitutional protections that require a legal basis for the interference in the private lives of 
individuals, the burden then falls on the private organization to decide how to respond to a 
request from a government agency. Generally, the private sector prefers that Governments

<p>establish a legal basis for obliging organizations to produce personal information upon 
request, as it removes their obligation to consider the nature of the case.  
</p>
<p>42. Third parties are also increasingly being called upon to collect more information 
than is necessary, and to retain this information for extended periods of time. The United 
Kingdom, for instance, has proposed that telecommunications companies actively monitor 
and retain information on individuals&#8217; online activities including social-networking 
activities &#8211; information that these companies have no justified interest in collecting.61 
Similarly, the European Union&#8217;s data retention directive62 has generated considerable 
criticism. When, in 2008, the German Federal Constitutional Court temporarily suspended 
the German law implementing that directive, it noted that &#8220;the retention of sensitive data, 
comprehensive and without occasion, on virtually everyone, for Government purposes that 
at the time of the storage of the data cannot be foreseen in detail, may have a considerable 
intimidating effect&#8221;.63 Also in Germany, research showed a chilling effect of data retention 
policies: 52 per cent of persons interviewed said they probably would not use 
telecommunication for contact with drug counsellors, psychotherapists or marriage 
counsellors because of data retention laws.64 
</p>
<p>43. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, in many countries, data 
retention laws have been adopted without any legal safeguards over the access to this 
information being established or without the fact that new technological developments are 
blurring the difference between content and communications data being considered. While 
constitutional provisions tend to require safeguards on access to communications content, 
the protection of transaction logs is more limited. While this information may be integral to 
investigations, it may also be just as privacy-sensitive as the content of communications 
transactions. 
</p>
<p>44. With the goal of combating terrorism financing and money laundering, States have 
obliged the financial industry to analyse financial transactions in order to automatically 
distinguish those &#8220;normal&#8221; from those &#8220;suspicious&#8221;. For instance, the European Union 
established a directive in 2005 on &#8220;the prevention of the use of the financial system for the 
purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing&#8221;65 requiring that financial institutions 
follow due diligence by reporting suspicious and &#8220;threshold&#8221; activities to financial 
intelligence units (FIUs). The additional processing of this information by the FIUs remains 
opaque, but States like Australia66 and Canada67 are processing millions of transactions each 
year through advanced data-mining tools.  
</p>
<p>45. Third parties may also be subject to foreign laws requiring disclosure. The United 
States Government, for instance, issued administrative subpoenas to the Society for

<p>Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the Belgian cooperative 
responsible for enabling messaging between more than 7,800 financial institutions in over 
200 countries. By gaining access to the SWIFT data centre in the United States, the 
country&#8217;s Treasury was then able to monitor foreign financial transactions across the 
SWIFT network, to find and identify terrorist suspects.68 Human rights groups filed legal 
complaints in over 20 courts arguing that, by handing this information over to United States 
authorities, SWIFT was in breach of local privacy laws.69  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that surveillance is being embedded in 
technological infrastructures, and that these will create risks for individuals and 
organizations. For example, the development of standards for lawful interception of 
communications requires telecommunications companies to design vulnerabilities into their 
technologies to ensure that States may intercept communications. These capabilities were 
abused in Greece where unknown third parties were able to listen to the communications of 
the Prime Minister of Greece, and dozens of other high-ranking dignitaries.70 More 
recently, these same capabilities were reported to have been used by the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to monitor protestors.71 To avoid abuse, surveillance technologies 
should log who accesses data, thereby leaving a trail that can itself be monitored for 
abuse.72 
</p>
<p>47. In some States, constitutional safeguards continue to apply, however. In Canada, for 
example, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects privacy of information held by third 
parties when it reveals &#8220;intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the 
individual&#8221;.73 This requires balancing of the societal interests in protecting individual 
dignity, integrity and autonomy with effective law enforcement.74 The jurisprudence of the 
European Convention of Human Rights has similarly extended the right to privacy to 
information held by third parties. The Convention for the Protection of Individuals with 
regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data requires both the public and private 
sectors to protect the information that they hold and regulates the sharing of information 
with government agencies. Exceptions apply when protecting State security, public safety 
or the monetary interests of the State, suppressing criminal offences or protecting 
individuals or the rights and freedoms of others.75 
</p>
<p><b> D. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that there is a trend towards extending such 
State surveillance powers beyond terrorism. Following the events of 11 September 2001, a 
number of legislatures introduced sunset clauses into and reviews of anti-terrorism 
legislation, as it was assumed that extraordinary powers may be required for a short period 
of time to respond to the then danger. These sunset clauses and reviews were not included

</p>
<p>in some areas of policymaking and, in later policies, were not considered at all. Many of the 
investigative powers given to law enforcement agencies under anti-terror laws are granted 
to these agencies to conduct investigations unrelated to terrorism. Meanwhile, States are 
following each other&#8217;s lead on policy without considering the human rights implications. 
Many of the policies outlined above were introduced first as extraordinary, but then soon 
became regional and international standards. Collectively, such interference is having 
significant negative impacts on the protection of the right to privacy, as there is limited 
access to legal safeguards. Without a rigorous set of legal safeguards and a means to 
measure the necessity, proportionality, or reasonableness of the interference, States have no 
guidance on minimizing the risks to privacy generated by their new policies. The Special 
Rapporteur has identified the legal safeguards that have emerged through policymaking, 
jurisprudence, policy reviews and good practice from around the world. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The principle of minimal intrusiveness 
</b></p>
<p>49. Some interference with the private lives of individuals is more intrusive than others. 
Constitutional protection of property and people has been extended over the past 50 years 
to include communications,76 information that is related to a biographical core77 and a right 
to the confidentiality and integrity of information-technological systems.78 These 
protections require States to have exhausted less-intrusive techniques before resorting to 
others. The United Kingdom Parliament&#8217;s Home Affairs Committee reviewed and adapted 
these ideas for modern data-centred surveillance systems into the principle of data-
minimization, which is closely linked to purpose-specification.79 In its review, the 
Parliamentary committee recommended that Governments &#8220;resist a tendency to collect 
more personal information and establish larger databases. Any decision to create a major 
new database, to share information on databases, or to implement proposals for increased 
surveillance, should be based on a proven need&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur contends that 
States must incorporate this principle into existing and future policies as they present how 
their policies are necessary, and in turn proportionate.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. The principle of purpose specification restricting secondary use 
</b></p>
<p>50. Whereas data protection law should protect information collected for one purpose 
being used for another, national security and law enforcement policies are generally 
exempted from these restrictions. This is done through secrecy provisions in lawful access 
notices, broad subpoenas and exemption certificates such as national security certificates, 
which exempt a specific database from adhering to privacy laws. The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that this limits the effectiveness of necessary safeguards against abuse. States 
must be obliged to provide a legal basis for the reuse of information, in accordance with 
constitutional and human rights principles. This must be done within the human rights 
framework, rather than resorting to derogations and exemptions. This is particularly 
important when information is shared across borders; furthermore, when information is 
shared between States, protections and safeguards must continue to apply.80

<p>GE.09-17804 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. The principle of oversight and regulated authorization of lawful access 
</b></p>
<p>51. Surveillance systems require effective oversight to minimize harm and abuses. 
Where safeguards exist, this has traditionally taken the form of an independent 
authorization through a judicial warrant and/or a subpoena process with the opportunity of 
independent review. Many policies have attempted to restrict oversight and lower 
authorization levels, however: communications interception laws have minimized 
authorization requirements for some communications; secret subpoenas are issued to gain 
access to information held by third parties and have restricted the ability to seek judicial 
protections; and States are increasingly allowing intelligence and law enforcement agencies 
to self-authorize access to personal information where previously some form of 
independent authorization and effective reporting was necessary. 
</p>
<p>52. Some States have taken measures to address the erosion of safeguards. In the United 
States, after a number of court cases and because of the reauthorization requirements under 
the USA Patriot Act, more opportunities for judicial review have been reintroduced. 
Changes to the communications surveillance practices in Sweden and the United States 
have reintroduced some limited safeguards in the form of judicial warrants. Similarly, the 
European Court of Justice ruled that courts had to review the domestic lawfulness of 
international watch lists.81  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the lack of effective and independent 
scrutiny of surveillance practices and techniques calls into question whether interferences 
are lawful (and thus accountable) and necessary (and thus applied proportionately). He 
commends the hard work of oversight bodies within government agencies, including 
internal privacy offices, audit departments and inspectorate-generals, as they too play a key 
role in identifying abuses. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls for increased internal 
oversight to complement the processes for independent authorization and external 
oversight. This internal and external accountability system will ensure that there are 
effective remedies for individuals, with meaningful access to redress mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The principle of transparency and integrity 
</b></p>
<p>54. The application of secrecy privileges for surveillance systems inhibits the ability of 
legislatures, judicial bodies and the public to scrutinize State powers. Individuals may be 
subject to inappropriate surveillance, where profiles are developed through data mining, 
and erroneous judgements, without any prior notification of the practice. Furthermore, the 
lack of clear and appropriate limitations to surveillance policies makes it difficult to prove 
that these powers are not used in arbitrary and indiscriminate manners. 
</p>
<p>55. The principle of transparency and integrity requires openness and communication 
about surveillance practices. In some States, individuals must be notified when and how 
they are under surveillance, or as soon as possible after the fact. Under <i>habeas data 
</i>constitutional regimes in Latin America82 and European data protection laws, individuals 
must be able to gain access to and correct their personal information held within data stores 
and surveillance systems. These rights must be ensured across borders by ensuring that 
legal regimes protect citizens and non-citizens alike.  
</p>
<p>56. Open debate and scrutiny is essential to understanding the advantages and 
limitations of surveillance techniques, so that the public may develop an understanding of

<p><b>20</b> GE.09-17804 
</p>
<p>the necessity and lawfulness of surveillance. In many States, parliaments and independent 
bodies have been charged with conducting reviews of surveillance policies and procedures, 
and on occasion have been offered the opportunity for pre-legislative review. This has been 
aided by the use of sunset and review clauses in legislation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. The principle of effective modernization 
</b></p>
<p>57. Even as more invasive information is available with greater ease, States have not 
developed commensurate protection. In fact, in the name of modernizing their surveillance 
powers, States sometimes have intentionally sought to apply older and weaker safeguard 
regimes to ever more sensitive information.83 Conscious of the need to consider how 
technology and policy change may have a negative impact on individuals, some States have 
introduced privacy impact assessments that articulate privacy considerations in the design 
of new surveillance techniques, including how policymakers considered many of the 
principles listed above, including data minimization and rights to redress. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that the use of such tools as privacy impact assessments may help 
inform the public about surveillance practices, while instilling a culture of privacy within 
government agencies as they develop new surveillance systems to combat terrorism. 
International standards must also be adopted to require States to enhance their safeguards to 
reflect technological change. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned that what was once exceptional is now 
customary. First, States no longer limit exceptional surveillance schemes to combating 
terrorism and instead make these surveillance powers available for all purposes. 
Second, surveillance is now engrained in policymaking. Critics of unwarranted 
surveillance proposals must now argue why additional information must not be 
collected, rather than the burden of proof residing with the State to argue why the 
interference is necessary. Third, the quality and effectiveness of nearly all legal 
protections and safeguards are reduced. This is occurring even as technological 
change allows for greater and more pervasive surveillance powers. Most worrying, 
however, is that these technologies and policies are being exported to other countries 
and often lose even the most basic protections in the process.</b>  
</p>
<p>59. <b>International legal standards must be developed to ensure against these forms 
of abuse. This would be aided by adherence to principles outlined in this report, 
including ensuring that surveillance is as unintrusive as possible and that new powers 
are developed with appropriate safeguards and limitations, effective oversight and 
authorization and regular reporting and review and are accompanied by 
comprehensive statements regarding the impact on privacy. The general public and 
legislatures have rarely had the opportunity to debate whether anti-terrorism powers 
are necessary, proportionate or reasonable. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
following emergent good practices may prove beneficial to all.</b>

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  For legislative assemblies 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends again that any interference with the right 
to privacy, family, home or correspondence should be authorized by provisions of law 
that are publicly accessible, particularly precise and proportionate to the security 
threat, and offer effective guarantees against abuse. States should ensure that the 
competent authorities apply less intrusive investigation methods if such methods 
enable a terrorist offence to be detected, prevented or prosecuted with adequate 
effectiveness. Decision-making authority should be structured so that the greater the 
invasion of privacy, the higher the level of authorization needed.  
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Adherence to international standards for privacy and human rights protection 
must be a tenet national law. Accordingly, a comprehensive data protection and 
privacy law is necessary to ensure that there are clear legal protections for individuals 
to prevent the excessive collection of personal information, that ensures measures are 
in place to ensure the accuracy of information, that creates limits on the use, storage, 
and sharing of the information, and which mandates that individuals are notified of 
how their information is used and that they have a right to access and redress, 
regardless of nationality and jurisdiction. 
</b>62. <b>Strong independent oversight mandates must be established to review policies 
and practices, in order to ensure that there is strong oversight of the use of intrusive 
surveillance techniques and the processing of personal information. Therefore, there 
must be no secret surveillance system that is not under the review of an effective 
oversight body and all interferences must be authorized through an independent 
body. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>All current and proposed counter-terrorism policies must include privacy 
impact assessments to review and communicate how the policy and technologies 
ensure that privacy risks are mitigated and privacy is considered at the earliest stages 
of policymaking. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that stronger safeguards be developed to 
ensure that the sharing of information between governments continues to protect the 
privacy of individuals. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that stronger regulations are 
developed to limit Government access to information held by third parties, including 
reporting schemes, and to minimize the burden placed on third parties to collect 
additional information, and that constitutional and legal safeguards apply when third 
parties are acting on behalf of the State.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Rapporteur warns that legislative language should be reconsidered 
to prevent the use of anti-terrorism powers for other purposes. New systems must be 
designed with a limitation of scope in the specifications. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  For Governments 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to articulate in detail how their 
surveillance policies uphold the principles of proportionality and necessity, in 
accordance with international human rights standards, and what measures have been 
taken to ensure against abuse.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends open discussion and regular reporting on 
information-based surveillance programmes. Reports to legislative and oversight </b></p>


<p><b>22</b> GE.09-17804 
</p>
<p><b>bodies, as well as independent reviews of practices will help inform future 
policymaking and deliberation on anti-terrorism policy. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Any watch list- or profile-based surveillance programme must include due 
process safeguards for all individuals, including rights to redress. The principle of 
transparency must be upheld so that individuals can be informed as to why and how 
they were added to watch lists or how their profile was developed, and of the 
mechanisms for appeal without undue burdens. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Given the inherent dangers of data mining, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that any information-based counter-terrorism programme should be 
subjected to robust and independent oversight. The Special Rapporteur also 
recommends against the development and use of data-mining techniques for counter-
terrorism purposes. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In light of the risk of abuse of surveillance technologies, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that equal amounts of research and development resources be devoted to 
privacy-enhancing technologies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  For the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the development of a programme for 
global capacity-building on privacy protection. The international replication of anti-
terrorism laws and the global standards on surveillance must be counterbalanced with 
greater awareness of the necessary safeguards for the protection of individuals&#8217; 
dignity. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Human Rights Council to establish a process 
that builds on existing principles of data protection to recommend measures for the 
creation of a global declaration on data protection and data privacy.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  For the Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Committee begins 
drafting a new general comment on article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, with the goal of elaborating a proper limitation test, thereby 
providing guidance to States on appropriate safeguards. The general comment should 
also give due attention to data protection as an attribute of the right to privacy, as 
enshrined in article 17 of the Covenant.
