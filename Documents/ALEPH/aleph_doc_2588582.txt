Glossary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Terms
The terms defined in this section may be used throughout this report:
“Bbl” One stock tank barrel, of 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used herein in reference to crude oil,
condensate or natural gas liquids.
“Boe” Barrels of crude oil equivalent, with six thousand cubic feet of natural gas being equivalent to one
barrel of crude oil based on the average equivalent energy content of the two commodities.
“Btu” British thermal unit, which represents the amount of energy needed to heat one pound of water by one
degree Fahrenheit and can be used to describe the energy content of fuels.
“completion” The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the
production of crude oil and/or natural gas.
“DD&A” Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion.
“developed acreage” The number of acres allocated or assignable to productive wells or wells capable of
production.
“development well” A well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of
a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
“dry hole” Exploratory or development well that does not produce crude oil and/or natural gas in economically
producible quantities.
“enhanced recovery” The recovery of crude oil and natural gas through the injection of liquids or gases into
the reservoir, supplementing its natural energy. Enhanced recovery methods are sometimes applied when
production slows due to depletion of the natural pressure.
“exploratory well” A well drilled to find crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in
an existing field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or to extend
a known reservoir beyond the proved area.
“field” An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same
individual geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition. The field name refers to the surface area,
although it may refer to both the surface and the underground productive formations.
“formation” A layer of rock which has distinct characteristics that differs from nearby rock.
"gross acres" or "gross wells" Refers to the total acres or wells in which a working interest is owned.
“horizontal drilling” A drilling technique used in certain formations where a well is drilled vertically to a certain
depth and then drilled horizontally within a specified interval.
“MBbl” One thousand barrels of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.
“MBoe” One thousand Boe.
“Mcf” One thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
“MMBoe” One million Boe.
“MMBtu” One million British thermal units.
“MMcf” One million cubic feet of natural gas.
“net acres” or "net wells" Refers to the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres or gross
wells.
“NYMEX” The New York Mercantile Exchange.
“play” A portion of the exploration and production cycle following the identification by geologists and
geophysicists of areas with potential crude oil and natural gas reserves.
i
“productive well” A well found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that
proceeds from the sale of the production exceed production expenses and taxes.
“prospect” A potential geological feature or formation which geologists and geophysicists believe may
contain hydrocarbons. A prospect can be in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that has
been fully evaluated and is ready to drill to a prospect that will require substantial additional seismic data
processing and interpretation.
“proved reserves” The quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and
engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given
date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and
government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless
evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain.
“reservoir” A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible
crude oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other
reservoirs.
“royalty interest” Refers to the ownership of a percentage of the resources or revenues produced from a crude
oil or natural gas property. A royalty interest owner does not bear exploration, development, or operating
expenses associated with drilling and producing a crude oil or natural gas property.
“SCOOP” Refers to the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province, a term used to describe properties located in
the Anadarko basin of Oklahoma in which we operate. Our SCOOP acreage extends across portions of
Garvin, Grady, Stephens, Carter, McClain and Love Counties of Oklahoma and has the potential to contain
hydrocarbons from a variety of conventional and unconventional reservoirs overlying and underlying the
Woodford formation.
"STACK" Refers to Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher, a term used to describe a resource play
located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma characterized by stacked geologic formations with major targets
in the Meramec and Osage formations overlying the Woodford formation. A significant portion of our STACK
acreage is located in over-pressured portions of Blaine, Dewey and Custer Counties of Oklahoma.
“undeveloped acreage” Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that
would permit the production of commercial quantities of crude oil and/or natural gas.
“unit” The joining of all or substantially all interests in a reservoir or field, rather than a single tract, to provide
for development and operation without regard to separate property interests. Also, the area covered by a
unitization agreement.
“working interest” The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and own crude
oil, natural gas, or other minerals. The working interest owners bear the exploration, development, and
operating costs on either a cash, penalty, or carried basis.
ii
Cautionary Statement for the Purpose of the “Safe Harbor” Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995
This report and information incorporated by reference in this report include “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including, but not limited to, forecasts or
expectations regarding the Company's business and statements or information concerning the Company’s
future operations, performance, financial condition, production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of
development, rates of return, budgets, costs, business strategy, objectives, and cash flows, included in this
report are forward-looking statements. The words “could,” “may,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “project,” “budget,” “plan,” “continue,” “potential,” “guidance,” “strategy” and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such
identifying words.
Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements about:
•our strategy;
•our business and financial plans;
•our future operations;
•our crude oil and natural gas reserves and related development plans;
•technology;
•
•crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices and differentials;
•the timing and amount of future production of crude oil and natural gas and flaring activities;
•the amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures;

the ability and willingness of current or potential lenders, hedging contract counterparties, customers, and
working interest owners to fulfill their obligations to us or to enter into transactions with us in the future on
terms that are acceptable to us.
Forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and assumptions about future
events and currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. Although the
Company believes these assumptions and expectations are reasonable, they are inherently subject to
numerous business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, most of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. No assurance can be given that
such expectations will be correct or achieved or that the assumptions are accurate or will not change over
time. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance and results of the business and
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those risk factors and other cautionary statements
described under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, if any, our Annual Report on Form
•
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, registration statements we file from time to time with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and other announcements we make from time to time.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date on which such statement is made. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this
report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company's actual results and plans
could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking
statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
Except as expressly stated above or otherwise required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no
obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information,
future events or circumstances after the date of this report, or otherwise.

Continental Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Organization and Nature of Business
Continental Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally formed in 1967 and is incorporated under the
laws of the State of Oklahoma. The Company's principal business is crude oil and natural gas exploration,
development and production with properties primarily located in the North, South, and East regions of the
United States. The North region consists of properties north of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River and
includes North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken and the Red River units. The South region includes all
properties south of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River including various plays in the SCOOP (South
Central Oklahoma Oil Province), STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher), Northwest Cana,
and Arkoma Woodford areas of Oklahoma. The East region is comprised of undeveloped leasehold acreage
east of the Mississippi River with no current drilling or production operations.
A substantial portion of the Company’s operations are concentrated in the North region, with that region
comprising approximately 64% of the Company’s crude oil and natural gas production and approximately
73% of its crude oil and natural gas revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company's
principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field of North Dakota and
Montana. In recent years, the Company has significantly expanded its activity in the South region with its
discovery of the SCOOP play and its increased activity in the Northwest Cana and STACK plays. The South
region comprised approximately 36% of the Company's crude oil and natural gas production and
approximately 27% of its crude oil and natural gas revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The Company has focused its operations on the exploration and development of crude oil since the 1980s.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, crude oil accounted for approximately 62% of the Company’s total
production and approximately 87% of its crude oil and natural gas revenues.    
Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries,
all of which are 100% owned, after all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated upon consolidation.
This report has been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to interim financial information. Because this is an interim period filing
presented using a condensed format, it does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), although the Company believes the disclosures are
adequate to make the information not misleading. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
("Form 10-Q") together with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 (“2015 Form 10-K”), which includes a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies and
other disclosures.
The condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016 and for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited balance sheet included in the 2015 Form 10-K. The
Company has evaluated events or transactions through the date this report on Form 10-Q was filed with the
SEC in conjunction with its preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure and
estimation of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those
estimates. The most significant of the estimates and assumptions that affect reported results are the
estimates of the Company’s crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are used to compute depreciation,
depletion, amortization and impairment of proved crude oil and natural gas properties. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair
presentation in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been included in these unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for any other interim period or for an entire year.
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-
average number of shares outstanding for the period. In periods where the Company has net income, diluted
earnings per share reflects

Inventories
Inventory is comprised of crude oil held in storage or as line fill in pipelines and tubular goods and equipment
to be used in the Company's exploration and development activities. Crude oil inventories are valued at the
lower of cost or market primarily using the first-in, first-out inventory method. Tubular goods and equipment
are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined primarily using a weighted average cost
method applied to specific classes of inventory items.
The components of inventory as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:

Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized
for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
basis of existing assets and liabilities using the enacted statutory tax rates in effect at period-end. The effect
on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. The Company’s policy is to recognize penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any,
in income tax expense. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than
not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recorded valuation
allowances of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively,
and $1.3 million and $12.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, against
deferred tax assets associated with operating loss carryforwards generated by its Canadian subsidiary for
which the Company does not expect to realize a benefit.
New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires companies to recognize a right of use asset and related liability
on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations arising from leases with durations greater than 12 months.
The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and
requires adoption by application of a modified retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which changes
how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards, including the accounting for
income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the
statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 and shall be adopted either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified
retrospective transition approach depending on the topic covered in the standard. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and related disclosures. The Company
expects to continue its current accounting practice of estimating forfeitures in determining the amount of
stock-based compensation expense to recognize.

the Company had $410.3 million and $797.5 million, respectively, of accrued capital expenditures.
Note 4. Derivative Instruments
Crude oil and natural gas derivatives
The Company may utilize crude oil and natural gas swap and collar derivative contracts to economically
hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with future sales of crude oil and natural gas
production. While the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price
movements, their use also limits future revenues from upward price movements.
The Company recognizes all crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either
assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The Company has not designated its crude oil and natural gas
derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, marks such derivative instruments
to fair value and recognizes the changes in fair value in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
comprehensive income (loss) under the caption “Gain (loss) on crude oil and natural gas derivatives, net”,
which is a component of "Total revenues".
With respect to a crude oil or natural gas fixed price swap contract, the counterparty is required to make a
payment to the Company if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price, and the
Company is required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period
is greater than the swap price. For a crude oil or natural gas collar contract, the counterparty is required to
make a payment to the Company if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price, and
the Company is required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement
period is above the ceiling price. Neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the
settlement price for any settlement period is between the floor price and the ceiling price.
The Company’s crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported settlement
prices on commodity exchanges, with crude oil derivative settlements based on Inter-Continental Exchange
(“ICE”) pricing for Brent crude oil and natural gas derivative settlements based on NYMEX Henry Hub
pricing. The estimated fair value of derivative contracts is based upon various factors, including commodity
exchange prices, over-the-counter quotations, and, in the case of collars and written call options, volatility,
the risk-free interest rate, and the time to expiration. The calculation of the fair value of collars and written call
options requires the use of an option-pricing model. See Note 5. Fair Value Measurements.

Diesel fuel derivatives
In March 2016, the Company entered into diesel fuel swap derivative contracts to economically hedge
against the variability in cash flows associated with future purchases of diesel fuel for use in drilling activities.
The Company has hedged approximately 19 million gallons of diesel fuel over the period from July 2016 to
December 2017 at a weighted average price of $1.41 per gallon. With respect to these diesel fuel swap
contracts, the counterparty is required to make a payment to the Company if the settlement price for any
settlement period is greater than the swap price, and the Company is required to make a payment to the
counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price. The diesel fuel swap
contracts are settled based upon reported NYMEX settlement prices for New York Harbor ultra-low sulfur
diesel fuel.

Note 5. Fair Value Measurements
The Company follows a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The
valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels
depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. The three levels are defined as
follows:
Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets as of the reporting date.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
•
•These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or
indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
9
Continental Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally
developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value
hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The Company’s assessment of the significance of
a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets
and liabilities within the levels of the hierarchy. As Level 1 inputs generally provide the most reliable
evidence of fair value, the Company uses Level 1 inputs when available. The Company’s policy is to
recognize transfers between the hierarchy levels as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the
event or change in circumstances caused the transfer.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The Company's derivative instruments are reported at fair value on a recurring basis. In determining the fair
values of swap contracts, a discounted cash flow method is used due to the unavailability of relevant
comparable market data for the Company’s exact contracts. The discounted cash flow method estimates
future cash flows based on quoted market prices for forward commodity prices and a risk-adjusted discount
rate. The fair values of swap contracts are calculated mainly using significant observable inputs (Level 2).
Calculation of the fair values of collars and written call options requires the use of an industry-standard option
pricing model that considers various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value,
volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other
relevant economic measures. These assumptions are observable in the marketplace or can be corroborated
by active markets or broker quotes and are therefore designated as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.
The Company’s calculation of fair value for each of its derivative positions is compared to the counterparty
valuation for reasonableness.
The following tables summarize the valuation of financial instruments by pricing levels that were accounted
for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

the field exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount of the field is reduced to
its estimated fair value. Due to the unavailability of relevant comparable market data, a discounted cash flow
method is used to determine the fair value of proved properties. The discounted cash flow method estimates
future cash flows based on the Company's estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production,
commodity prices based on commodity futures price strips adjusted for differentials, operating costs, and a
risk-adjusted discount rate. The fair value of proved crude oil and natural gas properties is calculated using

Unobservable inputs to the fair value assessment are reviewed quarterly and are revised as warranted based
on a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, crude oil and natural gas prices,
changes in costs, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors.
Fair value measurements of proved properties are reviewed and approved by certain members of the
Company’s management.
Proved properties were reviewed for impairment at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015. For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, estimated future net cash flows were determined to be in excess of cost basis,
therefore no impairment was recorded for the Company’s proved crude oil and natural gas properties. For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company determined the carrying amounts of certain proved
properties were not recoverable from future cash flows at that time and, therefore, were impaired.
Impairments of proved properties for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $5.0 million and
$75.0 million, respectively, and were primarily concentrated in an emerging area with minimal production and
costly reserve additions ($41.2 million, including $5.0 million in the 2015 second quarter), the Medicine Pole
Hills units ($14.7 million), various legacy areas in the South region ($11.0 million), and non-Bakken areas of
North Dakota and Montana ($8.1 million). The impaired properties were written down to their estimated fair
value totaling approximately $38.2 million as of June 30, 2015.
Certain unproved crude oil and natural gas properties were impaired during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, reflecting recurring amortization of undeveloped leasehold costs on properties the
Company expects will not be transferred to proved properties over the lives of the leases based on drilling
plans, experience of successful drilling, and the average holding period.
The following table sets forth the non-cash impairments of both proved and unproved properties for the
indicated periods. Proved and unproved property impairments are recorded under the caption “Property

The fair values of revolving credit facility borrowings and the term loan approximate face value based on
borrowing rates available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities and are classified
as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the note payable is determined using a discounted cash flow approach based on the interest
rate and payment terms of the note payable and an assumed discount rate. The fair value of the note payable
is significantly influenced by the discount rate assumption, which is derived by the Company and is
unobservable. Accordingly, the fair value of the note payable is classified as Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.
The fair values of the 7.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (“2020 Notes”), the 7.125% Senior Notes due 2021

Notes") are based on quoted market prices and, accordingly, are classified as Level 1 in the fair value
hierarchy.
The carrying values of all classes of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, and trade payables are
considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to the short term maturities of those
instruments.

Revolving Credit Facility
The Company has an unsecured revolving credit facility, maturing on May 16, 2019, with aggregate
commitments totaling $2.75 billion at June 30, 2016, which may be increased up to a total of $4.0 billion upon
agreement between the Company and participating lenders.
The Company had $885 million and $853 million of outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at market-based interest rates
plus a margin based on the terms of the borrowing and the credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior,
unsecured, long-term indebtedness. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at
June 30, 2016 was 2.2%.
The Company had approximately $1.86 billion of borrowing availability on its revolving credit facility at
June 30, 2016 and incurs commitment fees based on currently assigned credit ratings of 0.30% per annum
on the daily average amount of unused borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility.
The revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including a requirement that the Company
maintain a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. This ratio
represents the ratio of net debt (calculated as total face value of debt plus outstanding letters of credit less
cash and cash equivalents) divided by the sum of net debt plus total shareholders' equity plus, to the extent
resulting in a reduction of total shareholders’ equity, the amount of any non-cash impairment charges
incurred, net of any tax effect, after June 30, 2014. The Company was in compliance with the revolving credit
facility covenants at June 30, 2016.

On or after these dates, the Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of its senior notes of the
applicable series at the decreasing redemption prices specified in the respective senior note indentures
(together, the “Indentures”) plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
At any time prior to these dates, the Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of its senior notes
of the applicable series at the “make-whole” redemption prices or amounts specified in the Indentures plus
any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
The Company’s senior notes are not subject to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund requirements.
The indentures governing the Company's senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the
Company's ability to create liens securing certain indebtedness, enter into certain sale-leaseback
transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer certain assets. The senior note covenants are subject to a
number of important exceptions and qualifications. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at
June 30, 2016. Two of the Company’s subsidiaries, Banner Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and CLR Asset
Holdings, LLC, which have no material assets or operations, fully and unconditionally guarantee the senior
notes on a joint and several basis. The Company’s other subsidiaries, the value of whose assets and
operations are minor, do not guarantee the senior notes as of June 30, 2016.
Term Loan
In November 2015, the Company borrowed $500 million under a three-year term loan agreement, the
proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the borrowings then outstanding on the Company's
revolving credit facility. The term loan matures in full on November 4, 2018 and bears interest at a variable
market-based interest rate plus a margin based on the
13
Continental Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
terms of the borrowing and the credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior, unsecured, long-term
indebtedness. The interest rate on the term loan at June 30, 2016 was 1.95%.
The term loan contains certain restrictive covenants including a requirement that the Company maintain a
consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.0, consistent with the covenant
requirement in the Company's revolving credit facility. The Company was in compliance with the term loan
covenants at June 30, 2016.
Note Payable
In February 2012, 20 Broadway Associates LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, borrowed $22
million under a 10-year amortizing term loan secured by the Company’s corporate office building in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.14% per annum. Principal and interest
are payable monthly through the loan’s maturity date of February 26, 2022. Accordingly, approximately $2.2
million is reflected as a current liability under the caption “Current portion of long-term debt” in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2016.
Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies
Included below is a discussion of various future commitments of the Company as of June 30, 2016. The
commitments under these arrangements are not recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheets.
Drilling commitments – As of June 30, 2016, the Company had drilling rig contracts with various terms
extending to year-end 2019 to ensure rig availability in its key operating areas. Future commitments as of
June 30, 2016 total approximately $319 million, of which $97 million is expected to be incurred in the
remainder of 2016, $136 million in 2017, $62 million in 2018, and $24 million in 2019.
Pipeline transportation commitments – The Company has entered into firm transportation commitments to
guarantee pipeline access capacity on crude oil and natural gas pipelines. The commitments, which have
varying terms extending as far as 2027, require the Company to pay per-unit transportation charges
regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity used. Future commitments remaining as of June 30, 2016
under the pipeline transportation arrangements amount to approximately $893 million, of which $107 million
is expected to be incurred in the remainder of 2016, $207 million in 2017, $208 million in 2018, $154 million
in 2019, $47 million in 2020, and $170 million thereafter.
The Company’s pipeline commitments are for production primarily in the North region. The Company is not
committed under these contracts to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil or natural gas in the
future.
Litigation – In November 2010, a putative class action was filed in the District Court of Blaine County,
Oklahoma by Billy J. Strack and Daniela A. Renner as trustees of certain named trusts and on behalf of other
similarly situated parties against the Company. The Petition alleged the Company improperly deducted post-
production costs from royalties paid to plaintiffs and other royalty interest owners from crude oil and natural
gas wells located in Oklahoma. The plaintiffs alleged a number of claims, including breach of contract, fraud,
breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and other claims and seek recovery of compensatory damages,
interest, punitive damages and attorney fees on behalf of the proposed class. On November 3, 2014, plaintiffs
filed an Amended Petition that did not add any substantive claims, but sought a “hybrid class action” in which
they sought certification of certain claims for injunctive relief, reserving the right to seek a further class
certification on money damages in the future. Plaintiffs filed an Amended Motion for Class Certification on
January 9, 2015, that modified the proposed class to royalty owners in Oklahoma production from July 1,
1993, to the present (instead of 1980 to the present) and sought certification of over 45 separate “issues” for
injunctive or declaratory relief, again, reserving the right to seek a further class certification of money
damages in the future. The Company responded to the petition, its amendment, and the motions for class
certification denying the allegations and raising a number of affirmative defenses and legal arguments to
each of the claims and filings. Certain discovery was undertaken and the “hybrid” motion was briefed by
plaintiffs and the Company. A hearing on the “hybrid” class certification was held on June 1st and 2nd, 2015.
On June 11, 2015, the trial court certified a “hybrid” class as requested by plaintiffs. The Company has
appealed the trial court’s class certification order, which will be reviewed de novo by the appellate court. The
appeal briefing is complete and ready for determination by the court. An unsuccessful mediation was
conducted on December 7, 2015. The Company is not currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss
or range of loss or what impact, if any, the action will have on its financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows due to the preliminary status of the matter, the complexity and number of legal and factual issues
presented by the matter and uncertainties with respect to, among other things, the nature of the claims and
defenses, the potential size of the class, the scope and types of the properties and agreements involved, the
production years involved, and the ultimate potential outcome of the matter. Although not currently at issue in
the “hybrid” certification, plaintiffs have alleged underpayments in excess of $200 million that they may claim
as damages, which may increase with the passage of time, a majority of which would be comprised of
interest. The Company disputes plaintiffs’ claims, disputes that the case meets the requirements for a class
action and is
14
Continental Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
vigorously defending the case. The Company will continue to assert its defenses to the case as certified as
well as any future attempt to certify a money damages class.
The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings including, but not limited to, commercial
disputes, claims from royalty and surface owners, property damage claims, personal injury claims, disputes
with tax authorities and other matters. While the outcome of these legal matters cannot be predicted with
certainty, the Company does not expect them to have a material effect on its financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. As of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded a
liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Other noncurrent liabilities” of $6.1
million for various matters, none of which are believed to be individually significant.
Environmental risk – Due to the nature of the crude oil and natural gas business, the Company is exposed to
possible environmental risks. The Company is not aware of any material environmental issues or claims.
Note 8. Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has granted restricted stock to employees and directors pursuant to the Continental
Resources, Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2013 Plan") as discussed below. The Company’s
associated compensation expense, which is included in the caption “General and administrative expenses”
in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), was $11.8 million and
$16.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $21.0 million and $27.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In May 2013, the Company adopted the 2013 Plan and reserved 19,680,072 shares of common stock that
may be issued pursuant to the plan. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had 15,177,005 shares of restricted
stock available to grant to employees and directors under the 2013 Plan.
Restricted stock is awarded in the name of the recipient and constitutes issued and outstanding shares of the
Company’s common stock for all corporate purposes during the period of restriction and, except as otherwise
provided under the 2013 Plan or agreement relevant to a given award, includes the right to vote the restricted
stock or to receive dividends, subject to forfeiture. Restricted stock grants generally vest over periods ranging
from one to three years.
A summary of changes in non-vested restricted shares outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is
presented below.

The grant date fair value of restricted stock represents the closing market price of the Company’s common
stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for a restricted stock grant is a fixed amount determined at
the grant date fair value and is recognized ratably over the vesting period as services are rendered by
employees and directors. There are no post-vesting restrictions related to the Company’s restricted stock.
The fair value at the vesting date of restricted stock that vested during the six months ended June 30, 2016
was approximately $21.5 million. As of June 30, 2016, there was approximately $81 million of unrecognized
compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock. This expense is expected to be recognized
over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.

Note 10. Property Dispositions
In April 2016, the Company sold approximately 132,000 net acres of undeveloped leasehold acreage located
in Wyoming to a third party for cash proceeds of $110.0 million. The proceeds were used to pay down a
portion of outstanding borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. In connection with the
transaction, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $96.9 million. The disposed properties represented an
immaterial portion of the Company’s total acreage and included no production or proved reserves.
In May 2015, the Company sold certain undeveloped leasehold acreage in Oklahoma to a third party for cash
proceeds of $25.9 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $20.5 million. The disposed
properties represented an immaterial portion of the Company’s total acreage.
Note 11. Subsequent Event
On August 2, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell non-strategic producing and non-
producing properties in the SCOOP play in Oklahoma to a third party for cash proceeds of $281 million. The
disposition is expected to close in October 2016. The properties to be disposed represent an immaterial
portion of the Company’s total acreage, proved reserves, production, and revenues. The Company expects to
use the sales proceeds to reduce outstanding debt.

ITEM 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and our historical
consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. Our operating results for the periods discussed below may not be indicative of future
performance. The following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements and should be read
in conjunction with the risk factors described in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report, if any,
and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, along with Cautionary
Statement for the Purpose of the “Safe Harbor” Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 at the beginning of this report, for information about the risks and uncertainties that could cause our
actual results to be materially different than our forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are an independent crude oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development and
production of crude oil and natural gas. We derive the majority of our operating income and cash flows from
the sale of crude oil and natural gas and expect this to continue in the future. Our operations are primarily
focused on exploration and development activities in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana and the
SCOOP, STACK, and Northwest Cana areas of Oklahoma.
Business Environment and Outlook
Commodity prices showed some signs of stabilization and recovery in the second quarter of 2016, but still
remain volatile and unpredictable due to domestic and global supply and demand factors. In light of the
challenges facing our industry, our primary business strategies for 2016 continue to focus on: (1) optimizing
cash flows through operating efficiencies and cost reductions, (2) high-grading investments based on rates of
return and opportunities to convert undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, and (3) balancing
capital spending with cash flows to minimize new borrowings and maintain ample liquidity.
2016 Highlights
Production
Production for the second quarter of 2016 averaged 219,323 Boe per day, a decrease of 5% from the first
quarter of 2016 and 3% lower than the second quarter of 2015. Year to date production averaged 225,063
Boe per day, a 4% increase from the comparable 2015 period.
North Dakota Bakken production averaged 114,554 Boe per day for the second quarter of 2016, an 11%
decrease from the first quarter of 2016 and 10% lower than the second quarter of 2015. Year to date, North
Dakota Bakken production averaged 121,861 Boe per day, a 2% decrease from the comparable 2015 period.
SCOOP production averaged 64,669 Boe per day for the second quarter of 2016, in line with the first quarter
of 2016 and 3% higher than the second quarter of 2015. Year to date, SCOOP production averaged 64,642
Boe per day, a 15% increase over the comparable 2015 period.
Combined production from STACK and Northwest Cana averaged 14,610 Boe per day for the second
quarter of 2016, an increase of 31% from the first quarter of 2016 and 231% higher than the second quarter of
2015. Year to date, combined STACK and Northwest Cana production averaged 12,868 Boe per day, a
228% increase over the comparable 2015 period.
The South region comprised 38% of our total production for the 2016 second quarter compared to 34% for the
2016 first quarter and 31% for the 2015 second quarter. The South region comprised 36% of our total
production for year to date 2016 compared to 30% for the comparable 2015 period.
Revenues
Crude oil and natural gas revenues for the 2016 second quarter decreased 33% compared to the 2015
second quarter driven by a 30% decrease in realized commodity prices coupled with a 5% decrease in total
sales volumes.
Year to date crude oil and natural gas revenues decreased 32% from the comparable 2015 period driven by
a 35% decrease in realized commodity prices, the effect of which was partially offset by a 4% increase in total
sales volumes.
Average crude oil sales prices for the second quarter and year to date periods of 2016 decreased 23% and
29%, respectively, from the comparable 2015 periods.

Credit facility and liquidity
At June 30, 2016, we had $16.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.86 billion of
borrowing availability on our credit facility after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. We
had $885 million of outstanding borrowings on our credit facility at June 30, 2016 compared to $940 million at
March 31, 2016 and $853 million at December 31, 2015. At July 31, 2016, outstanding credit facility
borrowings totaled $820 million.
Property disposition
In April 2016, we sold approximately 132,000 net acres of non-core undeveloped leasehold acreage located
in Wyoming to a third party for cash proceeds of $110.0 million. The proceeds were used to pay down a
portion of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. In connection with the transaction we
recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $96.9 million.

The 11% decrease in crude oil production for the second quarter was driven by decreased production from
our properties in North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken and the Red River units due to a combination of
natural declines in production and reduced drilling and completion activities in those areas. North Dakota
Bakken crude oil production decreased 1,377 MBbls, or 14%, and Montana Bakken production decreased
242 MBbls, or 24%, while production in the Red River units decreased 145 MBbls, or 13%, over the prior
year second quarter. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 281

MBbls in crude oil production from our STACK/Northwest Cana properties due to additional wells being
completed and producing resulting from a shift in our well completion activities away from the Bakken to
higher rate-of-return areas in Oklahoma.
The 13% increase in natural gas production for the second quarter was driven by increased production from
our properties in the STACK, Northwest Cana and SCOOP plays due to additional wells being completed
and producing subsequent to June 30, 2015. Natural gas production in STACK/Northwest Cana increased
3,881 MMcf, or 173%, and SCOOP production increased 1,042 MMcf, or 4%, over the prior year second
quarter. Additionally, North Dakota Bakken natural gas production increased 990 MMcf, or 8%, due to an
increase in gas capture from non-operated properties and resulting increase in volumes produced and
delivered to market. These increases were partially offset by decreases in production from various areas in
our North and South regions primarily due to natural declines in production.
The increase in natural gas production as a percentage of our total production from 34% in the second
quarter of 2015 to 39% in the second quarter of 2016 primarily resulted from significant increases in STACK,
Northwest Cana and SCOOP production over the past year due to the aforementioned shift in our well
completion activities away from the Bakken to higher rate-of-return areas in Oklahoma. Our properties in
STACK, Northwest Cana and SCOOP typically produce a higher concentration of liquids-rich natural gas
compared to oil-weighted properties in the Bakken. For the remainder of 2016, we expect to continue
focusing our well completion activities on our Oklahoma properties. Accordingly, we expect our natural gas
production may increase to approximately 40% of our total production for the full year of 2016. As crude oil
prices recover, we expect to increase our completion activities in the Bakken and shift our production back to
a higher proportion of crude oil.
Revenues
Our revenues primarily consist of sales of crude oil and natural gas and gains and losses resulting from
changes in the fair value of our crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments.
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Sales. Crude oil and natural gas sales for the second quarter of 2016 were
$525.7 million, a 33% decrease from sales of $790.1 million for the 2015 second quarter due to decreases in
commodity prices and sales volumes.
Our crude oil sales prices averaged $38.38 per barrel in the 2016 second quarter, a decrease of 23%
compared to $49.84 for the 2015 second quarter due to lower crude oil market prices. The differential
between NYMEX West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") calendar month crude oil prices and our realized crude oil
prices averaged $7.21 per barrel for the 2016 second quarter compared to $8.18 for the 2015 second quarter.
The improved differential was due to increased use of pipeline transportation to move our North region crude
oil to market with less dependence on more costly rail transportation, along with significant growth in our
South region production which typically has lower transportation costs compared to the Bakken due to its
relatively close proximity to regional refineries and the crude oil trading hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.
Our natural gas sales prices averaged $1.31 per Mcf for the 2016 second quarter, a 43% decrease compared
to $2.31 per Mcf for the 2015 second quarter due to lower market prices for natural gas and natural gas
liquids (“NGLs”) along with the amendment of certain natural gas sales agreements in 2016. The majority of
our natural gas production is sold at our lease locations to midstream purchasers with price realizations
impacted by the volume and value of NGLs that purchasers extract from our sales stream. The difference
between our realized natural gas sales prices and NYMEX Henry Hub calendar month natural gas prices
was a discount of $0.65 per Mcf for the 2016 second quarter compared to a discount of $0.33 per Mcf for the
2015 second quarter. NGL prices remained depressed in the 2016 second quarter in conjunction with low
crude oil prices, which, along with our amended natural gas sales agreements, reduced the value of our
natural gas sales stream and unfavorably impacted the difference between our realized prices and Henry
Hub benchmark pricing. If NGL prices do not recover from current levels, the prices we receive for the sale of
our natural gas stream for the remainder of 2016 may continue to be lower than Henry Hub benchmark
prices.
Commodity prices showed some signs of stabilization and recovery in the second quarter of 2016, but still
remain volatile and we are unable to predict the impact future price changes may have on our full year 2016
revenues and differentials.
For the second quarter of 2016, our crude oil sales volumes decreased 13% from the comparable 2015
period, while our natural gas sales volumes increased 13%, reflecting the shift in our well completion
activities away from oil-weighted properties in the Bakken to areas in Oklahoma with higher concentrations of
liquids-rich natural gas.
Derivatives. Changes in natural gas prices during the second quarter of 2016 had an unfavorable impact on
the fair value of our natural gas derivatives, which resulted in negative revenue adjustments of $82.3 million
for the period, representing $121.0 million of non-cash losses on derivatives partially offset by $38.7 million
of cash gains. Our revenues may continue to be significantly impacted, either positively or negatively, by
changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments as a result of volatility in natural gas prices.

Operating Costs and Expenses
Production Expenses. Production expenses decreased $17.6 million, or 19%, from $91.7 million for the
second quarter of 2015 to $74.1 million for the second quarter of 2016. Production expenses on a per-Boe
basis decreased to $3.72 for the 2016 second quarter compared to $4.39 for the 2015 second quarter. These
decreases primarily resulted from curtailed spending and reduced service costs being realized in response to
depressed commodity prices, increased availability and use of water gathering and recycling facilities over
the prior year period, and a higher portion of our production coming from natural gas wells in Oklahoma
which typically have lower operating costs compared to crude oil wells in the Bakken.
Production Taxes and Other Expenses. Production taxes and other expenses decreased $22.4 million, or
36%, to $39.1 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $61.5 million for the second quarter of 2015
primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas revenues resulting from decreases in commodity prices over
the prior year period. Production taxes are generally based on the wellhead values of production and vary by
state. Production taxes as a percentage of crude oil and natural gas revenues were 7.4% for the second
quarter of 2016 compared to 7.8% for the second quarter of 2015, the decrease of which resulted from
significant growth over the past year in our STACK, Northwest Cana and SCOOP operations and resulting
increase in revenues coming from Oklahoma, which has lower production tax rates compared to North
Dakota. We expect our average production tax rate for the remainder of 2016 will continue to trend lower than
2015 levels as our operations in Oklahoma continue to grow in significance and given the passing of

legislation in North Dakota in 2015 that decreased the combined production tax rate from 11.5% to 10.0% of
crude oil revenues in North Dakota effective January 1, 2016.     
Exploration Expenses. Exploration expenses consist primarily of dry hole costs and exploratory geological
and geophysical costs that are expensed as incurred. The following table shows the components of
exploration expenses for the periods presented.

Exploration expenses
The increase in geological and geophysical expenses in the 2016 second quarter was due to changes in the
timing and amount of costs incurred by the Company and billed to joint interest owners between periods.
Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion (“DD&A”). Total DD&A decreased $11.2 million, or 2%,
to $441.8 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $453.0 million for the second quarter of 2015
primarily due to a 5% decrease in total sales volumes. The following table shows the components of our
DD&A on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.

Estimated proved reserves are a key component in our computation of DD&A expense. Holding all other
factors constant, if proved reserves are revised downward, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would
increase. Downward revisions of proved reserves in 2016 prompted by depressed commodity prices
contributed to an increase in our DD&A rate for crude oil and natural gas properties in the second quarter of
2016 compared to the prior year period. If commodity prices decline further, additional downward revisions of
proved reserves may occur in the future, which may be significant and would result in an increase in our
DD&A rate. We are unable to predict the timing and amount of future reserve revisions or the impact such
revisions may have on our future DD&A rate.
Property Impairments. Total property impairments decreased $10.8 million, or 14%, to $66.1 million for the
2016 second quarter compared to $76.9 million for the 2015 second quarter. There were no proved property
impairments recognized in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $5.0 million of such impairments in the
second quarter of 2015. This decrease resulted from differences in the timing and severity of commodity price
declines and resulting impact on fair value assessments and impairments between periods. As a result of the
impairments and DD&A recognized to date coupled with an improvement in commodity prices in June 2016,
our proved properties are carried at values that did not exceed estimated future net cash flows at June 30,
2016 and required no impairment during the 2016 second quarter.

Estimated reserves are a key component in assessing proved properties for impairment. If commodity prices
decline further, downward revisions of reserves may be significant in the future and could result in
impairments of proved properties in the remainder of 2016. We are unable to predict the timing and amount of
future reserve revisions or the impact such revisions may have on future impairments, if any.    
Impairments of non-producing properties decreased $5.7 million, or 8%, to $66.1 million for the 2016 second
quarter compared to $71.8 million for the 2015 second quarter. The decrease was due to a lower balance of
unamortized leasehold costs in the current year due in part to reduced land capital expenditures along with
changes in the timing and magnitude of amortization of undeveloped leasehold costs between periods
resulting from changes in the Company's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed
before lease expiration.
General and Administrative ("G&A") Expenses. Total G&A expenses decreased $7.9 million, or 18%, to

expenses include non-cash charges for equity compensation of $11.8 million and $16.2 million for the
second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. G&A expenses other than equity compensation totaled
$24.4 million for the 2016 second quarter, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 13%, compared to the 2015 second
quarter.

Total general and administrative expenses $ 1.82
The decrease in G&A expenses other than equity compensation was primarily due to a reduction in
employee related costs and other efforts to reduce spending in response to depressed commodity prices.
The decrease in equity compensation expense was primarily due to an increase in the estimated rate of
forfeitures of unvested restricted stock based on historical experience, which resulted in lower recognition of
expense in 2016.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $3.5 million, or 4%, to $81.9 million for the second quarter of
2016 compared to $78.4 million for the second quarter of 2015 due to an increase in our weighted average
outstanding long-term debt obligations and higher borrowing costs incurred on our credit facility and three-
year term loan resulting from downgrades of our credit rating in February 2016. Our weighted average
outstanding long-term debt balance for the 2016 second quarter was approximately $7.3 billion with a
weighted average interest rate of 4.3% compared to averages of $7.1 billion and 4.3% for the 2015 second
quarter. The increase in outstanding debt resulted from borrowings incurred subsequent to June 30, 2015 to
fund our capital spending.
Income Taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit for the second quarter of 2016 of $72.6 million compared
to income tax expense of $4.1 million for the second quarter of 2015, resulting in effective tax rates of
approximately 38% and 91%, respectively, after taking into account permanent taxable differences and
valuation allowances. For the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, we provided for income taxes at a
combined federal and state tax rate of 38% of pre-tax income (loss) generated by our operations in the United
States. Our effective tax rate for the 2015 second quarter was increased by a $1.3 million valuation
allowance recognized against deferred tax assets associated with $6.4 million of operating loss
carryforwards generated by our Canadian subsidiary in the 2015 second quarter for which we do not believe
we will realize a benefit.

The 4% decrease in crude oil production for year to date 2016 was driven by decreased production from our
properties in North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken and the Red River units due to a combination of natural
declines in production and reduced drilling and completion activities in those areas. North Dakota Bakken
crude oil production decreased 1,001 MBbls, or 5%, and Montana Bakken production decreased 607 MBbls,
or 28%, while production in the Red River units decreased 275 MBbls, or 13%, over the prior year period.

in the STACK/Northwest Cana and SCOOP plays which increased 503 MBbls and 378 MBbls, respectively,
due to additional wells being completed and producing resulting from a shift in our well completion activities
away from the Bakken to higher rate-of-return areas in Oklahoma.
The 23% increase in natural gas production for year to date 2016 was driven by increased production from
our properties in the STACK/Northwest Cana and SCOOP plays due to additional wells being completed
and producing subsequent to June 30, 2015. Natural gas production in STACK/Northwest Cana increased
6,771 MMcf, or 173%, and SCOOP production increased 7,236 MMcf, or 17%, over the prior year period.
Additionally, North Dakota Bakken production increased 3,942 MMcf, or 17%, due to an increase in gas
capture from non-operated properties and resulting increase in volumes produced and delivered to market.
These increases were partially offset by decreases in production from various areas in our North and South
regions primarily due to natural declines in production.
Our reduction in capital spending and deferral of certain well completion activities has adversely impacted
our rate of production and our 4% growth in total production realized for year to date 2016 compared to year
to date 2015 is not expected to be sustained for the remainder of 2016. We expect our rate of production to
slow for the remainder of 2016 and may average between 210,000 and 220,000 Boe per day for the full year
of 2016 compared to average daily production of 221,715 Boe per day for full year 2015.
Revenues
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Sales. Crude oil and natural gas sales for year to date 2016 were $929.3 million,
a 32% decrease from sales of $1.37 billion for the same period in 2015 due to a significant decrease in
commodity prices partially offset by an increase in total sales volumes.
Our crude oil sales prices averaged $31.76 per barrel for year to date 2016, a decrease of 29% compared to
$44.46 for year to date 2015 due to lower crude oil market prices. The differential between NYMEX WTI
calendar month average crude oil prices and our realized crude oil price per barrel for year to date 2016 was
$7.51 per barrel compared to $9.05 for year to date 2015. The improved differential was due to increased use
of pipeline transportation to move our North region crude oil to market with less dependence on more costly
rail transportation, along with significant growth in our South region production which typically has lower
transportation costs compared to the Bakken due to its relatively close proximity to regional refineries and the
crude oil trading hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.
Our natural gas sales prices averaged $1.33 per Mcf for year to date 2016, a 46% decrease compared to
$2.48 for year to date 2015 due to lower market prices for natural gas and NGLs along with the amendment of
certain natural gas sales agreements in 2016. The difference between our realized natural gas sales prices
and NYMEX Henry Hub calendar month natural gas prices was a discount of $0.69 per Mcf for year to date
2016 compared to a discount of $0.31 per Mcf for the comparable 2015 period. NGL prices in the first half of
2016 remained depressed in conjunction with low crude oil prices, which, along with our amended natural
gas sales agreements, reduced the value of our natural gas sales stream and unfavorably impacted the
difference between our realized prices and Henry Hub benchmark pricing. If NGL prices do not recover from
current levels, the prices we receive for the sale of our natural gas stream for the remainder of 2016 may
continue to be lower than Henry Hub benchmark prices.     
For year to date 2016, our crude oil sales volumes decreased 5% from the comparable 2015 period, while
our natural gas sales volumes increased 23%, reflecting the shift in our well completion activities away from
oil-weighted properties in the Bakken to areas in Oklahoma with higher concentrations of liquids-rich natural
gas.
At various times we have stored crude oil due to pipeline line fill requirements, low commodity prices, or
marketing disruptions or we have sold crude oil from inventory. These actions result in differences between
produced and sold crude oil volumes and caused crude oil sales volumes to be lower than crude oil
production by 80 MBbls for year to date 2016.
Derivatives. Changes in natural gas prices during the six months ended June 30, 2016 had an unfavorable
impact on the fair value of our natural gas derivatives, which resulted in negative revenue adjustments of
$40.1 million for the period, representing $118.1 million of non-cash losses on derivatives partially offset by
$78.0 million of cash gains. 
Operating Costs and Expenses
Production Expenses. Production expenses decreased $32.0 million, or 17%, from $184.7 million for year to
date 2015 to $152.7 million for year to date 2016. Production expenses on a per-Boe basis decreased to
$3.74 for year to date 2016 compared to $4.70 for the comparable 2015 period. These decreases primarily
resulted from curtailed spending and reduced service costs being realized in response to depressed
commodity prices, increased availability and use of water gathering and recycling facilities over the prior year
period, and a higher portion of our production coming from natural gas wells in Oklahoma which typically
have lower operating costs compared to crude oil wells in the Bakken.

Production Taxes and Other Expenses. Production taxes and other expenses decreased $40.3 million, or
37%, to $69.6 million for year to date 2016 compared to $109.9 million for year to date 2015 primarily due to
lower crude oil and natural gas revenues resulting from decreases in commodity prices over the prior year
period. Production taxes as a percentage of crude oil and natural gas revenues were 7.5% for year to date
2016 compared to 8.0% for year to date 2015, the decrease of which resulted from significant growth over the

in Oklahoma continue to grow in significance and given the passing of legislation in North Dakota in 2015
that decreased the combined production tax rate from 11.5% to 10.0% of crude oil revenues in North Dakota

The increase in our DD&A rate for crude oil and natural gas properties in the current period resulted from
downward revisions of proved reserves at year-end 2015 and in 2016 prompted by depressed commodity
prices. If commodity prices decline further, additional downward revisions of proved reserves may occur in
the future, which may be significant and would result in an increase in our DD&A rate. We are unable to
predict the timing and amount of future reserve revisions or the impact such revisions may have on our future
DD&A rate.
Property Impairments. Total property impairments decreased $79.4 million, or 35%, to $145.0 million for year
to date 2016 compared to $224.4 million for year to date 2015 primarily due to a decrease in proved property
impairments. There were no proved property impairments recognized for year to date 2016 compared to
$75.0 million of such impairments for year to date 2015. This decrease resulted from differences in the timing
and severity of commodity price declines and resulting impact on fair value assessments and impairments
between periods. The prolonged decrease in commodity prices in 2015 triggered significant impairments of
proved properties throughout 2015. As a result of the impairments and DD&A recognized to date coupled
with an improvement in commodity prices in June 2016, our proved properties are carried at values that did
not exceed estimated future net cash flows at June 30, 2016 and required no impairment during the six month
period.
If commodity prices decline further, downward revisions of reserves may be significant in the future and could
result in impairments of proved properties in the remainder of 2016. We are unable to predict the timing and
amount of future reserve revisions or the impact such revisions may have on future impairments, if any.
General and Administrative Expenses. Total G&A expenses decreased $20.9 million, or 23%, to $68.7
million for year to date 2016 from $89.6 million for the comparable period in 2015. Total G&A expenses
include non-cash charges for equity compensation of $21.0 million and $27.4 million for year to date 2016
and year to date 2015, respectively. G&A expenses other than equity compensation totaled $47.7 million for
year to date 2016, a decrease of $14.5 million, or 23%, compared to the comparable 2015 period.

Total general and administrative expenses $ 1.68
The decrease in G&A expenses other than equity compensation was primarily due to a reduction in
employee related costs and other efforts to reduce spending in response to depressed commodity prices.
The decrease in equity compensation expense was primarily due to an increase in the estimated rate of
forfeitures of unvested restricted stock based on historical experience, which resulted in lower recognition of
expense in 2016.
Interest Expense. Year to date interest expense increased $9.4 million, or 6%, to $162.9 million compared to
$153.5 million for the comparable 2015 period due to an increase in our weighted average outstanding long-
term debt obligations and higher borrowing costs incurred on our credit facility and three-year term loan
resulting from downgrades of our credit rating in February 2016. Our weighted average outstanding long-term
debt balance for year to date 2016 was approximately $7.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of
4.3% compared to averages of $6.7 billion and 4.5% for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in
outstanding debt resulted from borrowings incurred subsequent to June 30, 2015 to fund our capital
spending.
Income Taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $194.0 million
compared to a benefit of $49.9 million for the prior year period, resulting in effective tax rates of approximately
38% and 27%, respectively, after taking into account permanent taxable differences and valuation
allowances. For year to date 2016 and 2015, we provided for income taxes at a combined federal and state
tax rate of 38% of pre-tax losses generated by our operations in the United States. Our 2015 effective tax rate
was reduced by a $12.4 million valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets associated with
$50.2 million of operating loss carryforwards generated by our Canadian subsidiary in the first half of 2015 for
which we do not believe we will realize a benefit.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash flows generated from operating activities,
financing provided by our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities. At June 30,
2016, we had $16.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.86 billion of borrowing
availability on our revolving credit facility after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. We
are focused on balancing our 2016 capital spending with cash flows in order to minimize new borrowings
and maintain ample liquidity. At July 31, 2016, outstanding borrowings totaled $820 million with
approximately $1.93 billion of borrowing availability on our credit facility after considering outstanding
borrowings and letters of credit.
Based on our 2016 capital expenditure budget, our forecasted cash flows and projected levels of
indebtedness, we expect to maintain compliance with the covenants under our revolving credit facility, three-
year term loan, and senior note indentures for at least the next 12 months. Further, we expect to meet in the
ordinary course of business other contractual cash commitments to third parties as of June 30, 2016,
including those described in Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, recognizing we may be required to meet such commitments even if our
business plan assumptions were to change.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Our net cash provided by operating activities was $497.7 million and $916.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to lower
crude oil and natural gas revenues driven by lower realized commodity prices, partially offset by lower
production expenses, production taxes, and general and administrative expenses and an increase in cash
gains on matured natural gas derivatives.
If the commodity price environment existing in the second quarter of 2016 persists or worsens and our rate of
production continues to slow, we expect our operating cash flows for the remainder of 2016 will continue to
be lower than 2015 levels, the extent of which is uncertain due to the unpredictable nature of commodity
prices.
27
Cash flows used in investing activities
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we had cash flows used in investing activities
(excluding proceeds from asset sales) of $630.0 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, related to our capital
program, inclusive of dry hole costs and property acquisitions. Property acquisitions totaled $14.3 million and
$43.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in capital
spending was driven by a decrease in our capital budget and related drilling activity for 2016. Our cash
capital expenditures for 2016 include the payment of amounts owed at December 31, 2015 in connection
with our 2015 drilling program and associated $86.5 million decrease in accruals for capital expenditures for
the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The use of cash for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was partially offset by
$112.2 million of proceeds received from asset dispositions primarily related to the April 2016 sale of non-
core undeveloped leasehold acreage in Wyoming for proceeds of $110.0 million.
We expect our capital spending for the remainder of 2016 will continue to be lower than 2015 levels due to
the significant decrease in our budgeted capital spending to $920 million for 2016, a reduction of 63%
compared to $2.5 billion of capital spending in 2015.
Cash flows from financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $25.2 million primarily
resulting from net borrowings of $32 million on our revolving credit facility during the period. The net increase
in borrowings was comprised of $87 million of net borrowings in the 2016 first quarter partially offset by $55
million of net repayments in the 2016 second quarter. The second quarter net repayments resulted from a
$110.0 million reduction of credit facility debt using proceeds from the sale of undeveloped leasehold
acreage in Wyoming in April 2016, partially offset by additional borrowings during the quarter.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $1.05 billion primarily
resulting from $1.06 billion of net borrowings on our revolving credit facility during that period.
We are seeking to generally balance our 2016 capital expenditures with cash flows to minimize new
borrowings in 2016.
Future Sources of Financing
Although we cannot provide any assurance, we believe funds from operating cash flows, our remaining cash
balance and availability under our revolving credit facility should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements
inclusive of, but not limited to, normal operating needs, debt service obligations, planned capital
expenditures, and commitments for at least the next 12 months.
Our 2016 capital expenditures budget has been established based on an expectation of available cash
flows, with any cash flow deficiencies expected to be funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
If cash flows are materially impacted by declines in commodity prices, we have the ability to reduce our
capital expenditures or utilize the availability of our revolving credit facility if needed to fund our operations.
We may choose to access the capital markets for additional financing or capital to take advantage of
business opportunities that may arise if such financing can be arranged on favorable terms. Additionally, we
may choose to sell assets or enter into strategic joint development opportunities in order to obtain funding for
our operations and capital program.
We currently anticipate we will be able to generate or obtain funds sufficient to meet our short-term and long-
term cash requirements. We intend to fund future capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from
operations and through borrowings under our revolving credit facility, but we may also issue debt or equity
securities or sell assets. The issuance of additional debt requires a portion of our cash flows from operations
be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to
fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The issuance of additional equity securities
could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock.
28
Revolving credit facility
We have an unsecured revolving credit facility, maturing on May 16, 2019, with aggregate lender
commitments totaling $2.75 billion, which may be increased up to a total of $4.0 billion upon agreement
between the Company and participating lenders. The commitments are from a syndicate of 17 banks and
financial institutions. We believe each member of the current syndicate has the capability to fund its
commitment. As of July 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.93 billion of borrowing availability on our credit
facility after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings bear interest at market-
based interest rates plus a margin based on the terms of the borrowing and the credit ratings assigned to our
senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness.
The commitments under our revolving credit facility are not dependent on a borrowing base calculation
subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves.
Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating, such as the
downgrades by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's")
that occurred in February 2016 in response to weakened oil and gas industry conditions, do not trigger a
reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or
change in covenants. The downgrades of our credit rating did, however, trigger a 0.250% increase in our
credit facility's interest rate and a 0.075% increase in the rate of commitment fees paid on unused borrowing
availability under our credit facility.
Our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things,
incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and merge,
consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility also contains a requirement that we
maintain a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. This ratio
represents the ratio of net debt (calculated as total face value of debt plus outstanding letters of credit less
cash and cash equivalents) divided by the sum of net debt plus total shareholders' equity plus, to the extent
resulting in a reduction of total shareholders’ equity, the amount of any non-cash impairment charges
incurred, net of any tax effect, after June 30, 2014.
We were in compliance with our revolving credit facility covenants at June 30, 2016 and expect to maintain
compliance for at least the next 12 months. At June 30, 2016, our consolidated net debt to total capitalization
ratio, as defined in our revolving credit facility as amended, was 0.59 to 1.00. As we continue to focus on
balancing our 2016 capital spending with cash flows to minimize new borrowings, we do not believe the
revolving credit facility covenants are reasonably likely to limit our ability to undertake additional debt
financing to a material extent if needed to support our business. At June 30, 2016, our total debt would have
needed to independently increase by approximately $2.2 billion, or 31%, above existing levels at that date
(with no corresponding increase in cash or reduction in refinanced debt) to reach the maximum covenant
ratio of 0.65 to 1.00. Alternatively, our total shareholders' equity would have needed to independently
decrease by approximately $1.2 billion (excluding the after-tax impact of any non-cash impairment charges),
or 27% below existing levels at June 30, 2016 to reach the maximum covenant ratio. These independent
point-in-time sensitivities do not take into account other factors that could arise to mitigate the impact of
changes in debt and equity on our consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio, such as disposing of
assets or exploring alternative sources of capitalization.
Joint development agreement funding
In September 2014, we entered into an agreement with a U.S. subsidiary of SK E&S Co. Ltd ("SK") of South
Korea to jointly develop a significant portion of the Company's Northwest Cana natural gas properties.
Pursuant to the agreement SK will fund, or carry, 50% of our drilling and completion costs attributable to an
area of mutual interest within our Northwest Cana properties until approximately $270 million has been
expended by SK on our behalf. As of June 30, 2016, approximately $175 million of the carry to be expended
by SK on our behalf had yet to be realized and is expected to be realized through 2019.
Proceeds from pending sale of assets
On August 2, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell non-strategic producing and non-producing
properties in the SCOOP play in Oklahoma to a third party for cash proceeds of $281 million. The disposition
is expected to close in October 2016. We expect to use the sales proceeds to reduce outstanding debt.
29
Future Capital Requirements
Senior notes
Our long-term debt includes outstanding senior note obligations totaling $5.8 billion at June 30, 2016. We
have no near-term senior note maturities, with our earliest scheduled maturity being our $200 million of 2020
Notes due in October 2020. Our senior notes are not subject to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund
requirements. For further information on the face values, maturity dates, semi-annual interest payment dates,
optional redemption periods and covenant restrictions related to our senior notes, refer to Note 6. Long-Term
Debt in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
We were in compliance with our senior note covenants at June 30, 2016 and expect to maintain compliance
for at least the next 12 months. We do not believe the senior note covenants will materially limit our ability to
undertake additional debt financing. Downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to the credit
ratings assigned to our senior unsecured debt, such as the downgrades by S&P and Moody's that occurred
in February 2016, do not trigger additional senior note covenants.
Two of our subsidiaries, Banner Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and CLR Asset Holdings, LLC, which have no
material assets or operations, fully and unconditionally guarantee the senior notes on a joint and several
basis. Our other subsidiaries, the value of whose assets and operations are minor, do not guarantee the
senior notes as of June 30, 2016.
Term loan
We have a $500 million unsecured term loan that matures in full in November 2018 and bears interest at
variable market-based interest rates plus a margin based on the terms of the borrowing and the credit ratings
assigned to the Company's senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness. Downgrades or other negative rating
actions with respect to our credit rating, such as the S&P and Moody's downgrades that occurred in February
2016, do not trigger a security requirement or change in covenants for the term loan. The February 2016
downgrades of our credit rating did, however, trigger a 0.125% increase in our term loan's interest rate. The
interest rate on the term loan was 1.95% at June 30, 2016.
Capital expenditures
We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell crude oil and natural gas properties and expect to participate
as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek acquisitions that utilize our technical expertise or
offer opportunities to expand our existing core areas. Acquisition expenditures are not budgeted.
Our capital expenditures budget for 2016 is $920 million excluding acquisitions, which is expected to be
allocated as follows:

Our non-acquisition capital spending budget for 2016 has been set based on an expectation of available
cash flows and is designed to target capital expenditures and cash flows being relatively balanced for 2016
at an assumed average WTI benchmark crude oil price of approximately $37 per barrel for the year, with any
cash flow deficiencies being funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Over the six months
ended June 30, 2016, WTI crude oil benchmark prices have averaged approximately $40 per barrel.
The actual amount and timing of our capital expenditures may differ materially from our budget as a result of,
among other things, access to capital, available cash flows, unbudgeted acquisitions, actual drilling results,
the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of transportation capacity,
changes in commodity prices, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. We monitor our
capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and may continue to scale back our
spending should commodity prices decrease from current levels. Conversely, an increase in commodity
prices could result in increased capital expenditures. We expect to continue participating as a buyer of
properties when and if we have the ability to increase our position in strategic plays at competitive terms.
Commitments
Refer to Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of certain future commitments of the Company as of June 30, 2016. We believe
our cash flows from operations, our remaining cash balance, and amounts available under our revolving
credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our commitments.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
Currently, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance
liquidity and capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K.
ITEM 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
General. We are exposed to a variety of market risks including commodity price risk, credit risk, and interest
rate risk. We seek to address these risks through a program of risk management which may include the use
of derivative instruments.
Commodity Price Risk. Our primary market risk exposure is in the prices we receive from sales of our crude
oil and natural gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude
oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production. Pricing for crude oil and natural gas has
been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The
prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, including volatility in the
differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index prices. Based on our average
daily production for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and excluding any effect of our derivative
instruments in place, our annual revenue would increase or decrease by approximately $510 million for each
$10.00 per barrel change in crude oil prices at June 30, 2016 and $187 million for each $1.00 per Mcf
change in natural gas prices at June 30, 2016.
To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices, from time to time we
may economically hedge a portion of our anticipated crude oil and natural gas production as part of our risk
management program. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between derivative
contract index prices and those of our physical pricing points. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps
secure funds for our capital program. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our
production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. We may choose not to hedge
future production if the price environment for certain time periods is deemed to be unfavorable. Additionally,
we may choose to liquidate existing derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities
in order to monetize gain positions for the purpose of funding our capital program. While hedging, if utilized,
limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it also limits future revenues from upward price
movements. Our crude oil production and sales for the remainder of 2016 and beyond are currently
unhedged and directly exposed to continued volatility in crude oil market prices, whether favorable or
unfavorable.
Changes in natural gas prices during the six months ended June 30, 2016 had an overall unfavorable impact
on the fair value of our derivative instruments. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized cash
gains on natural gas derivatives of $78.0 million which were more than offset by non-cash mark-to-market
losses on natural gas derivatives of $118.1 million.
31
The fair value of our natural gas derivative instruments at June 30, 2016 was a net liability of $16.9 million.
An assumed increase in the forward prices used in the June 30, 2016 valuation of our natural gas derivatives
of $1.00 per MMBtu would increase our natural gas derivative liability to approximately $161 million at
June 30, 2016. Conversely, an assumed decrease in forward prices of $1.00 per MMBtu would change our
natural gas derivative valuation to a net asset of approximately $120 million at June 30, 2016.
Credit Risk. We monitor our risk of loss due to non-performance by counterparties of their contractual
obligations. Our principal exposure to credit risk is through the sale of our crude oil and natural gas
production, which we market to energy marketing companies, crude oil refining companies, and natural gas
gathering and processing companies ($385 million in receivables at June 30, 2016), our joint interest
receivables ($261 million at June 30, 2016), and counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative
instrument receivables ($20 million at June 30, 2016).
We monitor our exposure to counterparties on crude oil and natural gas sales primarily by reviewing credit
ratings, financial statements and payment history. We extend credit terms based on our evaluation of each
counterparty’s credit worthiness. We have not generally required our counterparties to provide collateral to
secure crude oil and natural gas sales receivables owed to us. Historically, our credit losses on crude oil and
natural gas sales receivables have been immaterial.
Joint interest receivables arise from billing the individuals and entities who own a partial interest in the wells
we operate. These individuals and entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in
leases included in units on which we wish to drill. We can do very little to choose who participates in our
wells. In order to minimize our exposure to this credit risk we generally request prepayment of drilling costs
where it is allowed by contract or state law. For such prepayments, a liability is recorded and subsequently
reduced as the associated work is performed. This liability was $85 million at June 30, 2016, which will be
used to offset future capital costs when billed. In this manner, we reduce credit risk. We may have the right to
place a lien on our co-owners interest in the well to redirect production proceeds in order to secure payment
or, if necessary, foreclose on the interest. Historically, our credit losses on joint interest receivables have
been immaterial.
Our use of derivative instruments involves the risk that our counterparties will be unable to meet their
commitments under the arrangements. We manage this risk by using multiple counterparties who we
consider to be financially strong in order to minimize our exposure to credit risk with any individual
counterparty.
Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to any variable-rate borrowings
we may have outstanding from time to time under our revolving credit facility and three-year term loan. Such
borrowings bear interest at market-based interest rates plus a margin based on the terms of the borrowing
and the credit ratings assigned to our senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness. In February 2016, our
corporate credit rating was downgraded by S&P and Moody's in response to weakened oil and gas industry
conditions and resulting revisions made to rating agency commodity price assumptions. These downgrades
caused the interest rates on our revolving credit facility borrowings and three-year term loan to increase by
0.250% and 0.125%, respectively. All of our other long-term indebtedness is fixed rate and does not expose
us to the risk of cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates.
We manage our interest rate exposure by monitoring both the effects of market changes in interest rates and
the proportion of our debt portfolio that is variable-rate versus fixed-rate debt. We may utilize interest rate
derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt
issues. Interest rate derivatives may be used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the
overall leverage of the debt portfolio. We currently have no interest rate derivatives.
We had an aggregate of $1.32 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility
and three-year term loan at July 31, 2016. The impact of a 0.25% increase in interest rates on this amount of
debt would result in increased interest expense of approximately $3.3 million per year and a $2.0 million
decrease in net income per year.
ITEM 4.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016 to ensure information
required to be disclosed in the reports it files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and information
required to
32
be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Controls and Procedures
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance that the
objectives of the internal control system are met.
