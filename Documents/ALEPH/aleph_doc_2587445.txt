1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1  Introduction
EBA Engineering Consultants Ltd. operating as EBA, A Tetra Tech Company (EBA) has prepared this Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) for SilverCrest Mines Inc.
(SilverCrest, SVL) of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for the Santa Elena Mine, located in central Sonora, Mexico.  Nusantara de Mexico S.A. de C.V.,
a 100% owned Mexican subsidiary and a legal operating entity of SilverCrest, holds the rights to the Santa Elena Mine.  The effective date of this report is
April 30, 2013.
 
The Santa Elena Mine is currently producing gold and silver from a 2,500 tonne per day open pit and heap leaching operation, which declared commercial
production in July of 2011.  The Santa Elena Expansion Project involves combined processing of ore from the remaining reserves in the open pit, new
reserves from underground development and reprocessing of spent ore from the existing heap leach pad in a new milling and processing plant.  Construction
of  a  3,000  tonne  per  day  mill  and  plant  facility  is  currently  underway  on  the  property.  An  underground  exploration  decline  is  being  developed  and  has
intersected the main mineralized zone (MMZ) at an elevation of 625 metres above sea level.
 
The  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  document  a  PFS  completed  for  the  Santa  Elena  Expansion  Project  and  support  recent  Mineral  Resource  and  Mineral
Reserve Estimates announced on May 29, 2013.
 
This  report  conforms  to  National  Instrument  43-101  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects  (NI  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1),  and  incorporates  the
Canadian Institute for Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM Definition Standards).
1.2  Santa Elena Updated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
The updated Probable Reserves (underground, open pit and leach pad) are estimated at 8.2 million tonnes grading 74.9 gpt Ag and 1.24 gpt Au, containing
19.7 million ounces of silver and 327,430 ounces of gold. This represents a 103% increase in contained silver and 50% increase in contained gold over
previous Probable Reserves (Table 1.2). Updated Indicated Resources (exclusive of Probable Reserves) are estimated at 2.1 million tonnes grading 114.9
gpt Ag and 1.69 gpt Au, containing 7.9 million ounce of silver and 116,000 ounces of gold. This represents a 127% increase in contained silver and 99%
increase in contained gold over previous Indicated Resources.

 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Note: All numbers are rounded. Underground and Leach Pad Reserves and Resources are based on 3 year historic metal price trends of US$28/oz silver,
US$1450/oz gold and metallurgical recoveries of 92% Au and 67.5% Ag with a metal ratio of Ag:Au at 70:1 used for grade cut-off determination . All Mineral
Resources and Reserves conform to NI 43-101 and CIM definitions for Resources and Reserves. Inferred Resources have been estimated from geological
evidence and limited sampling and must be treated with a lower level of confidence than Indicated Resources.
1 Open Pit and Leach Pad Probable Reserves were classified by SilverCrest.  Underground Reserves and Resources were classified by EBA, a Tetra Tech
Company.
2 Underground  Probable  Reserve  is  based  on  a  cut-off  grade  of  1.47  gpt  AuEq  with  an  average  10%  dilution  and  90%  mine  recovery.    Average  true
thickness of the designed stopes is 13.4 metres.
3 Open Pit Reserve is based on a cut-off grade of 0.20 gpt AuEq in a constrained pit shell with applied capping of 8 gpt Au and 300 gpt Ag.
4 Leach Pad Reserve based on production and drill hole data for volumetrics and grade model using a cut-off grade of 0.5 gpt AuEq. No capping was
applied.
5 Underground Resources are exclusive of Probable Reserves and based on 1 gpt AuEq grade shell, a cut-off grade of 1.4 gpt AuEq, and applied capping of
12 gpt Au and 600 gpt Ag.

The updated underground Reserves and Resources have been independently estimated by EBA utilizing 2012 and 2013 drilling results along with previous
independently-validated data (see SEDAR for previous NI 43-101 compliant Technical Reports). Drilling in 2012 and early 2013 was focused on conversion
and expansion of underground Resources to Reserves with an average drill hole spacing of approximately 35 metres. Drilling data from 2012 and 2013 used
for underground Resource estimate included 135 holes (48,980 metres) and 96 previous holes (14,865 metres). A total of 2,676 composite samples were
used as the basis for the block model.
 
The updated open pit Reserves and Resources have been estimated by SilverCrest utilizing extensive production data (blastholes), exploration drilling data
and computer modelling. All Indicated Resources in the currently operating open pit have been converted to Reserves as of April 30, 2013.
 
The Leach Pad Reserves (spent ore) have been estimated by SilverCrest utilizing crusher composite samples, drill data from verification holes on the pad,
bottle roll tests to process design specifications and SilverCrest production leach curves. In early May 2013, the Company completed 25 large diameter drill
holes (355 metres) on the pad to obtain additional information for the purposes of validation of production data. All spent ore material on the leach pad will be
reprocessed through the new processing facility once operational. Only the material currently on the pad and leached (300 day cycle completed or estimated
full  cycle)  has  been  declared  as  Mineral  Reserves.  Approximately  750,000  tonnes  of  open  pit  material  is  planned  to  be  placed  on  the  pad  during  the
remainder of 2013 and will undergo only partial leaching before being reprocessed through the new facility. Once this material is placed on the pad and
leaching has been discontinued, it will be declared as leach pad Reserves for processing and metal recovery in late 2014 and beyond.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Before production commenced, the Santa Elena open pit defined a mine life of approximately 6.5 years (including ramp up) having a Reserve of 5.1 million
tonnes  grading  1.72  gpt  Au  and  73.4  gpt  Ag  (refer  to  Technical  Report  dated  April  1,  2011).  In  April  2011,  the  open  pit  Reserve  was  depleted  by
approximately 6 months of production and optimized with the remaining 4.79 million tonnes grading 1.81 gpt Au and 75.9 gpt Ag (reported in Technical
Report dated April 1, 2011).  By January 2012, the open pit was depleted from 2011 production and re-optimized with a resultant Reserve of 3.45 million
tonnes grading 1.96 gpt Au and 87.3 gpt Ag showing lesser tonnes and higher grade. Re-optimization of the open pit between April 2011 and April 2013 has
reclassified approximately 880,000 tonnes of open pit Reserve to underground Resources which was converted mostly (excluding stope pillars) to the new
underground Reserves. The main purpose for re-optimization was to avoid a higher open pit strip ratio at higher cost in future years in the mine life but still be
able to mine the displaced Reserves from underground.
 
Extensive metallurgical test work including ongoing operations data show that all declared Reserves are amenable to conventional leaching either by heap
leach technology or standard CCD milling with a Merrill Crowe recovery system for doré bar production. Estimated recovery grades are stated in Table 1.3
below, and in Section 1.5.

1.3  Mining Methods
The Santa Elena ore body varies in dip and thickness along strike and at depth. As a result, three well established underground mining methods have been
selected for ore extraction. These mining methods are categorized in Table 1.4 below:
 
Table 1.4: Mining Method Selection Criteria
Orebody Geometry
Dip > 50 degrees, Thickness < 15m
Dip > 50 degrees, Thickness > 15m
Dip < 50 Degrees, Any Thickness
Mining Method
Longitudinal Long hole Stoping
Transverse Long hole Stoping
Mechanized Cut and Fill
In general, conventional mechanised mining methods have been selected.  The basis of the development of the mining methods and consequent equipment
selection  has  been  that  SilverCrest  will  undertake  production  drilling,  blasting  and  loading  using  a  contractor  for  the  waste  rock  and  ore  haulage  to
surface.  Initially a contractor will be retained to carry out mine development, with jumbo drill rigs purchased later in the mining life, after which development
will be done in house. Approximately 69% of stoping will be by long hole method and 31% by cut and fill methods. Most long hole stopes are produced early
in the mine schedule. Average stope width is 13.4 metres.
 
Conventional open pit mining will continue using a contractor until the third quarter of 2014 when open pit reserves are depleted. Mining of the heap leach
spent ore will be completed by loader and conveyor to transport material to the plant.
The mining schedule estimates the tonnages to be mined from the underground, open pit and the existing heap leach facility to feed the expansion plan
1.4  Mining Schedule
process plant at a nominal rate of 3,000 tpd.  Table 1.5 shows the combined schedule for the Santa Elena Expansion Project. The schedule is based on
optimizing higher grade long hole stopes first, with more costly cut and fill mining left for later in the mine life.

these tonnes and estimated remaining ounces will be added to the schedule for additional mine life.
1.4.1  Underground Production
For the purpose of this PFS, an underground mining schedule has been developed for the stopes in the reserve model and for development required to
access the stopes throughout the life of mine. The mining schedule results in grade and tonnage performance as shown in Figure 1.1. Peak production is
reached in year 6, when both access ramps are actively producing.

1.5  Recovery Methods
The ore from both underground and open pit resources will be processed by conventional cyanide leaching technology. In addition partially leached material
from the existing heap leach operations will be blended with underground ore at a variable rate and reprocessed through the same plant.
 
Santa Elena ore (Open Pit, Underground and Leach Pad) contains an estimated 1.24 g/t Au and 75 g/t Ag and after crushing and grinding can be leached in
cyanide to yield approximately 92% Au Recovery and 67.5% Ag recovery. Because of the relatively high level of silver in the ore (and hence solutions) there
are  advantages  and  benefits  to  using  traditional  CCD  and  Merrill-Crowe  for  metal  recovery  rather  than  CIL/CIP.  The  partially  leached  heap  ore  yields
recoveries of approximately 52% Au and 29% Ag when crushed to 10 mm and processed on the heap leach (partial leach cycle to Q1 2014).  On re-leaching
after grinding in the new plant, the balance of the metals are recovered to the level expected from new ore from open pit and underground.
 
The process plant has been designed to treat a nominal 3000 tonne per day (tpd) of ore, a mixture of freshly mined material and partially leached heap leach
residue.  The plant has been designed to treat any proportion of these two types of feed.  Because this may include up to 100% fine crushed material from the
heap leach pads it was considered that this would be unsuitable feed for a SAG milling circuit and it was elected to use a conventional crushing and grinding
circuit.
1.6  Project Infrastructure
The Santa Elena open pit heap leach mine was constructed in late 2009 and 2010, and has been operational since 2010. There are a number of facilities
currently in use at the Santa Elena site, and construction is currently underway for the new processing plant and underground mine.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Much of the same infrastructure facilities utilized for the open pit mine will continue to be used for the expansion project, including, but not limited to, access
roads, waste dumps, explosive magazines, office buildings, fuel storage facilities, power generation, primary crushing equipment, heap leach pads and
solution collection ponds.  The material on the existing heap leach facility will be removed, adding additional space on the facility for rehandling of the
tailings prior to transport to the waste dump as dry stack tailings. The additional facilities as part of the PFS include:
1.  A new CCD – MC processing facility, for which construction is currently underway.
2.  Upgrade of surface power generation facility.
3.  Construction of the underground decline, for which approximately 1,500 metres of development has been completed.
4.  A ventilation shaft with ventilation fans.
5.  A fresh air raise which will act as an escape way.
6.  Underground water recirculation facilities
7.  Underground electrical distribution system.
8.  Underground maintenance facilities.
9.  Dry stack tailings disposal facility (incorporated onto existing waste rock dump).
10.  Additional surface facilities such as mine dry and maintenance shops for the underground mine (maintenance shops already constructed).
1.7  Capital and Operating Costs
EBA has estimated total remaining capital costs for expansion of $88 million dollars including $9.3 million contingency, which excludes $24.2 million spent
on the project from January 1st 2012 to 30 April, 2013.  The total remaining capital is made up of $48 million initial, required for construction of the plant,
initial  underground  mining  equipment  purchases  and  preproduction  underground  development,  $39.7  million  sustaining  capital,  which  includes
development, mining equipment purchases and ongoing infrastructure requirements.  Capital costs for the project have been estimated for initial (prior to
production from new facilities) and sustaining as shown in Table 1.6.  Note that the costs shown below exclude sunk costs, for construction completed on the
process plant and for the underground decline.
 
EBA has estimated total operating costs at an average of $39 per tonne of ore processed.

EBA prepared an economic evaluation of the Santa Elena Expansion Project based on a pre-tax financial model and a post-tax model has been prepared by
Tetra Tech.  For the economic analysis long-term consensus metal prices and exchange rate (as of April 30, 2013) used in the base case were as follows:
1.  Price of gold –                                 US $1,450/ troy oz.
2.  Price of silver -                                US $28 / troy oz.
3.  Closure costs of $5 million
4.  Sandstorm receives and pays SilverCrest $350/oz. plus applicable inflation on an estimated remaining 31,000 oz. of gold per agreement.
 
The pre-tax financial model was established on a 100% equity basis, excluding debt financing and loan interest charges.  The financial results of the base
case and the two alternative cases are presented in Table 1.8. The economic analysis excludes the 2013 open pit heap leach production with an NPV of
approximately $ 20 million based on projected production cash flows at a gold price of $1,250 and a silver price of $19.50.

 ** Post tax results have been included in section 22 for a 30% tax rate. The financial results exclude 2013 production revenue of an estimated $20 million.
 
The economic analyses consider SilverCrest delivering a remaining 31,000 ounces of gold (2014 and beyond) to Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (Sandstorm) at a price
of US$350/oz under the Sandstorm Purchase Agreement executed on May14th, 2009. It does not include the option held by Sandstorm to participate in the
future underground mine production which would require payment by Sandstorm of 20% (pro-rata of gold) of the capital costs with a subsequent increase of
gold price for 20% of produced ounces to US$450/oz Au.  Sandstorm may elect to participate in the expansion, once SilverCrest provides a preliminary
technical report that includes amongst other items, the required capital costs associated with the transition from open pit heap leaching to a conventional mill
facility and underground mine.
1.9  Expansion Pre-Feasibility Recommendations
Further optimization of the mine schedule is warranted to investigate grade optimization versus stoping costs (long hole or cut and fill), potential to expand
and accelerate increased underground production with a second ramp for the bottom of the pit and expand milling capacity. These optimizations will be
addressed in detail after successfully announcing commercial production for the new mill facility in 2014.  Mineralization at Santa Elena is open in most
directions  with  potential  to  further  increase  resources  and  reserves  for  increased  production  and  mine  life.  Further  infill  and  expansion  drilling  is
recommended.

Mining regulations in Mexico provide all concessions to be valid for a period of 50 years. Taxes are based on the surface area of each concession and are
due in January and June of each year at a total annual cost of approximately $10,000. All tax payments have been paid to date.
 
On December 8, 2005, Nusantara had the right to acquire a 100% interest in the Santa Elena property from Tungento de Mexico SA de CV.  On August 14,
2009, Nusantara exercised the option to acquire 100% of the Santa Elena property.
 
On November 12, 2007, Nusantara signed an agreement with the Community of Banamichi (Ejido) for a 20 year lease on surface rights for a maximum of
841 ha with respect to exploration and exploitation. Lease payments were dependent (at Nusantara’s discretion) on the number of hectares required for a
given year. A minimum of 285 ha was required for initial exploitation. Currently 431 ha are under lease for exploitation and exploration.  The annual cost per
year ranged from approximately $55,000 to $160,000 dependent on the number of hectares required. Lease obligations have been met to date.

4.2  Royalties
No known private or state royalties currently exist for the Santa Elena mine.
4.3  Sandstorm Gold Stream
On May 14, 2009, SilverCrest entered into a definitive Purchase Agreement with Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (Sandstorm) under which SilverCrest’s wholly-owned
Mexican subsidiary, Nusantara de Mexico S.A. de C.V., agreed to sell 20% of future gold production from the Santa Elena open pit, or a total of 50,000
ounces gold, to Sandstorm in exchange for an Upfront Deposit of $12,000,000. The agreement also provides for ongoing per-ounce payments by Sandstorm
equal to the lesser of $350 and the prevailing spot gold market price upon delivery of gold.  In addition, Sandstorm issued $3.5 million common shares to
SilverCrest. The per ounce price of $350 is subject to an increase of 1% per annum commencing on the 3rd anniversary of the date that Santa Elena Project
began commercial production (i.e. July 2014).
 
If SilverCrest decides to develop an underground mine on the Santa Elena Project, Sandstorm has the right to review the project, accept the terms of the
agreement and if acceptable purchase 20% of the gold from the underground mine (includes reprocessing the leach spent ore) at a per ounce price equal to
the lesser of $450 and the prevailing spot gold market price, subject to an increase of 1% per annum beginning on the 3rd anniversary from the date the
underground mine begins commercial production. In exchange, Sandstorm will pay 20% of the upfront capital expenditures based on 20% of the pro rata
gold to be produced, including sunk costs incurred to date (pre April 30, 2013). The Pre-Feasibility Study upfront capital costs combined with sunk costs
incurred and approved by SilverCrest’s board will be the basis for Sandstorm’s review and potential investment.
4.4  Environmental Liabilities and Permitting
Currently, SilverCrest has maintained all of the necessary permits for exploration and exploitation at the Santa Elena mine site. A Manifestacion de Impacto
Ambiental (MIA) was submitted to Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) in early January of 2013 for amendment of the land
use licence related to the underground expansion project and was approved in May 2013.  This amendment approval allows for tailings facilities that were
not previously approved for the current operation.
 
A  mining  concession  in  Mexico  does  not  confer  any  ownership  of  surface  rights.  However,  use  of  surface  rights  for  exploration  and  production  can  be
obtained  under  the  terms  of  various  acts  and  regulations  if  the  concession  is  on  government  land.  The  Santa  Elena  concessions  are  located  on  Ejido
(community or co-op) land, and as of November 12, 2007, an agreement with the surface owners has been signed which allows SilverCrest access and
authorization to complete exploration and mine operations activities.

5.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCUTRE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
5.1  Accessibility
The Santa Elena property can be accessed easily year round by paved highways 90 km east from Hermosillo to Ures, then 50 km north along a paved
secondary road to the community of Banamichi, then by a gravelled maintained road 7 km east to the mine site.
5.2  Climate
The climate is typical Sonoran desert, with a dry season from October to May. Average rainfall is estimated at 300 mm per annum. There are two wet
seasons, one in the summer (July to September) and another in the winter (December). The summer rains are short with heavy thunderstorms whereas the
winter rains are longer and lighter. Seasonal temperatures vary from 0ºC to 40ºC. Summer afternoon thunderstorms are common and can temporarily impact
the local electrical service. Flash flooding is common in the area.
5.3  Local Resources
5.3.1  Water Supply
The main supply well currently used at the mine site, PSA-1, was installed and tested in September 2009 and a pump installed at approximately 109 metres
depth.  Pumping tests indicated the well was located in a confined aquifer with a potential association to geothermal sources and an estimated sustained
supply of 25 L/s, sufficient to support the open pit mining operation (Breckenridge, 2010).
 
18
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Well PSA-2 was constructed in the summer of 2011as a back-up well to support Santa Elena Mine’s primary water supply, Well PSA-1 (formally MW-1). The
well is 171 meters deep, and screened from a depth of 72m to the base of the well. There is a steel casing that extends from surface to a depth of 72m. The
casing and screen section are eight inches in diameter. The well was started by using an air rotary drill; however, due to the unstable and unconsolidated
nature of sediment in this portion of the sand and gravel aquifer the well was completed using a mud rotary drill.
 
The well was pumped at a rate of 10.6 liters per second (lps) over a 72 hour period, and the final measured drawdown in the well was approximately 20
meters. During the pumping test the water level dropped from its static level at 68m to a depth of 90m within a few minutes. The water level stabilized at 90
meters after two hours of pumping. The testing suggests that the well could be pumped indefinitely at a rate of 10.6 lps with no increase in drawdown (GRE,
2011a). The safe yield of the well is 12.9 lps, based on the criterion that drawdown equivalent to 25% of the aquifer thickness is allowable (GRE, 2011a).
 
Due  to  the  presence  of  the  screen  and  the  fact  that  it  is  open  to  a  smaller  aquifer  depth,  it  is  noted  that  Well  PSA-2,  although  very  productive,  is  less
productive than Well PSA-1. The screen in general reduces the ability of water to enter the well, and the vertical-slot screen used in Well PSA-2 was not
optimized for maximum yield. The pumping test indicates that there is minor hydraulic interference between the two water wells, and that the cumulative safe
yield of the well field, with both wells pumping at the same time is 35 lps (GRE, 2011a).
5.3.2  Power
A minor amount of electrical line power available from nearby sources currently supplies municipalities and agriculture, but is insufficient for the Santa Elena
operation. Power for current operations is provided by diesel generators. Future line power is possible, but requires permitting and a significant capital
expenditure.
5.3.3  Community Services
The Santa Elena Mine is located near to the village of Banamichi for which accommodations and local food services are found.  The mining centre of
Cananea is the closest sizable urban area (pop. est. 30,000), and is located approximately 100 km north by road from the Santa Elena mine site. Most
services  and  supplies  are  available  in  Cananea.    Sonora’s  capital  city,  Hermosillo,  is  located  approximately  150  km  southwest  of  the  property,  and  is
regarded as the main industrial hub for the majority of the local mining operations.  Services are available for heavy machine purchase and repair, materials
fabrication, and engineering services. Alternatively, Tucson Arizona is approximately a 4 hour drive north across the international Mexican USA border from
the Santa Elena mine site.
 
Northern Mexico has significant precious and base metal mines and there is a significant workforce of trained mining and processing personnel. Many of the
trades and skills learned in the region would be transferable to the new operations. The nearby Cananea and La Caridad mines are amongst the largest
mines in North America.

5.4  Existing Infrastructure
The Santa Elena open pit heap leach mine was constructed in 2009 and 2010 with the following operational infrastructure:
§  7 km long main access road from paved highway and local community of Banamichi,
§   2,500 tpd ore open pit mine,
§  Waste dump with the estimated permitted capacity of 35 million tonnes,
§  3-stage crusher,
§  Two lined and certified leach pads,
§  Lined and certified barren and pregnant solution pond,
§  Lined and certified emergency pond designed for 100 year event,
§  Merrill Crowe plant and refinery,
§  On-site laboratory for production and exploration work,
§  Administration office,
§  Diesel generators (total 2.5 MW capacity, 4 generators)
§  Core storage and logging facility, and
§  All required piping, power and security.
Construction of infrastructure to support an underground mine expansion, new mill and processing plant facility, is currently underway on site.  The new mine
infrastructure is described in detail in Section 18.0.
5.5  Physiography
The Santa Elena property is located on the western edge of the north trending Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range geographically adjacent to the
Sonora River Valley. Property elevation ranges from 800 m ASL to 1,000 m ASL. The property is located on the range front at a low elevation in relation to
the mountains immediately east and west respectively.
 
Vegetation  is  scarce  during  the  dry  season,  limited  primarily  to  juvenile  and  mature  mesquite  trees  and  cactus  plants.  During  the  wet  season,  various
blooming cactus, trees and grasses are abundant in drainage areas.
6.0  HISTORY
This section has been adapted from the initial Mineral Resource report authored by Fier (2007), who conducted much of the original research into historical
work on the property through archived company and government records.  EBA has not independently reviewed the information nor verified any reported
historical grade or production values.  EBA feels these historic numbers are insignificant and irrelevant in scale to the current and future production at the
Santa Elena Mine, and at least four primary levels (down to 75 metres below surface) of the historic underground workings have been removed within the
shell of the current producing open pit.

Earliest records of work on the property are from the late 19th to early 20th century when an English company by the name of Consolidated Fields operated a
mining operation at Santa Elena until the onset of the Mexican Revolution in 1910.  It is estimated that the most extensive underground development on the
property occurred during this period.  The development included a 450 ft. (137 meters) two compartment shaft, a single compartment 100 m inclined shaft,
and eight to nine working levels at a spacing of approximately 15 m to 20 m with numerous cross-cuts and raises.  The two compartment shaft was caved
near the surface prior to current development and the depth was not been verified.  Four of the levels (surface to 75 m in depth) and a total of approximately
1.5 km of development were accessed by SilverCrest in 2006.  Ongoing open cut mining has made the underground workings unsafe to enter.  Stoping in the
upper  accessible  levels  removed  an  estimated  57,000  tonnes  determined  by  a  void  survey  conducted  by  SilverCrest  in  2010.    No  detailed  production
records  are  available  for  the  Consolidated  Fields  work;  however,  SilverCrest  estimates  that  approximately  35,000  tonnes  of  the  original  tailings  from
Consolidated Fields’ operations remain onsite.  During the 1960’s, Industrias Peñoles S.A de C.V. drilled two or three holes on the property. No records are
available for this drilling.
 
During  the  early  1980’s,  Tungsteno  de  Baviacora  (Tungsteno)  mined  45,000  tonnes  grading  3.5  g/t  gold  and  60  g/t  silver  from  an  open  cut  at  Santa
Elena.  This material was shipped for processing to the company’s flotation mill near Baviacora, approximately 30 km southwest of Santa Elena.  The 50 ton
(short ton) per day mill was specifically built for processing tungsten ores from a nearby deposit from 1977 to 1983.  The tonnage from Santa Elena was
supplemental to the tungsten production.  Very limited records from the production are available but the owner has stated that recovery was adequate for the
Santa Elena tonnage but that some metal concentration still remains in the tailings on site.
 
After 2003, Tungsteno periodically surface mined high silica/low fluorine material from Santa Elena and shipped it to the Grupo Mexico smelter in El Tajo
near Nacozari, approximately 60 km to the northeast.
 
During 2003, Sergio A. Trelles Monge, CPG and Qualified Person conducted an exploration program for Tungsteno at Santa Elena.  Sr. Trelles was not
considered an “independent” QP for the purposes of this work.  The program consisted of the collection of 117 surface and underground samples.  A sample
summary report is available for review but sample lengths and locations are not clear. In late 2003, Nevada Pacific Gold Inc. of Vancouver B.C. completed a
brief surface and underground sampling program with the collection of 119 samples. A report was completed but subsequently misplaced.  Only the ALS-
Chemex  assay  sheets  and  a  rough  location  map  were  available  for  review.  The  property  remained  under  control  of  Tungsteno.    The  above  data  is
considered historical and unreliable and has not been used in the current study.
 
In early 2004, Fronteer Development Group of Vancouver, B.C., completed an extensive surface and underground mapping and sampling program.  A total
of 145 channel samples (89 underground and 56 surfaces) were collected and analyzed by ALS Chemex of Hermosillo, Mexico.  The property remained
under control of Tungsteno.  This data has been used by SilverCrest for exploration purposes only and has not been used in this PFS.

On  December  8,  2005,  SilverCrest,  using  its  100%  owned  subsidiary  Nusantara,  entered  into  an  option  agreement  with  Tungsteno  to  acquire  a  100%
interest in the Santa Elena property through staged option payments over 5 years. SilverCrest completed payments as per the terms of the agreement in
August  of  2009.  SilverCrest’s  Santa  Elena  open  pit  mine  has  been  in  commercial  production  of  gold  and  silver  since  2011,  with  a  mining  rate  of
approximately 2500 tonnes per day.
7.0  GEOLOGICAL SETTING
7.1  Regional Geological Setting
Santa Elena is located in northwestern Mexico where much of the geology can be attributed to the subduction and related volcanism of the Farallon Plate
beneath the North American Plate.  The east-directed subduction of the Farallon Plate began approximately 200 Ma ago with the tectonic rifting of the
supercontinent Pangea (Rogers 2004). The resulting NW-SE trending Sierra Madre Occidental extends from the USA-Mexican border to Guadalajara in the
southeast, a distance of over 1,200 kilometers.
 
Delgado-Granados et al. (2000) propose that subduction of the Farallon Plate occurred at a relatively shallow angle, resulting in continental uplift across
northern Mexico with accretionary terrains developing along the western fringes.  The shallow subduction is also thought to be responsible for the tectonics
that produced the Laramide orogeny.
 
Continental arc volcanism culminated with the Laramide orogeny in the early to late Eocene (Alaniz-Alvarez et al., 2007).  The waning of compression
coincides with the first part of Basin and Range extension (Wark et al., 1990; Aguirre-Diaz and McDowell, 1991, 1993).
 
The silicic volcanism is thought to be related to fractional crystallisation of mantle sourced basalts from subduction (Johnson, 1991; Wark, 1991).  Ferrari et al
(2007) summarises five main igneous deposits of the Sierra Madre Occidental;
§  Plutonic/volcanic rocks: Late Cretaceous –Paleocene.
§  Andesite and lesser Dacite-Rhyolite: Eocene (Lower Volcanic Complex).
§  Silicic ignimbrites: Early Oligocene & Miocene (Upper Volcanic Complex).
§  Basaltic-andesitic flows: late stage of and after ignimbrites pulses.
§  Repeat and episodic volcanic events related to rifting of the Gulf of California (alkaline basalt and ignimbrite) emplaced to western flanks: Late Miocene
Pliocene and Quaternary
During the final stages of the deformation period during the Paleocene – Early Eocene, E-W and ENE-WSW extension occurred in the Lower Volcanic
Complex that now hosts many porphyry deposits of the Sierra Madre Occidental. These porphyry deposits are hosted in Middle Jurassic to Tertiary aged
intrusions, located at Cananea, Nacozari and La Caridad. (Ferrari et. al., 2007).  This E-W and ENE-WSW extensional direction is similar in orientation to the
Santa Elena vein.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Early Oligocene extensional tectonics occurred along the eastern Sierra Madre Occidental flank forming the typical basin and range province. By early to
mid-Miocene, extension migrated west into Northern Sonora and along the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental resulting in N-NW striking normal
faults.  This extensional regime caused major deformation across the Sierra Madre Occidental exhuming pre-Cambrian basement rocks, especially in the
Northern Sierra Madre Occidental (Ferrari et. al., 2007).
 
Northwest  trending  shear  and  fault  zones  appear  to  be  an  important  control  on  mineralization  in  the  Sonora  region.  Mineralizing  fluids  may  have  been
sourced  from  Cenozoic  intrusions.  The  structural  separation  along  the  faults  formed  conduits  for  mineral  bearing  solutions.  The  heat  source  for  the
mineralizing fluids was likely from the plutonic rocks that commonly outcrop in Sonora.
To the west of the Sierra Madre Occidental are the parallel ranges and valleys that show structural similarities to the extensional tectonic regimes of the
Basin and Ranges Province to the east.  Elevations in the west are lower than the eastern Provinces, with transition to the Coastal plains and Gulf of
California.
7.1.1  Local and Property Geology
The Santa Elena property is located at the northwest extent of the Sierra Madre Occidental.  The primary rock types observed on the property are Tertiary
andesite and rhyolite flows (Figures 7.1)).  These units strike approximately N-S and dip 10º to 45º E-NE.  All the volcanic units in the immediate vicinity of
the Santa Elena deposit exhibit propylitic to silicic alteration.  Within the main mineralized structure, widespread argillic alteration and silicification proximal
to quartz veining is present. Chloritic alteration increases away from the mineralized zone in the andesite beds.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
The Main Mineralized Zone (MME) is hosted within an E-W trending structure that cross-cuts the volcanic units.  The structure hosts an epithermal quartz
calcite vein that has been mapped for approximately 1.2 kilometres in length, and ranges from 1 to 35 metres wide, averaging approximately 15 metres. The
structure dips from 40º to 60º to the south, and has been drill-tested to approximately 600 m below surface.
 
Andesite  and  granodorite  dykes  have  been  identified  at  the  Santa  Elena  deposit  which  are  adjacent  and  sub-parallel  to  the  MMZ.  The  location  of  the
mineralizing heat source has not yet been linked to any local plutonic phases. However, a large intrusion that exists approximately 10 km east and north of
Santa Elena may be associated with the mineralization.
 
The main structure (MMZ) hosts quartz and stockwork veining and displays typical epithermal textures, including: banded quartz; vuggy quartz; and brown-
black bladed calcite (pseudomorph to quartz) with many of these textures intermixed with hydrobreccia reworking. Some fracturing is found at localized fault
intersections and adularia has been identified in many of the core holes.
 
In late 2007, an induced polarization (IP), resistivity and magnetometer geophysical survey was completed by Pacific Geophysical Ltd. of Vancouver B.C.
Results showed the Main Mineralized Zone is a resistivity high (silica) and IP low (minor sulphides) that can be traced for approximately 1.2 km along strike
of the zone.
 
The oxidation-reduction (redox) boundary within the deposit is noted to persist to a depth of approximately 100 metres below surface, with a transitional
horizon  for  an  additional  20-30  metres,  or  120-130  metres  total  depth.    Visually,  the  oxidized  material  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  iron  oxides,
including limonite, jarosite, goethite and hematite along fractures and joints. The iron oxides are associated with gold and silver mineralization.  Below the
redox boundary, the vein remains intact as a milky white quartz-calcite vein with rare traces of fine grained pyrite, or primary iron-sulphides.
7.1.1.1  Structural Geology
Arroyo Tinaja Fault
 
Regional  interpretation  from  recent  topographic  mapping,  regional  geology  maps  and  recent  drilling  suggests  that  the  dry  river  valley,  el  arroyo  Tinaja
immediately east of the current open pit, may be associated with a large scale regional fault. This proposed regional fault is estimated to strike 033° and dip
steeply to sub-vertically.  Ongoing work is being conducted to confirm the presence and character of the fault system where it potentially intersects the Santa
Elena vein underground. Minor displacement has been identified along the fault based on surface mapping and subsurface drilling.
 
Northwest-Trending Structures
 
Northwest-trending splay and cross-cutting structures appear to influence mineralization at intersections with the main vein and along a NW-SE (striking
approximately 135 with steep westerly dip) trend in the footwall of the vein.  These narrow quartz and calcite filled planar brittle structures appear to cross-cut
and postdate the emplacement of the main vein at Santa Elena.    The  structures  display  weak  alteration  haloes  of  fine  grained  pyrite  in  addition  to  the
presence of  anomalous gold and silver concentrations (hole SE-12-98 5.72 gpt Au and 201 gpt Ag over 4.90 metres, down hole width).

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
8.0  DEPOSIT TYPE
Mineralization at Santa Elena occurs as a series of replacement veins, stockwork and hydrothermal breccias typical of other low-sulphidation epithermal
deposits found in the Sierra Madres and elsewhere in the world. Similar deposits include the La Colorada deposit in Sonora Mexico, Pinos Altos deposit in
Chihuahau Mexico, El Peñón deposit in Chile, and those deposits occurring in the Midas and Oatman districts of Nevada and Arizona in the USA.  These
deposits  form  in  predominantly  sub-aerial  felsic  volcanic  complexes  in  extensional  and  strike-slip  structural  regimes.    Samples  previously  collected  by
various parties, including SilverCrest, show a geochemical signature consistent with a high calcium, high level, low-sulphidation system (Au-Ag-Sb-Pb-Zn-
Ba-Ca-Mn).
 
The mineralization is the result of silica-rich fluids ascending into a structurally controlled, near-surface environment. Mineral deposition takes place as the
fluids undergo cooling by fluid mixing, boiling and decompression. Brecciation of the mineralized zone appears to be due to explosive venting from an
assumed intrusive at depth.  The Main Mineralized Zone is hosted in major E-W structure cross cutting the andesite units close to contact with Rhyolite,
8.1  Mineralization
The Santa Elena deposit contains gold and silver (typically as electrum) with minor lead, zinc and copper.  The structure consists of multiple banded quartz
veins and stockwork with associated adularia, fluorite, calcite and minor sulphides. Bonanza ore shoots (greater than 500 gpt silver and 30 gpt gold) appear
to be locally present (hole SE-12-106 with average uncapped grades of 35.94 gpt Au and 1,027 gpt Ag over 2.37 metres, not true width) but require more
definition to determine their full extent.
 
The permeable nature of the fractured zones has allowed partial oxidation to locally occur to maximum depth of 400 metres below the surface in selective
fractured zones.  Minor disseminated sulphides and possibly rhodonite have been noted at approximately 530 vertical metres and shows minor disseminated
sulphides and rhodonite.
 
Metal zonation appears to exist with higher grades and thicker mineralized widths near the epithermal boiling zones, one of which daylights in the open pit
area.  A trend of higher grades and thicker veining is apparent with a plunge of approximately 25° to the east.  Drill hole SE-12-74 intersected the vein at
approximately 500 vertical metres depth with an average uncapped grade of 1.56 gpt Au and 133 gpt Ag over 7 metres (not calculated as true width) along
this plunging trend from the current open pit operation.
 
Zonation also appears to correspond to northwest-trending structures that cross-cut the Main Mineralized Zone forming high grade shoots.  Vertical zonation
shows gold content consistent with depth and silver content increasing. At the surface, the silver to gold ratio is 20:1. At 500 m below surface, the ratio is
approximately 100:1.
 
Minor sulphides have been observed in a few locations within the mineralized zone.  The andesite in the hanging wall shows disseminated pyrite averaging
5%. Calcite is found in close proximity to pyrite and averages about the same. Select locations in the hanging wall show +30% finely disseminated pyrite
spatially associated with +30% disseminated and veinlet calcite. Hydrothermal breccias exist in the hanging wall andesite proximal to the Main Zone with
drill holes (SE 07-20 and 21) intersecting up to 200 m of breccia with a pyrite/calcite matrix. Selective sampling shows some anomalous lead, zinc and
copper, suggesting a possible mineralized intrusive (porphyry) at depth. Initial results from the 2007 geophysical program indicate deep-seated IP highs.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Alteration within the deposit is widespread and pervasive with the most significant being silicification, kaolinization, and chloritization.  Kaolin and alunite
occur primarily along deeply weathered and oxidized structures and the fractured-andesite contact.  Limonite within the oxide zone consists of a brick-red
colour after pyrite, brown goethite and local yellow jarosite.  Manganese occurs locally as pyrolusite and minor psilomelane near the surface.
 
Gangue minerals consist of quartz, calcite, adularia, chlorite and fluorite. Black calcite can be a significant gangue mineral found within the Main Mineralized
Zone.  Analysis shows calcite content of up to approximately 15% which has a direct metallurgical benefit for processing ore.
9.0  EXPLORATION
Exploration carried out previous to SilverCrest’s acquisition has been discussed in Section 6.0 and is not repeated here except for clarity purposes.
 
In 2006 and the first half of 2007, SilverCrest completed an extensive exploration program at Santa Elena. This work included surface mapping and channel
sampling, underground mapping, underground channel sampling and core drilling. The surface program was conducted in May 2006 under the direction of
N. Eric Fier, CPG, P.Eng.
 
A total of 289 samples were collected and analyzed by ALS-Chemex in Hermosillo, Mexico and North Vancouver, BC.  More detail regarding this program
can be found in the NI 43-101 Technical Report: ‘Reserve Update for the Santa Elena Open Pit and Preliminary Assessment for the Santa Elena and Cruz
de Mayo Expansion Project, Sonora, Mexico’ (May 11, 2011).
 
In  2012  SilverCrest  began  construction  of  the  underground  portal  and  exploration  decline.    Mapping  was  conducted  along  the  decline  for  geotechnical
purposes in addition to sampling.
10.0  DRILLING
10.1  Historical Drilling
No information of historic drilling was available to EBA.  The drill hole database and current Mineral Resource estimate include only SilverCrest drilling that
has been completed since 2006.
10.2  Previous Drilling by SilverCrest
SilverCrest completed a drill program in early 2006 consisting of 19 NQ holes totalling 2,572 m. Drilling was completed by Major Drilling de Mexico, a
subsidiary of Major Drilling Canada of Ontario using a Longyear 38 drill and associated support equipment. Drilling was conducted at 100 metre spacing
with all holes but two drilled north at angles from -45 to -70º along the E-W trending strike of the mineralized zone.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
SilverCrest completed a core drill program in 2007 consisting of 21 holes totalling 1,951.4 m, and a drill program consisting of an additional 48 core holes
(9,939 m), 4 geotechnical core holes (1,163 m) and 21 RC drill holes (4,308 m) in 2008. Drilling for both programs was completed by Cabo Drilling de
Mexico, a subsidiary of Cabo Drilling Corporation of North Vancouver B.C., using a Longyear 38 drill. The 2006 to 2008 drilling was termed Phase II.
 
In 2009, SilverCrest completed a pre-production in-fill drill program consisting of 11 RC holes (577 metres). RC drilling was completed as pre-collars for
coring and condemnation drilling in the proposed waste dump and leach pad areas.
 
From 2006 to 2009 a total of 144 combined drill holes have been drilled at Santa Elena for a total of 25,055.8 metres (Table 10.1).

10.3  2012-2013 Drilling
During 2012-2013, SilverCrest targeted delineation of shallow, below-pit mineralization and deep mineralization (Table 10.2) with additional drilling. Three
drilling  companies  were  contracted;  Major  Drilling  de  Mexico  based  in  Hermosillo,  Mexico,  Guardian  Drilling  from  Saskatchewan,  Canada,  and  DrilCor
based in Durango, Mexico.  A number of the deep drill holes were RC collared with diamond tails at depth in the mineralization. Figure 10.1 shows the
location of the 2012 to 2013 drill holes.  Appendix D has a list of the 2012-2013 drill holes and locations.
 
This drilling focused on delineating and extending the areas along trend and down-dip of the vein. Other drilling was located off strike to explore for near
parallel mineralization.
 
A total of 20 drill holes were collared using reverse circulation (RC) to expedite hanging wall drilling, then finished with diamond core from approximately 40-
50 metres before the vein target depth. (Table 10.2).  This practice was discontinued due to significant deviation in the pre-collared holes. A total of 149 holes
(48,980.18 m including RC with DD tails) were drilled during the 2012-13 program, including holes drilled from within the current pit (Table 10.2).

10.3.1  Heap Leach Drilling
In  early  May  2013,  SilverCrest  completed  25  large  diameter  drill  holes,  totalling  359  metres,  on  the  current  leach  pad  for  the  purposes  of  validating
production data (Figure 10.2).  This drill program was completed by Layne Drilling, a Mexican company. Drill equipment used to complete the drill program
was a reverse circulation Becker Hammer with inner tube of 6’’ for sampling. Drill holes were spaced on a 25 by 25 metre grid, and drilled to 5 to 20 metres
deep. Enough material and space was left between the collar of the hole and the liner to prevent any damage to the liner, and were stopped several meters
above the surveyed location of the liner. All drilling operations were performed without the addition of water or other additives and full sample was collected
per each interval drilled without any rejects on the drill site. A total of 164 samples were collected for analysis.

10.4  Core Recovery
Core recovery for the 2012-13 drilling program was measured in relation to marker blocks and was generally good (Figure 10.3). RQD was also measured
and recorded during core logging (Figure 10.3). The holes include SE-12-39 to SE-13-150 and SERC-12-22 to SERC-12-35.

10.5  Drill Surveying and Topography
Surveying of drill hole collars was first completed by handheld GPS and later resurveyed by the registered on site surveyor.
 
Eagle Mapping of Vancouver B.C. completed an aerial survey of the property in 2007.  The resultant digital elevation model from this survey provides the
basis for the site topography for the project.  Where previous drill collars were not located by the surveyor, their elevation in the database has been manually
fit to the digital elevation model.

11.0  SAMPLING METHODS AND APPROACH
11.1  Historical Sample Collection Methods
Knowledge of the sampling methods for work completed prior to 2004 is limited.  No data from this period has been used in previous NI-43 101 Technical
Reports as sampling completed by Tungsteno and Nevada Pacific was inadequately documented and insufficient to determine the approach.
 
In 2004, Fronteer completed surface and underground sampling at Santa Elena. Written documentation on sampling methods is limited but investigations by
SilverCrest  confirmed  the  underground  sample  locations.    The  sampling  method  was  found  to  be  of  contradictory  “discontinuous”  channels  and  this
approach was considered adequate at the early exploration stage.
11.2  Previous SilverCrest Sample Collection Methods
The 2006 sampling by SilverCrest consisted of continuous surface channel sampling along exposed road cuts and outcrops. The underground verification
channel sampling program consisted of semi-continuous horizontal sampling of identified Fronteer sample locations.  The samples were collected over
selected intervals, placed in plastic bags and periodically shipped to ALS-Chemex in Hermosillo Mexico for preparation, with sample pulps shipped to and
analysed by ALS-Chemex, North Vancouver, BC.
 
The 2006, 2007 and 2008 core drilling procedure included the collection and labelling of the drill core. After logging and identifying the mineralized zone,
core was selected for splitting and sampling. The 2008 RC drilling program consisted of collecting chips and cataloguing.
11.3  2012-2013 Sample Collection Methods
The 2012 and 2013 drilling program included procedures for the collection and labelling of the drill core.  A total of 15 drill holes (Table 11.1) where first
drilled by RC methods and finished with diamond core tails with a further 4 drilled purely as RC of HQ size drill core (63.5 mm diameter).  Although RC
cuttings were not retained a number of samples from the hanging wall were sampled. (Figure 11.1)

The drill core was recovered and stored in vinyl boxes, each of which contains approximately 2.25 metres of core.  Drill runs were identified in the field by
drillers using markers in the core boxes at 3 metre intervals.  These intervals were validated by SilverCrest geologists.  Recovered drill core was boxed by
the drillers on-site. The core boxes were collected and delivered twice daily to the on-site core logging facility where the core was logged and sampled by
SilverCrest technical staff.  Core is currently stored onsite for future viewing and reference.
 
Core logging procedures included review of the core quality and recording of recovery, lithological, geotechnical and mineralogical data within standardized
company logging forms. After characterizing the mineralization, SilverCrest geologists marked the start and end of each interval for sampling. The range in
drill core sample lengths can be seen in Figure 11.1 which shows lengths ranging from 0.11 to 36.7 metres (the latter was checked in supplied drill logs as
being correct) and mode of approximately 2 metres. Not all drill holes were entirely sampled and only samples are presented in Figure 11.1 below.  This did
not include RC sample intervals.  The average sample length used in the 2013 resource is 1.74 metres.
 
Figure 11.1: Santa Elena Sample Length Frequency used in 2013 Resource Estimate
 
 
Sample  intervals  were  recorded  on  the  core  box  with  sample  tags.  The  intervals  were  marked  on  the  drill  core  which  was  cut  in  half  by  a  SilverCrest
technician using a diamond saw blade.  Half of the core was sealed in a sample bag with the corresponding sample tag.  The other half of the core sample
was returned to the core box for company record and future viewing.  Sample numbers, intervals, and descriptions were recorded on the standardized drill
logs.
 
SilverCrest inserted Certified Reference Material (CRM’s), blanks and duplicates samples at regular intervals into the sampling stream.  In addition internal
laboratory QA-QC procedures were followed.

11.4  2012-2013 Laboratory Analytical Methods
For the 2012-2013 sampling, two independent analytical laboratories were used for sample analyses: Nusantara de Mexico S.A. de C.V (Nusantara), an on-
site grade control laboratory for Santa Elena operations; and ALS Chemex. Nusantara either prepared and analysed samples, or prepared and transported
samples to ALS Chemex in Chihuahua or Hermosillo for further preparation before being sent to ALS-Chemex in Vancouver for analysis.
 
EBA notes that some pulp samples from the Santa Elena on-site lab were received by the ALS preparation labs.
11.4.1  Nusantara Lab Preparation and Analysis
Nusantara  analysed  a  number  of  samples  using  Gravimetric  Fire  analysis  and  Atomic  Absorption  Fire  Assay  for  Au  and  Ag.    The  following  sample
preparation procedures have been translated from Spanish and are summarized for this report.
 
Received samples are dried, weighed and crushed to 90% passing the minus 150 mesh. Gold is analyzed using fire assay fusion with atomic absorption
finish and by gravimetric methods.  Silver is analyzed using an aqua regia digestion and atomic absorption finish.
 
Nusantara’s internal QA-QC includes adding one duplicate, one reference and one blank to every 27 samples. All samples analysed by AAS outside the
range of calibration are retested.  There are measures in place for oven time and contamination by chemical additives.

11.4.2  ALS-Chemex Lab Preparation and Analysis
ALS-Chemex labs in Chihuahua and Hermosillo prepared the samples using the Prep-31 procedure typically used for rock and drill core.  The samples were
dried, weighed, and crushed to obtain 70 % passing a 2 mm (Tyler 9 mesh, US Std. No.10) screen.  A split of up to 250 g was taken and pulverized to >85 %
passing a 75 micron (Tyler 200 mesh, US Std. No. 200) screen.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
ALS-Chemex in Vancouver, BC, analysed samples using the ME-ICP41 analytical procedure.  Samples were digested with aqua regia in a graphite heating
block.  After cooling the resulting solution was diluted to 12.5 mL with deionized water, mixed and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
spectrometry  (ICP-AES)  and  reported  36  element  grades  including  silver  (ME-ICP41).    The  analytical  results  are  corrected  for  inter-element  spectral
interferences.
 
Samples containing grades of silver exceeding 100 ppm were redigested in aqua regia and run using ore grade detection limits with ICP (Ag-OG46), and
where grades exceeded the detection limit 1,500 ppm, silver was analyzed using fire assay (Ag-GRA21) with AA finish.
 
Gold was analyzed using fire assay fusion with AA finish (Au-AA23) and default overlimit analysis using gravimetric determination (Au-GRA21).  A nominal
weight 30+/-3 grams was used for the analysis.  Silver analysed by the GRA21 finish has a lower detection limit of 5 ppm to an upper limit of 10,000 ppm with
gold having a lower detection limit of 0.05 ppm and an upper limit of 1000 ppm.
 
No ALS laboratory SG testing was undertaken.
11.5  Heap Leach Sampling, Preparation and Analysis
All sampling was carried out by SilverCrest’s geologists and sampling protocols adopted the following procedures:
 
§  Plastic bags were placed in a tray in the vertical outlet of the cyclone and into a container to avoid loss of material (Figure 11.2)
 
§   Full interval was sampled and samples were taken at multiple orders according to the depth of the hole. For holes with a length of 10 and 20 metres,
samples were taken every 2 metres. Holes with length of 15 metres, samples were collected every 3 metres and only one 5 metre sample was collected for
holes with 5m length.
§  All bags were labelled with the corresponding depth.
§  The samples were delivered to the Santa Site lab for splitting to pulverization and additional splitting to generate aliquot for analysis.
 
A very meticulous sampling procedure allowed for a very good sample recovery. All samples were handled by geologists at Santa Elena site. Samples were
sent to Santa Elena lab for analysis. Analytical method for gold included Fire Assay finishing in AA as well as gravimetric analysis for comparison purposes
and for silver an Aqua Regia digestion finishing in AA. Blanks and Certified Reference Material (“CRM”) were inserted by exploration personnel prior to the
sampling preparation at the Santa Elena Lab to carry out a QA/QC protocol in the preparation and analysis of the samples collected by the drilling program
on the pad. The results did not indicate deviations from the blanks and CRM assay values.

11.6  QP Statement
EBA has observed the core and RC sampling methods on site and have reviewed the leach material sampling protocol and believes the methods meet an
industry  standard  of  practice.    EBA  feels  the  sample  collection  methods  were  carried  out  in  a  methodical  and  unbiased  method  sufficient  to  support  a
database for estimation of Mineral Resources and Reserves.
12.0  DATA VERIFICATION
12.1  Historical Data Verification
Records  for  historical  accounts  of  data  verification  and  quality  control  measures  were  not  available  to  EBA.    No  sampling  material  remains  from  the
programs, as such, no verification sampling was undertaken.  Historical data prior to the 2006 SilverCrest drilling campaign is not included in the current
geological database.
12.2  Previous SilverCrest Data Verification
The following description of historical verification has been summarised from the Technical Report on the Pre-Feasibility Study for the Santa Elena Project,
Sonoro Mexico, by Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates, (SWRPA, August 11, 2008) and the Technical Report on the Cruz de Mayo Property, Sonora,
Mexico, by N. Eric Fier and C. Stewart Wallis (December 10, 2007). These technical reports were independent and NI 43-101 compliant.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
In April of 2006, SWRPA collected select samples for verification, including an underground continuous channel sample and quarter splits of drill core and
sent to ALS Chemex in Hermosillo with a regular shipment of core samples. Overall, the grade comparisons are considered to be within acceptable ranges.
 
In May 2006, SilverCrest collected 15 underground channel samples to verify the sampling results of Fronteer. The SilverCrest silver assays showed a bias
of up to 60% lower than the corresponding Fronteer assays with gold assays 50% to 100% lower. SWRPA considered it acceptable at this stage of property
development to use the Fronteer data in the resource estimate.
 
Gravimetric silver grades were consistently higher compared to both Fronteer and the SilverCrest silver fire with AA finish results. The result lends support to
the higher values. The fire assay with AA results was used in the resource estimate as they were more similar to the Fronteer results which were also used
 
In addition to the underground sampling, SilverCrest also completed silver geochemical analysis on 289 surface samples for fire assay AA finish and fire
assay  gravimetric  analysis.  Results  show  an  overall  20.3%  increase  in  silver  grade  using  silver  gravimetric  assays.  AA  silver  results  were  used  in  the
resource estimation and are considered conservative for grade estimation. QA-QC was completed by duplicate analyses on 16 of the above 298 samples at
ACME Laboratories in Vancouver on ALS-Chemex pulps from core sampling and preparation.  Although the ACME results have a higher detection limit, the
limited results on the duplicate pulps show consistent correlation of grades between laboratories.
 
During the 2008 drilling approximately every 20th sample was duplicated in a different laboratory for QA/QC purposes. The comparison for 2008 drill sample
results show average gold and silver results to be similar and within acceptable limits for QA/QC.
12.3  2012-2013 Data Verification
12.3.1  Site Visits
James Barr, P.Geo, visited the Santa Elena mine between May 10-11, 2012, and October 13-14, 2012 during the 2012-2013 drilling campaign at which time
rock exposure in the open pit and exploration underground decline was inspected, sample collection and logging procedures were reviewed, verification
samples were collected (Table 12.1, Figures 12.1 and 12,2) and recommendations for sampling quality control measures were made.

12.4  SilverCrest Blank Material Insertions
SilverCrest inserted 114 blank samples in a random fashion and near to expected high grade samples during the 2012-2013 drilling program, each blank
was labelled “Blank” or “Blanco” in the drill hole data base.  The material was collected from barren exploration drill core collected from unaltered andesite in
the hanging wall to the vein.
 
Figures 12.11 and 12.12 show the 114 samples of blank material plotted with the +1 standard deviation (dashed) and lower detection limits (red line) of 0.005

Blank sample results show a range of results (0.005 to 0.11 gpt Au and 0.2 to 13.5 gpt Ag) which can most likely attributed to contamination of the source
material. The majority of blank samples are near the limit of detection for both Au and Ag.
 
EBA feels it is unlikely that the results indicate contamination of the samples occurred on site or during laboratory sample preparation.
12.5  ALS-Chemex and Nusantara Laboratory Comparison
For verification of Santa Elena results against ALS-Chemex 751 samples were sampled at both Santa Elena and ALS-Chemex from the 2012-2013 Santa
Elena drilling (Section 10.3).  Samples analysed at Santa Elena prior to sending to ALS Chemex facilities in Hermosillo or Chihuahua were at the drill core,
pulp or RC cutting stage of preparation (Section 11).
 
Samples up to 250 grams of pulverized material, with 85% passed a 75 micron screen, were transferred internally to ALS-Chemex in Vancouver, BC for
analysis.
 
A total of 175 samples within the resource are using results analysed from Santa Elena.
 
Comparison of the duplicate analytical results are plotted on scatter plots to observe any bias/trends between the two labs (Figures 12.13 and 12.14). Table
12.3 shows the key statistics of the comparison results.

Reasonable reproducibility from the Nusantara lab to the ALS lab is indicated by the plots above.  Some gold grades produce a potential slight positive bias
to ALS at high grades. Silver grade reproduction is highly variable but overall seems to co-relate with an even spread across the 1:1 unity line (red). Overall,
the data reported from the Nusantara lab appears to be reproducible at the certified ALS lab and sample data reported from this source are considered to be
reliable.
12.6  Heap Leach Data Verification
Blanks (Table 12.4) and Certified Reference Material (“CRM”) (Figures 12.15 and 12.16) were inserted during the sampling preparation at the Santa Elena
Lab to monitor and have a QA/QC protocol in the sampling and analysis of the samples collected by the drilling program on the pad.  The results did not
indicate deviations from the blanks and CRM assay values reported in the blanks and CRM assays certificates (Table 12.5).

13.0  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTWORK
13.1  Previous Mineral Processing and Metallurgical test work
The following sections were documented in the previous Technical Report for Santa Elena (May, 2011) and have been extracted from the Technical Report
on the Pre-Feasibility Study for the Santa Elena Project, Sonoro, Mexico, by Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle and Associates (SWRPA) (August 11, 2008). This
technical report is NI 43-101 compliant. All test work covers the Santa Elena project. No test work been done on the Cruz de Mayo project.
13.1.1  Previous Metallurgical Test Work Summary For Santa Elena
There has been varied metallurgical test work done on the Santa Elena property over the last twenty five years. The test work was reviewed in 2008 by Mr.
Geoff Allard (Allard), P.E., of Allard Engineering Services of Tucson, Arizona.
 
The Allard audit overall findings are summarized below:
§  No fatal flaws exist with regard to metallurgy,
§  Ore is amenable to heap leaching with cyanide,
§  Average overall recovery of 67% for gold and 34% for silver (varied for depth) is consistent with available test results and acceptable for Pre-Feasibility
level,
§  Ore is suitable for anticipated design,
§  Top size of 3/8 inch for heap feed is appropriate,

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
§  Test work does not adequately reflect proposed flow sheet and design criteria,
§  Significant additional test work is required to firm up design criteria for a feasibility level study,
§  There is inverse dependence of recovery on particle size,
§  Short column testing (less than proposed lift height of five metres) cannot address leach cycles and percolation issues, and
 
§  Some reagent consumptions cannot be identified from the existing test work. In these instances, estimates have been used.
§  As previously stated in their August 2008 PFS, SWRPA concur with Allard’s findings.
13.1.2  Previous Metallurgical Test Work Description
Various metallurgical tests have been carried out on the Santa Elena property. Relevancy of test work carried out during the period 1983 to 2003 was very
difficult to ascertain, as either the work was not applicable or sample locations/references were not readily discernible. Table 13.1 below lists these reports
and comments by Allard.

In July 2006, Nusantara completed six bottle roll tests on representative samples collected from the Santa Elena Mine. This work was completed by Sol y
Adobe Ingenieros Asociados S.A. de C.V. (Sol & Adobe) in Hermosillo, Mexico, in association with the University of Sonora. Results of a three-day leach at
minus 10 mesh are shown in Table 13.2.

The conclusions made by Sol & Adobe indicated an average 73% recovery for gold and 42% recovery for silver. Reagent consumption was modest at 1.0
kg/t of cyanide consumption. Lime consumption appeared to be high at 5.52 kg/t. Sol & Adobe recommended further bottle roll tests to optimize cyanide and
lime consumptions on average grade composites (Sol & Adobe, 2006).
 
Allard made the following comments on this test work:
§  Poor correlation between assay head and calculated head,
§  Overstated lime consumption,
§  Some calculation errors.
Société Générale de Surveillance de México S.A. de C. V. (SGS) carried out bottle roll tests starting in 2007 as part of a column test campaign. Three ore
composites developed from underground channel sampling from the Santa Elena Mine named S (surface), SL (second level) and FL (fourth level) were
prepared, and tests were done on ground (-100 mesh) (Table 13.4) samples for 96 hours.

Cyanide  and  lime  consumptions  were  reported  as  low.  The  gold  and  silver  extractions  were  reported  as  acceptable.  SGS  recommended  using  higher
cyanide concentrations, higher reaction time and better control in the production of fine particles while crushing, to improve the metals recoveries.
 
Allard comments that the bottle roll tests showed the dependence of recovery on particle size. Since the procedure to generate the coarse samples (as
reported in the test work) may not be representative of a normally crushed sample, the tests can be used as an indicator of particle size dependence but
should not be used for recovery projections.
 
Column testing was carried out by SGS on the composites using minus 3/8 inch material, except for one sample which was minus ¼ inch material. The
results obtained after 77 days of leaching are summarized in Table 13.4. The column tests were run for 58 days, the ore was allowed to rest for 14 days, and
then leaching commenced for another 19 days.

From these column tests, the gold extraction averaged 66.8% and silver extraction, 34.3%. Cyanide consumptions are moderate, averaging 0.627 kg/t ore,
while lime consumption averaged 6.68 kg/t ore.
 
Allard made the following comments on the column tests:
§  Circulation of leach liquor through columns without cyanide to “neutralize” ore is poor practice,
§  Increase of cyanide concentration after 11 days from 0.3 g/L to1.0 g/L did not improve leaching kinetics as stated in the SGS report,
 
§  Columns operated in closed circuit without recovering gold or silver from column effluent. This affected dissolution and diffusion,
§  pH was maintained at abnormally high range,
§  Test column height (1.71 m) was inadequate to determine leach cycle for proposed 5 m lifts, and
§  Tests can be used for recovery indications but questionable test aspects would tend to reduce recovery.
Subsequent test work, consisting of grinding to 75% minus 75 micron and leaching for 120 hours, was done on the samples of the column test tails from the
previous tests. As well, work indices were determined for the composites. The results after 120 hours of leaching are shown below in Table 13.6.

There was one test done to determine specific gravities and bulk densities that has not been audited by Allard, but is included here. In September 2007, SGS
determined crushing work indices, specific gravities and bulk densities of three composites from bulk sampling: S = Surface, SL = Second Level and FL =
Fourth Level (SGS, 2007). There is no record of procedures. The results are shown in Table 13.8.

13.2  Recent Mineral Processing and Metallurgical test work
Appendix C contains a metallurgical report of test work carried out by Inspectorate  Mining and Metals in their Richmond, BC facility on samples from Santa
Elena and a limited number of samples from Cruz de Mayo.  Inspectorate also generated slurry samples for testing at Pocock Industrial in Salt Lake City for
thickening and filtration characterization.  Additional test work was carried out in Sonora at the University of Sonora.
 
The broad conclusions from the Inspectorate test work can be summarized as follows.
§  A grind of 80% passing (P80)100 µm is suitable for treating Santa Elena ore.
§  A cyanide strength of 1g/L is suitable for leaching Santa Elena ore
§  A leach time of 72 hours is indicated by the standard test procedure but the leaching rate can be accelerated significantly if the leach solution is changed
after an initial period of 10 hours and shortened to under 40 hours as well as improving silver recoveries.
§  A gold recovery of >92% and silver recovery of 68% is indicated.
§  Ore from Cruz de Mayo is harder and requires a finer grind than Santa Elena ore, and still gives poorer results.
Additional findings from recent test work is a Bond Ball Mill (metric) work index of 14.  The filtration test work indicated that filtration of Santa Elena tailings
was highly susceptible to the flocculent selected.
 
Open pit heap leach metallurgical test work is based on previous work and approximately 3 years of production data which has been publicly announced
and filed on SEDAR. Overall, actual average heap leach recoveries are estimated for ore under a 300 day leach cycle at 57% gold and 30% silver. Since the
leach pad will be decommissioned pre-maturely (before 300 day cycle is completed for most of 2013 ore placement), the estimated final open pit heap leach
recoveries are 52% gold and 29% silver.
13.2.1  Leaching Cyanidation of Samples from Santa Elena Deposit
Bottle roll cyanide leaching was mainly performed on Santa Elena NIVEL 4 whole ore at various grind sizes and different cyanide dosages to assess gold
and silver recovery potentials.

Baseline Bottle Roll Tests on Ground Whole Ore (Underground)
 
Baseline bottle roll tests (C1 to C6) were conducted on ground whole ore to assess the grind- and cyanide-sensitivity of gold and silver recoveries as well as
kinetics and reagent requirements.  The leach tests were carried out for 72 hours at 40% solids at target P80 grinds of 120 mm and 74 mm. Three cyanide
dosages of 0.5-, 1.0- and 1.5 g/L cyanide were tested at each grind, and pH ≥10.0 was maintained with hydrated lime.
 
Composites C1 to C12 were collected as bulk samples on the 4th level (est. 80 m below surface) of the old underground working which would be near the
bottom of the operating open pit. The baseline test results are summarized in Table 13.9, whilst Au and Ag leach profiles are plotted in Figures 13.1 and
13.2.

As shown in Table 13.9, the gold responded much better to cyanidation than the silver in these exploratory baseline tests, averaging 95.6% Au versus 56.6%
Ag. In general, residue gold and silver grades decreased with finer grinding and higher cyanide concentration.  In the range of 0.5-1.5 g/L cyanide, higher
cyanide strength benefited silver extraction, but not gold.
 
Cyanide consumption was in the neighborhood of 1.3 kg/t at a level of 1 g/L NaCN. In general, less than 0.1 kg/t lime were required to maintain slurry pH
≥10.  Increasing the cyanide strength from 0.5 g/L to 1.5 g/L doubled the NaCN consumption.
 
Leach kinetics showed that both gold and silver dissolution was fast in the first 8 hours of retention and subsequently slowed down. Finer grind and higher
cyanidation strength resulted in faster metal dissolution and better extraction. Gold and silver extractions might improve by extending the residence time to
over 72 hours without replacing leach liquor.

Leach Optimization
 
The optimization tests (C7 to C12) were conducted on the NIVEL (Level) 4 Composite at a moderate grind of 100 µm at various cyanide dosages with leach
solution  replacement  at  various  leach  intervals.    Test  conditions  and  leach  results  are  summarized  in  Table  13.12,  while  leach  profiles  are  plotted  in
Figures13.3 and 13.4.
 
In comparison to the baseline test results, leaching with solution replacement resulted in better silver extraction, and faster gold and silver leach kinetics.  By
replacing the leach solution, up to 70% silver recovery is achievable, and residence time can be shortened to 30 hours for gold. Double the number of
solution  exchanges  and  NaCN  dosages  as  well  as  the  addition  of  oxidants  resulted  in  negligible  gains  in  gold  and  silver  extractions.  In  general,
approximately 96% Au and 70% Ag extraction can be achieved at 40% solids in 1.0g/L NaCN solution with single solution replacement at the target grind of
100 µm.

Confirmatory Leach on New Santa Elena Feed
 
Confirmatory leach tests (C15 to C17) were carried out on another Santa Elena NIVEL (Level) composite (Comp. 4 ± 0 Nivel) with mine water (also referred
as site water in the test spreadsheets) provided by the client. Leach pulp density increased from 40 wt.% for the baseline tests to 45%. During the leach tests,
the pregnant leach solution was replaced with fresh mine water after 10 hours leach. Leach conditions and results are summarized in Table 13.12.
 
Results showed that over 97% gold extraction is achievable by leaching the Comp. 4 ± 0 Nivel in 1.0g/L cyanide at 45% solids by replacing partial or full
leach liquor. Increasing cyanide dosage to 1.5g/L did not result in significant improvement of gold recovery. Silver extraction was ~43% in all three cases.

Baseline Bottle Roll Tests on Spent Ore
 
During 2012, 10 representative bulk samples from trenching were collected from spent ore on the leach pad and analysed using mill design specifications.
Analyses consisted of bottle roll leach tests for 72 hours at approximately 33.3% solids at target P80 grinds of 74 µm. The cyanide dosage of 1.0 g/L cyanide
was tested at a pH ≥10.0 maintained with hydrated lime. Test work was completed at the on-site Santa Elena lab which has a fully functional wet lab with
extensive external QA/QC reviews (refer to Section 12 – Data Verification).
 
Results in Table 13.11 show average recovery rates of 91.4% gold and 72.5% silver which is consistent with results tested on underground bulk samples
and bottle roll tests used for mill design. Recovery rates of 92% gold and 67.5% silver are used for all milling ores including spent ore from the leach pad.

13.2.1  Filtering and Thickening Test work
Pocock Industrial carried out a series of tests on leach residue produced by Inspectorate to determine design parameters for plant design.  A flocculent
screening programme was carried out and it was determined that flocculent performance was highly variable.  The best performance was achieved using a
Hychem Flocculent (N301) for both thickening and a filter aid.  Using this flocculent in thickening over 70% solids could be achieved from feed densities in
the  20-25%  solids  range  with  an  indicated  thickener  area  (for  a  conventional  thickener)  of  0.11m2/tpd.    This  same  flocculent  used  as  a  filter  aid  could
produce an 18% moisture cake at a filtration rate of 777kg/m2/hr.
14.0  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
14.1  Introduction
Three  individual  Mineral  Resource  Estimates  are  presented  in  this  report,  a  new  estimate  for  spent  ore  material  on  the  existing  leach  pads  has  been
prepared by Eric Fier, Chief Operating Officer of SilverCrest and non-Independent Qualified Person, and an updated estimate for the material outside of, and
below, the ultimate open pit has been prepared by James Barr, P.Geo, Senior Geologist with EBA and an Independent Qualified Person.  No resource
estimate has been completed for the open pit at Santa Elena as all the material has previously been declared as mineral reserves, as discussed in Section
25 of this report.  A description of the methods used to define the open pit grade model is included below.
14.1.1  Previous Underground Resource Estimates
An initial resource estimate for underground resources at Santa Elena was completed by SilverCrest with the assistance of Dassault Systemes Software
International and reviewed by EBA in January, 2011.  The resource was released by EBA in May 2011 as part of a Preliminary Economic Assessment in the
report “NI 43-101 Technical Report, Reserve Update for the Santa Elena Open Pit and Preliminary Assessment for the Santa Elena and Cruz de Mayo
Expansion Project, Sonora Mexico (amended date May 11, 2011)”.  The estimate was based on 146 exploration drill holes (totalling 20,970.4 metres) and
2,106 samples for modelling gold and silver into the block model using GEMS software.  The underground resources include all mineralized blocks outside
of the final open pit1 and subjected to a 1.77 AuEQ2 gpt cut-off.
 
The underground Mineral Resources reported in 2011, and shown in Table 14.1 below, are superceded by the current resource estimate described in this
report.
1 Note:  the final open pit used in the 2011 resource estimate was updated in the current report, the current ultimate pit is much smaller than previously. 
2 AuEQ from the 2011 resource estimate was based on $USD 1,000/oz Au and $USD 18/oz Ag, and metallurgical recoveries of 93.5% Au and 75.7% Ag.

Previously  reported  in-pit  Mineral  Resources  have  been  converted  to  Reserves  and  are  superceded  by  the  current  report.    Current  in-pit  reserves  are
discussed in Section 15 of this report.
14.2  Basis of Current Resource Estimates
Interpretation  used  for  the  geological  and  grade  modelling  of  the  Santa  Elena  deposit  was  prepared  by  EBA  and  has  incorporated  information  through
discussions with SilverCrest personnel and interpretations used previously for the property.  The models used in this Mineral Resource Estimate have been
completed by EBA using Dassault Systemes GEMS v6.5 software.
14.2.1  Gold Equivalent (AuEQ) Calculations and Assumptions
The  Santa  Elena  deposit  demonstrates  mineralogical  correlation  between  gold  and  silver  concentrations.    Based  on  current  metal  prices,  EBA  applied
criteria to define the AuEQ, defined below, to be applied for both interpretation and reporting purposes.
 
Inputs for metal prices were based on trailing 3-year and 5-year datasets of average monthly metal prices for gold and silver at the end of March 2013, based
on  the  drill  hole  data  cut-off  date  of  March  15th,  2013.  Figures  14.1  and  14.2  show  the  3  year  monthly  average  trends  with  the  average  composite
values.  From the values shown in Table 14.2, a ratio of 70:1 silver to gold was selected for the AuEQ using the formula shown below.

Routine  in-situ  specific  gravity  (SG)  testing  was  conducted  by  SilverCrest  personnel  throughout  the  2012-2013  drilling  programs.    A  total  of  846
measurements from drill core were collected with a standard scale and bucket measuring apparatus. Results were tabulated in the corresponding drill hole
logs.  Of these, 766 SG samples were labelled with a rockcode (Table 14.3) and have been used in average SG calculations.
 
A specific gravity value of 2.60 was selected for mineralized material based on the mean value attained for the quartz, and vein related, samples.

14.3.1.2  High Grade Capping
Inspection of the uncapped composite data indicates the populations are positively skewed with some anomalous outliers.  Histogram distributions and log-
probability plots for gold and silver grade distributions were used for visual determination of anomalous values and as the basis of selection for high grade
metal capping. High grade caps were applied to the composited samples prior to interpolation of the block model using values of 12 gpt for gold and 600 gpt
for silver.  Figures 14.6 and 14.7 below highlight the capped gold and silver values on cumulative log-probability plots.

Drill core data was used as the basis for geological interpretation with cut-off grade and for the construction of mineralized solids at a 1.0 gpt AuEQ cut-off
created as triangulations using Dassault Systemes GEMS v6.5 software. The analytical data was interpolated into a block model using the Ordinary Kriging
(OK) method and was constrained by the mineralized solids.
 
The geological grade model has been built referencing the WGS 84 zone 12 coordinate system, the origins and bounds of the block model are listed in
Table 14.7, no rotation has been applied. Topographic data used in the model was collected by Eagle Mapping in November of 2010 using a fixed wing
aircraft to create a digital terrain model (DTM) accurate to 2 metre resolution. Drill hole collar elevations surveyed by SilverCrest personnel using a handheld
GPS were generally 10-14 metres higher than the DTM surface. Elevations were later corrected using the mine survey equipment and personnel to match
the Eagle Mapping DTM.

14.4.2  Grade Model Used in the Interpretation
Interpretation used for the geological grade model was prepared by EBA through discussions with SilverCrest personnel, independent field observations and
review of documentation.  The block model and resulting resource estimate was completed by EBA using Dassault Systemes GEMS geological modelling
software.
 
The Santa Elena deposit is a semi-continuous quartz and calcite filled brittle structure that strikes approximately 080 degrees and dips approximately 60
degrees to the south with a predominant south easterly directed plunge on mineralization with a rake of approximately 25 degrees.  Local variations in both
the strike and dip in the vein orientation is seen across the vein and may be associated with local pinch and swelling in the mineralized thickness.
 
A grade solid was generated on cross and plan section using raw drill hole assay grades and a 1.00 gpt AuEQ3 cut-off threshold within an interpreted
mineralized solid.  Hard boundaries are suited to the nature of epithermal vein mineralization and directly from evidence seen in drill hole mineralization and
sample results at Santa Elena.  Because the grade shell includes two splays in the deeper eastern section it was subdivided into three internal domains to
reflect current interpretation of flexure and re-orientation of the mineralization along strike. The flexural zones connecting these domains were modelled
separately to allow for smooth and continuous interpolation of metal grades within the mineralization.  In the footwall of the zone, two additional narrow zones
identified at mid to shallow depths directly beneath the current open pit operation were modelled and named Cholugo and Cholugo Dos (Figure 14.10).  A
unique code was applied to each domain for modelling purposes, described in Table 14.9 below.

The  composite  intervals  described  in  Section  14.3  were  calculated  within  the  boundaries  of  the  modelled  grade  shell  using  raw  assay  data,  and  then
subjected to additional geostatistics and analysis as described below.
14.4.3  Interpolation Method and Variography
The  model  is  based  on  verified  drilling  completed  by  SilverCrest  between  2006  and  2013  which  has  provided  near  continuous  drill  intersection  at
approximately 40 metres spacing within the mineralization.  Grade distribution and the drill sample density supports variography analysis to estimate the
orientation and anisotropy of elliptical search parameters for modeling the mineralization.
 
Initially, variograms were created for both gold and silver in each of the 3 subdivided domains to determine internal ellipse orientations and then for the
overall vein to determine a reasonable search range.  The variograms were verified with field observation and matched well with expected grade trends
within the Main Mineralized Zone.  Slight variance was noted between the ranges of gold and silver variograms, so the gold variogram parameters were
selected as the controlling values of the primary elliptical interpolation pass.

Metal grade values were interpolated into the block model from the one metre composite dataset using the variogram and ellipse parameters applied to and
Ordinary Kriging algorithm.  A minimum of 2 composites, to a maximum of 15, were required to interpolate block grades with no more than 5 composites
reporting from any one drill hole.
14.4.4  Block Classification
Mineral resources have been classified based on the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The category the resources
have been assigned is based on the confidence in geological information available relating to the mineral deposit, the quantity and quality of data available,
the level of detail of the technical and economic information which has been generated and the interpretation of the data and information.  EBA confirms that
the resources for the Santa Elena deposit meet the test of being a reasonable prospect for consideration of economic extraction based on the success of
currently open pit production and continuity of mineralization along defined structural trends.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Interpolation of gold and silver grades used the variogram and search parameters outlined above as the basis for estimation.  Following the interpolation, a
script was run to assign classification scheme to each block to represent a level of confidence for the reported grades.
 
An Inferred classification has been applied to the block model to target peripheral blocks that indicate the presence and continuity of mineralization, but lack
the density of data necessary for confirmation.  Inferred blocks within the Santa Elena deposit lie within the maximum variogram range of 117 metres and
have grade support from at least 1 drill hole and a minimum of 2 individual composite grades.  All mineralized blocks within the Cholugo and Cholugo Dos
veins were assigned as Inferred.
 
An Indicated classification has been applied to the block model to target portions of the mineralized body where data density confirms the presence and
continuity of mineralization with a moderate level of confidence. A factor of 0.9 was applied to the total sill of the experimental variogram to determine the
range with a level of confidence to support classification of Indicated Mineral Resources as seen below in Figure 14.11.  This resulted in a value of 60
metres.  All mineralized blocks with grade support from at least 2 drill holes and a minimum of 10 reporting composites within a distance of 60 metres were
assigned to the Indicated category.

14.4.6  Underground Validation
Estimated block grades were visually compared to drill hole grades along horizontal and vertical sections using the Santa Elena GEMS model (Figures
14.13 to 14.16).  In addition, Nearest Neighbor (NN), Inverse Distance Weighted methods, (IDW5 and IDW3) were run to compare against the Ordinary
Kriging method (OK) used in the actual resource estimate.  Average Au and Ag grades were reported for 25 metre vertical and horizontal slices of the
resulting verification and plotted for comparison against the average input composite grades within the same sections.  The results were compared to check
for potential global biases of the primary OK calculation method.  In general, an overall grade smoothing trend is observed in all methods.  The smoothing
effect in areas with discreet high grade peaks in the composite samples data effectively accounts for the declustering of data within the block model in higher
grade areas which are represented by high number of densely populated sampling points. OK has declustered the data but a directional bias as part of the
OK algorithm highlights high grade trends in areas with high density of sample points which is not seen in the IDW runs.

Overall, the four methods depict a close approximation to the overall grade trends shown by the composite sampling data.  The individual methods show
repeatability and do not indicate that biases have been introduced during the modelling process.  The OK method is thought to support the local variation in
grade and is felt to be an adequate representation of the grade distribution throughout the deposit.
14.4.7  EBA Statement on Mineral Resource Estimates
EBA has compared and reviewed the available datasets for the block model resources and feels that the block models used to report the mineral resource
estimate as stated above are valid and represent the source data in a reasonable manner.
14.5  Heap Leach Mineral Resource Estimate
The Leach Pad Resources (spent ore) have been estimated by SilverCrest utilizing daily production, grade and mass records obtained at the crushing plant
when conveying mineralized material to the pad. These records represent a complete production dataset since start-up of the operations at Santa Elena. A
detailed leach pad survey was completed in April 2013 to provide volumes of material placed on the pad. This volume was compared with weightometer
data collected on the crushing plant to validate tonnes on the pad using well known specific gravity on the leach pad of 1.85 g/cm3.
 
A block model from validation drilling was completed on 25 holes spaced on a 25 metre by 25 metre grid as described below. The validation results support
the estimation by the Company utilizing daily production data.

Original samples were not composited, maintaining the original length. An inverse distance squared methodology was applied with a single domain and
isotropic  search  ellipse  (200  meters  -same  search  distance  in  all  directions).    This  provides  a  close  to  polygonal  estimation  approach  for  the  resource
estimation  due  to  small  area  and  limited  number  of  samples.    The  grade  interpolation  parameters  included  no  grade  capping.  A  minimum  of  2s  and
a  maximum of 12 composites were used to interpolate block grades, with no more than 3 composites reporting from any one drill hole in multi stage search
radiuses to populate all blocks. Visual validation was performed to assess the results and final resource numbers were benchmarked against production
data for validation purposes.

*Classified by SilverCrest Mines Inc. and conforms to NI 43-101 and CIM definitions for resources. Mineral Resources have been estimated from drill hole
data and validated using company production data and sampling. The estimate must not be considered to imply economic mineability. The reported baseline
Mineral Resource for the leach pad material is based on a 0.5 gpt AuEQ cut-off and is highlighted in light blue.  No grade capping has been applied.
**Based on Au:Ag ratio of 70, incorporating metal price assumptions of $1,450/oz Au, $28/oz Ag and using metallurgical recoveries of 92% Au and 67.5%
Ag.  All leach pad spent ore is considered above cutoff grade of 1.0 gpt AuEQ.
14.6  Open Pit Mineral Resource Estimate
The updated open pit Resources have been estimated by SilverCrest utilizing Company production data (blastholes), exploration drilling data and computer
modelling. All Indicated Resources in the operating open pit have been converted to Reserves as of December 31, 2012.
 
The  Open  Pit  Mineral  Resource  estimates  are  based  on  verified  information  from  historical  and  recent  SilverCrest  sources.  Solid  boundaries  for  the
mineralization were constrained at 0.20 gpt AuEQ cut off and the open pit limits defines the mineralized material dated as December 31, 2012. The Resource
estimation was completed using Gemcom GEMS software applying Ordinary Kriging. Raw data (blast holes, core and RC samples) were composited to a 5
metre length for blast holes and 2 metre length for in-pit core and RC samples. These composites were assessed for spatial and geostatistical purposes. A
capping of 8 gpt Au and 300 gpt Ag was applied to core and RC data only. The composite data was interpolated into a 5 metre x 5 metre x 5 metre block size
model using Ordinary Kriging in two passes. The first pass using only blast hole data with an average spacing of 4 metres and interpolating grades to a
maximum distance of 15 metres from the sample location. The second pass used only core and RC drilling data spaced on average 50 metres to interpolate
5 metre x 5 metre x 5 metre blocks located in distances beyond 15 metres from the sample location. The blasthole resource model was compared against the
production data for verification purposes.

15.0  MINERAL RESERVES ESTIMATES
15.1  Introduction
Three individual Mineral Reserve estimates are presented in this report and are combined into the mine schedule and economic analysis that comprises the
Santa Elena Expansion Project.
 
An  updated  Reserve  estimate  for  the  Santa  Elena  open  pit  and  a  new  Reserve  estimate  for  spent  ore  material  on  the  existing  leach  pads  have  been
prepared  by  Eric  Fier,  CPG,  Chief  Operating  Officer  of  SilverCrest  and  non-Independent  Qualified  Person,  and  has  accounted  for  production  up  to  the
Effective Date.  A new Reserve estimate for the proposed underground mine has been prepared by Mike Tansey, P.Eng, Senior Mining Engineer with EBA
and an Independent Qualified Person.
 
On the basis of resources classified as Indicated in Section 14, EBA has estimated Santa Elena underground diluted and recoverable Reserves. SilverCrest
have estimated leach pad and open pit Reserves (Table 15.2).
15.2  Previous Reserve Estimates
An  updated  reserve  estimate  for  open  pit  mining  operations  at  Santa  Elena  was  previously  completed  by  SilverCrest,  with  the  assistance  of  Dassault
Systemes Software International, and reviewed by EBA in January, 2011.  This Reserve estimate was released by EBA in May 2011 in the report “NI 43-101
Technical Report, Reserve Update for the Santa Elena Open Pit and Preliminary Assessment for the Santa Elena and Cruz de Mayo Expansion Project,
Sonora Mexico (amended date May 11, 2011)”.
 
The  open  pit  Reserves  reported  in  2011,  and  shown  in  table  15.1  below,  are  superseded  by  the  current  open  pit  Reserve  estimate  described  in  this
report.   Significant variance from the current open pit Reserve estimate is attributed to the open pit design which was recently reduced in size from the 2011
pit.

15.3  Current Reserves Overview and Assumptions
The classification of Reserves follows the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as documented in National Instrument 43-101 and adheres to the
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Best Practice Guidelines. Indicated Resources demonstrating economic viability are assigned the
Probable category. No Measured Resources have been estimated, and therefore none of the Reserves estimated will be classified as Proven.  The Mineral
Reserves (open pit, underground, leach pad) in table 15.2 are based on the following parameters where applicable:
1.  Gold price of $ 1450 / troy ounce (3 year trailing average based - effective date 30th April 2013)
2.  Silver price of $28 / troy ounce (3 year trailing average based - effective date 30th April 2013)
3.  Silver grade was converted to a gold equivalent (AU EQ) using a 70:1 Ag (g/t) to Au (g/t) ratio
4.  Mining recovery of 85% for long hole stoping
5.  Mining recovery of 95% for mechanised cut and fill mining methods
6.  Global AU EQ cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t for stope design
7.  Specific cut off grades applied to each stope based on type of stoping and stope dimensions (see table 15.4).
8.  Total cost per tonne of $13.9 for open pit heap leach including waste, processing and G&A
9.  Total Cost per tonne of $28 for open pit milling
10.  Total cost per tonne of $ 61 (undiluted) for long hole stoping methods including stope development, processing and G and A costs
11.  Total cost per tonne of $ 65 (undiluted) for mechanised cut and fill stoping methods including stope development, processing and G and A costs
12.  Total cost per tonne of $22 for leach pad spent ore milling

NI 43-101 and CIM definitions for Resources and Reserves.
*Open Pit and Leach Pad Probable Reserves were Classified by SilverCrest.  Underground Reserves and Resources were classified by EBA.
**Underground Probable Reserve is based on a cut-off grade of 1.47 gpt AuEq with an average 11% dilution and 90% mine recovery.
***Open Pit Reserve is based on a cutoff grade of 0.20 gpt AuEq in a constrained pit shell with applied capping of 8 gpt Au and 300 gpt Ag.
****Leach Pad Reserve based on production and drill hole data for volumetrics and grade model using a cutoff grade of 0.5 gpt AuEq. No capping was
applied.
*****Underground Resources are based on 1 gpt AuEq grade shell and cutoff grade of 1.4 gpt AuEq with applied capping of 12 gpt Au and 600 gpt Ag.
15.4  Basis for Underground Mineral Reserve
The underground Mineral Reserve tonnages are based on the block model used for Indicated Resources. The block model has been developed using 5
metre x 5 metre x 5 metre blocks based on a grade shells modeled into a grade (mineralization) model created using drill hole intersections of greater than
1.0 g/t AU EQ. The Block model represents estimated Au and Ag grades interpolated using capped composite samples calculated by Ordinary Kriging (OK)
into each block (refer to section 14 for details of resource modelling). The block model is clipped to the topography and/or the currently planned ultimate pit.
Reserves were calculated using the grade shell model, restricted laterally by the grade (vein) model, and running various stope length and height iterations
to obtain the optimal stope dimension.
 
EBA estimated reserve grade and tonnage through cost approximation and thereby determination of a cut-off grade for AUEQ based on gold price and
metallurgical recovery (see section 13 and 17). Rock engineering criteria and analysis results (see section 16.2) were used to determine provisional stable
stope spans, using a set stope height of 45 m.  The stope height was based on a conceptual model for long hole stoping, with two sublevels in each stope,
separated by 22.5 m.  Mineral reserves were initially estimated at a cut-off of 1.5 g/t Au Eq for all stopes. Specific cut-off grades were then determined by
mining method after mining costs were established by an iterative optimization process.  Within the stope shapes created, Indicated Resources above and
below the cut-off grades were then considered for definition of undiluted Reserves. Other material within the stope shapes, including Inferred Resources, are
considered as zero grade dilution, resulting in internally diluted Reserves. Optimization was undertaken by excluding low grade areas from the stopes and
through  placement  of  ground  stability  rib  and  sill  pillars  outside  of  high  grade  areas.  Figure  15.1  shows  the  stope  shapes  generated  for  the  Reserve
definition.

External dilution (outside of the modelled stope) is added to the grade and tonnage to determine the Probable Reserves.  The external dilution is based on
the type of stoping being undertaken, rock engineering design spans and resultant dilution, minimum mining widths and consideration for blast damage.
 
Table 15.3 below summarizes the Santa Elena underground reserves by tonnage contained in stopes, recoverable pillars, and development drifts situated in
ore.  Table 15.4 shows the breakdown of the reserves, with the estimation of dilution and mining recovery on a stope by stope basis. Table 15.4 also shows

15.4.1  Underground Mining Methodologies Consideration for Underground Reserves
Three primary mining methods were considered for estimation of costs and thereby mineral reserves, namely; longitudinal long hole stoping, transverse long
hole stoping, and mechanized cut and fill (refer to Section 16.3 for explanation of mining methods).
 
Longitudinal long hole stoping has the highest estimated external dilution for the three methods in, with an average of 15% with select few stopes as high as
28% (due to the width of the vein being lower than the minimum mining width).  This method constitutes the lowest overall operating cost and has been
applied to all stopes with widths less than 15 m (hanging wall to footwall) and a footwall dip angle of greater than 50 °.
 
For stopes with dip angles greater than 50 ° and width greater than 15 m, transverse long hole stoping has been selected. This method requires more waste
footwall development and is thereby marginally higher cost than longitudinal long hole stoping.  Lower dilution has been included for transverse stopes, as
the spans of the stope are limited to 20 m widths at any one point; see section 16 for mining method descriptions. Table 15.5 shows the breakdown of mining
methods utilized throughout the life of the mine. Calculations are based on tonnages mined and mining method employed in each stope.

Mechanised cut and fill stoping has been applied to all areas with footwall dip angle of less than 50° from the horizontal.  This method has the highest cost,
due to footwall development requirements and productivity constraints due to reduced size of cuts taken at any point and the need to backfill .  External
dilution is estimated to be less for mechanized cut and fill due to hanging wall exposures being limited to a single cut at any point. In addition, sloughage of
the hanging wall  will be controlled by the backfill and through placement of support in the form of rock bolts and/or split sets in the active cut.
15.5  Open Pit Reserves (SVL)
All  open  pit  Mineral  Resources  are  declared  as  Reserves  (table  15.6).  Open  pit  production  from  January  1  to  April  30,  2013  was  subtracted  from  the
December 2012 Resource estimation.

15.6  Heap leach Reserves (SVL)
Section 14.4 details the estimation of heap leach Indicated Resources.  Based on mining practicality, no cut-off grades between 0 and 1 gpt AuEQ were
applied. All average grades for the leach pad spent ore are above 1gpt AuEQ, therefore all tested resource tonnes on the pad are considered reserves.
 
All spent ore material on the leach pad will be reprocessed through the processing facility once operational in the first quarter of 2014. Only the material
currently on the pad and leached (300 day cycle completed or estimated full cycle) has been declared as Reserves. Approximately 882,000 tonnes of open
pit material is planned to be placed on the pad during the remainder of 2013 and will undergo only partial leaching before being re-processed through the
new facility. Once this material is placed on the pad and leaching has been discontinued, it will be declared as leach pad Reserves for processing and metal
recovery  in  2014.  Extensive  metallurgical  test  work  including  ongoing  operations  data  show  that  all  declared  Reserves  are  amenable  to  conventional
leaching either by heap leach technology or standard CCD milling with a Merrill Crowe recovery system for doré bar production.

16.0  MINING METHODS
16.1  Introduction
This section includes a geotechnical analysis, explanation of mining methods and mine design methodology completed for the Prefeasibility Study based on
the information available and with the assumption that further investigation and detailed engineering will be completed prior to or during development. In
practice the actual conditions will vary based on actual ground conditions encountered. As more drilling is completed and the mine is developed, the mining
methods, stope layouts and rock engineering criteria will be modified in favour of actual conditions.
 
Conventional open pit mining will continue using a contractor until the third quarter of 2014 when the open pit reserves will be depleted. Mining of the heap
leach spent ore will be completed by loader and conveyor to transport material to the plant.
 
The analysis was completed using the basis of assumptions for geological model described in Section 14, and mining methods were selected based on the
results of preliminary geotechnical and rock mechanic analysis and to account for variations in vein thickness and orientation.  A detailed geotechnical
analysis was conducted to determine specific parameters for each mining method.
16.2  Geotechnical Analysis for Underground Mining
16.2.1  General
The geotechnical analysis of underground production stoping at Santa Elena is based on geotechnical data collected from sixteen exploration drill holes, six
of which were oriented, advanced as part of the 2012 subsurface exploration program and test work conducted on core samples at the University of Sonora,
Hermosillo, Mexico.
 
This section addresses the present work conducted for the proposed Santa Elena Expansion Project and provides a summary of the range of variance of the
rock mass conditions (by means of RMR76 and NGI-Q classification systems) at the following five zones:
§  Ore zone (referred herein as Zone D1).
§  Country rock above the hanging wall, from 5-6 m to 50-60 m above the upper ore zone/country rock interface (referred here in as Zone D2).
 
§  Country rock above the hanging wall, between the upper ore zone/country rock interface and about 5-6 m above it (referred here in as Zone D3).
 
§  Country rock below the foot wall, from 5-6 m to 50-60 m below the lower ore zone/country rock interface (referred here in as Zone D4).
 
§  Country rock below the foot wall, between the lower ore zone/country rock interface and about 5-6 m below it (referred here in as Zone D5).

of the 16 drill holes are presented in Table 16.1.
§  Geological and geotechnical logging of the drill holes is listed in Table 16.1.  This work was conducted by Silver Crest’s mine geologist prior to splitting
the core.  The geotechnical logging includes collection of geotechnical parameters to estimate the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system (Bieniawski 1976)
and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute’s NGI Q-System (after Barton et al. 1974). EBA undertook QA/QC of the rock core during site visits at the Santa
Elena project.

16.2.3  Rock Mass Characteristics
EBA evaluated the rock mass quality using the NGI-Q and RMR systems for the 16 drill holes listed in Table 16.1.  For this purpose, the geotechnical logs
were processed in raw spread sheets.  During this process, EBA reviewed (QA/QC) the geotechnical logs against the core photos and made corrections
where appropriate.
 
The rock mass was subdivided into five geotechnically distinct zones as described in Section 16.2.1.
16.2.4  Design Parameters
16.2.4.1  Rock Mass parameters
The cumulative percentage distributions of the NGI-Q and RMR values were calculated for the 5 zones. The cumulative percentage distribution plots provide
the means of progressively estimating the likelihood that an RMR or NGI-Q value will be equaled or exceeded. For this Prefeasibility study the NGI-Q and
RMR values at 50% were chosen. The purpose of adopting the 50% design values for Prefeasibility design is to provide stope dimension and reinforcement
that are not too conservative or too optimistic, and therefore serve for reasonable economic estimation.
 
Table 16.2 summarizes the NGI-Q and RMR values used for the preliminary design.

holes where potential faults were encountered.
 
In addition to this assessment set out in Table 2, NGI-Q values were assessed for the 655 Level. Core runs were isolated over a 45m run length at this level
to give an individual rock mass characterization for stoping at this level. NGI-Q values of 15 and 6 were calculated for zones D1 and D3 for stopes at this
level.
Rock strength is based on laboratory testing results from University of Sonora together with a small sample of test work undertaken at University of British
16.2.4.2  Rock Strength
Columbia, Vancouver. The test work completed at Sonora consisted of simple Uniaxial Compressive Tests (UCS) without strain measurements, Brazilian
Tests and Point Load Tests (PLT). The test work at UBC consisted of simple UCS and Brazilian tests for comparison. The results of the laboratory testing at
both Universities is presented in Appendix E.

The average ore body strength from the test work undertaken at the two institutes is 87 MPa.
 
The strength of the hanging wall for the prefeasibility analysis is taken as 92 MPa. This is based on the average point load testing data from University of
Sonora. Three UCS tests were carried out in hanging wall material at University of Sonora giving an average of 95 MPa which ties in closely with the PLT
results.
16.2.5  Design Approach
16.2.5.1  General
The design approach presented in this report consists of empirical and analytical methods using the rock mass quality approach.  In this respect, it should be
noted that as with all the empirical methods, assumptions should be validated once mining starts by comparing actual with anticipated results.  Below is
presented the empirical method used for the assessment.
16.2.5.2  Design Assumptions
The following assumptions have been made during the geotechnical design approach at Prefeasibility level for Santa Elena.
 
§  Modelling of the orebody and mine openings was undertaken using RocScience Examine 2Dtm software. As such, the rockmass is assumed isotropic and
homogenous. See geotechnical recommendations in section 26.2.
§  Hoek-Brown parameters and deformation characteristics are generic dependent on rock type as established from the RocScience RocLabt m software
program.
§  The orebody was split into three sections – West, Central and East and an average dip and strike was assigned to each.
 
§  Stopes are assumed to be of fixed width along strike with average dip and strike dependent on their location within the orebody.
§  Stope vertical height is set at 45 m.
§  No stress data is available at site. Stress is assumed to be depth dependent based on overburden. No variation in the horizontal to vertical stress ratio was
incorporated at prefeasibility level.
§  Based  on  the  ground  water  report  undertaken  by  Global  Resource  Engineering  (2011)  and  observations  undertaken  during  ramp  development  the
excavations were assumed to be dry or have minor inflow. A second hydro-geological assessment is recommended to confirm the initial findings of Global
Resource Engineering.
16.2.5.3  Tabulation of Results
Tables 17 through 23 in Appendix E show the stope configuration summaries for each level for longitudinal and cut and fill mining. They indicate a stable
span without support, a stable span with support and a measure of anticipated dilution with greater span lengths. Effective cable bolt support has been
considered when designing maximum spans for stable spans with support. These stope design summary tables present the results of the analysis with
respect to the rectangular stope design and are referred to in the body of this summary.  They are split into West, Central and East locations at each level
dependent on average strike and dip of the orebody.

 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
These reference tables are meant for general design purposes only at a Prefeasibility level as the stope spans assume continuous width and dip profiles. As
actual stopes vary in width and dip across their span, further geotechnical study of individual stopes is advised beyond Prefeasibility level.
 
Actual stope and pillar performance should be consistently monitored during mining and a database created. This will allow for any modifications of initial
design to be made based on actual mining of the orebody.
 
Dilution levels for span lengths greater than those recommended from Potvin’s method are indicative only and it is strongly recommended that a site based
dilution data base be established to monitor sloughage based on stope spans and rockmass quality. Further rockmass classification through mapping and
logging can assist in defining stope dimensions to a higher level of detail. Actual stope and pillar performance should be consistently monitored during
mining. This will allow for any modifications of initial design to be made based on actual mining of the orebody.
16.2.5.4  Methodology of Stability Graph for Stope Design
The  stability  graph  method  (developed  by  Mathews  et  al.  (1981)  and  modified  by  Potvin  (1988)  and  Nickson  (1992)  is  widely  used  by  designers  to
qualitatively assess the stability of open stopes.
 
The stability number N is defined as:
 
N = Q' x A x B x C                                                                                             (1)
 
Where A is the stress factor (ratio of intact rock strength to induced stress), B is rock defect orientation factor, and C is the gravity factor related to orientation
of design surface.
 
See Table 16.3 for summary of NGI-Q’ values.

16.2.6  Span Length Design – Longitudinal and Transverse
The following key mining parameters / assumptions were used as the basis of the initial stope design:
§  Non-man entry to production level.
§  With an initial assessment of the effect of both hanging wall and the stope back it was found that the hanging wall will govern the stope size. Therefore, the
hanging wall effect was considered throughout the design process.
§  Cable bolted stopes and stable stope spans were assessed.
§  Two scenarios were considered for stope length design in longitudinal mining: When the hanging wall is excavated in waste rock, and when mineralized
vein is left in place as part of the hanging wall.
§  Stope widths of 7 metres, 12 metres, 17 metres and 22 metres were considered.
Sloughage was considered using the ELOS graph developed by Clark and Pakalnis (1997). This seeks to quantify the degree of dilution anticipated for a
given span length and corresponding shape factor.
 
It must be noted that this graph was developed for weak rock masses. There is no measure of time dependent behaviour but nevertheless this approach
provides an indication as to predicted dilution at this stage and should be used in conjunction with observational data during mining. Acceptable sloughage
levels of 15% or less were also calculated for stope design utilizing the ELOS criteria for the stability graph after Clark and Pakalnis (1997).
16.2.7  Stope Back Width Design
The stability graph method was utilized for designing the “stable” back length similar to hanging wall stope length design. It can be seen in Tables 17 through
23 in Appendix E that the hanging wall stability is the overall controlling factor for stope stability.
 
At this Prefeasibility level it may be advisable to consider supporting stope backs greater than 10 metres width with cable bolts at the 536 Level and below
due to stress effects. However, as spans will likely vary across levels and also in individual stopes, the magnitude and orientation of the in-situ stress regime
is recommended beyond Prefeasibility level to verify stress effects on the mine openings and hence the need for localized support in individual stopes.
16.2.8  Cut and Fill
The dimensions for the cut and fill mining method were estimated using the span design curve (Lang, 1994).
 
A maximum span of 15 metres is recommended in current cut and fill mining levels. The spans refer to spans which may not require intensive ground support
such as timber sets, cable bolts or post pillars,  but  still requires local support within the immediate back to confine potential blocks (loose) which may open
due to nearby blasting and/or redistribution caused by subsequent mining activity. 2 metre by 2 metre pattern bolting is recommended in slashed stopes with
spans less than these stable back span figures. Due to the nature of the ore body, spans will vary across levels and also in individual stopes. An assessment
of the need of support required for individual stopes needs to be undertaken at a stage beyond the scope of this PFS.
 
 
113
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
With a 5 metre cut and a maximum stope length of 100 metres dilution from blast damage only along the hanging wall should be expected.
16.2.9  Transverse Long Hole Stoping
With reference to Table 16.4 assuming a 20 metre stope width and a maximum length of 30 metre the stope back should remain stable. Loose from the stope
back may be created during the last 10 metre of stope production at 471 m and 536 m Level. Timely mucking and backfill placement is recommended. Stope
sidewalls should remain stable. A 10% dilution can be expected from hanging wall sloughage at the 471 m and 536 m Levels. However, as the hanging wall
forms the stope end, dilution will be dependent upon the speed at which the stope is blasted and mucked. If low grade mineralized vein forms the hanging
wall then expect blast damage only.

16.2.10  Pillar Design
16.2.10.1  Sill Pillar Design
For Prefeasibility Study purposes, sill stress was estimated in Examine 2D in four cases of stope width 7 metre, 12 metre, 17 metre, and 22 metre.
 
A  constant  sill  pillar  thickness  was  assumed  across  the  entire  mining  level  for  practical  mining  purposes.  This  constant  thickness  corresponds  to  the
maximum ore width analyzed. Additionally blast damage of 1 metre was also assumed on each side of the pillar.
 
Table 16.5 shows the corresponding sill thickness stability above each mine level with the greatest ore span considered having the most effect on stability
due to the ratio of width to height.

16.2.10.2  Crown Pillar Design
Underground mining will result in a temporary surface crown pillar below the open pit, as well as permanent crown pillars in some areas.  The minimum
thickness for crown pillar design was assessed as 25 metres using the empirical crown pillar stability graph (Carter, 1990) taking a typical Q value of 11.6 for
the ore at near surface stress conditions. The maximum span of the orebody was taken as 25 metres giving a thickness/span ratio of 1.
16.2.10.3  Rib Pillar Design
Rib pillar widths have been assessed based on two-dimensional analysis utilizing brittle Hoek Brown parameters and the pillar stability chart as used for sill
pillar analysis.
 
For two dimensional modelling a horizontal cross section was taken across the pillar midpoint in order to incorporate the pillar shape factor in the stress
analysis. A constant stress field dependent on depth was imposed onto the cross section.
 
For efficiency purposes at this stage of prefeasibility level study the rib pillar widths were modelled at the mid-point of the mine at 536 m level. Five “fixed”
stope span length classes of 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 metres were modelled. An average pillar sub-vertical height of 56 metres was used during the analysis
based on average dip of the ore body across the West, Central and East domains. Rib widths of 15 metres, 18 metres, 20 metres, 25 metres, and 30 metres,
respectively, were found to give an adequate factor of safety for these span lengths, as shown in Table 16.6. Stress analysis was conducted on a pillar width
2  metres  less  than  the  final  pillar  width  to  take  into  consideration  pillar  blast  damage.  An  in-situ  stress  testing  and  tri-axial  strength  testing  regime  is
recommended to refine pillar dimensions beyond Pre-Feasibility level.

16.3  Proposed Underground Mining Methods
The Santa Elena ore body varies in dip and thickness along strike and at depth. As a result, three well established underground mining methods have been
selected for ore extraction. These mining methods are categorized in table 16.7 below:

Mining Method
Longitudinal Longhole Stoping
Transverse Longhole Stoping
Mechanized Cut and Fill
In general, conventional mechanised mining methods have been selected.  The basis of the development of the mining methods and consequent equipment
selection  has  been  that  SilverCrest  will  undertake  production  drilling,  blasting  and  loading  using  a  contractor  for  the  waste  rock  and  ore  haulage  to
surface.  Initially a contractor will be retained to carry out mine development, with jumbo drill rigs purchased later in the mining life, after which development
will be done in-house.  The roles played for operation of the underground mine will be as follows:
1.  SilverCrest will undertake:
a.  General mine infrastructure development,
b.  Mine management and planning,
c.  General underground maintenance and provision of supplies,
d.  Ore drilling and blasting,
e.  Ore loading,
f.  Ore development and tunnelling (after purchase of a drilling jumbo)
2.  Haulage contractor will undertake:

16.3.1  Longitudinal Long Hole Stoping
Longitudinal long hole stoping is a sublevel bulk mining method involving a narrow, steeply dipping vein with competent ore and host rock. Santa Elena will
employ longitudinal long hole stoping when the ore has a width less than 15m. Figure 16.1 below shows typical layout and dimensions for sublevel long
hole mining.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
The stope design done for the purpose of this PFS considers two single drifts for drilling and blasting the ore to develop sublevels every 22.5 m, with a drift
developed at the base of the stope for mucking the blasted ore.  This results in stopes of 45 m in height.  The stope spans along strike are dependent on the
rock engineering criteria for managing hanging wall dilution.
 
The long hole mining concept takes advantage of the dip of the footwall, such that the broken ore will run to the base of the stope towards the mucking points.
The stope inclination will vary between 50o and 62o depending on which level and domain the mining is taking place.
 
The sill pillars separate the stoping blocks vertically with the sublevels further dividing each block. Rib pillars will be left between adjacent stopes, separating
the stoping blocks horizontally. Stope spans are based on geotechnical analysis by depth and geotechnical domain, see section 16.1.
 
A detailed geotechnical study based on geotechnical drilling and rock mass assessment was conducted and the results reported the recommended stope
dimensions  for  each  mining  level  and  the  different  domains.  These  parameters  along  with  the  Indicated  Resources  where  used  to  develop  the  stope
layout.  Where possible, the stopes have been placed in high grade areas, with sill and rib pillars placed in the lower grade areas.  EBA has considered that
rib pillar extraction is reasonably possible where rib pillars are located close to the access ramp to limit footwall development, have high grade and with a
strike width to pillar thickness ratio of more than 2:1  to ensure that there is reasonable expectation of pillar stability prior to extraction.
Stoping will begin by drilling and blasting the lower sublevel to initiate ore flow and provide an open face into which ore will be blasted. The mining will then
continue on the upper level and will retreat towards the cross cut intersection from the ramp, from which the stope is accessed.
16.3.2  Transverse Long Hole Stoping
In areas with a proposed stope thickness of greater than 15 metres, the transverse long hole mining method will be used.  When mining transversely, access
drifts will be driven perpendicular to the strike of the ore body from the initial footwall developments. The drawpoints will also be oriented perpendicular to
strike and will be accessed from crosscuts which extend from the footwall access drifts to the stope hanging wall. Mining occurs by retreating from the
hanging wall to the footwall, initiating ore flow by blasting from the footwall towards free face created against the hanging wall.  To mine the stope, it is
divided into primary, secondary and possibly tertiary stopes.  The primary stopes are the first to be mined, with secondary and tertiary stopes mined after
backfilling. Note that for the purpose of the PFS, cemented rock fill is being considered to prevent backfill from contaminating the ore while mining the
secondary and tertiary stopes.
 
The primary and secondary stopes will span from the footwall to the hanging wall and are planned to be 20 m wide. Figure 16.2 shows the primary stopes in
blue and secondary stopes in green. Once the primary stopes are mined out, they are backfilled using a cemented rock fill, which will be sourced from
development and surface waste rock dumps. The secondary and tertiary stopes are then mined between the filled stopes.  The overall stope heights are set
at 45 m to allow levels to coincide with longitudinal stopes. A sublevel interval of 22.5 m has been considered, as in the case of longitudinal long hole
method.

16.3.3  Mechanized Cut and Fill
Where the dip of ore body results in stopes with a footwall inclination of less than 50°, long hole stoping will not be suitable due to the increased length of
blastholes, potential blast hole inaccuracy and the potential for ore to hang up on the footwall.  EBA has thus considered mechanized cut and fill mining for
these areas.  The lower east portion of the reserve model, as seen in figure 15.1, has been assessed to have conditions conducive to cut and fill mining.
 
Though cut and fill stoping can consider large vertical spans, rib pillars and sill pillars have been included in the stope layout to separate stoping blocks and
to limit the hanging wall spans for each cut.  Once each cut is mined out, it will be filled with cemented rock fill, which can include tailings and waste rock
from ongoing underground development.  Dilution from hanging wall geotechnical failure will be minimal with cut and fill mining because there will be limited
exposure to the hanging wall during mining.  Support will be required for the exposed cut back (roof) of each cut during mining, for safety of personnel
operating machinery and working in the stopes.
 
The ore will typically be mined in 5 m high cuts, with each cut silled out from hanging wall to footwall. Each cut will be accessed by attack ramps from the
footwall development drifts. Once the cut has been filled all the way back into the attack ramp, the brow of the ramp is slashed into, and another cut can
begin. This process will continue until the attack ramp grade becomes too steep for ore haulage. The orebody is then accessed from a higher footwall
development. Figure 16.3 below represents the cut and fill method discussed here.
 
Trucks will backhaul fill material from tailings and waste rock stockpiles on surface, when rock is not available from underground development. This material
will be mixed with water and 5% cement to create a consolidated fill, and be placed in the stopes via scoop tram.

16.3.4  Rib and Sill Pillar Recovery
Wherever economically feasible, sill and rib pillars will be recovered. Specifically, the rib pillars between the 597-3 and 597-2 stopes and the 597-2 and 597-
1 stopes have been estimated to contain high grade ore and are accessible with minimal additional development, see figure 15.1 The sill pillar above the
597-4 stope also includes high grade ore, which could be extracted based on backfilling of the 597 level stope.

For the purpose of completion of this Prefeasibility study, the layout of the Santa Elena underground was completed using Dassault Systemes GEMS 6.5
software. This allowed for the digitization and visualization of the mine stope layout as it evolved through the design process.
16.4.1  Pillar Layout
The underground layout for Santa Elena was developed by initial placement of the sill pillars according to Indicated Resources above 1.5 g/t Au equivalent,
rock engineering criteria, the depth of the open pit and the desired crown pillar vertical thickness. Refer to section 16.2 for the geotechnical analysis and
geotechnical design parameters and resulting sill pillar thickness.  Subsequently, rib pillars were positioned on each level according to the rock engineering
analysis, using the maximum allowable open span for each level as the distance between rib pillars. Where possible low grade areas where targeted for rib
pillar placement.

16.4.2  Stope Layout
Solids were digitised in between the pillars, delineating the mineable area of the underground Indicated Resources. These solids provided the initial stope
shapes to calculate internally diluted grade and tonnage. These initial reports highlighted stopes which could be feasibly mined where grades were higher
than cut-off grade for the planned mining method, and allowed the exclusion of stopes that had grades below the economic cut-off grade. Where stopes
where found to have grades lower than the cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t AUEQ or the stopes grades where only marginally higher than the cut-off grade, the stopes
were clipped or adjusted to exclude some low grade materials on the stope edges. In some instances entire stopes were excluded from the reserves as the
stope grades were below the cut-off grade and there was too little material to justify reasonable extraction.
The layout of the cut and fill stopes was undertaken to create shapes above cut-off grade in the lower east portion of the mine where the deposit shallows out
in dip. More flexibility in the stope shape is possible for the cut and fill stopes, due to the mining method, though as far as possible stope shapes were kept to
blocks with strike lengths of a maximum of 100 m to limit the hanging wall spans within the cuts.  Sill pillars are not necessary but have been left to allow the
upper most stopes to be mined first This creates an opportunity for stoping to be undertaken concurrently with ongoing development, and thereby the use of
waste development muck for cut and fill stope backfill.
 
The stopes that are situated directly underneath the open pit include material that is considered crown pillar for the duration of mining. These stopes are
scheduled for extraction at the end of the mine life. These stopes will be mined by long hole method, but will only require a single development drift on the
bottom sublevel for haulage. The other access points for these stopes will be via drop-raises through the bottom of the open pit.
 
Figures 16.4 and 16.5 show the PFS arrangement of stopes, coloured by mining method. In yellow are the longitudinal long hole stopes, in orange are the
transverse longhole stopes and in green are the cut and fill stopes. The black regions are the pillars that were identified as recoverable

16.4.3  Development Layout
Figure 16.6 and 16.7 show the development layout developed for the PFS.
 
Access to the underground stopes will be via a main ramp, and a secondary ramp called the pit ramp, which will be developed from the bottom of the ultimate
pit at an elevation of 675 m a.m.s.l. The main ramp will continue from the current exploration drift which is being driven from surface, east of the open pit. The
ramps will be ventilated using a shaft that is driven within the centroid of the ramp with the fresh air carried by bag ducting to the face. A main exhaust
ventilation shaft will be developed to the east of the main ramp.  Details of the preliminary ventilation design are in section 16.7 of this report.
 
The stopes will be accessed from crosscuts driven from the ramps towards the ore body from the closest point on the ramp to the ore body on each level.
From these crosscuts, the sublevel developments will be driven.
 
For longitudinal stopes, the sublevel development drifts are situated within the ore, meaning this material will be sent for processing and recovery of gold and
silver if above the marginal cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t AU EQ (to ensure the ore will at minimum pay the processing costs). The stopes will be developed on three
sublevels: one abutting the upper sill pillar, one abutting the lower sill pillar, and one halfway between the sills. The lower development will be used as a
loading and haulage drift, and the upper two will be used as drilling and blasting drifts.
 
The transverse stopes will be developed similarly to the longitudinal stopes, except the development drifts must be in the footwall waste rock, and the stopes
will be accessed from perpendicular crosscuts. These drifts will serve as entry points through the ore body to the hanging wall, and mining will retreat to the
footwall. The drifts into the transverse stopes will be silled out to allow more accurate drilling of long holes between sublevels.
 
The cut and fill stopes access will be developed in the footwall waste rock. The stopes will be accessed using attack ramps from these main development
drifts. As a sublevel is finished, the backfill provides a working floor from which to mine the next cut.
Table 16.9 shows a summary of the linear metres of development over the life of mine, by development aspect.

16.5  Backfill
For the transverse long hole stoping and mechanized cut and fill mining methods, backfilling is required.  For the transverse long hole stoping the backfill will
be comprised of a combination of waste rock mixed with 5% Portland cement by weight to create a consolidated fill.  For cut and fill stoping the backfill does
not need to be cemented; however, for the purpose of the PFS cement has been included in the backfill costs to provide for the opportunity to extract rib and
sill pillars between cut and fill stopes if it is determined it is safe to do so.
 
The waste rock will either be transported from surface waste dumps or from adjacent mining stopes. Rock fill will be run of mine and therefore the overall
sizing curve will be short on fines, however detoxified mill tailings will also be available for use in backfilling.
16.5.1  Backfilling Cut and Fill Stopes
Mining will begin at the lower most section of each stope by slashing through the width of the ore body in (5 m) lifts. The openings will then be backfilled with
cemented rock fill. During mining of each 5 m high cut, support in the form of rock bolts or split sets will be installed in the back and sidewalls as informed by
geotechnical conditions and daily inspections. The backfill is placed in order to provide a new working platform for the level above.
16.5.2  Backfilling Transverse Long Hole Stopes
For transverse stoping, primary stopes will be mined leaving behind an adjacent secondary stope of the same width. Primary stopes will be laid out so that
temporary pillars are left in place to allow for the safe extraction of all primary stopes. The primary stopes will then be backfilled using cemented rock fill to
allow for the extraction of secondary stopes.  The process may be done in two or more phases of extraction to allow time for the cemented rock fill to set prior
to extraction of the adjacent stopes.
16.5.3  Backfilling to Extract Pillars
For the purpose of the PFS, EBA has included the extraction of high grade accessible pillars. In the case of rib pillars, the stopes on either side of the rib
pillar to be extracted will be backfilled.  In the case of sill pillars the stope below the sill pillar must be backfilled. This will provide the necessary support to
allow the rib and sill pillars to be extracted safely. New access drifts will have to be developed from the decline ramps for rib pillar extraction as the sublevel
drifts will have been mined out during the initial extraction of the stopes.
16.6  Overall Mining Schedule
The mining schedule describes the estimates tonnages which will be mined from the underground, open pit and the existing heap leach facility to feed the
expansion plan process plant.  Table 16.10 shows the combined schedule for the Santa Elena Expansion Project.

The schedule in table 16.10 excludes 882 kilo tonnes of material to be mined during 2013 and processed on the existing heap leach facility.
16.6.1  Underground Mine Production Schedule
For the purpose of the PFS, a preliminary schedule has been developed so that the stope tonnes and grades can be applied to a mining timeline.  The
mining schedule has been developed for the stopes in the reserve model and for the required development to access the stopes throughout the life of mine.
 
The mining schedule has been developed based on the parameters as shown in Table 16.11 below.
 
Table 16.11: Scheduling Parameters
Scheduling parameters
Value
Maximum daily production from each longitudinal long hole stope
Maximum daily production from each transverse long hole stope
Maximum daily production from each cut and fill stope
Heading/ drift advance rate per blast round
Maximum development advance per jumbo drill with one heading available
 
Based on the above parameters the mine stoping and development schedule was developed by targeting high grade stopes for the earlier in the schedule,
where  possible  and  ensuring  that  at  all  times  at  least  3  stopes  are  available  for  production,  to  allow  flexibility  in  the  mining  operation.    Additionally,
mechanised cut and fill stoping areas have been scheduled for the end of the life of mine. The development schedule was established by ensuring that the
required development for all stopes operating in a particular time period was completed in advance of production commencing.  Allowance has also been
made for a ramp up period.

After completion of the schedule, verification has been undertaken to ensure that the ore tonnes and grade in the schedule are consistent with the Probable
Reserve numbers for underground as shown in section 15.
 
Mining costs applicable to various types of stoping have been applied to each stope in the Probable Reserves and scheduled.  Development costs are
included separately as the timing of development of a stope and mining of a stope may be months apart and thus need separate consideration.

The mining schedule results in grade and tonnage performance as shown in Figure 16.8. Peak production is reached in year 6, when both access ramps are
actively producing.  Mechanised cut and fill mining in the lower portions of the mine have been scheduled later in the life of mine.

16.6.2  Open Pit Mining Schedule
 
The remaining ore reserves as shown in section 15, within the open pit reserves will be mined from the 30th of April 2013 until completion in July 2014.  In
terms of Santa Elena’s current production schedule for 2013, 881,843 tonnes will be mined in 2013 and the remaining 544,867 will be mined in 2014.
16.6.3  Heap Leach Mining Schedule
The heap leach mining schedule has been created in such a way as to increase mill feed to mill capacity for each year of operation. The heap leach resulted
in a tonnage of 2.8M tonnes at an average grade of 0.66 g/t Au and 33 g/t Ag for the life of mine. This schedule is not optimized and increases in grade are
possible once open pit heap leaching is complete by Q1 2013.
16.7  Ventilation
A preliminary ventilation study was performed for the Santa Elena Mine.  The purpose of the ventilation study was to determine the ventilation requirements
in terms of airflow and circuits, as well as provide an estimate of ventilation equipment, infrastructure and the excavations required.
16.7.1  Ventilation Requirements
Ventilation requirements were based on a common industry minimum of 0.06 m3/s per kW of equipment.  Based on the equipment usage at the mine, the
total air requirement is 146 m3/s.  Table 16.13 shows the estimated power and utilization of the underground equipment.

Operational constraints guided the ventilation design. In particular, hauling will be performed on the lower drift of each stope.  LHD’s are a large proportion of
the overall ventilation load, and the ventilation has been planned to avoid ventilation doors on haulage levels.  As a result, air flow has been routed to reach
the haulage drifts last.
16.7.2  Ventilation Model
16.7.2.1  Conceptual ventilation design
In order to undertake the ventilation design, conceptual design work was undertaken to create parameters for friction for various types of conduits.  This
resulted in conceptual designs for ventilation as shown in Tables 16.14 through 16.17.
16.7.2.2  Intake airway / Escape way Raise
This arrangement may apply to the intake fresh air raise, as is currently being excavated along with the main ramp. Figure 16.10 below shows a partition
within the raise, separating the man way from the airway itself. The complete raise has dimensions of 2.13 m by 3.05 m. This raise was sized to provide
ventilation, and an escape way route, for the ramp development only (3 trucks, 1 scoop, 1 jumbo, 1 Kabota). It is not meant to be the sole conduit of fresh air
for the mine when in production.

16.7.2.6  Setup of ventilation model
Ventsim  Visual  Advanced  (Ventsim)  was  used  as  the  ventilation  modeling  software.    Ventsim  provides  a  number  of  features  useful  for  underground
ventilation design, including fan specification, and airflow modeling throughout the mine workings.  The software utilizes the Hardy-Cross method to iterate to
a ventilation solution.  Minimum inputs to the software are a tunnel system, surface connection, and air moving device, such as a fan.
 
Initially, solid files were imported from the mine design software as centerlines of the mine workings.  Tunnels were constructed around the centerlines, and
then set as their actual type.  Group properties were set for each of the tunnel types.  The tunnel types have specific shapes, as well as friction factors. Tunnel
types and their properties are shown in Table 16.18.

The ventilation model is sensitive to an accurate friction factor being chosen.  The friction factors ultimately chosen are shown in Table 16.17.  After the initial
setup  of  the  model,  three  phases  were  created  for  ventilation  planning  purposes  only.    These  phases  are  representative  of  early,  mid,  and  late  mining
stages.  Figures 16.12, 16.13 and 16.14 show the ventilation phases and the ventilation requirements for each phase.
 
Ventsim supports a forced airflow method that allows a specific required airflow to be placed where a fan would be placed, and the required fan pressure,
and then models the airflow throughout the mine.  A forced airflow of 146 cu.m/s was selected from the initial ventilation calculations, and used throughout
the modeling as the target flow rate.
 
A final step was connecting the various workings to the ramps and drifts with attack ramps and small ventilation raises.  These were selected for ease of
ventilation  modeling  and  not  mining  feasibility.    As  a  result,  the  actual  location  of  access  ramps  into  the  drifts  is  not  reflected  in  the  Ventsim  model.
Additionally, some of the drifts will require in-place ducting to supply air to the working face.

16.7.3  Interpretation of Ventilation Conceptual Design
Based on the three sample phases, Santa Elena can be ventilated by one main exhaust fan. During development under the pit, auxiliary fans and ducting
will be required, until the under pit developments are attached to the main developments.  Ventilation velocities are reasonable in the ramp and shafts, and
airflow is adequate at the most distant drifts.
 
It may be advantageous to use two main fans, to provide redundancy in the event of mechanical failures.  As well, a stench gas system should be installed as
warning to evacuate the mine in case of emergency.

Santa Elena is a conventional open pit. All drilling, blasting and mining is completed by a local Mexican mine contractor utilizing a fleet of:
§  4 – 40 tonnes Caterpillar 740 articulating trucks.
§  3 – 70 tonnes Caterpillar 769 haul trucks.
§  Support equipment including one D8 and two D9 dozers, two excavators, two air track drills (Tamrock and G. Denver), one 140H Caterpillar grader,
explosives truck, and maintenance vehicles.
§  Auxiliary equipment includes a water truck and light vehicles.
The current optimized pit (Tinaja Pit) is designed for an estimated mine life of 4 years which was originally 6.5 years. The design was changed to avoid a
strip ratio up to 10:1 in year 3 and prevent excavation with a subsequent high cost diversion of the adjacent Tinaja gulch which has high water flows in the
rainy season. With the optimization of the original pit, a portion of the original reserves have been transferred to underground. The overall strip ratio for the
Tinaja Pit is approximately 4:1.
 
Standard operating procedures for the open pit includes:
 
§  Daily meetings between owner (Santa Elena operations) and mine contractor to review safety, production objectives and ore control for the day.
 
§  Blasthole drilling of ore is on an average 3.5 by 3.0 metre pattern, 6 metre hole depth with a 1 metre sub-drill. Blasthole drilling of waste is on an average
of 4.0 by 4.0 metre pattern.
§  Blastholes  are  loaded  with  mixture  of  ANFO  or  emulsions  depending  on  standing  water  in  the  hole.  Standing  ignition  is  used  for  basting  and
fragmentation.
§  Typically, a blast pattern consists of 50 to 100 blastholes with blasting occurring on average 3 times per week.
§  Blastholes considered to be in or near ore are systematically sampled and sent to the onsite lab for gold, silver and copper analysis. Turnaround time for
the  lab  is  estimated  at  24  hours.  Analytical  results  are  given  to  the  geology  department  and  standard  ore  control  is  completed  using  AutoCAD  and
Gemcom software.
§  Ore control is flagged and cut lines are established in the pit for extraction of ore and waste.

 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
§  Daily surveys are completed in the pit to determine volumes extracted and for floor grade control. Truck counts are also completed by the mine contractor
and owner personnel. Invoicing for the contractor is based on a cost per tonne with the reconciliation of surveys and truck counts.
§  Mine production is guided by a pre-set mine design that is considered geotechnically adequate to extract materials while operating in a safe manner.
 
§  Blasted ore from the pit is hauled to the nearby crushing facility and either end dumped into the primary jaw crusher or stockpiled for loader feed crushing.
As of April 31, 2103, an estimated 2.84 million tonnes of ore have been extracted from the pit delivered to the crusher and leach pad.
§  Blasted waste rock from the pit is hauled to the waste dump on the northwest of the pit. As of April 31, 2013, an estimated 10.1 million tonnes of waste
have been excavated and delivered to the waste facility (see Figure 18.1).
16.9  Spent Ore Mining And Rehandling Methods
Spent ore will be delivered to the mill using of a 3.5 cubic meter loader and a conveyor belt (grasshopper and stacker). A loader will load the spent ore from
the leach pad on to a 24 inch wide conveyor belt capable of handling 220 tonnes per hour to be delivered to a stockpile area for blending with underground
ore using a reclaim tunnel at the processing facility. Grade control will be performed on spent ore as using a belt sampler. The amount of spent ore required
to be processed is flexible. For this report a 50/50 blend is used to maintain a nominal 3,000 tonnes per day feed to the processing facility (1,500 tonnes per
day underground ore and 1,500 tonne per day spent ore from the leach pad).  Refer to figure 17.2 for a layout of the plant and 16.15 for the overall site layout
which shows the heap leach facility in relation to the plant site and ROM stockpiles.
 
Figure 16.15 Layout of the open pit and waste dump on April 30 2013
16.10  Tailings Disposal
The tailings produced from the processing facility will be filtered and deposited as dry-stack tailings. The tailings handling circuit will have the following
equipment:
§  final CCD thickener underflow pumps,
§  filter feed slurry pumps,
§  filter feed stock tank; 3,200 mm diameter × 7,600 mm,
§  three belt filters with a capacity ,
§  filter press conveyor belts,
§  air compressors,
§  tailings conveyor belt,
§  tailings filtrate pump box.
145
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
The  final  CCD  thickener  underflow  will  be  the  final  plant  tailings.  The  thickened  tailings  will  be  pumped  from  the  final  CCD  thickener  at  a  density  of
approximately 65% solids. Slurry will enter the pump box which will feed the tailings filter feed stock tank. The plate and frame filters will dewater the tailings
slurry to a moisture content of about 20%. The dewatered solids will be conveyed to the lined leach pad for aeration and cyanide destruction. Once the
cyanide toxicity in the dry tailings is at acceptable levels, it will be transported by conveyor to the waste facility for deposition and reclamation in the future.
The filtrate from the filter presses will be collected in a filtrate pump box and will be pumped to the barren solution tank for reuse within the leach circuit.
17.0  RECOVERY METHODS
The ore from both underground and open pit resources will be processed by conventional cyanide leaching technology, shown in Figures 17.1 and 17.2. In
addition partially leached material from the existing heap leach operations will be blended with underground ore at a variable rate and reprocessed through
the same plant.
 
Metallurgical test work has demonstrated that Santa Elena ore is amenable to conventional processing.  Test work has also demonstrated that the existing
heap leach residue can be further treated to recover most of the residual gold and silver.
 
Santa Elena ore contains an estimated average grade (open pit, underground and heap leach) of 1.24 g/t Au and 75 g/t Ag and after crushing and grinding
can be leached in cyanide to yield approximately 92% Au Recovery and 67.5% Ag recovery. Because of the relatively high level of silver in the ore (and
hence solutions) there are advantages and benefits to using traditional CCD and Merrill-Crowe for metal recovery rather than CIL/CIP. The partially leached
heap ore yielded recoveries of approximately 52% Au and 29% Ag when crushed to 10 mm and processed on the heap leach.  Since the leach cycle is
being prematurely terminated to start the mill on re-leaching after grinding the balance of the metals are recovered to the level expected from new ore.
The process plant has been designed to treat a nominal 3000 tonne per day (tpd) of ore, a mixture of freshly mined material and partially leached heap
residue.  The plant has been designed to treat any proportion of these two types of feed.  Because this may include up to 100% of fine crushed material from
the heap leach pads it was considered that this would be unsuitable feed for a SAG milling circuit and so it was elected to go to a conventional crushing and
grinding circuit.
 
ROM ore is delivered to a dump pocket ahead of the crushing plant.  Ore is reclaimed from the dump pocket by vibrating grizzly feeder and fed to a 30``x54``
jaw crusher (the one from the existing heap leach crushing plant).  Product is screened and oversize fed to a XL400 secondary cone crusher.  The cone
crushed product is again screened and the oversize to a bin ahead of two  XL 400 tertiary cone crushers, operated on close circuit with the same screen.
 
Crushed ore is placed on an open stockpile above a reclaim tunnel.  Reclaimed heap leach material is collected and conveyed to a second stockpile located
above the same reclaim tunnel.  Each stockpile has two feeders under it (total 4).  There is a weightometer between the two piles on the reclaim conveyor
and another after the reclaimed material has been combined (as well as a sampler) to allow for accounting of both the fresh ore and heap leach residue.  The
stacking belts feeding the stockpiles also have weightometers and cross belt samplers.
 
146
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Ore is reclaimed from the stockpiles and fed to a 15’x21’ (4.62 m x 6.77 m) ball mill fitted with a 2200 kW motor. This mill is designed to produce a 100µm
(P80) product and the mill circuit is closed by Hydrocyclones. The ore grinding takes place in barren solution and so significant amounts of gold and silver
will  dissolve  in  the  grinding  circuit.      The  cyclone  overflow  is  thickened  ahead  of  the  leach  circuit,  and  the  supernatant  solution  advanced  as  pregnant
solution or used elsewhere in the circuit depending on the grade.  Lime and Cyanide are also added to the grinding circuit to maintain desired leaching
conditions of pH10.5 and 1000mg/L NaCN strength.
 
The thickener underflow pulp at 55% solids is fed to the leach circuit consisting of five 13.6mx 12.8m high tanks giving a total of 48 hrs. residence time.
These tanks are aerated. In a slight departure from conventional practice after the first leach tank the leach slurry can be diluted and washed with lower
grade solution before being re-introduced into the leach circuit (tank #2).  This solution change has been shown to boost the leaching rate, reducing the
overall leach time required which provides opportunities to maximize capacity at the plant.
 
The last leach tank discharges to the CCD (counter current decantation) circuit:  This consists of three thickeners in addition to the grinding circuit thickener
and the intermediate thickener, making 5 thickeners in all.  A wash water ratio of 3.2:1 is anticipated.
 
The washed residue from the final CCD thickener underflow is fed to a surge tank ahead of the two tailings belt filters. Filtration of tailings and dry stacking
the cake was selected to minimize water usage, and produce stable tailings.  The dry tailings will be conveyed to an intermediate point adjacent to the
disposal area (leach pads), and then distributed over the disposal area (waste dump) after detoxification. Provision has been made for cyanide detoxification
of residue, but calculation of the likely concentration in the residue suggests it will not be required.  The intermediate transfer point will be sealed and any
drainage from the residue collected and returned to the ore process plant.
 
The pregnant solution is collected in the existing pregnant solution pond. The various qualities of the possible solution (grinding thickener, intermediate
thickener and #1 CCD thickener overflows) will be monitored to maintain a relatively high grade solution, with lower tenor solutions used elsewhere in the
circuit.
 
The pregnant solution is reclaimed from the pond and fed to a conventional Merrill-Crowe (MC) recovery circuit.  Solution is first clarified in a vertical leaf
precoat clarifier using DE (diatomaceous earth) as the clarifying medium.  The solutions are then de-aerated under vacuum to remove oxygen, and then zinc
dust is added to precipitate gold and silver which is removed from the solution by plate and frame filter press. The existing MC plant will be utilized alongside
a new MC plant.
 
The barren solution from the precipitation press is recycled for re-use in the plant as process water. The filter cake is discharged, dried and mixed with flux for
smelting to Dore.
 
The plant also has reagent handling systems.  Lime is added dry to the mill feed belt.  Cyanide is mixed as a 10% solution and distributed in the plant.
Flocculent,  zinc,  anti-scalent,  systems  are  in  place  as  well  as  systems  for  Copper  Sulphate  and  Sodium  Metabisulphate  if  required  for  cyanide  de-
toxification.

18.0  PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
The project infrastructure is shown in figure 18.1
 
The Santa Elena open pit heap leach mine was constructed in late 2009 and 2010, and has been operational since 2010. There are a number of facilities
currently in use at the Santa Elena site.
 
The  Santa  Elena  Expansion  Project  will  be  undertaken  within  the  current  infrastructure.  Broadly  speaking  the  Expansion  requires  the  addition  of  a
processing plant and facilities for the underground mine. The same infrastructure facilities utilized by the open pit mine will continue to be used for the
expansion.
 
Current facilities at the mine consist of (see Figure 18.1 for general site plan):
§  7 km long main access road from paved highway and local community of Banamichi,
§  2,500 tpd ore open pit mine utilizing a mine contractor,
§  Waste dump with the capacity of an estimated 35 million tonnes,
§  3-stage crusher provided by Excel Machinery of Amarillo, Texas,
§  Lined and certified leach pad designed by Vector Engineering of Denver, Colorado,
§  Lined and certified barren and pregnant solution pond designed by Vector Engineering of Denver, Colorado,
§  Lined and certified emergency pond designed for 100 year event,
§  Merrill Crowe plant and refinery,
§  On-site laboratory for production and exploration work,
§  Administration office,
§  Maintenance shop for mine contractor,
§  Diesel generators, and
§  All required piping, power and security.
The material on the existing heap leach facility will be removed, and there is space on the facility for rehandling of the tailings prior to transport to the waste
dump as dry stack tailings.
 
In January of 2012, the expansion of the mine from an open pit heap leach operation to an underground mill operation commenced with ground breaking of
the underground portal. As of April 31, 2013, the expansion was approximately 30% complete with all major equipment purchased and the completion of all
earthworks for the new processing facility, tank construction underway, and approximately 1,300 metres of underground ramping and development.

18.1  Surface Infrastructure for the Expansion Plan
18.1.1  Access Roads
The access road to the Santa Elena mine is a 7 km unpaved road, which connects to a nearby paved highway and the local community of Banamichi. This
road is currently operated and maintained by SilverCrest.
18.1.2  Offices, Cafeteria, Warehouse and Change Houses
The existing offices, cafeteria, warehouse and change house at Santa Elena are expected to be adequate for the Santa Elena Expansion Project. Currently,
the  office  space  consists  of  a  main  office  located  where  the  access  road  enters  the  mine  area  and  a  smaller  mobile  office  for  the  surveying  and  the
underground manager/s.  The process plant being constructed will include office space for the technical staff operating the processing facility.  No additional
office space is required for the expansion plan.
18.1.3  Fuel Storage Facility
The diesel storage requirements for the mining machinery for the open pit mine will be sufficient for the underground mining equipment. The consumption of
each individual equipment type is highlighted in table 18.1 with the total daily diesel consumption also listed.  Diesel for power generation will be stored at
the power generation site/facility.

18.1.4  Water storage facility
A water storage facility is located as shown in Figure 18.1, no additional water storage is required for the expansion plan.
18.1.5  Electrical Distribution
The underground mine will received power from surface generators supplying power to the process  plant and the underground mine.  The overall installed
capacity will be in the order of 6.5 MW.  Roughly 1 MW of the installed capacity will be required for underground.  The generators will produce power which
will feed a surface substation, from which power will be drawn for the process facility and the underground.  A 5 kV cable will take power underground, either
via the fresh air raise or via a borehole.
18.1.6  Explosive Magazine
Santa  Elena  currently  has  powder  magazines  for  the  open  pit  mining.    This  will  be  used  for  surface  bulk  storage  of  explosives  for  the  underground
operation.  Underground temporary storage of explosives will be undertaken in suitable areas or containers, as directed by Mexican mining health and safety
regulations.
18.1.7   Maintenance Shop
A maintenance shop exists for the underground machinery used in the ramp development.  This shop is adjacent to the current underground adit as seen in
figure 18.1 above. In addition to surface maintenance shops, and underground maintenance shop will be constructed on the 536 level.  This shop will consist
of 3 to 4 bays, which have been slashed to accommodate an underground truck with the load body in the tipping position.  The underground shops will be
fitted with overhead trolleys for lifting of heavy equipment and will include tools and equipment as required for maintenance.
The existing laboratory used for the open pit will continue to be used for the underground mining.
18.1.8  On-site Laboratory
18.1.9  Cement Silo
Santa Elena may require a cement storage area. This cement may then be added to waste rockfill and mixed in transport trucks on their way to the open
stopes. The rate of backfilling will vary with the production rate and the type of mining undertaken.  The maximum backfill requirements will occur when
mostly transverse long hole stoping is being carried out from year 6 to year 8 of mining.  The volumes will average around 360 to 400 m3 of backfill per day.
The daily requirement for Portland Cement has been estimated at around 32 tonnes. Storage for cement is sized in a manner such that there will be at
minimum  a  week’s  worth  of  cement  on  site  to  feed  the  backfill  requirements.  At  this  rate  the  weekly  storage  capacity  should  be  225  tonnes.  EBA  has
estimated that a 300 tonne silo will be required for the cement storage.  Cement will be delivered to site as required to maintain the storage inventory.
18.2  Underground Infrastructure
Additional facilities will be required to support the mining operations underground. SilverCrest has completed the main ramp from the adit at 780 elevation to
the 625 level as of the end of April 2013.  The current ramp includes muck bays, sumps and a fresh air raise to surface.  This arrangement will be continued
to the 536 level after which a return airway will be raise bored from surface to create a ventilation circuit. In addition to the ramp, cross cuts and drifts required
for the mining of the ore, further infrastructure is required as stated below.
 
 
153
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
18.2.1  Underground Maintenance Shop/Warehouse
The underground shop will be situated on the 536 level, in a more central location where equipment from all areas of the mine can easily access the shop.
The shop will include 3 bays with dimensions to allow for work on scoop trams, jumbo drills, and underground haul trucks. The bays will accommodate
scoop trams with a raised bucket. Next to the maintenance shop will be a bay equipped with shelving to store frequently used parts as well as other parts on
consignment,  consumables,  and  tires.  A  concrete  floor  will  be  placed  in  working  areas  in  the  workshop  to  enable  working  on  level  surfaces  and  for
containment of spilled contaminants.
A prefabricated refuge station will be located in an unused drift or a muck bay to serve as an emergency shelter, as required by health and safety regulations.
18.2.2  Refuge Station
18.2.3  Dewatering
All development headings will be sloped at a 2% gradient towards the ramps to allow for water to drain in a controlled direction. Sumps will be developed on
each level to collect any inflow water and from there the water will be either recycled and used as drill water, or pumped to surface. The sumps will be
installed at a vertical interval of 60 to 70 m.  A conceptual arrangement for the dewatering of the mine is shown in figure 18.2, equipment and flow rates are
expected to very considerably over the life of mine.

Underground Electrical Installations
A conceptual layout of the underground electrical installations up until the 536 level is shown in Figure 18.3.
 
The site currently has no grid power and the use of diesel power generators will continue for the Expansion of the project. The power generation capacity will
be increased to supply power for the process plant and the underground mining requirements.  The underground power consumption has been estimated at
800 kW effective power, requiring an estimated 1MW of installed power generation capacity.  The primary use of power underground will be by ventilation
fans, drills, lighting plants, sump pumps and the workshop, while the majority of power used on the overall Santa Elena site will be by the crusher and
process plant. To extend the services to underground, a 5 kV high tension power cable will be run down the ventilation raises or a dedicated borehole,
connecting to a substation on each of the active levels. The underground machinery will be run on 440 V, with step down transformers mounted on skids
delivering the power to the levels as required.  Where required, smaller transformers will step down the voltage for underground lighting, shops and lunch
rooms. All electrical installations will be done under supervision of a qualified electrician.   The electrical equipment required for underground will include:
§  Underground cable vacuum breaker
§  Main underground cable from substation to adit – 5kV
§  Cable from adit to ventilation shaft collar – 5kV
§  Ventilation fan transformers and switchgear
§  Main underground cable – 5 kV
§  Underground power centres mounted on skids including circuit protection, transformers, 5 kV feed couplings and 480/440 /120 V output couplings
§  480/440 V underground feeder cables
§  Surface cap lamp charger stations
§  Miscellaneous electrical equipment including distribution boards, lighting and low voltage cables

18.2.5 Water Services
Underground water requirements include both potable and non-potable water. Non potable water for the jumbo and long hole drills will be sourced from
sumps on each level if possible, or from surface water storage tanks. A service water pipeline will be provided down the ramp or down the ventilation shafts
as required.  Potable water will be taken down in bottles for each shift.
18.2.6  Powder Storage
The main explosives magazine will be on surface. A temporary storage area for a short term supply will be developed on some of the levels underground.
The underground explosive magazines will hold enough charge and detonators to be able to supply the underground workings for 1 week.
18.2.7  Compressed Air
A mobile compressor will be used to provide compressed air for jackleg drilling power as well as ANFO loading.  This compressor will be powered by
electricity.
18.3  Processing Plant Infrastructure
The major equipment to be installed by January 2014 for the processing plant is shown in table 18.2 (see Figure 17.1, 17.2 and 18.1 for details and layouts

18.4  Waste Rock and Tailings Storage Facilities
The waste rock storage facility at Santa Elena has been designed for a capacity of 35 million tonnes and fully covers all planned open pit and underground
waste and dry stack tailings. Of the 35 million tonne capacity, 20 million tonnes has been used for the open pit waste rock, leaving roughly 15 million tonnes
of capacity for underground waste rock and tailings.  Note that not all waste rock from underground will be deposited at the waste dump sites as roughly 14%
will be used to backfill some of the underground stopes.  Figure 18.1 above shows the waste dump location and design.  Table 18.3 below shows the
estimated volumes of waste rock and tailings which will be placed on the waste dump for the Santa Elena Expansion Project.

Tailings from the processing facility will be washed, filtered to approximately 18% moisture content, drained on an exposed portion of the existing leach pad
for at least week and conveyed for dry stacking on top of the ROM waste rock dump.   Removal and cyanide detoxification will be achieved in combination
with multiple filtering, a wash cycle and photo-degradation on the leach pad prior to be conveyed to the waste dump.  The estimated tonnage of tailings to be
delivered to the waste dump will depend on the plant processing capacity, with a planned nominal throughput of 3,000 tpd.  The tailings are estimated to
have a bulk density of 1.61 t/m3.

The infrastructure required for handling the dry stack tailings that has been included for the PFS include an overland conveyor to transport the material to the
waste rock storage dump and a loader to rehandle the material from the heap leach pad onto the over land conveyor.  Note that the existing bull dozer used
on the current heap leach facility is of sufficient size to move 3,000 tonnes of dry stack tailings per day on the waste rock dump.
 
It must be noted that additional capacity will also be available for detoxified tailings material on the current heap leach facility, later in the mine life, when a
significant portion of the material on the existing heap leach has been reprocessed.  No further waste rock storage facilities are foreseeably required.

19.1  Sales of gold and silver doré
EBA is satisfied that SilverCrest currently sells gold and silver from the open pit operations and therefore an assessment of the market for silver and gold is
not regarded as material to this PFS.
 
EBA has included costs for refining, transportation and customs expenses for selling of the mine poured doré bars within the economic analysis presented in
Section 22.
20.0  ENVIRONMANTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT
20.1  Land Use Change Permit
Nusantara is authorized by SEMARNAT (May 2, 2013) from the environmental impact assessment view to develop the Project Expansion of the Santa Elena
Mine which consists on adding 71.12 ha surrounding the already authorized surface of 99.35 ha for a total of 170.47 ha. The authorization is valid for 10
years from the next day of the day of reception of this document. It may be extended by written request within 30 days before the date of expiration.
 
The permitted new construction includes: portal and ramp, diesel gens, crusher and mill, tanks construction for leaching by CCD for underground mining,
Merrill Crowe area, stacking area for ROM material, offices, mill shop and warehouse and internal road network to communicate the area of underground
process.
20.1.1  Summary of ARD/ML Work for Santa Elena
Geochemical characterization of mine waste and geochemical modelling has been undertaken at the Santa Elena Mine and includes consideration for acid
rock drainage (ARD) and metal leaching (ML) potential. This work was undertaken by Global Resource Engineering Ltd. (GRE, Breckenridge, 2009). Testing
was completed in two phases, the first in 2006 and the second in 2009. Phase II of the program was based on preliminary findings in Phase I and includes
additional analyses and measured analytes. The results for both programs are typically reported together without distinction for phase.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Mine  waste  material  was  characterized  by  a  series  of  static  tests,  including  acid  base  accounting  (ABA),  whole  rock  metals  analysis  and  Synthetic
Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP). Testing was completed on a variety of lithological units defined as andesite. Apart from the mineralized andesite
ore, the mine waste material considered for geochemical characterization include the following:
§  Geo-thermally altered andesite near the mineralized zone - Andesite within the sulfide-rich halo.
§  Unaltered andesite distant from the mineralized zone - Andesite outside the mineralized halo
§  High calcite andesite
ABA  testing  has  been  completed  on  42  samples.  Results  indicate  that  the  andesite  units  inside  and  outside  of  the  sulfide-rich  halo  are  classified  as
potentially acid-generating (PAG) and that the andesite in the calcite-rich zones is net neutralizing. Samples from the sulfide-rich halo zone show a strong
variance in net neutralization potential, with variable levels of sulfide and calcite present.
 
Whole Rock Metals analysis was completed on 14 samples. Results indicate that there is a significant difference in calcite concentrations between the
various lithological groupings, and no significant difference in sulfide concentrations. Manganese was noted in elevated concentrations in select samples,
and has also been noted in elevated levels in groundwater samples from site.
 
SPLP testing, with variable analytes measured, has been completed on a total of 42 samples. Results indicate that only concentrations of aluminium in the
acid leachate are elevated. Key indicators of alkaline rock drainage, including arsenic, selenium and zinc were not noted at high concentrations.
 
Based on the results of the static testing, kinetic test cells were established to evaluate reaction kinetics and the potential time to onset of acidic conditions.
Six samples were composited to form two kinetic test cells.
 
Geochemical modelling was undertaken to predict ARD/ML potential for the mine waste material over an extended period of storage on surface at the mine
site. The geochemical model includes consideration for precipitation, surface water flow, reaction kinetics and geochemical reactions.
 
Kinetic test result and the experience of storing mine waste on surface at the mine site indicate that geochemical reactions at the site are slow. This is in
large part due to the water supply and flow dynamics of the site. It is not expected that the mine waste material will generate acidic leachate or leachate with
elevated metal concentrations. The current geochemical risk mitigation plan includes infiltration management to manage any leachate and runoff that may
develop. The mitigation plan includes continual testing and monitoring as well as concurrent reclamation.
20.2  Closure Planning
An  independent  Closure  and  Mine  Reclamation  Plan  was  created  for  the  Santa  Elena  project  in  March,  2010,  by  Global  Resource  Engineering  Ltd.
(Breckenridge,  2010).    This  plan  incorporated  study  results  from  baseline  environmental  impact,  water  quality  and  geotechnical  stability  studies  for  the
original open pit, processing and waste dump.  Closure plan activities included, but were not limited to closure and capping of the waste facility, closure and
capping of the spent heap leach facility, disposal and/or treatment of hazardous site chemicals and impacted soils, and re-contouring of impacted grounds.  A
closure cost of $USD 2.28M (NPV projected to 2017) was included with a 10% contingency in place.
 
161
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
EBA has included consideration for mine closure, remediation and ongoing monitoring and stewardship activities within the economic model at an estimated
value of $USD 5M.  A revision to this closure plan is recommended.
21.0  CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS
EBA  has  estimated  total  capital  costs  remaining  of  $88  million,  which  excludes  $24.2  million  spent  on  the  project  as  of  the  30  April,  2013.    The  total
remaining capital is made up of $48 million initial, required for construction of the plant, initial underground mining equipment purchases and preproduction
underground development, and a further $40 million sustaining capital, which includes ongoing development, ongoing mining equipment purchases and
ongoing infrastructure requirements.  EBA has included an estimated of contingency of $9.3 million over the life of mine the Santa Elena Expansion Project.
 
EBA has estimated total operating costs at an average of $39 per tonne of ore processed.
 
The sources of information for these costs include:
§  Overall cost and equipment and materials for the processing plant
§  Underground design work for pre-production development costs
§  Quotes from equipment suppliers
§  Equipment operating costs from equipment suppliers
§  Industry cost publications including Costmine
§  SilverCrest financial reporting
§  Santa Elena actual costs including salaries, general and administrative costs (G and A), and consumables costs per unit
 
The  capital  costs  have  been  entered  into  a  capital  cost  schedule,  which  takes  into  consideration  when  the  expense  occurs,  as  well  as  lead  times  on
equipment purchases and payment terms for equipment. As of April 30, 2013, approximately 30% of the new process facility had been constructed with a
schedule for completion by January 2014.
 
The operating costs have been entered into a cost model to determine the cost per tonne of rock material handled to the processing plant or to surface,
whether waste or mineralized material.  The operating cost is divided into cost per tonne underground mining, cost per tonne processing and cost per tonne
General and Administrative.

21.1.6  Indirect Capital Costs
EBA has considered a cost of $900,000 for indirect capital costs this includes:
1.  $200,000 for staff recruiting and expatriation costs
2.  $400,000 for underground design and engineering
21.1.7   Sunk Costs
SilverCrest has advised that the capital spent up to the April 30 2013 includes $5,3 million on the underground development, which has reached the 625
level, and $18.9 million on the processing facility as shown in table 21.6.  These sunk costs have not been included in the economic analysis.
21.2  Operating Costs
The estimation of operating costs has been undertaken by dividing the operation into four areas for costing, these are:
1.  Mining of the underground ore, estimated by EBA
2.  Mining of the reprocessing ore on the heap leach facility , estimated by SilverCrest
3.  Processing the ore estimated by John Fox of Laurion Consulting

Assumptions for Underground Mining Costs Estimation
 
The interim cost estimates for the Santa Elena underground are based on several assumptions. These assumptions include:
 
1.  Any part of the ore body that has a dip shallower than 50° cannot be mined by long hole stoping, and will be extracted using mechanized cut and fill.
2.  All underground development has been costed at $2,300 / m, as per recent quote by contractor.
3.  Diesel cost is $0.80 / litre of diesel or $3.02 / gal.
4.  Ammonium nitrate explosives is costed at $0.96 / kg of explosive, with emulsion or water gel cost at $3.42 per kg.
5.  Underground haulage of ore has been assumed to be carried out by contractor at a rate of $45/hour for a 20 tonne truck.
6.  The rock engineering work has only be completed at the level required for PFS, further rock engineering work may result in changes to the costs.

4.  Cut-off grades are presented as gold equivalent grades using a gold to silver ratio of 70:1 EBA has undertaken costing for two mining methods, namely
long hole stoping and mechanized cut and fill.  The long hole stoping costs are divided into longitudinal long hole stoping and transverse long hole
stoping (see section 16 for details of the mining methods).  The costing has further been divided by stoping width, this has been done to provide for the
fact that some costs are fixed per length of stope, whereas others are estimable per tonne regardless of the width of the stope.
Summary of mining operating costs for long hole stoping is shown in Table 21.8.

21.2.2  Costs for Loading and Transporting Existing Heap Leach Material to the Mill for Reprocessing
EBA has estimated the cost of loading and transporting the material on the existing heap leach pad to the mill for reprocessing.  This cost is based on using a
loader  (by  contractor,  including  25%  markup)  to  load  the  material  onto  grasshoppers  (portable  jump  conveyors)  which  will  deliver  the  material  to  the
reprocess stockpile.  Tables 21.10 to 21.12 show the heap leach reprocessing cost and assumptions.

21.2.3  Processing Plant Operating Costs
The proposed plant for Santa Elena has been designed to process 1million Tonnes/annum of Santa Elena ore. Power will be generated on site from diesel
fuel.  Reagent consumption is based on test work for the major consumables (Lime, Cyanide, etc.), but general experience for minor reagents (Zinc, DE
etc.).    Steel  consumption  in  comminution  is  based  on  power  consumption  and  other  relationships  established  by  FC  Bond.    Manpower  levels  and
maintenance supplies are based on experience in similar operations. The breakdown of the estimates for processing cost is shown in Table 21.13.

Based on % of Capital Cost  (revised)
The figures in Table 21.13 are averaged for the whole resource (mined ore and reclaimed heap leach).  Mined ore has to be crushed and thus this material
would cost perhaps $1.00/t above average, and the heap leach material doesn’t require crushing and would be about $1.00/t below average ($20.50 for
Underground and $18.50 for spent heap leach material)
21.3  Tailings Handling Costs
EBA has estimated the cost of handling of tailings by from end loader, overland conveyor and a bull dozer onto the waste rock dump at $1 / tonne ore
processed.
21.4  General and Administrative Operating Costs
In order to assess the general and administrative costs associated with the cost of production, EBA has reviewed the 2012 and 2013 financial statements
produced by SilverCrest.  It is the opinion of EBA that the current and historic costs are a reflection of the expected costs for the expanded operation.  EBA
has also noted that the production rates achieved during the current operations will be comparable with the initial phases of the Santa Elena underground
operation, during a time when the heap leach reprocessing is being undertaken, subsequent to that production rate overall will decrease marginally.  EBA
has determined that the current open pit scenario and operational cost framework for G and A is roughly $3,650,000 per year.  EBA expects that G and A to
remain relatively similar motivated by the following points:
 
1.  The current open pit is operated by contractor mining, and therefore much of the skilled staff required for mining are included in the G and A cost and not
the mining cost
2.  The production rate for the future underground mining, including the heap leach is similar
3.  Santa Elena currently has staff related expenses under G and A who work on the underground operation, who will continue working on the underground
operation
4.  The key changes from the current operational scenario applicable to the Expansion are the construction of a plant and the underground mine.  Both
aspects of the Expansion include costs estimates relative to current operations, therefore additional costs are included in the mining and /or processing
cost.
174
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
Therefore G and A costs for the Expansion have been estimated at $3.65 Million per year, averaging an estimated $3.60 per tonne over the life of mine.
22.0  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
22.1  Introduction
Tetra Tech prepared an economic evaluation of the Santa Elena Expansion Project based on a pre-tax financial model and post-tax financial results.  The
analysis is based on Q2 2013 US dollars.  No gearing or adjustment for inflation/currency gap is assumed. The complete economic evaluation is provided in
Appendix F. This economic analysis includes current Sandstorm agreement terms (see section 4.3).  Note that Sandstorm’s participation in the underground
production is pending. This economic analysis does not include sunk costs for all expenses applicable to the Santa Elena expansion up to the 30th of April
2013.
22.2  Technical Assumptions
Technical-Economic assumptions used in the analysis are summarized in Table 22.1.
 
Currency exchange rates are based on three-year trailing averages.
 
Refinery costs, as described in Section19.1, reflect actual contract terms and include provision for freight and marketing costs.
 
Income  tax  is  calculated  at  a  rate  of  30%  on  operating  profit  less  depreciation,  applicable  loss-carry  forwards  and  employee  profit  share
payments.  Employee profit share is included in the G&A and is structured according to current SilverCrest operations.

The economic analysis does not include 2013 open pit heap leach production, which has an estimated NPV of $20 million based on projected production
cash flows at a gold price of $1,250 and a silver price of $19.50.  The economics also excludes the fact that the heap leach reserves will be increased by the
open pit production in 2013, and this material will be available for milling.  The heap leach pad reserves will be restated in 2014, first quarter to include the
material placed on the pad for 2013.
 
The post tax financial model was established on a 100% equity basis, excluding debt financing and loan interest charges.  The post tax financial results of
the base case are compared to roughly the spot price in the first week of July 2013 in Table 22.3 below.

22.5  Post - tax Results and Sensitivity Analysis
The post tax model has been developed for the PFS by Tetra Tech.  The following assumptions have been used in development of the after tax model:
1.  A tax rate of 30%.
2.  Any employee profit share is included in the G & A and is structured according to current SilverCrest operations.
3.  Depreciation has been deducted from taxable earning as straight-line depreciation over 10 years.
4.  No losses have been carried forward.
5.  Other deductions applicable to pre-tax financial results are applicable to post tax financial results.
The base case as shown Table 22.3 above is used as the base case for the sensitivity analysis.  The sensitivities are determined by initially determining
which key variable the project is most sensitive to and then selecting those for further analysis.  In the case of the Santa Elena Expansion Project, these are
in order of most sensitive to least sensitive; gold and silver price, operating and capital cost.  The key variables are adjusted from -30% to +30%.  The results
for NPV and are IRR shown in Figures 22.2 and 22.3. Tables 22.4 shows the cash flow analysis used to derive the post-tax sensitivities.

To evaluate the financial performance of the Project, the production schedule was incorporated into the 100% equity pre-tax financial model to develop
annual recovered metal production from the relationships of tonnage processed, head grades, and recoveries.
 
All costs and revenues were assumed to occur at the end of each year in which they were scheduled to occur.
 
Gold and silver payable values were calculated based on base case metal price and exchange rate.  Unit operating costs for mining, processing and G&A
were applied to monthly mined or processed  tonnages, to determine the overall operating cost, which was deducted from the revenues to derive monthly
operating cash flow.  Monthly operating cash flows were totaled into annual cash flows, and the financial analysis was run on annual cash flows.
 
Initial and sustaining capital costs were incorporated on a year-by-year basis over the LOM.  Reclamation bond, working capital and capital equipment
salvation value have been included in the cash flow. Capital expenditures were then deducted from the operating cash flow to determine the net cash flow
before taxes.
 
Initial capital expenditures presented in this study include costs accumulated prior to first production of doré for the new process facility but excludes cost for
exploration, open pit, and heap leach. Sustaining capital includes expenditures for mining and processing additions, equipment replacement, and process
plant expansion.
 
The undiscounted annual net cash flow (NCF) and cumulative net cash flow (CNCF) are shown in Figure 22.1

It should be noted that the sensitivity of the Santa Elena Expansion Project to gold and silver price volatility is nearly equal. It can be seen that the NPV and
IRR return similar results when either one of the commodity prices is changed.
22.6  Purchase Agreement
On May 14, 2009, SilverCrest entered into a definitive Purchase Agreement with Sandstorm Gold Ltd. under which Nusantara agreed to sell 20% of future
gold production from the Santa Elena open pit to Sandstorm, up to 50,000 ounces of gold, in exchange for an Upfront Deposit of $USD 12,000,000. The
agreement also provides for ongoing per-ounce payments by Sandstorm equal to the lesser of $350 and the prevailing spot gold market price upon delivery
of gold. The per ounce price of $USD 350 is subject to an increase of 1% per annum commencing on the 3rd anniversary of the date that Santa Elena Project
began commercial production (i.e. July 2014).
22.7  Smelter Terms
Santa Elena is an operating mine and currently sells gold and silver as part of ongoing operations.  Based on information provided by SilverCrest, EBA has
added a cost to account for smelter and refinery costs.
23.0  ADJACENT PROPERTIES
There are no issues related to adjacent properties.
24.0  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
The following information has been considered useful to understand the Santa Elena expansion Project.
24.1  Project Execution Plan – Progress Completed
It should be noted that progress towards executing the Santa Elena Expansion Project has already been achieved.  In particular the main ramp, from the 780
level adit, has been advanced to the 625 level (at an elevation of 625 m a.s.l.).  At this elevation a crosscut has been developed into the ore body.  At this
elevation inflows of ground water at over 200 gallon per minute, were experienced.  This water will be managed by SilverCrest and may be available to the
mine for the process plant.
Progress has also been made in purchasing equipment for the construction of the process plant.  Table 24.1 shows the progress on equipment purchases
and construction of the process plant.

24.2  Schedule to the Start of Underground Stoping
Based on the progress to date, there is no concern for slippage in the schedule for the Santa Elena Expansion Project. Also, the availability of spent ore can
mitigate this risk. In addition, schedule slippage of 2 to 3 months will not cause a significant loss to the project as in that case the mined ore would be heap
leached until completion of the process mill.  Though recoveries would be lower in the heap leach than in the mill, the heap leached ore is planned to be
reprocessed and thereby resulting in similar overall recoveries. The critical date for the underground mining to commence is after exhaustion of the open pit
reserves.  Figure 24.1 shows the schedule for the project as a Gantt chart with the milestone of commencement with stoping as the objective.
 
Figure 24.1 shows Project schedule up to commencement with stoping (two stopes available)

25.0  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION
25.1  Geology and Underground Resource Estimate
The Santa Elena vein is a low sulphidation quartz-calcite epithermal vein striking in  E-NE and dipping between 45-75° to the south. The principal trend of
mineralization has a rake of approximately 25° to the southeast and has been delineated to a depth of approximately 475 metres below surface.  Gold and
silver grades are constrained within the main quartz vein with some additional mineralization noted in stringers and quartz breccia along the hanging wall
and footwall contacts of the vein.  The metal grades are zoned with silver proportions increasing with depth.
 
The deposit is strongly oxidized at surface and down to depths of at least 150 metres below surface. However, weak to moderate alteration associated with
disseminated  fine  grained  pyrite  is  noted  where  northwest  trending  structures  crosscut  the  main  vein.    The  oxide  zone  transitions  at  depth  to  sulphide
bearing, noted by trace amounts of visible argentite noted in the drill core.
25.2  Underground Reserves and Mining Methods
Underground probable reserves of 3.9 million tonnes at an average grade of 3 g/t Au equivalent have potential for economic extraction at current metal
prices.  A combination of longitudinal and transverse long hole stoping and mechanised cut and fill methods will be suitable for underground mining.
25.3  Costs and Project Economics
EBA  has  estimated  that  approximately  $48  million  in  capital  investment  is  required  to  commence  with  production  as  part  of  the  expansion  plan  with
approximately another $40 million required over the life of mine, this including a contingency of $ 9.3 million over the life of mine.  Operating costs are
estimated to be approximately $569 per ounce of gold equivalent and $11 per ounce silver equivalent.  At the base case metal prices the estimated post tax
net present value estimate of the operation is roughly $ 145 million at a discount rate of 5%. At the current metal prices the estimated post tax net present
value estimate of the operation is roughly $ 65 million at a discount rate of 5%.
26.0  RECOMMENDATIONS
26.1  Geology and Underground Resource Estimate
26.1.1  Risks and Opportunities
Mineralization  within  the  southeasterly  plunging  trend  has  been  well  delineated  by  the  recent  2012-2013  drilling  campaign;  however,  more  drilling  is
required in preparation for underground mining.  Additional drilling on the property should aim to test and confirm the following items:
 
185
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
§  Delineation drilling along the eastern strike extent of the main vein between the 600 and the 400 metre level elevation to delineate trends with elevated
grades and increase resource classification for blocks in this area,
§  Infill drilling on 12 metre centres within the current Indicated resource to upgrade block model confidence for underground mining,
 
§  accurately delineate the distribution of sulphide bearing mineralization and the transition from near surface oxide to un-oxidized material at depth as this
change in mineralogy may have a significant impact of metal recoveries,
§  Dedicated drilling within the Cholugo and Cholugo Dos veins to upgrade current resource and as exploration to depth,
§  Map and delineate the mineralized NW trending structure which cross-cut the main Santa Elena vein as these may support additional resources,
 
§  Extensively map the Tinaja fault in drilling and from underground development to characterize the vein width and to project the fault into the proposed
mine development for planning purposes, and
§  Conduct detailed drill core and underground mapping to assist in determining control and orientation of high grade mineralization trends and ore shoots.
26.2  Geotechnical Recommendation
Geotechnical recommendations are split into two sections for this Pre-Feasibility report:
§  Key recommendations to improve stope size and refine pillar dimensions.
§  Geotechnical considerations in overall mine design.
26.2.1  Stope Size and Pillar Dimensioning
26.2.1.1  Hanging wall  and orebody NGI-Q values
§  Due  to  the  apparent  degradation  of  rock  mass  quality  with  depth  in  the  2012  drilling  program  it  is  recommended  that  further  drilling  be  conducted
underground. This degradation could be due to limited availability of geotechnical data at present as footwall rock quality appears fairly consistent at
depth. This apparent degradation could create overly conservative stope design parameters and it is recommended that rockmass quality at depth requires
further clarification through a drilling program.
26.2.1.2  Joint set orientation
Joint set orientation can play a key role in stope stability. The orientation data at Santa Elena is limited with six orientated holes gleaning a limited number of
measurements to gain joint set data for stope layout.
 
§  Further joint set measurements can be taken through consistent geotechnical mapping of the ore zone and hanging wall during mining activities.
 
§  Further orientated boreholes can be undertaken during subsurface and surface exploration. During the 2012 surface drilling program a limited number of
joint orientation data was able to be retrieved. It is strongly recommended that the use of a Televiewer be incorporated into further data collection.  This
allows for in-situ joint orientation data to be collected that will aid in stope definition.
186
NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
26.2.1.3  In-situ stress regime
The in-situ stress regime at Santa Elena needs clarification as the stress regime has been assumed at pre-feasibility level.
 
§  It is strongly advised that in-situ stress analysis be conducted at Santa Elena in order to determine principal stress magnitude and trajectory and horizontal
to vertical stress ratio. This should be done in order to maximize ore extraction, minimize pillar dimensions, assist in pillar recovery design and minimize
support cost to local rather than regional zones based on the in-situ stress regime. EBA can assist in developing a cost effective stress measurement
program in conjunction with Silver Crest for this purpose.
26.2.1.4  Hanging wall  and ore body strength and deformation characteristics
Clarification of hanging wall and ore body strength characteristics is recommended beyond pre-feasibility level as there is concern that the UCS strength
results that have been returned so far are relatively low for the general rock types encountered.
 
§  In addition to simple UCS strengths for the footwall, hanging wall  and orebody the Hoek-Brown parameters and deformation characteristics need to be
determined for the rock conditions found at Santa Elena in order to refine stope and pillar design to a higher degree of accuracy beyond pre-feasibility
level.
§  It is strongly recommended that tri-axial testing be carried out on hanging wall, footwall and ore samples together with further UCS testing with strain
measurements  in  order  to  determine  site  specific  strength  and  deformation  characteristics  of  the  rock  types  at  Santa  Elena  for  inclusion  into  future
geotechnical modelling of the mine and for stope and pillar refinement. It is recommended that 80% of future testing be carried out at Sonora University,
Mexico and 20% at UBC, Vancouver as a reference check.
26.2.2  Geotechnical Considerations in Overall Mine Design
§  As the orebody varies in dip and dip direction and thickness, both along strike and down dip, it is strongly advised that three dimensional geotechnical
analysis be conducted on the orebody once the stress regime and rock deformation characteristics have been determined. This can be advantageous to
mine sequencing, backfill addition and pillar recovery in order to further maximise ore extraction.
§  It is recommended to space rib pillars across levels so as to avoid stacking of pillars. This will minimize the creation and effect of tall slender pillars on the
overall mine wide excavation.
§  This PFS does not consider the interaction between the pit and the proposed underground stopes. This should be reviewed once stoping outlines have
been defined for feasibility or design stages.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT
 EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 30, 2013 | RELEASED DATE: JULY 25, 2013
26.3  Recommendations on Mining Methods and Mining Costs
EBA recommend that SilverCrest further investigate the purchase of commercial underground mining trucks as opposed to use of an underground haulage
contractor.  EBA suggests that the reliability and productivity of commercial underground mining trucks, may improve the efficiency of haulage of ore and
waste rock to surface.
 
EBA recommend that SilverCrest investigate hydraulic and/or paste fill as a means of disposing of mill tailings, and the use of boreholes drilled from surface
to deliver the tailings underground, as opposed to backhaul by trucks.
26.4  Environmental, Closure and Asset Retirement
A  previous  independent  closure  and  reclamation  plan  was  created  in  2010  for  the  original  open  pit  mining  and  heap  leaching  operations.    Numerous
elements of the project and impacts to the property have been modified from the original project scope for the current Expansion Project.  It is recommended
that SilverCrest update the estimated funding, or bond, requirements that will be necessary for site closure and long term monitoring activities.

METHOD OF PREPARATION:
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen. The +270 material was discarded. The -270 material was
mixed for 5 days in a double-cone mixer. Splits were taken and sent to 15 laboratories for round robin assaying.
 
ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL:
 
Standard CDN-CM-17 was prepared using 770 kg of a granitic rock blended with 29 kg of a Cu-Au-Mo concentrate and 5 kg of a high grade Ag ore.
 
Approximate chemical composition (from whole rock analysis) is as follows:

Statistical Procedures:
 
The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally expected for similar analytical methods done by
reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was removed from further calculations when the mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test
of the global means of the other laboratories. The means and standard deviations were calculated using all remaining data. Any analysis that fell outside of
the mean ±2 standard deviations was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean and standard deviations were again calculated using the remaining
data. This method is different from that used by Government agencies in that the actual “between-laboratory” standard deviation is used in the calculations.
This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. The limits can therefore be used to monitor
accuracy from individual analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits published on other standards.

METHOD OF PREPARATION:
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen. The +270 material was discarded. The -270 material was
mixed for 5 days in a double-cone mixer. Splits were taken and sent to twelve laboratories for round robin assaying.
 
ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL:
This standard is made primarily from ore supplied by US Silver from the Coeur d’Alene mining district in northern Idaho. The mineralization occurs as veins
hosted by weakly metamorphosed, siliceous sediments. Ag-Cu ore occurs as tetrahedrite, and variable amounts of pyrite and chalcopyrite. Minor Pb is
associated with Ag-Cu veins. Other portions of the mineralized areas include Pb-Ag veins primarily consisting of galena and quartz. The standard was made
by mixing 200 kg of US Silver ore with 40 kg of a high grade Au ore, 22 kg of a Cu, Zn concentrate and 535 kg of a blank granitic material.

Statistical Procedures:
The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally expected for similar analytical methods done by
reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was removed from further calculations when the mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test
of the global means of the other laboratories. The means and standard deviations were calculated using all remaining data. Any analysis that fell outside of
the mean ±2 standard deviations was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean and standard deviations were again calculated using the remaining
data. This method is different from that used by Government agencies in that the actual “between-laboratory” standard deviation is used in the calculations.
This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. The limits can therefore be used to monitor
accuracy from individual analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits published on other standards.
 
Assay Procedures:
Au: Fire assay pre-concentration, AA or ICP finish (30g sub-sample).
Ag: Fire assay pre-concentration, gravimetric finish (30g sub-sample). 
Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn: 4-acid digestion, AA or ICP finish.

METHOD OF PREPARATION:
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen. The +270 material was discarded. The -270 material was
mixed for 5 days in a double-cone mixer. Splits were taken and sent to 14 laboratories for round robin assaying.

Statistical Procedures:
 
The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally expected for similar analytical methods done by
reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was removed from further calculations when the mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test
of the global means of the other laboratories. The means and standard deviations were calculated using all remaining data. Any analysis that fell outside of
the mean ±2 standard deviations was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean and standard deviations were again calculated using the remaining
data. This method is different from that used by Government agencies in that the actual “between-laboratory” standard deviation is used in the calculations.
This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. The limits can therefore be used to monitor
accuracy from individual analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits published on other standards.
 
Assay Procedures:
 
Au: Fire assay pre-concentration, AA or ICP finish (30g sub-sample). 
Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn: 4-acid digestion, AA or ICP finish.

METHOD OF PREPARATION:
Reject ore material was dried, crushed, pulverized and then passed through a 270 mesh screen. The +270 material was discarded. The -270 material was
mixed for 5 days in a double-cone mixer. Splits were taken and sent to 15 laboratories for round robin assaying.
ORIGIN OF REFERENCE MATERIAL:
The ore was supplied by Capstone Mining Corp. from the Minto Mine in Yukon, Canada. Mineralization is primary chalcopyrite and bornite pervasively
disseminated and as stringers within foliated granodiorite units rich in secondary biotite. Sulphide mineralization is typically accompanied by magnetite. Gold
is associated with the sulphide mineralization, typically intimately associated with bornite and rarely observed as free gold. 733 kg of the Minto ore was
combined with 67 kg of a Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn concentrate.

Statistical Procedures:
 
The final limits were calculated after first determining if all data was compatible within a spread normally expected for similar analytical methods done by
reputable laboratories. Data from any one laboratory was removed from further calculations when the mean of all analyses from that laboratory failed a t test
of the global means of the other laboratories. The means and standard deviations were calculated using all remaining data. Any analysis that fell outside of
the mean ±2 standard deviations was removed from the ensuing data base. The mean and standard deviations were again calculated using the remaining
data. This method is different from that used by Government agencies in that the actual “between-laboratory” standard deviation is used in the calculations.
This produces upper and lower limits that reflect actual individual analyses rather than a grouped set of analyses. The limits can therefore be used to monitor
accuracy from individual analyses, unlike the Confidence Limits published on other standards.
 
Assay Procedures:
Au: Fire assay pre-concentration, AA or ICP finish (30g sub-sample). 
Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn: 4-acid digestion, AA or ICP finish.

This reference material is designed to be included with every batch of samples analysed and the results plotted for quality
monitoring and assessment purposes.
The container (jar or sachet) and its contents should not be heated to temperatures higher than 50 °C. The reference material
is stable, with weight changes of less than 0.5 % at extremes of naturally occurring temperature and humidity conditions.
Pulverized basalt rock and feldspar minerals were blended with finely pulverized and screened, gold-containing minerals.
Once the powders were uniformly mixed the composite was placed into 3267 wide-mouthed jars, each bearing a unique
number. 60 jars were randomly selected from the packaging run and material from these jars was used for both homogeneity
and consensus testing.
Certificate of Analysis, ROCKLABS Reference Material OxD87, 29 November, 2010. Page 2 of 6.
Homogeneity Assessment:
An independent laboratory carried out gold analysis by fire assay of 30 g portions, using an AAS finish. Steps were taken to minimize laboratory method
variation in order to better detect any variation in the candidate reference material.
 
The contents of six randomly selected jars were compacted by vibration (to simulate the effect of freighting) and five samples removed successively from top
to bottom from each jar. In addition, five samples were removed from the last jar in the series. A sample was also removed from the top of each of the 60 jars
randomly selected from the 3267 jars in the batch. The results of analysis of the 95 samples (randomly ordered and then consecutively numbered before
being sent to the laboratory) produced a relative standard deviation of 1.2 %.
 
Analytical Methodology:
Once homogeneity had been established, two sub-samples were submitted to a number of well-recognized laboratories in order to assign a gold value by
consensus testing. The sub-samples were drawn from the 60 randomly selected jars and each laboratory received samples from two different jars. Indicative
concentration ranges were given. All laboratories used fire assay for the gold analysis, with most using an instrument finish and four using a gravimetric
finish.
 
Calculation of Certified Value:
Results for gold were returned from 47 laboratories. Statistical analysis to identify outliers was carried out using the principles detailed in sections 7.3.2 -
7.3.4, ISO 5725-2: 1994. Assessment of each laboratory’s performance was carried out on the basis of z-scores, partly based on the concept described in
ISO/IEC Guide 43-1. Details of the criteria used in these examinations are available on request. As a result of these statistical analyses, eight sets of results
were excluded for the purpose of assigning a gold concentration value to this reference material. A recommended value was thus calculated from the
average of the remaining n = 39 sets of replicate results. The 95 % confidence interval was estimated using the formula:-
(where X is the estimated average, s is the estimated standard deviation of the laboratory averages, and t is the 0.025 tail-value from Student’s t-distribution with n- 1 degrees of freedom). The recommended value is provided at the beginning of the certificate in ^g/g (ppm) units. A summary of the results used to calculate the recommended value is listed on page 4 and the names of the laboratories that submitted results are listed on page 5. The results are listed in increasing order of the individual laboratory averages.
Statistical analysis of the consensus test results has been carried out by independent statistician, Tim Ball.

Instructions and Recommendations for Use:
Weigh out quantity usually used for analysis and analyze for total gold by normal procedure. Homogeneity testing has shown that consistent results are
obtainable for gold when 30g portions are taken for analysis.
 
We quote a 95% confidence interval for our estimate of the declared value. This confidence interval reflects our uncertainty in estimating the true value for the
gold content of the reference material. The interval is chosen such that, if the same procedure as used here to estimate the declared value were used again
and again, then 95% of the trials would give intervals that contained the true value. It is a reflection of how precise the trial has been in estimating the
declared value. It does not reflect the variability any particular laboratory will experience in its own repetitive testing.
 
Some users in the past have misinterpreted this confidence interval as a guide as to how different an individual test result should be from the declared value.
Some mistakenly use this interval, or the standard deviation from the consensus test, to set limits for control charts on their own routine test results using the
reference material. Such use inevitably leads to many apparent out-of-control points, leading to doubts about the laboratory’s testing, or of the reference
material itself.
A much better way of determining the laboratory performance when analysing the reference material is to accumulate a history of the test results obtained,
and plot them on a control chart. The appropriate centre line and control limits for this chart should be based on the average level and variability exhibited in
the laboratory’s own data. This chart will provide a clear picture of the long-term stability or otherwise of the laboratory testing process, providing good clues
as to the causes of any problems. To help our customers do this more simply for themselves, we can provide a free Excel template that will produce sensible
graphs, with intelligently chosen limits, from the customer’s own data.

1    SUMMARY
 
Inspectorate Exploration & Mining Services Ltd. - Metallurgical Division has carried out a scoping metallurgical testing program on samples originating from
SilverCrest’s Santa Elena and Cruz de Mayo properties in Mexico to evaluate the samples’ leaching characteristics.
 
As was originally requested, the study covers the following major topics: ore sample characterization, bottle roll cyanidation as well as preliminary tailings
evaluation.
 
Four samples including two from Santa Elena deposit, one from Cruze de Mayo deposit and one high manganese sample (Hi-Mn) were tested. The two
samples from the Santa Elena deposit assayed 1.46- and 3.31 g/t Au, and 38.5- and 119.1 g/t Ag, respectively. Sulfur content in the Santa Elena ore was
<0.03%. The sample from the Cruze de Mayo deposit assayed 0.5g/t Au and 148.5g/t Ag, while the Hi-Mn sample assayed 5.04g/t Au and 89.5g/t Ag. All four
samples tested contained significant amount of Mn, ranging from 559ppm to 4.4%. Arsenic was in a range of 13- to 55 ppm.
 
Comminution studies showed that the Santa Elena ore is of moderate hardness with 14.0 kWh/t Bond rod-mill work index and 14.8 kWh/t Bond ball-mill work
index. The Cruze de Mayo composite sample showed a harder character of a 19.3 kWh/t Bond ball mill work index. Ore microscopy studies indicated that the
Cruze de Mayo sample contains trace of gold in native form of less than 5 mm. Argentite and pyrargyrite-proustite are the main silver carriers embedded in
silica gangue, which also carries isolated inclusions or flakes of native silver and/or electrum. The Hi-Mn sample consists basically of pyrolusite. Silver as
electrum occurs as <20 mm inclusions together with native gold in association with limonite.
 
Baseline leaching of the Santa Elena ore for 72-hours in 0.5- to 1.5 g/L NaCN recovered 95.6% Au and 56.6% Ag on average at a grind size of less than 120
mm. Finer grinding to ~74 mm improved the baseline Au recovery to 97.4%, but Ag remained refractory throughout with residue grade averaging ~52 g/t Ag.
Increasing the cyanide concentration in the range of 0.5- to 1.5 g/L cyanide was of no significant benefit to gold extraction, but was to silver.

Cyanidation of Santa Elena ore in 1.0g/L NaCN with single solution replacement at the target grind of 100 mm improved silver extraction from the baseline
56.6% to ~70%. Solution replacement also benefited both gold and silver leach kinetics. By replacing leach liquor, residence time could be shortened to 30
hours for gold. Increasing the number of solution exchanges and cyanide dosages as well as the addition of oxidants resulted in negligible gains in gold and
silver extraction.
 
Leaching of the Cruz de Mayo sample at 40% solids in 3g/L NaCN with single solution replacement extracted 51% Au and 54% Ag. A reasonable Au
extraction of 92% was achieved on the Hi-Mn sample following identical leach conditions, but silver extraction remained at a low 60%.
 
Settling test on Santa Elena leach tailing with 40 g/t of Percol Magnafloc 368 yielded a 24-hour raked underflow density of 79.2% solids and a unit thickener
area of 0.07 m2/h/tpd of dry solids. Vacuum filtration with Polypropylene type Filter cloth PO-808HF at 70% solids had capacities of 32.6 kg/m2/h solids and
64 L/m2/h of filtrate at standard conditions.
 
Scoping detoxification studies using the INCO SO2/air procedure suggested that less than 1mg/L of CN in the effluent is achievable

2   INTRODUCTION
 
Inspectorate  -  Metallurgical  Division  was  retained  by  Mr.  John  Fox,  P.Eng.,  from  Laurion  Consulting  Inc.  on  behalf  of  SilverCrest  Mines  Inc.  to  perform
metallurgical  testing  on  gold  and  silver  bearing  samples  collected  from  SilverCrest's  Santa  Elena  Mine  located  150km  northeast  of  Hermosillo,  near
Banamichi  in  the  State  of  Sonora,  Mexico.  The  optimum  process  conditions  developed  from  the  Santa  Elena  ore  was  further  confirmed  on  samples
representing the Cruze de Mayo deposit and a high manganese sample (Hi-Mn).
 
The stated objectives of this metallurgical study program are to conduct baseline investigations to determine leaching characteristics of the samples, and to
provide adequate data to optimize gold & silver recoveries.
 
The test work consisted of head characterization, bottle roll cyanide leaching and preliminary tailings evaluation. Head characterization including assaying
and hardness testing were conducted on feed samples from Santa Elena and Cruz de Mayo deposits. Optical mineralogy examination was carried out on
Cruz de Mayo feed and Santa Elena leach residue. Metallurgical testing consisting of cyanide leaching and detoxification of cyanide leach tailings as well as
detoxified  tailings  characterization  was  mainly  conducted  on  the  Santa  Elena  samples.  Confirmatory  bottle  roll  cyanide  leach  following  preferred  leach
conditions was conducted on a composite sample from Cruz de Mayo deposit and a Hi-Mn sample.
 
This report summarizes the laboratory test procedures and results of the scoping study.

Based on a detailed proposal, specific formats in the overall approach and methods to be used were agreed upon between Inspectorate and the client’s
representative (Mr. John Fox from Laurion Consulting).
 
3.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION
 
Two shipments were received at Inspectorate on July 26th of 2011 and June 6th of 2012 respectively. Sample identification and compositing information are
presented in Table 1. Detailed Sample Receiving Logs are provided in Appendix 1.

Each composite sample was prepared and assayed individually. For Comp. CM and Comp. 4±0 Nivel, the samples were first crushed to 1.5 inches. After
removal of sub-samples for comminution testing, the remain samples were further crushed to 6-Tyler mesh and then blended three times prior to rotary split
into 2 kg test charges for the metallurgical test program. Head aliquots were also split off from each composite for head characterization.
 
3.2 ASSAY PROCEDURE
 
The Au and Ag analyses were done by standard fire assay procedures. A weighed sample was mixed with litharge and the required soda ash and borax
fluxes to produce a fluid slag at 1000oC. After cooling, the lead button was separated from the slag and re-melted in a cupel, which absorbed the oxidized
base metals. The remaining precious metals bead was weighed, dissolved in acid and analyzed by Atomic Absorption (AA) Spectrophotometry. A multi‐
element ICP scan using standard multi-acid digestion procedure was also employed. Carbon and sulfur speciation used microbalance measurements and
gas detections in a Leco furnace, while As was determined by standard wet assays.
 
3.3 GRINDING AND SCREENING
 
Wet grinding was performed in a dedicated stainless steel laboratory rod mill on 2 kg charges of composite sample, at a 65% solids pulp density. Test grinds
determined the time required to achieve reliable target grind size distributions.
Particle size analysis was performed using a Rotap™, equipped with 20 cm (8”) diameter test sieves, and stacked in ascending mesh sizes. The sample was
initially wet screened at 37 mm (400 Tyler™ mesh). The +37 mm fraction was then dry screened through stacked sieves. Each sieved fraction was collected
and weighed for calculating the individual and cumulative percentage retained.

3.4 CYANIDATION
 
The bottle roll cyanide leaching tests were carried out at a pulp density of 40 wt.% solids. Prior to adding sodium cyanide (NaCN), the alkalinity was adjusted
with hydrated lime to pH 10 and further maintained at this level. NaCN levels were established and maintained at specific targets and the dissolved oxygen
concentration was monitored for the duration of the test.
 
Six baseline leach tests (C1-C6) were carried out on the NIVEA 4 Comp. in 0.5-, 1.0- and 1.5 g/L NaCN at target grinds of 120 mm and 74 mm, respectively,
to evaluate the effect of cyanide concentration and grind size on metals’ recoveries. Intermediate solution samples were removed and analyzed to determine
gold and silver dissolutions at 2, 4, 7, 24, 30, 48 and 54 hours of retention time. These tests were terminated after 72 hours with filtration of pregnant leachate
solution (PLS). The solid residues were displacement-washed with cyanide solution, followed by two water rinses. The PLS and the final residue were
analyzed for gold and silver content for metallurgical balance.
 
Leach optimization tests (C7-C12) were performed on NIVEA 4 Comp. at a target P80 of 100 mm grind with solution replacement at various retention times.
Three cyanide concentrations of 1.0-, 1.5- and 2 g/L cyanide were tested. The addition of lead nitrite and hydrogen peroxide was also tested to assist metals’
dissolution.
 
Confirmatory leach tests (C13-C17) were conducted on the CM Comp., the Hi- Mn Comp. as well as the new Santa Elena feed sample - Comp.4 ± 0 Nivel to
evaluate the samples’ response to preferred leach conditions.
 
At the end of the test program, two bulk leach tests (C18, C19) were performed to generate tailings for thickening studies at Pocock Industrial.
 
Reagent concentrations were determined using standard titration methods. The sodium cyanide concentration was determined by titrating with silver nitrate
and using para-dimethylamino rhodanine as an indicator.

A detailed test report including a metallurgical balance and the test procedure was prepared for each test, as provided in Appendix III.
 
3.5 BOND BALL MILL WORK INDEX DETERMINATION
 
The Bond ball-mill work index was measured in a Bico-Braun® laboratory mill, with a standard ball charge medium. The feed size was 100% passing 6-
Tyler  mesh,  and  the  specified  closing  screen  of  150-Tyler  mesh  for  the  product.  The  bulk  density  was  determined  and  the  feed  size  distribution  was
measured to yield undersize, at a specified number of mill revolutions. The product was discharged to sift out the media and perform a screen analysis. The
oversize was retained for the next cycle, replacing the weight of the undersize with an equivalent weight of the original feed. The undersize weight minus the
feed undersize amount yielded the net product weight. The procedures were repeated for each cycle until a constant circulating load was achieved after 6-7
cycles. This allowed the calculation of a stable amount of net product per revolution, and the calculation of the ball mill work index from the empirical Bond
formula.
 
Other comminution testing was performed at Hazen Research.

4.1.3 Mineralogical Examination
 
Ore  microscopic  investigations  were  carried  out  on  representative  6-Tyler  mesh  crushed  CM  composite  and  the  Hi-Mn  composite  for  gold  and  silver
mineralogy. The mineralogy study was performed by Dr. Lehne at Lehne & Associates Applied Mineralogy in Germany.
 
The mineralogy examination revealed that the CM composite consists of silica gangue that possesses a pronounced iron staining due to finely disseminated
limonite. Silver carriers are argentite and pyrargyrite-proustite embedded in silica gangue. The gangue also carries isolated inclusions or flakes of native
silver and/or electrum. Trace of gold occurs in native form in less than 5-micron size.
 
The Hi-Mn composite is characterized by a distinct manganese mineralization consisting essentially of pyrolusite. Specific silver minerals have not been
observed. Silver is contained in electrum which occurs as <20 micron inclusions together with native gold in association with limonite. The small particle
sizes of the noble metal phases imply rather resistant locking textures. Detailed findings are provided in Appendix IV.

4.2 CYANIDATION OF SAMPLES FROM SANTA ELENA DEPOSIT
 
Bottle roll cyanide leaching was mainly performed on Santa Elena NIVEL 4 whole ore at various grind sizes and different cyanide dosages to assess gold
and silver recovery potentials. A series of test grinds were conducted to establish reliable laboratory grind time requirements prior to metallurgical testing.
 
4.2.1 Baseline Bottle Roll Tests on Ground Whole Ore
 
Baseline bottle roll tests (C1 to C6) were conducted on ground whole ore to assess the grind- and cyanide-sensitivity of gold and silver recoveries as well as
kinetics and reagent requirements. The leach tests were carried out for 72 hours at 40% solids at target P80 grinds of 120 mm and 74 mm. Three cyanide
dosages  of  0.5-,  1.0-  and  1.5  g/L  cyanide  were  tested  at  each  grind,  and  pH  >10.0  was  maintained  with  hydrated  lime.  The  baseline  test  results  are
summarized in Table 4, whilst Au and Ag leach profiles are plotted in Figures 1 and 2.

In general, residue gold and silver grades decreased with finer grinding and higher cyanide concentration. In the range of 0.5-1.5 g/L cyanide, higher cyanide
strength benefited silver extraction, but not gold.
 
Cyanide consumption was in the neighborhood of 1.3 kg/t at a level of 1 g/L NaCN. In general, less than 0.1 kg/t lime were required to maintain slurry pH
>10. Increasing the cyanide strength from 0.5 g/L to 1.5 g/L doubled the NaCN consumption.
 
Leach kinetics showed that both gold and silver dissolution was fast in the first 8 hours of retention and subsequently slowed down. Finer grind and higher
cyanidation strength resulted in faster metal dissolution and better extraction. Gold and silver extractions might improve by extending the residence time to
over 72 hours without replacing leach liquor.

4.2.2 Leach Optimization
 
The optimization tests (C7 to C12) were conducted on the NIVEL 4 Comp. at a moderate grind of 100 mm at various cyanide dosages with leach solution
replacement at various leach intervals. Test conditions and leach results are summarized in Table 5, while leach profiles are plotted in Figures 3 and 4.
 
In comparison to the baseline test results, leaching with solution replacement resulted in better silver extraction, and faster gold and silver leach kinetics. By
replacing the leach solution, up to 70% silver recovery is achievable, and residence time can be shortened to 30 hours for gold. Double the number of
solution  exchanges  and  NaCN  dosages  as  well  as  the  addition  of  oxidants  resulted  in  negligible  gains  in  gold  and  silver  extractions.  In  general,
approximately 96% Au and 70% Ag extraction can be achieved at 40% solids in 1.0g/L NaCN solution with single solution replacement at the target grind of
100 µm.

4.2.3 Confirmatory Leach on New Santa Elena Feed
 
Confirmatory leach tests (C15 to C17) were carried out on another Santa Elena NIVEL composite (Comp. 4 ± 0 Nivel) with mine water (also referred as site
water in the test spreadsheets) provided by the client. Leach pulp density increased from 40 wt.% for the baseline tests to 45%. During the leach tests, the
pregnant leach solution was replaced with fresh mine water after 10 hours leach. Leach conditions and results are summarized in Table 6.
 
Results showed that over 97% gold extraction is achievable by leaching the Comp. 4 ± 0 Nivel in 1.0g/L cyanide at 45% solids by replacing partial or full
leach liquor. Increasing cyanide dosage to 1.5g/L did not result in significant improvement of gold recovery. Silver extraction was ~43% in all three cases.

4.2.4 Leach Tailing Production
 
All remaining Santa Elena feed samples, including 20kg of Comp. Nivel 4 and 5.5kg of Comp. 4 ± 0 Nivel, were leached to produce sufficient tailing samples
for thickening studies at Pocock Industrial. The two feed samples were processed separately due to their difference in color. The leach tests (C18-C19) were
carried out at 48% solids with synthetic mine water in 1.5g/L NaCN at a target P80 grind of 100 mm. The leach results are summarized in Table 7.

4.2.5 Mineralogical Investigation of Leach Residue
 
The Santa Elena leach residue (from test C10) was investigated by ore microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with X-Ray
Diffraction (XRD) Analysis to determine silver deportment and the nature of silver causing the lower silver extraction in cyanidation.
 
Once again, the mineralogical investigation was performed by Dr. Lehne at Lehne & Associates Applied Mineralogy in Germany. According to Dr. Lehne, the
Santa  Elena  leach  residue  consisted  mainly  of  silica  and  carbonate  gangue  (quartz  and  calcite).  Specific  silver  minerals  have  not  been  detected.
Microanalysis proved a faint and erratic distribution of silver that could not be attributed to specific silver minerals or other silver carriers. "It is assumed that
the silver retained in the sample originates from reprecipitation of silver during the leaching process”. (Dr. Lehne, Nov.22, 2011). Reprecipitation can be one
of the main reasons for poor silver recovery in leaching operations. Detailed mineralogical findings are presened in Appendix IV.
 
4.3 CYANIDATION OF CRUZ DE MAYO SAMPLE AND A HI-MN SAMPLE
 
Following the optimum leach conditions established on the Santa Elena samples, confirmatory bottle roll leach tests (C13-C14) were conducted on the
composite sample from the Cruz de Mayo deposit (also referred as CM Comp. in the test spreadsheets) and the high manganese composite (Hi-Mn Comp.).
Cyanide strength increased to 3g/L to prevent silver reprecipitation. The test conditions and results are summarized in Table 8, and gold and silver leach
profiles are plotted in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.
 
As shown in Table 8, the Cruz de Mayo composite responded poorly to the cyanidation process with 51% Au and 54% Ag recoveries. A reasonable Au
extraction of 92% was achieved on the Hi-Mn sample, but not Ag.

According to mineralogical examination, the silver mineral (native silver and/or electrum, argentite and pyrargyrite-proustite) embedded in silica gangue
might have resulted in the underprivileged silver recoveries on the Cruz de Mayo composite and the Hi-Mn composite.
 
In comparison to the tests done on the Santa Elena samples, cyanide consumption was higher in tests C13 and 14 due to the higher cyanide start level.
 
4.4 SUPPORT STUDIES FOR TAILINGS EVALUATION
 
4.4.1 Cyanide Detoxification
 
The tailing pulp from leach test C11 was used for scoping detoxification studies. The INCO air/SO2 cyanide destruction was simulated in a batch mode and
an overall target of <1mg/L total CN in the effluent was arbitrarily set. Standard Free-CN titrations were performed to follow progress at regular intervals.
Detailed analysis of the final products suggests that <1mg/L of total CN in the effluent is achievable.
 
4.4.2 Characterization of Detoxified Sample
 
Full  suites  of  environmental  analyses  were  done  on  the  detoxified  effluent.  Assay  results  as  summarized  in  Table  9  indicate  that  cyanide  is  efficiently
reduced to <0.5 mg/L. Table 9 also compares the characteristics of the detoxified feed and effluent. Further test details are provided in Appendix III.

4.4.3 Settling Test
 
Settling tests were conducted on Santa Elena leach pulps to generate plant design data. The tests were carried out on leach tests C12 and C17 pulps with
additions  of  30g/t  and  40g/t  Percol  Magnafloc  368,  respectively,  on  diluted  pulp  based  on  flocculant  screening  tests.  Settling  test  results  on  final  leach
residues are summarized in Table 10. Further test details are provided in Appendix III.
 
Results indicated that settling of Santa Elena leach tailing with 30 g/t of Percol Magnafloc 368 yielded a 24-hour raked underflow density of 74.8% solids and
a unit thickener area of 0.1 m2/h/tpd of dry solids. An underflow density of 79.2% solids and a unit thickener area of 0.07 m2/h/tpd of dry solids are achievable
by increasing the Percol Magnafloc 368 to 40g/t.

4.4.4 Vacuum Filtration Test
 
Underflows from the settling tests were adjusted to different pulp densities varying from 50% to 70% solids for vacuum filtration studies. The standard 0.1 ft2
laboratory vacuum disc filtration procedure was applied. Polypropylene type Filter cloth POPR 901F and P0-808HF were tested. The filtration test results are
presented in Table 11 below with detailed test results provided in Appendix III.

As can be seen in Table 11, no cake or thin cake formed during the filtration tests, and no clear filtrate was achieved in all tests. In most cases, the filter cloth
was blinded by fine particles and no filtrate flowed after 5 seconds.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 
Beneficiation of the Santa Elena samples by direct cyanide leaching alone will recover most of the gold but leave much of the silver in the residues. Grinding
to 74 mm and leaching for 72-hours at 40 wt.% solids in 1.5 g/L NaCN recovered 97% Au and up to 65% Ag, with residue grades of 0.08 g/t Au and 44 g/t Ag.
The silver extraction can be improved to 70% with single solution replacement after 10 hours leach. A 48-hour residence is adequate in leaching the Santa
Elena ore with solution exchange. The use of lead nitrite and hydrogen peroxide, higher cyanide concentration or finer grinding had limited benefits on
leaching. More detailed testing will be needed to optimize silver recovery.
 
The Cruz de Mayo sample responded poorly to the cyanidation process with 51% Au and 54% Ag recoveries. The gold in the Hi-Mn sample was more
favorable to cyanidation than the silver.
 
Preliminary  support  studies  on  the  leach  pulp  also  showed  encouraging  response  to  detoxification,  but  poor  flocculation,  settling  and  filtration
characterizations.

MINERALOGICAL REPORT
Microscopical Investigation of Two Auriferous Composite Samples from the Cruz de Mayo Project, Sonora, Mexico (INSPECTORATE - METALLURGICAL
DIVISION) November 2011 (11-11/128)
Summary
 
The following report presents the results of ore microscopic investigations carried out on two head composite samples from the Mexican Cruz de Mayo
project. The investigations focussed on gold and silver mineralogy.
 
The first head composite consists of silica gangue that possesses a pronounced iron staining due to finely disseminated limonite. Silver carriers are argentite
as well as pyrargyrite-proustite. In addition to these there is also native silver and/or electrum. Trace of gold occur in native
 
The second head composite is characterised by a distinct manganese mineralisation consisting essentially of pyrolusite. Specific silver minerals have not
been observed. Silver is obviously contained in electrum which occurs together with native gold in association with limonite.
 
The small particle sizes of the noble metal phases imply rather resistant locking textures. Therefore a leaching process for the recovery of gold and silver is
suggested. It is assumed that previously intense grinding of the siliceous materials will be required.
 
Resumen
 
El informe presenta los resultados de un estudio mineragrafico realizado en dos muestras colectivas de mineral de cabeza del proyecto mexicano de Cruz
de Mayo. El estudio se centra en la m ineralogfa de oro y plata.
 
Una muestra esta formada poor ganga silicea que posee una marcada coloracion ferruginosa causada por limonita diseminada. Los portadores de plata son
la argentita y la proustita- pirargirita. Ademas hay plata nativa y/o electrum. Trazas de oro se presentan en forma nativa.
 
La segunda muestra esta caracterizada por una pronunciada mineralizacion de manganeso que consiste principalmente de pirolusita. No se ha observado
minerales especfficos de plata. Sin embargo hay ele ctrum que se presenta junto con oro nativo en asociacion con la limonita.
 
El pequeno tamano de grano de los minerales de oro y plata que implica texturas resistentes a la molienda , sugiere un p roceso de lixiviacion para la
recuperacion de los metales nobles. Se supone que una previa molienda intensa de lass menas siliceas sera necesaria.

Summary
 
The following report presents the results of mineralogical investigations carried out on a silver-bearing leach residue from the Santa Elena Mine, Sonora,
Mexico. The investigations comprised ore microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and microanalysis focussing on silver mineralogy and its potential deportment in
a leaching process.
The leach residue consists mainly of silica and carbonate gangue (quartz and calcite). It carries rock fragments that show a distinct iron staining due to finely
disseminated limonite. The general oxidation of the material is also reflected by the presence of manganese oxides. Sulphides do not exceed trace amounts.
Specific silver minerals have not been detected.
 
Microanalysis proved a faint and erratic distribution of silver that could not be attributed to specific silver minerals or other silver carriers. It is assumed that
the silver retained in the sample originates from reprecipitation of silver during the leaching process. Reprecipitation can be of the main reasons for poor
silver recovery in leaching operations.
 
Resumen
 
El informe presenta los resultados de investigaciones mineralgicas realizadas en una muestra de residuo de lixiviacin argentfera de la mina de Santa Elena,
Estado  de  Sonora,  Mexico.  Las  investigaciones  comprendieron  mineragrafa,  difractometra  de  rayos  X  y  micronanlisis,  enfocando  la  mineraloga  y  el
comportamiento de plata.
 
El residuo est mayormente compuesto por cuarzo y calcita. Adems lleva fragmentos de roca que muestran una marcada coloracin ferruginosa causada por
limonita diseminada. La oxidacin generalizada del material se manifiesta tambin en la presencia de xidos de manganeso. Los sulfuros no sobrepasan
cantidades trazas. No se ha detectado minerales especficos de plata.
 
A travs de microanlisis se comprob una dbil y errtica distribucin de plata que no aparece con minerales especficos de plata u otros portadores de plata. Se
supone que la plata retenida en la muestra resulta de una reprecipitacin de plata durante el proceso de lixiviacin. Reprecipitacin puede ser una de las
causas principales para mermas de plata en operaciones de lixiviacin.

MICROANALYSIS
The two element maps for silver show a discrete distribution of the metal. Silver has been detected in isolated spots. It cannot be attributed to specific
silver minerals or other silver carriers that could represent leaching-resistant minerals or remnants of an incomplete leaching process. In fact the faint and
erratic distribution of silver supports the idea of silver reprecipitation that occurred during the leaching process.

MICROANALYIS
The third element map for silver has been obtained by employing two parallel spectrometers (elevated background
noise as compared to the previous maps). Nevertheless there are not more than three tiny spots where silver
has been clearly detected. The corresponding element maps for iron and silica show the distribution of the
two elements reflecting ferruginous rock fragments and quartz grains. In addition to the minerals already identified
by microscopy and XRD, microanalysis (EDS) detected dolomite, baryte, rutile, pyrophanite and zircon.

silver minerals or other silver carriers that could represent leaching-resistant minerals or remnants of an incomplete leaching process. In fact the faint and
erratic distribution of silver supports the idea of silver reprecipitation that occurred during the leaching process.

INTRODUCTION
General
Santa Elena Expansion Plan,  Underground Pre-Feasibility Level Geotechnical Rock Mechanics Evaluation
Subject:
 
1.0  
 
1.1  
 
EBA Engineering Consultants Ltd. operating as EBA, A Tetra Tech Company (EBA) was requested by SilverCrest Minerals Inc. (SilverCrest) to assess the
geotechnical conditions at the Santa Elena mine as part of a Prefeasibility Study. The following report summarizes the geotechnical data obtained and
design parameters implemented and focusses on both the footwall development and production stopes of the Santa Elena Mine. Geotechnical development
design and production design are summarized individually in this report.
 
The Santa Elena Gold and Silver Mine property is approximately 150 km northeast of the state capital city of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. Currently, ore is
extracted  from  an  open  pit  mine,  and  gold  and  silver  are  recovered  by  heap  leaching.  Before  SilverCrest  became  involved  with  the  property,  ore  was
extracted underground, and there are several open stopes, a mine shaft, and an open mine portal.
 
Geotechnical  data  collection  consisted  of  a  background  review  of  information  from  Vector  Engineering  (Vector  2009),  a  geotechnical  drilling  program
undertaken in 2011 where six geotechnical boreholes were drilled to assess conditions for permanent ramp and raise development, and a geotechnical
drilling program undertaken in 2012 to assess the orebody, footwall and hangingwall conditions for production design. The 2012 program also consisted of
UCS, Brazilian and Point Load Testing of rock samples at the Sonora University.

Investigation and Assessment Objectives and Methodology
1.3  
 
The following are the objectives of the pre-feasibility geotechnical evaluation for the Santa Elena Expansion Plan:
§  Collect geotechnical information pertaining to the in situ materials;
§  Geotechnically characterize the in situ materials;
§  Geotechnically characterize the rock mass;
§  Divide the mine into zones, if deemed necessary, to serve as the basis of geotechnical analysis; and
§  Assess the stability of the underground openings (ramps, raises, and stopes) to make recommendations pertaining to permanent ramp and raise support
and stope and pillar dimensions.
The principal stages of the pre-feasibility geotechnical evaluation work program were split into two sections and comprised the following:
 
Section 1 – Permanent ramp access and raise assessment utilizing data from the 2011 drilling program:
§  Conduct QA/QC of geotechnical core logging and discontinuity orientation of core recovered from the boreholes;
§  Interpret and analyze the collected geotechnical data to divide the ramp and raise development into geotechnical domains; and
§  Compile a pre-feasibility geotechnical evaluation incorporating recommendations for ramp and raise support design.
Section 2 – Stope and pillar design utilizing data from the 2012 drilling program:
§  Conduct QA/QC of geotechnical core logging and discontinuity orientation of core recovered from the boreholes;
§  Select  representative  drill  core  samples  from  the  different  lithological  units  encountered  in  the  boreholes  to  undertake  field  and  laboratory  testing  of
geotechnical properties of the in situ materials;
§  Submit representative samples to the Sonora University rock mechanics laboratories, Mexico, for geotechnical testing;
§  Interpret and analyze the collected geotechnical data and test results to divide the rockmass into geotechnical domains; and

2.0   GEOTECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF FOOTWALL ACCESS RAMPS AND RAISES
 
Initial ramp development and ventilation raise location was considered for the eastern end of the open pit only, however, this has subsequently been revised.
The main access ramp which is currently under development is located at the eastern end of the open pit. This eastern ramp is currently at the 655 Level and
will continue down to the base of the orebody at the 328 Level. Two shaft raises will be used at this eastern end of the orebody for ventilation purposes. A
future western decline is proposed at the base of open pit together with a separate ventilation shaft. This western shaft and ramp will extend down to the
base of the current orebody in this area of the orebody at the 471 Level. Figure 1 shows an overview of the ultimate pit, underground workings and borehole
locations drilled in 2011, and the perceived location of the Tinaja Fault Zone (located based on topography). The proposed underground workings are within
the footwall of the deposit where the predominant rock types are Andesite and Rhyolite. The workings can be separated into two distinct zones, as described
below.
 
Zone 1 – Eastern Ramp
 
The Eastern ramp spirals down from surface to the base of the current orebody at 328 Level. Figure 2 shows the eastern ramp and the relevant boreholes
that have been drilled specifically to characterize the rock. The gradient of the ramp is 12%. Boreholes GT11-08, GT11-05, GT-06 and GT-07 intersect the
ramp.
 
The Tinaja Fault is anticipated to intersect the Eastern Ramp. Borehole GT11-06 intersects the Tinaja Fault. Boreholes GT11-06a and GT11-06b intersect
the Tinaja Fault at a higher elevation. These holes were planned to be drilled to completely intersect the Tinaja Fault, but due to surface conditions were
moved by SilverCrest. The perceived fault is shown in Figure 1.
 
Adjacent to the eastern ramp is an as-built fresh air raise that connects to each of the different levels to provide ventilation during development of the ramp
access. This raise is shown on Figure 2. The proposed main ventilation shaft at the eastern end of the orebody is also shown on Figure 2 and will extend
down to the base of the proposed workings.
 
Zone 2 – Western Ramp and Ventilation Raise
 
The western ramp is proposed at the base of the open pit together with a separate ventilation shaft as shown in Figure 1. This development is a recent
addition and was proposed after initial geotechnical planning and investigation which focussed on the eastern side of the open pit. Therefore, this ramp and
raise are not considered in detail within this report. Whilst it is anticipated that geotechnical conditions are similar throughout the footwall it is recommended
to undertake geotechnical drilling at this proposed location in order to ascertain ground support recommendations for this access and raise development.

Note on Dip and Dip Direction
 
Within this report a structural orientation has been designated a dip and dip direction. For example 40°/ 090° indicates a structure inclined at 40 degrees
from the horizontal trending towards the east.
Background Review
2.1  
 
As part of the review of background information, the report prepared by Vector Engineering (Vector 2009) was reviewed. The pertinent information from this
report is summarized below.
 
The primary rock types observed on the property are Tertiary Andesite and Rhyolite flows.
 
Near quartz veining argillic and silicification is present, whereas in the Andesite beds chloritic alteration increases away from the mineralized zones.
§  The mineralized zone is approximately 1.2 km long, with a width from 1 to 35 m, averaging 15 m.
§  The trend is between 40° and 60° towards the south.
§  Within the footwall Andesite, the primary joint set is oriented at 28/085.
§  The average geomechanical and geotechnical properties of the Andesite as reported by Vector are:
-  Strength 80 to 160 MPa;
-  Average RQD = 65%;
-  Average joint spacing = 0.25 m;
-  Average RMR joint condition = 10 (out of a possible 30); and
-  Average RMR is 51 (fair rock).
§  A stereonet of the discontinuities measured underground indicates two major joint sets one at 65/170, the second at 74/258. These measurements are
consistent with surface recordings and measurements undertaken from oriented core.
Geotechnical Investigation
2.2  
 
SilverCrest geologists undertook diamond drilling and geotechnical borehole logging during September and October 2011 to gain geotechnical data for the
ramp. EBA was on site before the start of the drilling program to train SilverCrest geologists on evaluating geotechnical parameters. Field data collected by
SilverCrest geologists was reviewed on site by the senior mine geologist as the drilling progressed.
 
The drilling program consisted of drilling, logging and sampling six boreholes. EBA in conjunction with SilverCrest chose the location, length, azimuth, and
inclination of the boreholes. EBA recommended that all six boreholes have oriented core to allow kinematic analysis, and the Reflex® ACT II orientation
system was used to orient the drill core.

Drill core from the geotechnical holes was oriented using the Reflex ACT II RD core orientation system. With the ACT II tool, the core is marked at this
lowermost point from which a bottom reference line can be drawn.
 
The core is carefully pieced back together, and the reference line is transferred along the length of the core run. Alpha and beta angles are measured and
recorded for the dominant and sub-dominant joint sets for each core run. The alpha angle is the acute angle between the core axis and the plane of the joint
surface, while the beta angle is the circumferential angle between the Reflex ACT II RD reference line and the downhole apex of the ellipse formed by the
joint cutting through the core, measured in a “looking downhole” clockwise direction. Alpha angles are measured using a clear plastic protractor held parallel
to the axis of the core, and beta angles are measured using a wraparound protractor scaled for the core diameter.
 
Oriented core data was processed using Rocscience DIPS™ software. Each alpha and beta angle pair, in conjunction with downhole survey data was used
to determine a true dip and dip direction for dominant and subdominant joint surfaces that were observed in core logging.
 
Geotechnical parameters for rock mass classification were collected using two widely used empirical systems: the NGI Q-system after Barton et al. (1974)
and the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system after Bieniawski (1973). Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 present an overview of the Q and RMR systems respectively.

Quality Assurance of Geotechnical Logs and Resolution of Ambiguities
2.3  
 
A quality assurance (QA) review of the geotechnical core logs was undertaken to identify any potential issues or concerns with the dataset. The review of the
logs included a spot check of the core photos to cross-check data. A few minor inconsistencies and issues were identified, but as a whole the QA review
indicates that the dataset is in good order.
 
Some data was missing from the logs, including joint parameters as well as oriented core orientation angles. Q and RMR values were only calculated in runs
for which the necessary data was available and complete.

Two issues were identified with respect to the recorded RQD values. First, in selected runs, the RQD exceeded 75%, yet the number of natural fractures and
Jn  value  recorded  were  high,  indicating  the  opposite  may  be  true.  Second,  and  more  commonly,  in  some  runs,  only  one  or  two  natural  fractures  were
recorded, but the RQD length was lower than is potentially feasible. These runs typically listed 100% recovery over a 3 m run length, but with only one
natural fracture, and yet had an RQD length of less than 2.90 m. In these cases, the correct procedures for measuring RQD may not have been followed. The
RQD was still within the correct range of 80-100%, but the RQD was perhaps slightly lower than it should be based on fracture data. Potential issues in the
RQD length are highlighted in 51 out of the 490 runs (10.4%). Due to the limited number of highlighted runs and since the RQD was still within the correct
range, this issue did not warrant re-logging of the core, and no changes were made to this part of the data.
 
As  a  whole  the  Ja  values  were  noted  as  being  slightly  lower  than  expected  given  the  lithologies  and  alteration  styles  encountered.  In  some  runs,  the
comments section notes the presence of chlorite and other non-softening mineral coatings, but the Ja values of 1 or 2 do not reflect this. A spot check of the
photos suggests that the mineral coatings may be minor. The runs in which this concern is noted are irregular and interspersed and not deemed significant in
quantity.
 
In the lower six runs from 28.75 to 39.05 m of borehole GT-11-06, the values of Ja for the representative and worst case joints are reversed. This is simply
noted as a typo and the Ja values have been interchanged for the purpose of EBA’s analyses.
 
Some discrepancies exist between the values recorded and the associated comments, particularly as it relates to the assignment of a weathering value. This
was noted in some runs; however, as the weathering value does not influence the Q or RMR calculation, no changes were made to this part of the dataset.
 
A nominal RQD of 10% was assigned to all runs for which the listed RQD was <10%. This change is consistent with the guidelines presented by Barton et al.
(1974) in assessing the NGI Q-value.
 
2.4  
 
The main ramp and fresh air raise developments are within the footwall of the deposit which is formed from both Rhyolite and Andesite rock types. Within
these  rock  types,  differing  structural  domains  could  exist.  A  structural  domain  is  classified  as  a  zone  or  area  of  rock,  which  has  similar  structural
characteristics and geomechanical properties, and consequently, the rock behaviour is also similar in terms of excavation (potential failure mechanisms and
deformation).
 
The Tinaja Fault Zone is thought to be a 100 m wide strip of rock striking northeast to southwest. The location of the TFZ is based on surface topography
where a shallow valley feature has formed. A review of the borehole logs was unable to definitively locate the Tinaja Fault Zone; therefore, this feature may
not be as significant as previously suggested from surface mapping.
 
Based on the foregoing, there are potentially three structural domains on site:
 
1.           Eastern ramp in Rhyolite;
 
2.           Eastern ramp in Andesite; and
 
3.           The Tinaja Fault Zone.

To reconcile whether these three areas form structural domains, the structural discontinuity orientations, as well as the average geotechnical parameters,
were compared within each of the zones.
 
The alpha and beta angles recorded on the geotechnical logs were converted to true dip and dip directions using the program DIPS (by Rocscience 2011)
and the orientation of the borehole at the collar.
 
Deviation by downhole survey of the borehole was not undertaken, therefore, downhole orientation was assumed to be a straight path from the hole collar. In
total, EBA recorded 114 discontinuity measurements. This is an unusually low success rate for the orientation tool. By comparing all the data, four general
structural joint sets were identified, as shown on Figure 3.
 
The average geotechnical parameters were compared and showed that overall geotechnical characteristics are very similar throughout the footwall of the
mine. Therefore, at this stage, we do not believe there is sufficient data, or the basis, to discretize the rock mass into structural domains.
 
2.5  
 
2.5.1  
 
The Q-system uses six parameters to determine a numerical value (Q) which represents the quality of a given rock mass. The parameters assign numerical
values to various features of the rock mass, including RQD, number of joint sets, joint alteration, joint surface roughness, stress conditions, and water inflow
intensity. These are combined in a simple formula to derive a “Q-value”, which indicates the overall quality of the rock mass for underground excavation and
support design. This formula can be thought of as the function of three geomechanical rock properties (1) block size given by RQD/Jn; (2) inter-block shear
strength given by Jr/Ja; and (3A)A active stress given by Jw/SRF.  The formula for determining Q is as follows:
Summary of Rock Mass Quality and Geotechnical Conditions
Note on the NGI Q-System
(1)
Where:                   RQD = rock quality designation
Jn = joint set number
Jr = joint roughness number
Ja = joint alteration number
Jw = joint water reduction number
SRF = stress reduction factor
 
The description of the six parameters can be found in the report by Barton et al. (1974). The numerical value of Q ranges from 0.001 (for exceptionally poor
quality, squeezing ground) to 1000 (for exceptionally good quality, massive rock).

The  Q-system  presents  a  relationship  between  the  rock  mass  quality  and  the  amount  and  type  of  permanent  excavation  support.  This  relationship  is
summarized on the NGI Q-system excavation or tunnel support chart. An updated version of the tunnel support chart is shown on Figure 4. The tunnel
support chart takes into account not only the rock mass quality, but also the size of the excavation in terms of span or wall height and the purpose of the
excavation.  The  size  and  purpose  of  the  excavation  are  incorporated  through  a  parameter  known  as  the  equivalent  dimension  (De).  The  equivalent
dimension  is  determined  by  dividing  the  span  (when  analyzing  for  roof  support)  or  height  (when  analyzing  for  wall  support)  of  the  excavation  by  the
excavation support ratio (ESR). The ESR is a value, determined by the function and purpose of the excavation, and it is akin to a factor of safety. The ESR is
higher for some excavations (e.g., ESR = 1.6 for permanent mine openings) and lower for more critical structures (e.g., ESR = 0.8 for underground nuclear
power stations).
 
For the underground ramps at Santa Elena, the excavation dimensions are a span of 4.5 m wide by a vertical height of 4 m. In this case, the span is the
controlling factor. A span of 4.5 m divided by an ESR of 1.6 is equal to an equivalent dimension of 2.8. This equivalent dimension value is shown as a green
line on Figure 4.
 
2.5.2  
 
The Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system is a geomechanical classification system for rocks, developed by Bieniawski (1973, with major updates in 1976 and
1989). The following six parameters are used to classify a rock mass using the RMR system:
Note on the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) System
1.  Uniaxial compressive strength of rock material;
2.  Rock Quality Designation (RQD);
3.  Spacing of discontinuities;
4.  Condition of discontinuities;
5.  Groundwater conditions;
6.  Orientation of discontinuities.
Assumptions for Evaluating Rock Mass Quality
Each of the six parameters is assigned a value corresponding to the characteristics of the rock. The sum of the six parameters is the “RMR value”.
 
2.6  
 
Most of the parameters for evaluating the RMR and NGI Q-Values were collected on site. However, some assumptions were made during the evaluation
specifically related to groundwater and stress conditions.
 
2.6.1  
 
The groundwater table at Santa Elena is reported to be 60 m below ground surface. In the underground excavations, water inflow will be controlled by
hydrogeological conduits such as fault zones, open joints, and fractured rock. Hydro-geological packer testing to determine the hydraulic conductivity was
undertaken as part of the geotechnical investigation. The average of 12 tests successfully undertaken gave 1.3 x 10-7 m/s. The value of 1.3 x 10-7 m/s can
be described as “low discharge or poor drainage” based on a qualitative comparison presented by Hoek and Bray (1977).

Stress Reduction Factor
Although open to conjecture, in finer grained igneous rocks, the somewhat brittle nature of the rock tends to produce a lower persistence of joints, but with a
higher fracturation than other coarser igneous rocks. For a rock mass to be permeable, both conditions (i.e., fractured rock and highly persistent joint sets) are
potentially required to increase the inter-connectivity. Other aspects that control permeability are joint spacing and the aperture of joints. The average joint
spacing is moderate, and hardly any joints were noted as being open on the logs.
 
At this stage, the groundwater is assumed not to be significant during excavation and the water inflows that do occur should dissipate with time. For the RMR
calculation, a groundwater condition of 10 was assumed (equivalent to < 10 litres of water inflow for a 10 m length of tunnel). For the NGI Q-system, a JW
value of 1.0 was assumed (equivalent to a dry excavation or minor inflow). These inflow estimates have been verified by the Global Resource Engineering
(November 2011) report which estimates inflow for the ramp as between 17.4 and 59.4 litres per minute of water inflow.
 
We understand that for the full feasibility study a groundwater model may be developed to more accurately predict groundwater conditions. The assessment
of assumed groundwater parameters used in the RMR and Q-value analysis should be updated following this study.
 
2.6.2  
 
The stress reduction factor (SRF) categorizes the stress conditions into four categories: a) weakness zones, b) competent rock stress problems, c) squeezing
rock, and, d) swelling rock. At this stage only competent rock stress problems are envisaged. One method of estimating SRF is by σc / σ1 (the uniaxial
compressive strength (UCS) of the rock divided by the principal stress).
 
Based on the average description of strong rock (indicating a UCS of ~75 MPa) a medium stress (under SRF category b) is envisaged in the eastern ramp
and eastern raise bore. A medium stress condition is based on the σc / σ1 ratio ranging between 10 and 200. A medium stress condition equates to a SRF
value of 1.
 
We have also assumed an SRF of 1 for the lower eastern ramp. Although in theory the in-situ stress and average rock strength gives a σc / σ1 ratio lower
than 10 in some instances, given only one borehole for the lower eastern ramp and the number of unknown or assumed parameters, this SRF is believed to
be reasonable at this time. If stress problems occur in the lower levels after the eastern ramp is excavated, the SRF should be re-evaluated in conjunction
with additional geotechnical boreholes drilled into the eastern ramp and geomechanical testing (including rock strength testing).
 
3.0  
 
The geotechnical parameters throughout the mine were assessed based on the borehole logs. To achieve this aim, the exploration declines were split into
four zones. Boreholes relevant to each zone were then grouped, and a weighted average was used to determine the average parameter value.
 
3.1  
 
EBA visited the site in 2012 and undertook geotechnical mapping of the first 400 m of ramp development. To assess the weighted averages for the Eastern

The average geotechnical parameters from core logging in the Eastern ramp and fresh air raise show that the rock is good quality based on both the Q and
RMR  values.  The  jointing  and  rock  strength  will  control  excavation  stability.  The  fair  RQD  means  that  locally  the  rock  is  expected  to  be  fractured,  but
generally the rock mass contains two joint sets (with one random set), slightly altered, rough planar joints.
 
In July 2012 the first 420 m of the ramp was geotechnically mapped by EBA staff. The ramp was found to be generally dry with minor seepage in the last 70
m of ramp mapped. The figures in brackets in Table 2 are the parameters obtained from the mapping exercise as a comparison to the parameters obtained
from core logging. It can be seen that the representative average Q value is lower than that obtained from core logging. This is mainly due to a far lower
maximum Q value obtained from the mapping exercise and the fact that generally three joint sets are apparent in the actual section of ramp mapped.
 
It is imperative that regular geotechnical mapping of the ramp access is carried out to confirm these initial Q values and to correlate Q values obtained from
core logging and mapping. Support recommendations remain the same for both the values obtained – see Section 4.4.
 
A useful tool that is currently used for QA/QC correlation of mapping and borehole log data is the Televiewer. It is a valuable tool in obtaining 360o digital
images of the borehole walls and therefore in-situ fractures and other defects along the borehole. As the Televiewer logs the hole in-situ it provides a far
more accurate representation of actual rockmass conditions than traditional core evaluation which has been disturbed from its in-situ state. The Televiewer
can accurately provide structural orientation data for the borehole and can provide a means of QC/QA for traditional orientated boreholes. It can also provide

Kinematic Stability
Only one borehole was used to estimate the geotechnical characteristics within the lower eastern ramp.
 
On average the rock mass quality is very good based on the Q-system and good based on the RMR system. The joints are unaltered, rough planar with two
joint sets plus a random being present at any one place. The rock strength on average is 3.5 indicating medium strong to strong rock. This average is slightly
lower than elsewhere.
 
4.0   UNDERGROUND STABILITY ASSESSMENT AND SUPPORT OF PERMANENT ACCESS
 
4.1  
 
This section of the report assesses the effect of joint orientation on the ramp and raise stability. Joints or other discontinuities can interact to form trapezoid or
pyramidal shaped blocks of rock that may become unstable when the ramp or raise is excavated. A stereonet analysis was carried out on the measured joint
sets (having adjusted the alpha and beta angles to give true dip and dip direction orientations) to assess if the joint orientations could potentially form blocks
of unstable rock. Given that the ramps spiral down the sidewalls have all possible orientations. The vertical raises also have all possible orientations for
vertical kinematic stability.
 
The total number of successful orientation measurements was relatively low at 114 recorded orientations, and all structural data was combined onto a single
stereonet. Figure 3 presents a stereonet of the major joint sets from all data; these joint sets are summarized below.
 
1 = 73 / 101.
 
2 = 89 / 017.
 
3 = 68 / 338.
 
4 = 62 / 034.
 
4.2  
 
The underground stability of the ramps was analyzed using the Rocscience program Unwedge
Kinematic Stability of Underground Ramps
(Rocscience 2011). Within this program, the dimensions and shape of the excavation were entered as well as the assumed in situ stress field at a nominal
depth of 100 m. The shear strength properties of the discontinuities were assigned a friction of 35° with no cohesion. The Unwedge program assigns an
orientation of the excavation to assess if kinematically feasible wedges are formed. Given that the ramps vary in orientation as they spiral down, the azimuth
of the alignment of the ramps was varied in 15 degree increments from 000 degrees (whole circle bearing) through to 180 degrees (180 to 360 was not
assessed as it is a mirror image of the first assessment). The results of this analysis are shown in Table 5. Wedges less than 0.1 m3 in size have been
ignored, as have wedges formed in the floor (sill/invert) of the excavation. Typical output plots from the Unwedge program are shown in Figures 5 and 6.

Mechanism of failure and volume (m3)
Falling wedge; volume = 0.77 m3
Sliding on joint 2; volume = 0.66 m3
Falling wedge; volume = 0.66 m3
Falling wedge; volume= 1.125 m3
Falling wedge; volume = 2.3 m3
(One falling wedge identified where factor of safety
was 1.18, but wedge volume was 5.29 m3).
Sliding on joint 4; volume = 0.5 m3
NA
Sliding on joint 3; volume = 0.278 m3
Falling wedge volume = 0.435 m3
Falling wedge volume = 0.38 m3
Falling wedge volume = 1.2 m3
Falling wedge volume = 0.77 m3
Generally, the wedge size is relatively small, although wedges falling from the crown or back of the tunnel are a potential mode of failure. Only one sizable
wedge was found at an orientation of 075 and 255 degrees, where a low factor of safety for a wedge formed between joint sets 2, 3 and 4 may give rise to a
wedge 5.29 m3 in size.
 
The analysis summarized in Table 5 is sensitive to the horizontal stress component. As horizontal stress increases, it tends to ‘lock in’ potential kinematically
feasible blocks of rock. Therefore, wedge failure is considered to be significantly less for the mid and lower levels within the eastern ramp than for the near
surface in the eastern ramp.  In theory, locating the excavations within the upper eastern ramp on top of one another, channels any horizontal stress present
into the rock between the excavations, potentially assisting to ‘lock in’ kinematic wedges.
 
The sizes of the wedges formed within the ramp were used to check the sufficiency of the standard rock bolt length to support the rock (detailed in Section
4.6).
 
4.3  
 
The  program  Unwedge  was  also  used  to  assess  the  kinematic  stability  of  the  raises.  In  this  case,  the  raises  were  modelled  as  semi-vertical,  circular
excavations with a 3.5 m diameter. The results of this analysis showed that a combination of joint sets 1, 2, and 3 form potential wedges with a factor of safety
lower than 1.0. However, the volume of the wedges formed from joint sets 1, 2, and 3 was relatively small (0.37 m3). Figure 7 shows the results of this
analysis. Joint set combination 2, 3, and 4 could also form potential wedge failures, but the factor of safety of this combination is above 1.4, and the wedge
size is again relatively small and less than 0.75 m3. Figure 8 shows the results of this second analysis.

Based on these initial results, it does not appear that sizeable wedges will form within the raises.  Critically, in the case of the raise bore, the wedge size is
small  enough  to  fall  down  the  raise  without  causing  a  potential  blockage.  The  size  of  the  wedges  has  in  part  been  used  to  assess  the  supporting
requirements within the raises.
Support Design
Classes 1 & 2: No support, spot bolting only.
Class 3: Systematic bolting at a spacing of 1.7 m and 50 mm steel fibre reinforced shotcrete.
Class 5: Systematic bolting at a spacing of 1.3 m and 90 to 120 mm steel fibre reinforced shotcrete.
Class 6: Systematic bolting at a spacing of 1.1 m and 120 to 150 mm steel fibre reinforced shotcrete.
Class 4: Systematic bolting at a spacing of 1.4 m and 60 to 90 mm steel fibre reinforced shotcrete.
4.4  
 
Based on the equivalent dimension of 2.8 calculated in Section 2.5.1, the following support is envisaged for differing ranges of Q-value. Figure 4 presents the
Q-system stability graph.

4.5  
 
Although the NGI Q-system indicates that for Q-value greater than 1.75 (i.e., Classes 1 and 2) either no support or only spot bolting is required, such a
recommendation may not conform to local practice. At some mine sites where a scheme of thorough scaling and routine detailed inspection occurs, having
the back or crown of the excavation left unsupported is feasible in the context of an overall rigorous quality control and assurance ground support program. It
is also appreciated that some mine sites prohibit workers from entering unsupported ground, and the back or crown of the excavation is always supported.
 
At Santa Elena, it may be preferable to support the back with wire mesh fixed in place with split sets. If this is the case, the welded wire mesh should have an
aperture of 100 mm by 100mm and a section gauge of 5 mm. Panels are generally sized by imperial units (8 by 4 feet) and should have at least six split sets
per panel (including overlap of 300 mm/ 1 foot, such that the adjacent panel has a minimum of three split sets installed). The split sets should be a minimum
of 1.2 m long.

Class 7: Systematic bolting at a spacing of 1.0 m, installation of reinforced ribs of shotcrete (or steel sets with invert closure if preferred) and
more than 150 mm of steel fibre reinforced shotcrete.

The choice of a rigorous scaling program or the use of mesh should be left to the owner’s discretion. Based on the Q-values, we do not foresee the need to
spray shotcrete down the entire ramp.
 
4.6  
 
The length of rock bolts can be estimated from the excavation width and the excavation support ratio. Based on this assessment and the potential size of
wedge failure (detailed in Section 4.2 of this report), two alternative types of rock bolt are envisaged at this feasibility stage.
 
§  Alternative A = 2 m long super-swellex bolts installed and then inflated as per Atlas Copco manufacturers recommendations.
Rockbolt Details and Design
§  Alternative B = 2 m long, 25 mm diameter fully threaded bar (steel grade 517 / 690 MPa), fully resin grouted in place.
A stock of 3 m long rock bolts should also be on site and available for either rock bolting or fore-poling difficult and poor ground. At intersections, using longer
rock bolts up to 3 m should also be considered, due to the increased span of the excavation
 
4.7  
 
The shotcrete design will be developed by the contractor undertaking the mining work to suit the equipment and logistics of the site. Although specifications
for the shotcrete will be developed during detailed design, the following preliminary specification has been prepared for this report.
Shotcrete Design
§  Minimum 28 day strength from sprayed panels on site = 35 MPa
§  Minimum 28 day flexural strength from sprayed panels on site = 5 MPa
§  Minimum toughness indices index I20 from sprayed panels on site = 12.0
§  Minimum steel fibre reinforcement content = 50 kg / m3
Poor Ground and Fault Zone Support Design
4.8  
 
The contractor should allow for poor and faulted ground and should have suitable equipment and materials on site to maintain the stability and integrity of the
excavation if such ground conditions are found.
Support within these fault zones will be critical as potentially weak and fractured ground could affect the stability of the excavation and the safety of mine
workers. The ability to support and reinforce difficult ground should include:
§  Ability to spray shotcrete quickly and efficiently
§  Suitably designed steel sets, on hand at site
§  3 to 4 m long forepoles
§  Ability to grout up to 20 m ahead of the excavation (with down the hole hydraulic packers as well as shorter packers).

Fresh Air Raise Excavation and Support
Notes:
1      Length of excavation is within standard ramp having a width of 4.5 m and height of 4 m. Based on a 12% gradient the length of the Eastern ramp is 1350
m. This has been used as the baseline for the excavation length. This does not include the air raises or the proposed development at the base of the open
pit. At intersections additional support may be required both in terms of shotcrete and longer rock bolts.
2      As discussed in Section 4.9, although no support might be recommended by support classes 1 and 2 of the NGI Q-system, some optional support for
worker safety may be desirable such as mesh fixed with split sets.
 
4.10  
 
This air raise has been built to 625 Level and the following support recommendations should be compared to actual as-built design. The fresh air raise is
expected  to  be  excavated  using  a  short  10  to  15  m  long  horizontal  access  excavated  from  each  level  of  the  ramp.  The  2.1  x  3  m  diameter  raise  will
essentially connect these access points together by excavating upwards in 20 m vertical, sequential stages as the ramp is progressed. Within the raise, initial
support will consist of spot rock bolting only, until the 20 m section has holed through with the access above. Good quality scaling is critical to the safety of
this part of the works following each blast. Support for the temporary platform constructed at the start of each shift, as the raise progresses, will also be
needed using resin-grouted rebar shaped to suit the heavy timber used for the platform (this platform is dismantled prior to blasting).
 
Once a section of the raise has holed through, then the sidewalls of the raise should be supported with welded wire mesh panels and split sets. This will help
ensure that rock does not fall down the entire raise if instability occurs and creates a rock fall. Having supported a particular section of the raise, a concrete
bulkhead wall should be constructed within the access way leading off the ramp. The purpose of this concrete bulkhead wall is to maintain the correct air
flow throughout the ramp excavations (with a door for emergency access). The intention is to mount one or two ventilation fans into the concrete bulkheads.
 
The access points to the fresh air raise from each level of the ramp will make ideal and safety bays during excavation.

Proposed Main Eastern Air Raise Excavation and Support
4.11  
 
It is assumed that the 3.4 m diameter eastern fresh air raise will be excavated using raise boring techniques. A shaft chamber will need to be excavated at
the proposed shaft base off the Eastern ramp. The shaft chamber should at least be 6 m wide and 6 m long to accommodate the raising cutter head and
provide an ample target for the probe hole and accompanying drill string.
 
The stability of the raise bore walls will likely be controlled by joint sets forming wedge shaped instabilities. At this stage, the rock appears to be of sufficient
quality that mass or large scale instability from the walls of the shaft will not occur. However, this should be verified by drilling a vertical geotechnical hole
offset (by 5 to 15 m) from the location of the raise bore.
 
During raise boring, the type and consistency of the cuttings should be carefully recorded in case poor ground is struck. Support of the raise bore can only
occur once the cutter head has reached surface and is removed. Support will be installed from the top down within the shaft, following thorough scaling of a
particular section. An allowance should be made to have the entire shaft supported with mesh and split sets so as to prevent rock fall. Only in the event of
massive, unfractured rock can the shaft be left unsupported. Spot bolts and potentially pattern bolts (in poor ground) may also be required. An additional
support assessment should be undertaken once the vertical investigation hole has been drilled.
 
5.0   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS OF GEOTECHNICAL AND STABILITY CONDITIONS FOR RAMPS AND RAISES
 
5.1  
 
The following conclusions in this section should be compared to the as-built ramp and fresh air raise:
Eastern Ramp As-Built and Fresh Air Raise
§  Both Rhyolite and Andesite rock types can be expected.
§  The average geotechnical parameters in the eastern ramp and fresh air raise show that the rock is good quality based on both the Q and RMR values. The
jointing and rock strength will control excavation stability. The fair RQD means that locally the rock is expected to be fractured, but generally the rock mass
contains two joint sets (with one random set), slightly altered, rough planar joints.
§  The groundwater conditions are considered to be “damp” in that less than 10 litres of inflow per 10 m of excavation can be expected.
 
§  The  stress  conditions  within  the  eastern  ramp  are  considered  to  be  favorable  for  excavation,  with  stress  related  to  overburden  being  the  principal
component. Stress is considered to be less than 5 MPa.
§  There is the potential for kinematic wedge instability, although in general the size of the wedges formed is relatively small (< 1.2 m3). Wedge-related
instability is likely to be most prolific within the western ramp, where low horizontal stress does not ‘lock in’ potential kinematic wedges.
§  Based on the average overall Q-value, the support class will be either 1 or 2, indicating no support or only localized spot bolts. However, poorer rock is
expected to occur, and shotcrete will be required in just over 10% of the excavation.

§  Additional support may be required for worker safety, at the discretion of the owner in coordination with the mining contractor. Such support may consist of
installing mesh fixed with split sets on the back (crown) of the excavation throughout the mine.
Eastern Ramp Between 597 Level and 471 Level, and Planned Main Air Raise
5.2  
 
The following summary conclusions can be made about the geotechnical conditions within this ramp section and planned main air raise:
 
§  Both Rhyolite and Andesite rock types can be expected within the raise bore. Rhyolite can be expected within the ramp.
 
§  The rock in the ramp and air raise is considered to be good quality in terms of the Q and RMR rock mass classification systems. The rock is well jointed
with almost three joint sets on average being present. The joints are generally unaltered and rough planar.
§  The groundwater conditions are considered to be “damp” in that less than 10 litres of inflow per 10 m of excavation can be expected.
 
§  There is the potential for kinematic wedge instability, although in general the size of the wedges formed is relatively small (< 1.2 m3). Wedge instability
may also occur within the raise bore, although the size of these wedges is considered to be less than 0.75 m3.
§  Based on the average overall Q-value, the support class will be either 1 or 2, indicating no support or only localized spot bolts. However, poorer rock is
expected to occur, and shotcrete will be required in just over 10% of the excavation.
§  Additional support may be required for worker safety, at the discretion of the owner in coordination with the mining contractor. Such support may consist of
installing mesh fixed with split sets on the back (crown) of the excavation throughout the mine.
5.3  
 
The following summary conclusions can be made about the geotechnical conditions within the eastern ramp:
Lower Eastern Ramp
§  Both Rhyolite and Andesite rock types can be expected.
§  Based on only one borehole, within the lower eastern ramp the rock mass quality is very good based on the Q-system and good based on the RMR
system. The joints are unaltered, rough planar with two joint sets plus a random being present at any one place. The rock strength on average is 3.5
indicating medium strong to strong rock. This average is slightly lower than elsewhere within the mine.
§  The  groundwater  conditions  at  this  stage  are  considered  to  be  “damp”  in  that  less  than  10  litres  of  inflow  per  10  m  of  excavation  can  be  expected.
However, since the eastern ramp will develop the highest hydraulic gradient within the mine, this assessment will need to be updated based on additional
hydro-geological modelling and actual mine pumping data. Section 9.3 of this report gives specific recommendations to assess groundwater.

§  The stress conditions within the eastern ramp are considered to be favorable for excavation. Some stress related problems may occur where the rock is
locally weaker (UCS less than 50 MPa).
§  There is the potential for kinematic wedge instability, although in general the size of the wedges formed is relatively small. Wedge-related instability is
likely to be least prolific within the lower eastern ramp, due to the horizontal stress component being relatively high and tending to ‘lock in’ potential

PRODUCTION STOPE DESIGN

6.1  
 
The geotechnical analysis of production stoping at Santa Elena is based on geotechnical data collected from exploration drill holes advanced as part of the
2012 subsurface exploration program and geotechnical test work conducted on core samples at Sonora University.
 
This section provides the following information:
 
§  Summary of the range of variance of the rock mass conditions (by means of RMR76 and NGI-Q classification systems) at the following five zones as
General
represented in Figure 10:
1.  At the ore zone (referred herein as Zone D1).
2.  Country rock above the hanging wall, from 5-6 m to 50-60 m above the upper ore zone/country rock interface (referred here in as Zone D2).
 
3.  Country rock above the hanging wall, between the upper ore zone/country rock interface and about 5-6 m above it (referred here in as Zone D3).
 
4.  Country rock below the foot wall, from 5-6 m to 50-60 m below the lower ore zone/country rock interface (referred here in as Zone D4).

§  Mechanized cut and fill mining method (man entry) for ore body dipping less than 45-50° or at steeper angles when the hanging wall of the stope is weak.
§  Transverse stoping for wide areas of the orebody.
§  EBA QA/QC all the core logs provided by Silver Crest. Three of the core logs were already retrieved on site on September 5th and 6th, 2012. It was found
that the RQD values were lower than the actual values. This can be attributed to the fact that the core boxes were only 60 cm in length. The driller’s off-
sider had to break the core in order to enable the core to fit in the boxes. EBA corrected the RQD values before processing the data for the purpose of the
pre-feasibilty report.

the 16 drill holes are presented in the Table 8.
Geological and geotechnical logging of the drill holes listed in the Table 8.  This work was conducted by Silver Crest’s mine geologist prior to splitting the
core. The geotechnical logging includes collection of geotechnical parameters to estimate the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system (Bieniawski 1976) and the
Norwegian Geotechnical Institute’s NGI Q-System (after Barton et al. 1974). EBA undertook QA/QC of the rock core during site visits at the Santa Elena
project. During this process, EBA reviewed (QA/QC) the geotechnical logs against the core photos and made corrections where appropriate.

6.2.2  
 
During the core logging in 2012, samples of the core were collected to provide specimens for geotechnical laboratory testing for Uniaxial Compressive
Strength, Direct Shear Testing, Brazilian tensile strength testing and point load testing (PLT). The results of these tests (except for direct shear tests) have
been made available to EBA. The UCS tests did not include strain measurement data.
 
6.3  
 
EBA  evaluated  the  rock  mass  quality  using  the  NGI-Q  and  RMR  systems  for  the  16  drill  holes  listed  in  Table  8.  For  this  purpose,  EBA  processed  the
geotechnical logs in raw spread sheets.
 
The rock mass was subdivided into five geotechnically distinct zones as described in Section 6.1. Summaries of the rock mass properties are presented in
the back of this memo in the following tables:

In addition to the tables listed above, the following figures serve to summarize the rock mass properties at the proposed underground location:

§  Figures 12 through 16 – Plots showing the cumulative percentage of the RMR76 and NGI-Q for each of the five zones described in Section 6.1.
 
In summary based on the tables and figures above, the following is interpreted for each of the five zones:
 
§  At the ore zone (referred herein as Zone D1) – The rock quality of this zone is mainly rated as (i) fair to good rock based on the RMR rating classification
system and (ii) fair to extremely good rock above El. 580 m and poor to very good rock below El. 580 according to the Q rating classification system.
§  Country rock above the hanging wall, from 5-6 m to 50-60 m above the upper ore zone/country rock interface (referred here in as Zone D2) – The rock
quality of this zone is mainly rated as (i) fair to good rock based on the RMR rating classification system and (ii) poor to good rock according to the Q rating
classification system.
§  Country rock above the hanging wall, between the upper ore zone/country rock interface and about 5 6 m above it (referred here in as Zone D3) – The rock
quality of this zone is rated as (i) poor to good rock above El. 580 and fair to good rock below El. 580 m according to the RMR rating classification system
and (ii) poor to very good rock according to the Q rating classification system.
§  Country rock below the foot wall, from 5-6 m to 50-60 m below the lower ore zone/country rock interface (referred here in as Zone D4) – The rock quality of
this  zone  is  rated  as  (i)  fair  to  good  rock  according  to  the  RMR  rating  classification  system  and  (ii)  poor  to  very  good  rock  according  to  the  Q  rating
classification system.
§  Country rock below the foot wall, between the lower ore zone/country rock interface and about 5-6 m below it (referred here in as Zone D5) – The rock
quality of this zone is rated as (i) fair to good rock according to the RMR rating classification system and (ii) poor to very good rock according to the Q rating

Figures 12 through 16 present plots of the cumulative percentage distributions of the NGI-Q and RMR values. The cumulative percentage distribution plots
provide the means of progressively estimating the likelihood that an RMR or NGI-Q value will be equaled or exceeded. For this preliminary prefeasibility
design the NGI-Q and RMR values at 50% were chosen. It should be understood that the design values at 50% could be over conservative for some areas of
the mine where the actual NGI-Q and RMR values are considerably higher, and therefore would not likely be the most economical option, or may not work
 
(i.e.  unstable)  for  areas  of  the  mine  where  the  NGI-Q  and  RMR  values  are  considerably  lower.  The  purpose  of  adopting  the  50%  design  values  for
prefeasibility  design  is  to  provide  stope  dimension  and  reinforcement  that  are  not  too  conservative  or  too  optimistic,  and  therefore  serve  for  economic
estimation purposes.

holes where potential faults were encountered.
In addition to this assessment set out in Table 13, NGI-Q values were assessed specifically for the 655 Level. Core runs were isolated over a 45m run length
at this level to give an individual rock mass characterization for stoping at this level. NGI-Q values of 15 and 6 were calculated for zones D1 and D3 for
stopes at this level.
 
From  core  logging  during  the  2012  drilling  program  it  would  appear  that  the  rock  mass  quality  is  degrading  with  depth.  However,  from  footwall  cores
summarized in Table 6 (2011 drill holes), the rock mass quality is good and relatively consistent with depth. This degradation in rock mass quality needs
investigating further as it impacts on the recommended stope dimensions below the 580 level. There is concern that due to limited drilling, rock mass quality
and hence stope lengths are being underestimated here.
 
It is recommended that further drilling be conducted underground during development of the current 655 Level in order to build on drilling data and resolve
this issue in a timely manner. Drilling could be conducted in remuck bays driven into the hangingwall side of the stope access to avoid extra exploration
development and drilled to depth below the 580 Level to obtain NGI-Q values for the hangingwall and orebody. This program could be combined with
exploration drilling to further define the orebody at depth. Geotechnical mapping of the ramps and current orebody and hangingwall exposure at the 655
Level is also recommended in order to correlate mapped NGI-Q values to core logging data.
 
6.4.2  
 
The uniaxial laboratory compressive results submitted an average value of 71 MPa which appears to be low for the intact material of the site – refer to
Appendix A.
 
The average orebody strength from UCS testing at Sonora University was 72MPa. Point load testing from Sonora indicated an average equivalent UCS of
136MPa. Average Brazilian tests at Sonora indicated a tensile strength of 10 MPa in the orebody. Typical tensile strengths in rock are approximately 10% of
the UCS value. An initial estimate of orebody UCS strength was taken as 100MPa.
 
From core sent to EBA from Santa Elena four samples were deemed suitable for UCS testing and three samples for Brazilian testing. These were sent to
UBC in Vancouver for appropriate testing. See Appendix A for UCS and Brazilian test results from Sonora University, Mexico and UBC, Vancouver.
 
Two UCS samples from the orebody were tested at UBC, Vancouver with an average strength result of 87MPa. These samples are from the same drill hole
SE-13-145 and tie in closely with the average UCS result of 81MPa from drill hole SE-13-145 conducted at Sonora University. It was decided to weight the
orebody UCS in favour of Sonora UCS values. The UCS orebody strength was subsequently revised to a value of 87MPa.

The  strength  of  the  hangingwall  for  the  prefeasibility  analysis  is  taken  as  92MPa.  This  is  based  on  the  average  point  load  testing  data  from  Sonora
University. Three UCS tests were carried out in hangingwall material at Sonora giving an average of 95MPa which ties in closely with the PLT results. UCS
testing of Andesite at UBC indicated a strength of 199 MPa however, it should be noted that this is only based on one result.
 
The strength results obtained so far for the orebody appear to be low for a quartzite rock type. This could be due to local rock conditions or the presence of
micro fracturing in the samples taken due to extraction from the in-situ stress regime.
 
It  is  strongly  recommended  that  tri-axial  testing  be  carried  out  on  hangingwall,  footwall  and  ore  samples  together  with  further  UCS  testing  with  strain
measurements  in  order  to  determine  site  specific  strength  and  deformation  characteristics  of  the  rock  types  at  Santa  Elena  for  inclusion  into  future
geotechnical modelling of the mine for stope and pillar design refinement. See Section 9.0-Recommendations.
 
As UCS results from Sonora University tie in closely with the limited number of test carried out at UBC it is recommended that 80% of future testing be carried
out at Sonora University, Mexico and 20% at UBC, Vancouver as a reference check.

6.5.1  
 
The design approach presented in this report consisted of empirical and analytical methods using the rock mass quality approach. In this respect, it should
be noted that as with all the empirical methods, assumptions should be validated once mining starts by comparing actual with anticipated results.  Below is
presented the empirical method used for the assessment.
 
6.5.2  
 
The  stability  graph  method  (developed  by  Mathews  et  al.  (1981)  and  modified  by  Potvin  (1988)  and  Nickson  (1992)  is  widely  used  by  designers  to
qualitatively assess the stability of open stopes. The stability number N is calculated from selected geotechnical factors as described below to give an
associated hydraulic radius from the stability graph for two cases of stable with support and stable without support utilizing the following formulae.

The stability number N is defined as:
 
N = Q' x A x B x
C
 
Where A is the stress factor (ratio of intact rock strength to induced stress), B is rock defect orientation factor, and C is the gravity factor related to orientation
of design surface.
 
The underground design at this stage of the analysis is deemed to be governed by the stability of the hanging wall and stope back surfaces.  The following
steps were taken to calculate N values for each level:
 
§  Q’: From an initial assessment of Q’-Values, two lithology dependent domains “Waste Rock” of the hangingwall immediately above the ore zone (D1) and
“Mineralized Zone” (D1) were initially identified for stope design considerations. It was also found from the geotechnical assessment of the borehole data
that these domains can be sub-divided into two portions of “above 580 m elevation”, and “below 580 m elevation”. Table 14 shows the Q’ associated with
these four domains at 50% level of cumulative frequency. In addition to this NGI-Q values were assessed for the 655 Level. Core runs were isolated over a
45m run length at this level to give an individual rock mass characterization for stoping at this level. NGI-Q values of 15 and 6 were calculated for zones
D1 and D3 for stopes at this level.

§  Factor A: Induced stresses were estimated at the back and hanging-wall of the stope using boundary element computer program Examine 2D.
 
-  Uniaxial compressive strength of the ore and waste material was considered as 87MPa and 92 MPa, respectively.
 
-  Four cases 7 m, 12 m, 17 m, and 22 m for the span width were analyzed in examine 2D, considering the variation of ore width at each level (with four
classes of ore thickness: 0 m to 10 m, 10 m to 15 m, 15 m to 20 m, and greater than 20 m). The average back and hangingwall span stress at each level
was taken for calculation of the A factor.
§  Factor B: From review of the GEMS model, the mineralized vein was subdivided into three sub-domains “West”, “Centre” and “East” with dip and strike of
55°/90°, 62°/72°, and 47°/90°, respectively.
In the case of stope length design, the joint set J5 with the orientation of 79°/178° was found to have the greatest impact in the western and central stopes
while the joint set J4 with the orientation of 63°/168° is the most influencing discontinuity set when the hanging-wall is entirely located in the waste material.
However, when the ore material contacts the hanging-wall (i.e. when the low grade ore is the barrier between the mined-out span and the waste material),
the discontinuity set J1 with the orientation of 43°/222° is the most influencing factor on instability of the eastern and western stopes. The joint set J4 with the
orientation of 81°/133° is the dominating factor in central stopes within mineralized vein material.
 
The associated B factors derived from the available empirical chart for the two scenarios of hanging-walls are presented in Table 15.

The following key mining parameters / assumptions were used as the basis of the initial stope design:
Span Length Design
§  Non-man entry to production level.
§  With an initial assessment of the effect of both hanging wall and the stope back it was found that the hanging wall effect will govern the stope size.
Therefore, the hanging wall effect was considered throughout the design process.
§  Height of stopes = 45 m; width of stope dependent on ore body; length of stope dependent on acceptable sloughage limits of 15%. The stope length was
refined when the sloughage level exceeded 15% to fall within acceptable sloughage limits.
§  Seven levels were considered for stress analysis and underground stope design (including stope length, back length, sill pillar thickness, and rib pillar
width as well as crown pillar thickness). These levels were named as the elevation of the bottom line of the stope considering the recommended sill
thickness and the stope height of 45 m.
§  Cable bolted stopes and stable stope spans were assessed, where deemed necessary.
§  Two scenarios were considered for stope length design: When the hanging wall is excavated in waste rock, and when mineralized vein is left in place as
part of the hanging wall.
§  Stope widths of 7 m, 12 m, 17 m and 22 m were considered.
Sloughage was considered using the ELOS graph developed by Clark and Pakalnis (1997). This seeks to quantify the degree of dilution anticipated for a
given span length and corresponding shape factor.
 
It must be noted that this graph was developed for weak rock masses. There is no measure of time dependent behaviour but nevertheless this approach
provides an indication as to predicted dilution at this stage and should be used in conjunction with observational data during mining. Acceptable sloughage
levels of 15% or less were also calculated for stope design utilizing the ELOS criteria for the stability graph after Clark and Pakalnis (1997).

The predicted hydraulic radius with acceptable sloughage can then be utilized to back-calculate the maximum span for the surface being analyzed with a
given design stope height.
 
Tables 17 to 23 show the stope configuration summaries for each level. They indicate a stable span without support, a stable span with support and a
measure of anticipated dilution with greater span lengths. The recommended cablebolt pattern is 5 cables per ring every 2.2 m in stope sublevels. Dilution
levels for span lengths greater than those recommended in the stability graph method are indicative only and it is strongly recommended that a site based
dilution data base be established to monitor sloughage based on stope spans and rockmass quality.
 
6.7  
 
The stability graph method was utilized for designing the “stable” back length similar to hangingwall stope length design. It can be seen in Tables 17 - 23 that
the hangingwall stability is the overall controlling factor for stope stability.
 
At this prefeasibility stage it may be advisable to consider supporting stope backs with cablebolts at the 536 Level and below due to stress effects. However,
the magnitude and orientation of the in-situ stress regime is recommended beyond prefeasibility level to verify stress effects on the mine openings.
 
6.8  
 
The dimensions for the cut and fill mining method were estimated using the span design curve (Lang, 1994).
Stope Back Width Design
Cut and Fill
A maximum span of 15 m is recommended in current cut and fill mining levels. The spans refer to spans which may not require intensive ground support
such as timber sets, cable bolts or post pillars, but still requires local support within the immediate back to confine potential blocks (loose) which may open
due to nearby blasting and/or redistribution caused by subsequent mining activity. 2 m x 2 m pattern bolting is recommended in slashed stopes with spans
less than these stable back span figures. Due to the nature of the orebody, spans will vary across levels and also in individual stopes. An assessment of the
need of support required for individual stopes needs to be undertaken at a stage beyond the scope of this prefeasibility study.
 
With a 5 m cut and a maximum stope length of 100 m dilution from blast damage only along the hangingwall should be expected.
 
A value of Jw=1 was assigned in calculating Q as was an SRF of 1 as described in Section 2.6.2.
 
6.9  
 
With reference to Table 24 assuming a 20 m stope width and a maximum length of 30 m the stope back should remain stable. Loose from the stope back
may be created during the last 10 m of stope production at 471 and 536 Level. Timely mucking and backfill placement is recommended. Stope sidewalls
should remain stable. Expect a maximum dilution of 7% from hangingwall sloughage at the 471 and 536 Levels. However, as the hangingwall forms the
stope end, dilution will be dependent upon the speed at which the stope is blasted and mucked. If low grade mineralized vein forms the hangingwall then
expect blast damage only.

7.0  
 
7.1  
 
Horizontal (sill) pillars were assessed by means of Rocscience Examine 2D software program and by an empirical failure criterion (Hoek and Brown, 2002).
 
The strength of the sill rock mass depends on the compressive strength of the rock mass material as well as the shape factor of the sill, i.e. ore width and sill
thickness, while the sill thickness is being designed. Sill stress depends on the depth and the sill thickness and the width of the opening. For pre-feasibilty
purposes, sill stress was estimated in Examine 2D in four cases of stope width 7 m, 12 m, 17 m, and 22 m.
 
As maximum sill pillar stress is acting in the horizontal direction the ‘width’ of the pillar is its thickness and its ‘height’ corresponds to the orebody width. A
constant sill pillar thickness was taken across the entire mining level for practical mining purposes. This constant thickness corresponds to the maximum ore
width analyzed. Additionally blast damage of 1 m was also assumed on each side of the pillar.
 
For two dimensional analysis brittle Hoek Brown parameters were utilized for sill pillar design as the GSI values for the ore vary between 65 to 74 based on
converted modified Q’ values for the ore body, Maybee (2000).
 
Figure 17 shows the pillar stability chart used for the analysis. Average pillar stress was obtained using the RocScience Examine 2D software package with
sill pillar width reduced by 2 m at each level due to blast damage consideration.
 
Table 25 shows the corresponding sill thickness stability above each mine level with the greatest ore span considered having the most effect on stability due
to the ratio of width to height.

This analysis assumes a constant ore width along ore strike and that the rockmass is homogenous and isotropic. In analyzing pillar design a K stress ratio of
one was taken at prefeasibility level. The actual in-situ stress ratio, its inclination and its variation with depth needs to be determined beyond prefeasibility
level.
 
As the orebody varies significantly in thickness, strike and dip, both along ore strike and down dip, a three dimensional analysis of stope and pillar design is
recommended as are stress measurements at Santa Elena. See Section 9 - Recommendations.
 
7.2  
 
Underground mining will result in a temporary surface crown pillar below the open pit, as well as permanent crown pillars in some areas. The minimum
thickness for crown pillar design was assessed as 25 m using the empirical crown pillar stability graph (Carter, 1990) taking a typical Q value of 11.6 for the
ore at near surface stress conditions. The maximum span of the orebody was taken as 25 m giving a thickness / span ratio of 1.
 
7.3  
 
Rib pillar widths have been assessed based on two dimensional analysis utilizing brittle Hoek Brown parameters and the pillar stability chart as used for sill
pillar analysis.
 
For two dimensional modelling a horizontal cross section was taken across the pillar midpoint in order to incorporate the pillar shape factor in the stress
analysis. A constant in-situ stress field dependent on depth was imposed onto the cross section.
 
For efficiency purposes at the stage of prefeasibility level the rib pillar widths were modelled at the mid-point of the mine at 536 level. EBA modeled five
“fixed” stope span length classes of 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 m. An average pillar height of 56m was used during the analysis based on average dip of the
orebody across the West, Central and East domains. Pillar results are shown in Table 26. Stress analysis was conducted on a pillar width less 2 m of final
pillar width to take into consideration pillar blast damage.

These numbers are considered as an initial estimation of rib width at PFS level at mine mid-point. Pillar widths are likely to be reduced at shallower levels
and increased at lower levels. However, in order to define pillar widths on a mine wide scale, as the orebody varies significantly in thickness, strike and dip,
both along strike and down dip, it is advised that the in-situ stress ratio, its inclination and its variation with depth be determined beyond prefeasibility level
along with site specific strength, deformation and Hoek-Brown characteristics of the rock mass. Tri-axial and UCS testing with strain are recommended along
with shear strength testing in order to determine site specific strength and deformation characteristics.
 
A  three  dimensional  analysis  of  stope  and  pillar  design  is  recommended  once  site  specific  in-situ  stress  and  rock  mass  deformation  and  Hoek-Brown
characteristics have been determined. This will enable rib and sill widths to be refined at each level and stope boundary beyond pre-feasibilty level in order
to maximize ore extraction. Extraction of rib pillars for longhole, cut and fill and transverse mining methods have not been considered at this level and require
further investigation for mining sequencing and backfill operations. See Section 9.0 - Recommendations.
 
8.0  
 
Tables 17 to 23 present show the stope configuration summaries for each level for longitudinal and cut and fill mining. They indicate a stable span without
support, a stable span with support and a measure of anticipated dilution with greater span lengths on stope surfaces in hangingwall “waste” and stope
surfaces where the hangingwall is in low grade “mineralized vein”. Effective cablebolt support has been taken into consideration when designing maximum
span lengths for stable spans with support. Stope backs are considered in ore. Maximum critical back spans are listed for cut and fill mining. The stope
design summary tables 17 to 23 present the results of the analysis with respect to the rectangular stope design. They are split into West, Central and East
locations at each level dependent on average strike and dip of the orebody.
 
These charts are meant for general design purposes only at prefeasibility stage as the stope spans assume continuous average width, strike and dip profiles.
As such a maximum span of 120 m has been applied to the tables. As actual stopes will vary in width, strike and dip along their span further geotechnical
STOPE DESIGN SUMMARY TABLES
study of individual stopes is advised beyond prefeasibility level.
 
Dilution levels for span lengths greater than those recommended from Potvin’s method are indicative only and it is strongly recommended that a site based
dilution data base be established to monitor sloughage based on stope spans and rockmass quality. Further rockmass classification through mapping and
logging can assist in defining stope dimensions to a higher level of detail.

Actual stope and pillar performance should be consistently monitored during mining. This will allow for any modifications of initial design to be made based
on actual mining of the orebody.
 
9.0  
 
Recommendations are split into three sections for the pre-feasibilty report:
RECOMMENDATIONS
§  Key recommendations to improve stope size and refine pillar dimensions;
§  Geotechnical considerations in overall mine design; and
§  General recommendations.
Stope Size and Pillar Dimensioning
9.1  
 
The key factors governing stope size at Santa Elena are:
§  Hangingwall and orebody NGI-Q values;
§  Joint set orientation;
§  In-situ stress regime; and
§  Hangingwall and orebody strength and deformation characteristics.
Hangingwall and orebody NGI-Q Values
9.1.1  
 
§  Due  to  the  apparent  degradation  of  rock  mass  quality  with  depth  in  the  2012  drilling  program  it  is  recommended  that  further  drilling  be  conducted
underground. This degradation could be due to limited availability of geotechnical data at present as footwall rock quality appears fairly consistent at
depth. This apparent degradation could create overly conservative stope design parameters and it is recommended that rockmass quality at depth requires
further clarification through a drilling program.
§  This drilling program could be undertaken during development of the current 655 Level in order to build on drilling data and resolve this issue in a timely
manner. Drilling could be conducted in remuck bays driven into the hangingwall side of the stope access to avoid extra exploration development and
drilled to depth below the 580 Level to obtain NGI-Q values for the hangingwall and orebody. This program could be combined with exploration drilling to
further define the orebody at depth. The use of a Televiewer and sonic probing down hole could provide a tool for accurate geotechnical data collection of
the in-situ undisturbed rock mass.
§  Geotechnical mapping of the ramps and current orebody and hangingwall exposure at the 655 Level is also recommended in order to correlate mapped
NGI-Q values to core logging data.
§  Silver Crest’s mine geologist recorded NGI-Q values during geological logging of exploratory boreholes in 2012. It is recommended to construct a NGI-Q
value data base and a 3D-NGI-Q value model using data from all the 2011 and 2012 exploration holes and underground mapping data. This could allow
for refinement of stope design by creating NGI-Q zones at a local level through the mine. Incorporation of observational data during actual mining will be
highly advantageous in refining initial design constraints.

§  Initial reports indicate that running water up to 450 gpm has been intersected within the orebody at the 625 Level. During ramp and ore development
reports indicate that any water makes intersected were pockets of water and had drained away naturally. The water make within the orebody needs to be
monitored in order to establish if a similar situation occurs here. If this water make is persistent this could have a negative impact on rock mass quality and
NGI-Q values and impact on stope dimensions and sloughage levels. The source of water needs to be established whether its drainage from the water
table or if it is artisanal which may be the case as the water temperature is at 30o Centigrade. Further exploratory work within the orebody would need to
be conducted in order to determine the continuation of the water make along strike and down dip and a de-watering program may be recommended in
order to improve on stability conditions within the orebody.
Joint Set Orientation
9.1.2  
 
Joint set orientation can play a key role in stope stability. The orientation data at Santa Elena is limited with six orientated holes gleaning a limited number of
measurements to gain joint set data for stope layout.
 
§  Further joint set measurements can be taken through consistent geotechnical mapping of the orezone and hangingwall during mining activities.
 
§  Further orientated boreholes can be undertaken during subsurface and surface exploration. During the 2012 surface drilling program a limited number of
joint orientation data was able to be retrieved. It is strongly recommended that the use of a Televiewer be incorporated into further data collection. This
allows for in-situ joint orientation data to be collected that will aid in stope definition.
§  The Televiewer is able to acquire 360o digital images of the borehole walls and therefore in-situ fractures and other defects along the borehole. As the
Televiewer  logs  the  hole  in-situ  it  provides  a  far  more  accurate  representation  of  actual  conditions  than  traditional  core  evaluation  which  has  been
disturbed from its in-situ state. The Televiewer can accurately provide structural orientation data for the borehole and can provide a means of QC/QA for
traditional orientated boreholes. It can also provide valuable structural data in jointed zones where core has returned broken or lost.
§  The  Televiewer  can  be  used  in  the  orientated  exploration  boreholes  for  accurate  QA/QC  correlation  and  subsequently  be  used  in  non-orientated
boreholes where gaps in orientation data have been highlighted without the additional expense and time for further orientated drilling.
In-situ Stress Regime
9.1.3  
 
The in-situ stress regime at Santa Elena needs clarification as the stress regime has been assumed at pre-feasibility level.
 
§  It is strongly advised that in-situ stress analysis be conducted at Santa Elena in order to determine principal stress magnitude and trajectory and horizontal
to vertical stress ratio. This should be done in order to maximize ore extraction, minimize pillar dimensions, assist in pillar recovery design and minimize
support cost to local rather than regional zones based on the in-situ stress regime. EBA can assist in developing a cost effective stress measurement
program in conjunction with Silver Crest for this purpose.

Hangingwall and Orebody Strength and Deformation Characteristics
9.1.4  
 
Clarification of hangingwall and orebody strength characteristics is recommended beyond pre-feasibility level as there is concern that the UCS strength
results that have been returned so far are relatively low for the general rock types encountered.
 
§  In addition to simple UCS strengths for the footwall, hangingwall and orebody the Hoek-Brown parameters and deformation characteristics need to be
determined for the rock conditions found at Santa Elena in order to refine stope and pillar design to a higher degree of accuracy beyond pre-feasibilty
level.
§  It is strongly recommended that tri-axial testing be carried out on hangingwall, footwall and ore samples together with further UCS testing with strain
measurements  in  order  to  determine  site  specific  strength  and  deformation  characteristics  of  the  rock  types  at  Santa  Elena  for  inclusion  into  future
geotechnical modelling of the mine and for stope and pillar refinement. It is recommended that 80% of future testing be carried out at Sonora University,
Mexico and 20% at UBC, Vancouver as a reference check.
Geotechnical Considerations in Overall Mine Design
9.2  
 
§  As  the  orebody  varies  greatly  in  dip  and  dip  direction  and  thickness,  both  along  strike  and  down  dip,  it  is  strongly  advised  that  three  dimensional
geotechnical analysis be conducted on the orebody once the stress regime and rock deformation characteristics have been determined. This can be
highly advantageous to mine sequencing, backfill addition and pillar recovery in order to further maximise ore extraction.
§  It is recommended to space rib pillars across levels so as to avoid stacking of pillars. This will minimize the creation and effect of tall slender pillars on the
overall mine wide excavation.
§  Since the ground conditions are not consistently uniform throughout the ore body, it is recommended that in further stages (beyond prefeasibility level) the
site be subdivided into detailed geotechnical domains, as rock mass characteristics are further defined through drilling, mapping and actual stope dilution
data. This will enable in-depth geotechnical analysis to be conducted to maximize ore recovery from stope and pillar dimensioning on a stope by stope
basis,  where  each  domain  is  represented  by  a  Q’  value.  Stability  within  a  domain  could  be  selected  to  ensure  that  approximately  80  %  (or  other
percentage) of the stopes are stable, and the remaining 20% or so can then be dealt with individually using specific ground support or different extraction
strategies.
§  This prefeasibility study does not consider the interaction between the pit and the proposed underground stopes. This should be reviewed once stoping
outlines have been defined for feasibility or design stages.

General Recommendations
9.3  
 
§  Both the Contractor undertaking the work and a representative from SilverCrest should carry out joint geological and geotechnical mapping of the face and
sidewalls of each round of excavation. The representatives, in coordination with the miners, should also agree on the type of support class, and the NGI Q-
value. The record could also be used to assess whether geological overbreak has occurred. The actual quantity of overbreak should be based on survey
profile records.
§  A tape extensometer should be routinely used by the mine geotechnical department to measure deformation near the face, at intersections and especially
within poor ground conditions. These measurements can be used to back calculate the stress conditions and will prove very useful for detailed mine
design.
§  The  ability  to  spray  shotcrete  quickly  and  efficiently  from  the  top  of  a  muck  pile  (at  short  notice)  is  considered  a  necessity.  If  poor  ground  is  struck,
stabilizing the face and sidewalls is vital to control the ground and maintain the safety and integrity of the works.
§  Careful records should be made of groundwater inflow being pumped out of the ramp during excavation. Accurate flow meters should be installed at the
ramp  portal  to  measure  both  water  inflow  and  outflow;  the  difference  shows  the  quantity  of  groundwater  inflow.  Also,  during  daily  geological  and
geotechnical mapping, records should be kept of any localized water makes and the volume of ingress. The records should also indicate if the inflow is
structurally controlled and the structure orientation and dip direction and whether the water flow declines over time. These records will be invaluable when
assessing the macro hydro-geological conditions within the mine.
§  The  performance  of  the  support  recommended  in  this  report  should  be  evaluated.  The  evaluation  should  be  based  on  instrumentation  as  well  as
observations made within the ramp. Refinement of the recommended support should occur based on these evaluations and on site assessments.

3 year trailing average gold price and silver price as of 30 April 2013 has been used as reference and deducted to $1450
Capital costs relating to the expansion plan are included as of Apil 30th 2013, and production is considered to be all production relating to the processing
plant from commissioning in January 2014
No inflation of costs or revenues has been used in the model
Revenues are only calculated on gold equivalent grades
Contractor development and haulage of ore has been considered
Contractor development will continue to year 2 during which a jumbo will be purchased to do ongoing development
Ore haulage by contractor has been included for life of mine
Contractor development rates are estimated at $3,000/m based on Santa Elena cost information for contractor
In house development is estimated at $1,950/m based on Costmine and cost models - EBA expects that SE will purchase a jumbo in year 3 and after that the
development cost will be an average of $3000 and $900/m
Conventional Raise development costs are estimated at $1300/m, based on costmine, Santa Elena numbers which show a range from $417 to $1700 for
raise development
Raise boring is estimated at $2,104 /m
Mining costs are based on cost modelling
G and A costs are based on Santa Elena financial reports
Contingencies on capital
