<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth 
session from 22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of Ukraine was held at the 5th 
meeting on 24 October 2012. The delegation of Ukraine was headed by Nazar Kulchytskyy, 
the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights, Ministry of Justice of 
Ukraine. At its 9th meeting held on 29 October 2012, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Ukraine. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Ukraine: Cameroon, Saudi Arabia and 
Ecuador. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued 
for the review of Ukraine: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/UKR/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/UKR/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/UKR/3 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Mexico, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Ukraine through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that the national report was drafted in the spirit of openness  
involving public discussions and that it reflected the actions taken for the implementation of 
the recommendations of the first cycle of the UPR and progress documented in this respect. 
Among various steps taken to ensure human rights protection, the delegation highlighted 
the judicial reform, and the adoption of new anti-discrimination legislation and a 
comprehensive criminal procedure. All reforms had the common goal of promoting the 
principle of the rule of law and enhancing the guarantees of human rights protection. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation reported on the launch of the criminal justice reform. In the 
framework of this reform, the new Code of Criminal Procedure and the Law on the Bar and 
Bar Associations were adopted and adoption of a draft Law on the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and 
reform of the judiciary are in progess. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation explained that the new Criminal Procedure Code prescribed bail and 
home arrest as the main preventive measures, with detention as an extraordinary preventive 
measure. When examining requests on detention, the courts should verify the existence of 
well-founded reasons for detention, and when reviewing preventive measures, the courts 
should evaluate the persistence of the risks representing the grounds for detention and the </p>


<p>measures taken by the law-enforcement authorities to eliminate such risks. Thus, the above 
mentioned requirements were expected to resolve the problem of unreasoned and extensive 
detention and overcrowding in pretrial detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>8. As to the guarantees of a fair trial, the new Code would effectively regulate the 
procedure for obtaining evidence in proceedings. Furthermore, the institution of an 
investigative judge was introduced to exercise judicial control over pretrial investigations. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that according to the new Code, evidence should be considered 
inadmissible, if obtained, inter alia, as a result of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or threats of such treatment, with violation of the person&#8217;s right to defence. The 
provisions on admissibility of evidence were considered important since in most cases, law- 
enforcement authorities violated human rights in order to obtain evidence that would 
subsequently be used during proceedings. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that the new Code would also resolve the problem of 
ineffective investigation into complaints of ill-treatment and deprivation of life. According 
to the European Court of Human Rights, the main reason for ineffective investigation is 
conflict of interest, since the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office serve as investigative, controlling and 
prosecuting body. Under the new Code, the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office would be the investigative 
body only in cases concerning judges, high-ranking officials and law-enforcement officers. 
In addition, law-enforcement bodies are obliged to register cases and initiate the 
investigation as soon as a complaint is received. The delegation expressed its belief that 
those provisions would eliminate conflict of interest and increase the effectiveness of 
investigations into complaints of ill-treatment and deprivation of life. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation reported on the judicial reform which was launched by the adoption 
of the Law on the Judicial System and Status of Judges. Subsequently, a set of laws was 
adopted with the aim of improving the judicial system and administration of justice. Once 
the reform is completed, judges would be selected through a transparent and competitive 
process that includes a qualification examination. The composition of the High Council of 
Justice, empowered to impose disciplinary sanctions and to dismiss judges, was reformed to 
guarantee judicial independence. Of the 18 members of the Council, 11 must be judges. 
Prosecutors, who are the members of the Council, cannot initiate disciplinary proceedings 
against a judge on cases to which the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is a party. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation stated that a Law on Legal Aid was adopted in 2011, which defines 
the grounds and procedures for granting legal aid. Until the end of 2012, there would be 27 
centres providing free legal aid in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the regions, and the 
cities of Kyiv and Sevastopol. The Government plans to set up an additional 67 centres 
throughout the country over the next two years. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation also reported on the progress made in establishing the national 
preventive mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT) by amending the 
Law on the Parliamentary Human Rights Commissioner and creating a legal basis for the 
Ombudsman Plus model of the national preventive mechanism. As a result of those 
amendments, a special department within the structure of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office was 
established and an Ombudsman representative on this issue was designated. Additionally, 
an action plan for the effective functioning of the national preventive mechanism was 
developed in 2012. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that all the reforms mentioned, that were carried out over the 
past years, had the common goal of promoting the rule of law and ensuring that human 
rights violations would not remain unpunished. </p>

Court (ICC). Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Regarding the questions on anti-discrimination measures, the delegation noted the 
adoption of a law on preventing and combating discrimination which defines 
discrimination, identifies entities empowered to combat discrimination, and in particular 
grants the Ombudsman additional powers to address discrimination. 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, the delegation stated that, 
under the new concept of its migration policy, combating racism and xenophobia, including </p>


<p>against migrants, was a strategic priority of the Government. Awareness-raising measures, 
among other preventive measures, has been taken to educate the public about cultural and 
traditional specificities of the different migrant groups. 
</p>
<p>36. Furthermore, since April 2012, a national plan was implemented to mold and 
promote a culture of tolerance in society, which comprises a range of preventive measures, 
including awareness-raising and educational measures, social dialogue and cooperation 
with civil society organizations on those matters. The plan was developed based on practice 
and recommendations of international organizations to help to reduce the number of racist 
incidents. The delegation stated that in 2009, amendments had also been made to the 
Criminal Code in order to take into account racist and religious motives behind crimes, 
which would be considered as an aggravating factor in sentencing. 
</p>
<p>37. The delegation noted that Ukraine has made progress in improving legislation to 
ensure equal rights for women and men. However, despite this progress, discriminatory acts 
still occur. A draft law was submitted to Parliament to further improve legislation with a 
view to ensuring equal opportunities for women and men in general, and in particular, equal 
gender representation in central and local government. The delegation explained that under 
the draft law, complaints concerning discrimination in this area could be submitted to the 
Ombudsman, law-enforcement bodies and the courts. 
</p>
<p>38. Special attention was paid in the draft law to addressing gender bias and 
stereotyping in advertising. Additionally, the Expert Council, which is responsible for 
reviewing cases of gender discrimination, has been working to address stereotypes 
regarding gender roles of women and men in advertising. The Government has developed 
and adopted standards for non-discriminatory advertising in close cooperation with public 
associations and the main players in the advertising industry. 
</p>
<p>39. Ukraine paid particular attention to preventing and combating domestic violence, in 
particular against children. Measures have been taken to shape the culture of society and  
denounce domestic violence as a conflict-solving tool in families, improve legislation and 
mechanisms in this area and build the capacity of institutions that work to assist victims, 
and the enhance the effectiveness of law-enforcement entities and the courts in addressing 
domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>40. The delegation stated that the Government was in the process of drafting 
amendments to the Law on Domestic Violence in order to improve the legal definition of 
domestic violence, broaden its scope and to ensure more effective protection of victims. 
The Government had also adopted a plan of measures in 2012 to conduct a national 
campaign against domestic violence. Social service centres for families worked in all the 
regions to provide psychological, medical, informational and legal support to victims, in 
addition to services provided by support and hotlines services for children. The delegation 
highlighted Ukraine&#8217;s readiness to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing 
and combating violence against women and domestic violence. For this purpose, the 
Government carried out a thorough study of the national legislation in view of the 
Convention and a working group was established to draft amendments, based on the 
findings of the study, to bring its legislation in conformity with the Convention. 
</p>
<p>41. With regard to questions concerning mass media and access to information, the 
delegation mentioned the recent adoption of a Law on Access to Public Information and 
amendments to other laws regarding access to information. Individuals and legal entities 
could now request and receive public information promptly and effectively, including on 
the work of the central and local government. The Government has initiated the process to  
establish public television and radio. Since 2011, an inter-agency working group, which 
also comprises representatives of civil society, was set up to study legislation on freedom of </p>


<p>expression and protection of journalists, and propose recommendations for further 
improvement of the national legislation. 
</p>
<p>42. Regarding the work of the media during the election campaign, the delegation stated 
that measures had been adopted to examine issues affecting the work of journalists during 
this period. A monitoring centre had been established to support international election 
observers, and a telephone hotline had been set up for reporting violations during the 
elections. The delegation also noted that the existing statistics indicated that opposition 
candidates received more broadcasting time than the representatives of ruling party during 
the pre-election campaign.

<p>64. Regarding the protection of children&#8217;s rights, the delegation stated that the 
Government had implemented various measures to prevent the phenomena of so-called 
&#8220;social orphans,&#8221; by supporting families in general, and in particular families facing 
difficult social conditions. The State financial assistance for families with a new-born child 
has increased more than three times since 2008. The Government also implemented a 
financial support programme for families with young children to meet their housing needs. 
All those measures were incorporated into the new State social programme for families,  
adopted in 2012. 
</p>
<p>65. The delegation also reported on specific measures to assist families in difficult social 
conditions with the aim of preventing the separation of children from families for financial 
reasons. A national strategy to address the issue of social orphans was approved by 
Presidential decree in October 2012. The strategy adopts a comprehensive approach to 
preventing the separation of children from their families by, inter alia, addressing the 
financial problems of families at an early stage, by providing financial assistance. Social 
service centres for families, children and youth operate nationwide and carry out the main 
work required by the strategy. Several other support centres also operate, such as 
psychological support centres for families, centres for children deprived of family care and  
mother and  child support centres. The Institute for Social Workers was also established to 
train professional social workers. 
</p>
<p>66. The delegation stated that special assistance was provided to children temporary 
deprived of family care. Special rehabilitation centres provide psychological, social, 
educational and legal support to such children. Those centres work also with children who 
are victims of domestic violence. The number of such centres has doubled since 2005. 
</p>
<p>67. Moreover, the Government has worked to decrease the number of children in care 
institutions. In the past years, the number of children living in family-type institutions and 
in foster care has steadily increased. In 2010, over 70 per cent of orphans and children 
deprived of family care lived with foster families or in family-type institutions. The number </p>


<p>of children adopted by Ukrainian families has also increased. In 2012, the budget allocation 
for financial support to foster care and families with adopted children increased by 20 per 
cent compared to 2011. 
</p>
<p>68. The delegation reported that the amendments to the law on secondary education 
were adopted in 2010 to introduce inclusive education for children with special needs. 
Since 2011, the number of children with disabilities attending primary and secondary 
schools, vocational training institutions and universities has been increasing. New teaching 
materials have been developed and teacher training has been carried out for inclusive 
education. The remuneration of teachers working with children with special needs has 
increased. The Government plans to continue taking measures to improve inclusive 
education for children with special needs. 
</p>
<p>69. The delegation reported on the newly adopted law on minorities languages. The 
Government also identified the need to improve the main law on national minorities, which 
was adopted in 2001, and has therfore started drafting amendments to it. The Government 
also implemented various measures for the successful integration of Crimean Tatars who 
were deported from the territory of Ukraine in 1944 and who have returned over the past 
years. In particular, the Government supported the construction of housing for returned 
Crimean Tatar families. The schools were preparing to provide education in the Crimean 
Tatar language; and religious buildings have been returned to the minority community.

</p>
<p>89. The delegation reported on the establishment in 2012 of a special body responsible 
for the implementation of a State migration policy and the adoption of the Law on refugees 
and persons in need of complementary or temporary protection, which is aimed at 
improving national legislation in the light of international human rights standards. As a 
result, progress was documented in a number of areas, including a unified refugee status 
determination procedure, strengthened support for refugee families, special guarantees for 
asylum-seeking children and strengthened legal provisions to ensure the principle of non-
refoulement. Special measures were also adopted for unaccompanied asylum-seeking 
children and the integration of refugees in society. 
</p>
<p>90. The delegation reported on several measures undertaken to implement the 2011 Law 
on combating trafficking in persons. The Ministry of Social Policy has assumed the role of 
national coordinator for the work on preventing and combating human trafficking, in 
particular trafficking in children. The new comprehensive State social programme for 
preventing human trafficking was also adopted with the aim of improving State assistance 
to victims of trafficking victims and increasing public awareness on the issue. Social 
service centres for families and children serve as main bodies for providing medical, legal, 
psychological and material support to victims. Such centres operate in 20 regions and 
additional centres are planned for seven regions. 
</p>
<p>91. The delegation stated that unlike prisons, pretrial detention centres faced the 
problem of overcrowding. The construction of new buildings was among various measures 
undertaken to solve the problem of overcrowding. Implementation of those measures 
allowed the reduction in the population at the detention centres to be documented and 
ensured a living space of three square meters per inmate, with the goal of  ensuring four 
square meters per inmate in the near future. </p>


<p>92. The delegation also reported on various measures implemented to improve access to 
health care in the penitentiary system. In 2011, a large proportion of medical equipment in 
the medical establishments of the penitentiary system was modernized. Furthermore, the 
legal framework for access to medical services in prisons has been improved. As a result, if 
adequate medical assistance cannot be provided in the medical establishments of prisons, 
then the necessary medical assistance would be provided by the establishments of the 
Ministry of Health, based on the inter-agency agreement between the Ministry of Justice 
and Ministry of Health. Additionally, starting from 2012, a prisoner has the right to choose 
his/her doctor freely, including from among the medical personnel of the Ministry of 
Health. 
</p>
<p>93. The delegation also stated that a steady decrease in cases of tuberculosis in prisons 
has been documented in the past years. Each detainee or prisoner is entitled to take an HIV 
test on a voluntary basis and receive medical and psychological support. 
</p>
<p>94. The delegation highlighted that Ukraine had adopted a State programme to prevent 
and combat HIV/AIDS and established a State national council to coordinate the work in 
this area. Due to effective access to preventive measures, the mother- to -child transmission 
rate of HIV infection has significantly decreased.  Additionally, the antiretroviral treatment 
coverage has increased in 2012. 
</p>
<p>95. In respect to the ratification of the Rome Statute of the ICC, the delegation stated 
that Ukraine remained committed to the idea of the establishment of the international court. 
Ukraine was also demonstrated its full commitment in effective execution of judgments of 
the European Court of Human Rights of the Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>96. In conclusion, the delegation stated that the universal periodic review was an 
important opportunity for an objective evaluation of human rights situation in the country. 
The delegation expressed its appreciation for the participation of all delegates and for their 
questions, especially those provided in advance.
