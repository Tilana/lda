<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment undertook a visit to Nigeria from 4 to 10 March 2007. The visit included stops in 
Abuja, Lagos, Port Harcourt and Kaduna. He expresses his appreciation to the Government for 
the cooperation it extended to him. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomes Nigeria&#8217;s commitment to promoting respect for human 
rights, as demonstrated by, among other things, its record of cooperation with international 
human rights mechanisms and organizations. He appreciates the challenges the State faces given 
the sheer size and diversity of the population, including ethno-linguistic and religious groups, 
the plurality of legal systems, the nature of the federal structure, the high level of crime, 
widespread poverty (despite the potential enormous wealth from oil revenues), and the conflict 
in the Niger Delta. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of an analysis of the legal system, visits to detention facilities, interviews with 
detainees, the support of forensic medical evidence, and interviews with government officials, 
lawyers and representatives of NGOs, the Special Rapporteur concluded that torture and 
ill-treatment is widespread in police custody, and particularly systemic in the Criminal 
Investigation Departments. In a vivid first-hand account, the circumstances surrounding the 
deaths of the two persons personally interviewed by the Special Rapporteur - examples of 
serious torture, disappearance and extrajudicial killing - illustrate and confirm the inability of the 
current system to effectively investigate allegations, protect victims of serious human rights 
violations, and bring law enforcement officials in Nigeria to account. 
</p>
<p> The conditions of detention in police cells visited were appalling. All the prisons visited 
were characterized by severe overcrowding, consisting of an inmate population which is 
typically double or triple the actual capacity of the facility. The vast majority of detainees are 
held in detention awaiting trial or held without charge for lengthy periods, as long as 10 years. 
However, female prisoners are provided with considerably better facilities. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes that corporal punishment, such as caning, and including 
sharia penal code punishments of the northern states (i.e. amputation, flogging and stoning to 
death), remain lawful in Nigeria. He recalls that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to 
the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Under 
international law, they are not lawful sanctions and violate the international human rights treaties 
to which Nigeria is a party. 
</p>
<p> Noting that capital punishment is still available under the laws of Nigeria, the Special 
Rapporteur is encouraged by the policy of President Obasanjo not to carry out executions. 
However, he expresses concern that persons continue to be sentenced to death, contributing to 
the growing numbers of persons languishing on death row for many years in conditions that are 
inhuman. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4

</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomed the adoption of a number of State laws prohibiting 
discrimination against women in critical areas, such as female genital mutilation and early 
marriage. Despite such legislation, however, he remains concerned at the persistence of these 
practices and the social acceptance of them and the lack of effective mechanisms to enforce the 
existing prohibitions. 
</p>
<p> These findings are not new as many credible human rights organizations, as well as 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, have documented and concluded that torture is 
widespread in the country and that the conditions in detention are unacceptable. Nigerians 
themselves have exhaustively identified the nature and scale of these problems. Indeed, in 
August 2005 and again in a meeting with the Special Rapporteur on 21 May 2007, 
President Obasanjo clearly acknowledged the severity of the problem of torture in the country. 
 Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur recommends a number of measures to be adopted by 
the Government in order to comply with its commitment to prevent and suppress acts of torture 
and other forms of ill-treatment. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur was invited by the Government of Nigeria to undertake a visit to 
the country from 4 to 10 March 2007. The visit included stops in Abuja, Lagos, Port Harcourt 
and Kaduna. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with the President, the Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Controller General of Prisons, the Inspector General 
of Police, the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, the Solicitor General, the Chairman of 
the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Executive Secretary of the National 
Human Rights Commission, as well as with State Police Commissioners and Prison Controllers. 
On the last day of his visit he was also received by representatives of the State Security Services. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Abuja, 
Lagos, Port Harcourt and Kaduna and with representatives of the corporate sector. In addition, 
the Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations country team, including the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development 
Fund for Women (UNIFEM), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) and Word Health Organization (WHO), and the diplomatic corps in 
Abuja. 
</p><p>4. The purpose of the mission was twofold: to assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment 
in the country and to offer assistance to the Government in its efforts to improve the 
administration of justice, including the police and prison sector. The Special Rapporteur 
expresses his appreciation to the Government for the cooperation it extended to him during the 
visit. A primary focus of the visit was the inspection of detention facilities in the country and, in 
this regard, he expresses his appreciation to the Government for the respect of the terms of 
reference for the visit. In particular, he wishes to thank the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and 
the Controller General of Prisons (CGP) for opening up the prisons and police detention facilities 
to unannounced visits and permitting the Special Rapporteur to conduct private interviews with 
detainees. In Abuja, he visited Kuje Prison and the Force Criminal Investigation Department, 
Garki. In Lagos, he visited the Panti Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba. In Rivers State, 
visits were made to Port Harcourt Prison, the State Police Headquarters, the State Criminal 
Investigation Department and the Central Police Department. In Kaduna, he visited the 
Central Prison, the State Police Headquarters and the State Criminal Investigation Department 
and its Annex. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the State Security Service denied him access to their 
detention facilities on each of the three occasions he attempted to visit.<b>1 </b>This constitutes a 
serious breach of the terms of reference agreed upon by the Government. Since he received

</b>  For a description of the incidents, see appendix I, below. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>credible allegations of torture by this intelligence agency, the denial of his right to assess for 
himself the allegations by inspecting unannounced the facilities and interviewing detainees in 
private leads him to strongly suspect that the authorities wished to conceal evidence. 
</p>
<p>6. On 9 July 2007, a preliminary version of this report was sent to the Government. 
On 14 September the Nigerian Government provided comments, contained in appendix II of the 
present report.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge with appreciation the excellent support 
provided by the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Mr. Alberic Kacou, and his staff in the 
United Nations country team; the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR); Dr. Duarte Nuno Vieira, Director of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, 
Portugal; and Mr. Roland Schmidt and Ms. Isabelle Tschan, of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute 
of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Context and challenges in the promotion and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur welcomes Nigeria&#8217;s commitment to promoting respect for human 
rights, as demonstrated by, among other things, its democratic principles, the existence of a 
vibrant media, dedicated civil society organizations, membership of the Human Rights Council, 
and its record of cooperation with international human rights mechanisms and organizations. He 
appreciates the challenges the State faces given the sheer size and diversity of the population, 
including ethno-linguistic and religious groups, the plurality of legal systems, the nature of the 
federal structure, the high level of crime, widespread poverty and the conflict in the Niger Delta. 
</p>
<p><b>Niger Delta conflict 
</b></p>
<p>9. The increasing violence in the Niger Delta, with its roots in the Federal Government&#8217;s 
decades-long neglect and marginalization of people in the region, as well as the desperate 
poverty they face - despite the enormous oil revenues emanating from there - impacts upon the 
practice of torture and ill-treatment. The rise of serious violent crime and attacks by vigilante and 
criminal gangs against the local population and the oil companies operating there, and the 
resultant heavy response from security forces and police paid by oil companies,<b>2</b> invite 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Oil companies in Nigeria rely upon Nigerian security forces to provide security for their 
</p>
<p>business interests in the country. Under the Nigeria Police Act, which provides for the 
appointment of &#8220;supernumerary police&#8221;, these officers &#8220;shall be a member of the Force for all 
purposes&#8221; and are subject to the Act&#8217;s provisions on discipline. They provide payments to 
officers assigned for protection, which amount to premiums above their regular monthly salaries, 
as was affirmed to the Special Rapporteur by Shell Group representatives in Nigeria. See, for 
example, Human Rights Watch, <i>The Price of Oil: Corporate Responsibility and Human Rights 
Violations in Nigeria&#8217;s Oil Producing Communities</i>, 1999; and International Crisis Group, 
<i>The Swamps of Insurgency: Nigeria&#8217;s Delta Unrest</i>, Africa Report No. 115, August 2006. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>10. Nigeria is party to the major United Nations human rights treaties prohibiting torture and 
ill-treatment: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment (CAT); the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); and the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). 
</p>
<p>11. Nigeria is party to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and to the Additional Protocols I 
and II, and has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>12. Nigeria has not acceded to the first Optional Protocol to ICCPR and has therefore not 
recognized the competence of the Human Rights Committee to consider complaints by 
individuals regarding violations of the Covenant. Neither has it acceded to the Second Optional 
Protocol aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. Further, Nigeria has not recognized the 
competence of the Committee against Torture to receive communications from individuals under 
article 22 of CAT and has not signed the Optional Protocol on the Convention against Torture 
(OPCAT). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>13. Relevant regional human rights instruments ratified by Nigeria include: the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR) and its Protocols on the Rights of Women in 
Africa and the establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights; and the 
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. 
</p>
<p>14. As a member of the African Union, Nigeria is encouraged to abide by the Resolution on 
Guidelines and Measures for the Prohibition and Prevention of Torture, Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa (the Robben Island Guidelines) adopted by the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in 2002. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Domestic level 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Constitutional protection of human rights, including 
the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>15. Chapter IV of the Constitution, entitled Fundamental Rights, provides for, inter alia, rights 
to life, dignity, personal liberty, a fair hearing, private and family life, freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion, freedom of expression and the press, peaceful assembly and association, 
freedom of movement and freedom from discrimination. 
</p>
<p>16. The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment is provided in 
section 34 (1) (a): no person shall be subject to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment. 
</p><p>17. According to section 12 (1) of the Constitution, international human rights treaties shall 
only be applicable if they are enacted into domestic law by the National Assembly. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>2. Provisions of the Criminal Code and Penal Code 
criminalizing torture 
</b></p>
<p>18. Nigeria&#8217;s criminal law is primarily based on two legal texts: the Penal Code, 
applicable in the mainly Muslim 12 northern states; and the Criminal Code, applicable in the 
remaining 24 southern states of the country. 
</p>
<p>19. The 1990 Criminal Code does not contain any provision explicitly prohibiting torture with 
the requirements laid down in article 1 of CAT (i.e. the requirements regarding the role of a 
public official and the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering for a specific purpose, 
such as obtaining a confession, intimidation, or punishment), or any provision for adequate 
sanctions, as required by article 4 of CAT. However Part 5, which deals with offences against the 
person, contains a number of provisions criminalizing acts which may fall within the scope of 
the Convention, such as various categories of assault (chaps. 25 and 29), homicide (chap. 27), 
offences endangering life (chap. 28), and assaults on females (chap. 30). Section 298 
criminalizes the excessive use of force. 
</p>
<p>20. Penalties potentially range from: imprisonment for 1 year for ordinary assault to 14 years 
for assault with intent to have unlawful carnal knowledge; 7 years to life for grievous bodily 
harm; life imprisonment for manslaughter; death penalty for murder; and life imprisonment, with 
or without caning, for rape. 
</p>
<p>21. Under the Penal Code applicable in the northern mostly Muslim states which have 
introduced criminal law based on sharia to the jurisdiction of sharia courts and courts of appeal,<b>3</b> 
acts amounting to torture may constitute offences such as infliction of injury, homicide and rape. 
Under sharia, the perpetrator of homicide and injury can only be punished if the victim or 
relatives of a victim seek punishment. If committed intentionally, the punishment is retaliation: 
punishment mirroring the injury inflicted. Blood money can be paid to the victim or the relatives 
of a victim in lieu of retaliation. 
</p>
<p>22. The Police Act and Police Regulations provide for internal disciplinary measures. 
Section 341 of the Police Act provides: &#8220;In the individual exercise of his powers as a police 
officer, every police officer shall be personally liable for any misuse of his powers, or for any act 
done in excess of his authority.&#8221; The First Schedule of the Police Act lists several disciplinary 
offences which are subject to internal disciplinary sanctions, including unlawful or unnecessary 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Twelve northern states: Zamfara State, Kano, Katsina, Niger, Bauchi, Kaduna, Sokoto, Borno, 
</p>
<p>Gombe, Kebbi, Jigawa and Yobe. Section 4 of the Constitution specifies that the legislative 
power of the Government is divided between the federal and state governments. Section 4 (7) 
gives state houses of assembly the power to &#8220;make laws for the peace, order and good 
government of the State&#8221;. Section 6 empowers states to establish courts with jurisdiction at first 
instance or on appeal on matters. Advocates of the implementation of sharia argue that sharia 
courts have jurisdiction to try criminal cases, because although the Constitution mentions sharia 
courts with regard to civil proceedings and Islamic personal law, it is silent regarding criminal 
law jurisdiction; criminal law is not on the Federal Exclusive List in the Constitution, and the 
states have residual powers to legislate in this sphere. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4

</p>
<p>exercise of authority, i.e. if an officer uses any unnecessary violence on any prisoner or other 
persons with whom he may be brought into contact in the execution of his duty, or is uncivil to a 
member of the public (q) (ii). Punishments include dismissal, reduction in rank, withholding or 
deferment of salary rise, a reprimand, a fine, or confinement to barracks for up to 14 days. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Safeguards against torture and ill-treatment during arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p>23. In Nigeria, police functions to arrest, detain and investigate suspects for offences vest in a 
myriad of law enforcement agencies, including the Nigeria Police Force, the military, the State 
Security Service, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the National Drug Law 
Enforcement Agency, the Federal Road Safety Commission, and the Nigerian Security and Civil 
Defence Corps.<b>4</b> Nevertheless, in carrying out these functions, they are all governed by 
international, constitutional and domestic law. 
</p>
<p>24. The Constitution contains a number of safeguards for suspects: section 35 (2) allows a 
detainee or arrested person to remain silent until consultation with a legal practitioner and 
section 35 (3) guarantees the right to be informed about the facts and grounds of the arrest or 
detention. Section 35 (4) includes time limits and safeguards regarding imprisonment: a person 
who is arrested or detained shall be brought before a court within one or two days. Further, if a 
person is not tried within a period of two or three months he shall be released either 
unconditionally or upon such conditions as are necessary to ensure that he appears at trial at a 
later stage (sects. 35 (4) (a-b)). 
</p>
<p>25. According to section 35 (1) (f), &#8220;a person who is charged with an offence and who has 
been detained in lawful custody awaiting trial shall not continue to be kept in such detention for 
a period longer than the maximum period of imprisonment prescribed for the offence&#8221;. 
Section 36 contains procedural rights, including the presumption of innocence (sect. 36 (5)) and 
the right to a fair hearing within reasonable time before an independent and impartial tribunal in 
case of a charge of criminal offence (sect. 36 (1)). 
</p>
<p>26. There are a number of provisions in the Criminal Code (CC) as well as in the Criminal 
Procedure Code (CPC), which potentially safeguard the integrity of an individual arrested or 
detained: a person arrested shall not be exposed to unnecessary restraint, including handcuffing, 
unless there is a judicial order, a reasonable apprehension of violence, an attempt to escape, or 
the consideration of the restraint as necessary for the safety of the person arrested (CPC, sect. 4); 
criminal accountability of authorities using excessive use of force (CC, sect. 298); the limitation 
of force used in executing process or in arrest to be reasonably necessary when overcoming 
resistance (CC, sects. 261, 272, 273). Further potential safeguards are the obligations to take an 
arrested person within a reasonable time to a police station (CPC, sect. 9); to report persons 
arrested without warrant to the nearest magistrate (CC, sect. 20); to notify the person arrested of 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Apart from duplication of duties, rivalry and competition for scarce resources, the proliferation 
</p>
<p>of law enforcement agencies has been criticized for the establishment of parallel law 
enforcement regimes with the concomitant proliferation of parallel cells and detention facilities, 
the potential for abuse, and a challenge for adequate central oversight. See the <i>Report of the 
Presidential Committee on Police Reform</i>, May 2006, pp. 185-187. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>the cause of the arrest (CPC, sect. 5); to inform the person arrested without delay of the charge 
against him or her and to give reasonable facilities for obtaining legal advice, taking steps to 
furnish bail and otherwise making arrangements for his or her defence or release (CPC, sect. 9); 
and the prohibition of wilful delays to take an arrested person charged with an offence before 
court (CC, sect. 130). 
</p>
<p>27. In addition, the Criminal Code penalizes unlawful deprivation of liberty (sect. 365), and 
requires the proper keeping of records of any person in confinement and punishes neglect or 
deliberate false entries (sect. 368). Section 419 of the Criminal Procedure Code requires that 
young persons ordered to be imprisoned shall not be, so far as it is deemed practical, allowed to 
associate with adult prisoners. 
</p>
<p>28. Section 28 of the 1990 Evidence Act provides that a confession to a charge made by an 
accused person cannot be used to secure a conviction against him or her if it appears to have 
been caused by any inducement, threat or promise from a person in authority and sufficient to 
give the accused person grounds for supposing that he or she would avoid any evil of a temporal 
nature. This provision, however, does not appear to satisfy the wider requirements of article 15 
of CAT, which provides that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of 
torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against the person accused of 
torture. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Complaints and investigation of acts of torture 
</b></p>
<p>29. Oral or written complaints of police misconduct by members of the public can be made to 
any superior police officer about acts of misconduct involving his or her subordinates, and if the 
complainant is dissatisfied with the response, he or she could complain in writing to higher 
officers, including the IGP. Complaints could also be sent to the police Public Complaints 
Bureau (PCB) located in the police public relations department of every state police command, 
or to the police Provost Department at the Force headquarters.<b>5</b> In addition, Human Rights Desks 
for receipt of complaints have been established in recent years for each state command. 
</p>
<p>30. The Police Service Commission (PSC), an independent constitutional body established 
in 2001,<b>6</b> is also responsible for investigating police abuses. Section 6 of the Act grants the body 
responsibility for the appointment, promotion, discipline and dismissal of all Nigerian police 
officers below the rank of Inspector General. 
</p>
<p>31. Criminal investigations and prosecutions of police officers are carried out by Investigating 
Police Officers (IPO) assigned within the command. Where sufficient evidence is found, they

<p>misconduct are typically dealt with departmentally at first instance, internal review is without 
prejudice to criminal prosecution. The internal peer review, also referred to as an &#8220;orderly room 
trial&#8221;, is carried out by the Provost Department, which can impose various disciplinary 
sanctions.<b>7</b> Discipline of senior officers (i.e. Assistant Superintendent of Police and above) 
ultimately rests with the PSC, where the IGP sets up a panel of senior officers in order to hear 
the case, and recommendations are forwarded to the PSC for sanctioning. 
</p>
<p>32. Complaints on human rights violations may be made in writing or orally to the National 
Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Created in 1995 by a military decree, NHRC is mandated 
to monitor and investigate all alleged cases of human rights violations and make appropriate 
recommendations to the Federal Government.<b>8</b> Moreover, NHRC has identified torture as well as 
detention centres as 2 of its 15 main thematic areas. It has appointed a Special Rapporteur on 
Torture, Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions and a Special Rapporteur on Police, 
Prison and other Detention Centres. The Special Rapporteurs carry out investigations within their 
mandate and report to NHRC. However, the Commission is chronically under-resourced and 
lacks the judicial power to enforce redress, since it only has the power to make recommendations 
to Government. 
</p>
<p>33. The Legal Aid Council is mandated to provide free legal assistance and advice to persons 
who cannot afford a lawyer. A new programme deploying lawyers to police stations and 
magistrate courts has been recently introduced. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>34. According to section 35 (6) of the Constitution any person who is unlawfully arrested or 
detained shall be entitled to compensation and a public apology from the appropriate authority or 
person. However, this clause is not applied in the case of a person arrested or detained upon 
reasonable suspicion of having committed a capital offence. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur notes that there is currently no regular or systematic mechanism or 
activities related to independent visits to detention facilities. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE SITUATION OF TORTURE AND ILL-TREATMENT 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur was told by government officials that torture is prohibited by law, 
though it may occur from time to time, in an unfortunate isolated circumstance, and that the 
sternest measures are taken against perpetrators, including dismissal and criminal charges. 
However, these observations appear divorced from the realities prevailing in criminal 
investigation departments (CID) and police stations in the country, at least those visited by the 
Special Rapporteur. In fact, at CID detention facilities, it was a challenge to find a detainee that 
had not been ill-treated. The high number of consistent and credible allegations received from 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  See paragraph 29 and note 5 above. 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Human Rights Commission Act.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>speaking with various detainees, corroborated by forensic medical evidence, in facilities visited 
in different parts of the country and obtained within the span of a one-week mission, speaks 
volumes. 
</p>
<p>37. Despite the existence of safeguards for arrest and detention (paras. 18-28 above), they are 
effectively meaningless because they are regularly ignored. Torture was frequently cited to the 
Special Rapporteur as being used for the purpose of extracting money, obtaining confessions or 
further information in relation to alleged crimes. Methods of torture included: flogging with 
whips; beating with batons, cables, bamboo sticks, and machetes; shooting suspects in the foot; 
threatening a suspect with death and then shooting him with powder cartridges; suspension from 
the ceiling or metal rods in various positions; and being denied food, water and medical 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>38. Suggestions by officials that &#8220;torture&#8221; is only isolated or merely amounts to rough handling 
of suspects, are contradicted by evidence the Special Rapporteur found of dedicated rooms in 
CIDs for torture and equipment used for such purposes, and by the testimony from numerous 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the Special Rapporteur on summary, arbitrary and 
extrajudicial executions that while &#8220;&#8230; the scourge of armed robbery plagues much of Nigeria, 
the label of &#8216;armed robber&#8217; is very often used to justify the jailing and/or extrajudicial execution 
of innocent individuals who have come to the attention of the police for reasons ranging from a 
refusal to pay a bribe to insulting or inconveniencing the police &#8230; [The rules contained in Police 
Order No. 237] are deeply flawed. They provide close to a carte blanche to the police to shoot 
and kill at will&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, paras. 43 and 46). A high proportion of individuals 
detained in the facilities that the Special Rapporteur visited were held on suspicion of armed 
robbery; many of them with close-range gunshot wounds to the feet and legs, which is reportedly 
a common practice to prevent suspects from fleeing once they have been apprehended and a 
means to make them confess on the threat of death. In custody, many of these detainees have not 
received any medical treatment for these injuries, which become seriously infected and 
consequently life-threatening. Allegations were received from detainees of prisoners dying as a 
result of such injuries, and this denial of medical treatment effectively amounts to extrajudicial 
killing. 
</p>
<p>40. On the basis of a thorough analysis of the legal system, visits to detention facilities, 
interviews with detainees, the support of forensic medical evidence, and interviews with 
government officials, lawyers and representatives of NGOs, the Special Rapporteur concludes 
that torture and ill-treatment are widespread in police custody, and particularly systemic at CIDs. 
Torture is an intrinsic part of how the police operate within the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Impunity and lack of effective complaints mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>41. There was no question about accountability of perpetrators because there are no 
functioning complaint mechanisms in place to receive allegations, and to report and seek 
effective redress for acts of torture. Victims, especially those still in detention, have no 
confidence in the existing mechanisms, such as reporting allegations directly to senior police 
officials or to the Human Rights Desks (in those stations where they exist) - for example, at 
CID Panti, Lagos, prisoners were detained and tortured right behind the Human Rights Desk. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>Other avenues to complain are out of reach to the vast majority of detainees: they cannot afford 
lawyers and have no practical means of communicating allegations to family, NGOs, or others 
(i.e. by telephone, visits, etc.). The 2006 NHRC annual report states, &#8220;The Commission has a 
viable and effective complaints mechanism for treating complaints of allegations of human rights 
violation.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur notes that he received more credible complaints of 
ill-treatment during any one of his visits to CIDs than NHRC throughout the country in one 
year.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the climate of fear and mistrust of police 
prevalent in many of the places visited, and particularly at CIDs. A significant number of 
detainees declined to speak with the Rapporteur due to the fear of retaliations by the authorities, 
or only did so under the condition of anonymity. Detainees have the feeling of being left 
completely at the mercy of the officers and live under the constant fear of violent reprisals for 
any complaints, behavioural infractions, acts of non-compliance, or otherwise without 
provocation. Despite knowing that police abuse is wrong, victims feel powerless and are 
resigned to accept that impunity is the natural order of things when it comes to Nigerian law 
enforcement. 
</p>
<p>43. Attempts to register complaints may be met with intimidation, or investigations lack 
independence as they may be conducted by the police themselves or dealt with internally. 
Forensic medical examinations which could sustain complaints are non-existent, even in cases of 
death in police custody. No information was provided by the Government on evidence of 
successful criminal prosecutions of perpetrators of torture, or payment of compensation to 
victims, or statistics on disciplinary sanctions meted out to officers. 
</p>
<p><b>A first-hand account 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur met at least three detainees with life-threatening gunshot 
wounds that would die without prompt medical attention (Mr. Elijah John, Mr. Bayo Abdurmo 
Adekunk, both of whom were interviewed at CID Panti, Lagos, on 6 March 2007; and 
Mr. Mohammed &#8220;Mame&#8221; Bello, who was interviewed at CID Gwagwade, Kaduna, on 8 March. 
See appendix I for further details). By telephone on 10 March, the Special Rapporteur made a 
direct plea to Mr. Sunday Ehindero, the Inspector General of Police, for urgent medical 
treatment, and assurances were received in this regard (in addition, follow-up letters were sent on 
6 and 27 April). Appeals for assistance were also sent to the Controller General of Prisons, the 
Minister of Justice/Attorney General. 
</p>
<p>45. On 3 April 2007, a visit by United Nations officials found the torture room at CID Panti 
emptied. According to the officers in charge, Mr. John and Mr. Abdurmo Adekunk were brought 
to court shortly after the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The District Court Chief Prosecutor, 
Magistrate Court Yaba, indicated that Mr. Abdurmo Adekunk (case file C 26/07) was sentenced 
for armed robbery and imprisoned at Ikoyi Island Prison, Lagos. However, upon inquiries by the 
Lagos Prison Controller, the Head of Ikoyi Prison reported that Mr. Abdurmo Adekunk did not

</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  Respectively, for the years 2005 and 2006, 42 and 24 complaints of degrading treatment by 
</p>
<p>law enforcement agencies were received by NHRC (see 2005 and 2006 NHRC annual reports). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4

</p>
<p>appear on the current list of inmates. Furthermore, according to the files of the Investigating 
Police Officer, CID Panti, on 12 March, Mr. John&#8217;s case (charge number - N/23/2007) was 
transferred to Magistrate Court No. 12, Ebute - Meta, Lagos. However, to date, no records 
related to this case ever reached the court. 
</p>
<p>46. On 21 May 2007, on the occasion of the InterAction Council of Former Heads of State 
and Government in Vienna, the Special Rapporteur raised the case of those men with 
President Obasanjo. On 28 May, President Obasanjo wrote to the Special Rapporteur to assure 
him of the assistance of the IGP in the follow-up to these cases. On 6 June, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterated his appeal for information on the situation of these detainees to the newly 
inaugurated IGP, Mr. Mike Okiro. Despite several attempts to follow up on their situation with 
the Inspector General of Police, the Controller General of Prisons, the Attorney General and 
Minister of Justice, and the President, the authorities failed to provide any information on these 
persons; neither details of any medical treatment provided, nor their current whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>47. Given their physical condition at the time of the visit and their subsequent disappearance, 
the Special Rapporteur could not but conclude that these three individuals had been victims of 
reprisals as a result of his intervention. Either these detainees had died as a result of a deliberate 
denial of medical treatment, or, worse, they had been killed by the police and disappeared: a 
vivid first-hand confirmation of allegations of the widespread practice of extrajudicial killings 
across the country. 
</p>
<p>48. By letter dated 14 September 2007, the Government stated that it is &#8220;committed to 
unravelling the circumstances leading to and surrounding the deaths, which it has established, of 
two of the detainees, namely: Mr. Elijah John and Mr. Bayo Abdurmo Adekunk. Their deaths are 
presently being investigated and the Government is committed and determined to hold all these 
found guilty, accountable&#8221;.<b>10</b> By the same letter, the Government informed that Mr. Bello was 
alive and in prison custody in Kaduna. A photograph and medical certificate of Mr. Bello 
following his treatment was also provided by the Government. The Special Rapporteur reports 
that he has not received any information to date on steps taken to bring the officers implicated in 
these acts, or their superiors, to justice. 
49. These two clear and grave examples of serious torture, disappearance and extrajudicial 
killing, notwithstanding the above-stated commitments made at the highest levels of 
Government, disturbingly illustrate and confirm the inability of the current system to make 
timely and effective inquiries in order to protect victims of serious human rights violations. It 
further illustrates the breakdown of a credible system of accountability of law enforcement in 
Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  However, on 20 September 2007, in a meeting with the Special Rapporteur in Geneva, the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Representative of Nigeria informed him that Mr. John and Mr. Adekunk were 
subsequently found to be alive and have received medical treatment. Despite repeated requests 
for details of their situation, including their whereabouts and medical treatment reports, no 
information has been provided to date. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONDITIONS OF DETENTION 
</b></p>
<p>50. The conditions of detention in police cells visited by the Special Rapporteur were 
appalling. Detainees are held in unsanitary overcrowded cells, forced to sleep on the concrete 
floor, and are provided with insufficient food and clean water. At some police stations, women 
and men, children and adults are held together in extremely overcrowded conditions. Medical 
care is non-existent and seriously ill detainees are left to languish until they die. In the opinion of 
the Special Rapporteur, this demonstrates a complete disrespect for human life and dignity. 
</p>
<p>51. All the prisons visited by the Special Rapporteur are characterized by severe 
overcrowding, consisting of an inmate population that is typically double or triple the actual 
capacity of the facility. For example, while Port Harcourt Prison is designed for 800 detainees, a 
total of 2,420 are presently held. The vast majority of detainees (e.g. in Port Harcourt, 
92 per cent) are held awaiting trial (in pretrial detention) or held without charge for lengthy 
periods, as long as 10 years. These detainees are subject to even more severe conditions than 
those of convicts: they are held in overcrowded cells, lacking appropriate hygiene facilities, with 
insufficient places to sleep, inadequate and/or insufficient food, water, and medical care, let 
alone any opportunities for educational, leisure, or vocational training. Pretrial detainees reported 
that they are forced to pay for food, bathing, or contacting family members, receiving visitors, or 
medication. It is ironic that discriminatory treatment suffered by pretrial detainees, who may be 
held longer than some convicts, has been justified by the heads of some facilities on the grounds 
that their guilt being not yet proven, there is less responsibility and obligation, and consequently 
less resources, allocated to care for them. Children on remand are often held with adult males. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur considers that such an extensive recourse to pretrial detention 
constitutes the major cause for the overcrowding of prisons. It is contrary to the principle of the 
presumption of innocence and to the rule regarding deprivation of liberty as a disposition of last 
resort laid down by international law (article 9, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights). 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the Government&#8217;s recognition of the severity of 
the problem by considering the release of approximately 25,000 of the 45,000 detainees currently 
held in Nigerian prisons as announced on 4 January 2006. He is further encouraged by the 
announcement on 16 May 2007, that the Government will release all prisoners over 70, and those 
over 60 who have been on death row for 10 years or more. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur notes that at the facilities he visited the conditions of detention of 
female detainees are much better than those of men. The female sections/wings of the prisons are 
not overcrowded and women are provided with considerably better facilities. He welcomes that 
at Port Harcourt prison, the female detainees are able to engage in (vocational) activities, such as 
sewing, etc. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that at most of the facilities he visited there were 
serious constraints on resources and that staff have not been paid for several months. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p><b>IV. CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, SHARIA PENAL CODE  
PUNISHMENTS, AND CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Corporal punishment 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur notes that corporal punishment, such as caning, and including 
sharia penal code punishments of the northern states (i.e. amputation, flogging and stoning to 
death), remain lawful in Nigeria. Moreover he notes that sharia-related provisions for adultery 
and sodomy discriminate against women and same-sex couples, respectively. 
</p>
<p>57. Section 17 of the Criminal Code includes death and caning as punishments. Caning can be 
inflicted in addition to imprisonment for various offences regarding the defilement of young girls 
(sects. 218, 219, 221, 222, 225A), offences endangering life or health (sects. 330, 334), and 
assaults on females (sects. 358, 359).<b>11</b> Furthermore, section 18 gives courts the discretion to 
order the caning of male persons believed to be under 17 in addition to or in substitution for any 
other punishment to which they are liable. Section 295 justifies &#8220;a blow or other force&#8221; for the 
correction of children, servants and others. 
</p>
<p>58. The Criminal Procedure Code sets out in part 42 the provisions regulating caning: no 
person shall be sentenced to caning more than once for the same offence (sect. 384); persons 
over 45 shall not be punished with caning (sect. 385); caning shall be executed with a light rod, 
cane or birch and not exceed 12 strokes (sect. 386); offenders convicted for a minimum of six 
months&#8217; imprisonment can be sentenced to caning in addition to or in lieu of any other 
punishment (sect. 387); and a confirmed sentence of corporal punishment shall be inflicted as 
soon as practicable (sect. 388). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Sharia penal codes 
</b></p>
<p>59. The sharia penal codes contain a number of provisions raising serious concerns not only 
regarding their constitutionality but more fundamentally regarding their compatibility with the 
international prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (see for a 
detailed discussion, report on the Mission to Nigeria of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief (E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.2), paras. 47-79). 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur recalls that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Under 
international law, they are not lawful sanctions and violate the international human rights treaties 
to which Nigeria is a party, particularly CAT, ICCPR and CRC (A/60/316, paras. 18-28).

above 13, and of idiots (CC, sect. 221); Indecent treatment of girls under 16 (CC, sect. 222); 
Persons trading in prostitution (CC, sect. 225); Disabling in order to commit felony or 
misdemeanour (CC, sect. 330); Intentionally endangering safety of persons travelling by railway 
(CC, sect. 334); Punishment of rape (CC, sect. 358); Attempt to commit rape (CC, sect. 359). </p>

</p>
<p><b>C.  Capital punishment 
</b></p>
<p>61. Noting that capital punishment is still available under the laws of Nigeria, the Special 
Rapporteur is encouraged by the position of President Obasanjo not to support the death penalty. 
According to information received from the Government, eight executions have been carried out 
in Nigeria in the period of March 2002 to July 2006.<b>12</b> Although the rate of executions may be 
low, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern that persons continue to be sentenced to death, 
contributing to the growing numbers of persons languishing on death row for many years (e.g. up 
to 17 years) in conditions that are inhuman. The Special Rapporteur appeals to the Government 
to officially declare a moratorium, to commute death sentences to terms of imprisonment and 
de jure abolish capital punishment. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION 
</b></p>
<p>62. On the occasion of International Women&#8217;s Day, which was celebrated during the week of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit in Nigeria and drew attention to violence against women and girls 
and the impunity that makes it possible, the Special Rapporteur welcomed the adoption of a 
number of State laws prohibiting discrimination against women in critical areas, such as female 
genital mutilation and early marriage. Despite such legislation, however, he remains concerned 
at the persistence of these practices and the social acceptance of them and the lack of effective 
mechanisms to enforce the existing prohibitions. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>63. In Nigeria, torture and ill-treatment are widely practised in police custody; they are 
particularly systemic in the Criminal Investigation Departments (CID). Torture is an intrinsic 
part of the functioning of the police in Nigeria. This unacceptable state of affairs must end. The 
Government must take immediate and effective measures to ensure that this message permeates 
every level of every law enforcement agency in Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment is 
absolute. The circumstances surrounding the deaths of the two persons personally interviewed by 
the Special Rapporteur (see paragraphs 44-49 above) - examples of serious torture, 
disappearance and extrajudicial killing - illustrate and confirm the inability of the current system 
to effectively investigate allegations, protect victims of serious human rights violations, and 
bring law enforcement officials in Nigeria to account. 
</p>
<p>65. The findings of the Special Rapporteur are hardly a revelation as many credible human 
rights organizations, as well as United Nations human rights mechanisms, as for example the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  In this period, three persons were executed in Kaduna Prison, Kaduna State, for homicide and 
</p>
<p>armed robbery; one person in Jos Prison, Plateau State, for homicide; and four persons in Enugu 
Prison, Enugu State, for armed robbery. </p>

  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4), 
have documented and concluded that torture is widespread in the country.<b>13</b> That the conditions 
in detention are appalling is similarly well known. 
</p>
<p>66. It is fact that Nigerian law enforcement is seriously under-resourced and at the same time 
confronted with a high rate of violent crime. Consequently, adequate training is lacking, 
corruption is endemic, and the cadres, emboldened by a culture of impunity for torture, are prone 
to heavy-handed tactics in a criminal justice system which relies heavily on confessions. But the 
roots of the problem cut a wider swathe. The Special Rapporteur concurs fully with the analysis 
of the Special Rapporteur on summary, arbitrary and extrajudicial executions, who carried out a 
visit to the country in 2005: 
</p>
<p>There is no single entry point for reformers of the dismally inadequate Nigerian criminal 
justice system. Virtually every component part of the system functions badly. The result 
is a vicious circle in which each group contributing to the problem is content to blame 
others. Thus for example, police officers complain about a lack of resources, but the 
politicians complain that the police are thugs and their performance undeserving of 
increased resources. The judiciary blames the prison system and the police for the 
scandalous number of uncompleted cases, while the police observe that arresting robbers 
is futile because the courts will never convict them. It is essential to understand the 
vicious cycle of blame and for all actors to acknowledge their own responsibilities 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, para. 88).<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur cannot emphasize enough that Nigerians themselves have 
exhaustively identified the nature and scale of these problems. Indeed in August 2005, 
President Obasanjo acknowledged the severity of the problem of torture in the country.<b>15</b> Further, 
Nigerians have already come up with the way forward. One needs only to pore over the

<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  This is echoed in the Report of the Presidential Committee on Police Reform, which states: 
&#8220;... there are some factors, organizations, and institutions that tend to affect the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the police in the discharge of its statutory responsibilities. For the Police to operate 
maximally and meet the expectations of the public, these institutions must play their part in such 
a way that they will help rather than hinder the efficiency of the Police &#8230; institutions such as the 
Prisons and the Judiciary, which together with the police make up the Criminal Justice System 
have to be reformed to ensure a harmonious working relationship with the reformed Nigeria 
Police &#8230;&#8221; (pp. 179-180).

What is of concern, however, is that such reform efforts have been short-lived, without the same 
commitment to follow-up. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the significant challenges faced by the country. As the 
report of the Presidential Commission on Reform of the Administration of Justice in Nigeria 
states, &#8220;&#8230; transforming the administration of justice in Nigeria will have to be taken in the 
context of many and competing economic and human development challenges facing the country

<p>  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is currently working with the 
Nigerian Prison Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice on the 
development and implementation of the prison reform agenda of the Government. The UNODC 
prison reform project involves: capacity-building for prison personnel; rehabilitation of prison 
infrastructures; development of a detainee data file management system; improved health-care 
delivery; rehabilitation of prison inmates; and prison decongestion. In addition, UNODC is 
concluding a preventive HIV/AIDS and drug abuse awareness programme in some selected 
prisons in the country, which began in 2003. More generally, since 2003, UNODC has been 
working with the Government to strengthen the rule of law, both at the national and local levels, 
by increasing the capacity and integrity of the justice system, in particular of the judiciary. In one 
of its projects, &#8220;Support to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the 
Nigerian Judiciary&#8221;, UNODC is working with the Government and<b> </b>the European Union to: 
increase access to justice; timeliness and quality of justice; public confidence in the courts; 
efficiency, effectiveness and credibility of the complaints system; and coordination across the 
criminal justice system. Other partners in the international community are also striving to see 
that the effectiveness of the criminal justice sector is enhanced. For example, the 
United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) through its programme, 
&#8220;Security, Justice and Growth Programme&#8221;, has substantially supported the justice sector, 
covering areas such as improving systems for delivery of effective justice services, at both 
federal and state levels. DFID has also promoted a project on community policing with the 
Nigerian Police Force. There is currently a Justice Sector Coordination Working Group made up 
of UNODC, the World Bank, the European Union, DFID, and USAID that seeks to harmonize 
the respective programmes in the justice sector, develop joint initiatives, and seek out more 
efficient ways of implementing programmes in the sector. </p>

</p>
<p>as a whole. However the &#8230; justice sector is relevant and indeed central to poverty reduction 
initiatives&#8230;&#8221;.<b>18</b> Moreover, &#8220;the solution to many of the problems that &#8230; [have been] &#8230; 
identified does not lie only in budgetary appropriation, much of the issues can be resolved 
administratively &#8230;&#8221;.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>70. Since the visit was carried out, the Special Rapporteur wishes to report on two important 
developments. 
</p>
<p>71. By letter dated 8 May 2007, President Obasanjo wrote to the Special Rapporteur to 
acknowledge receipt of a draft law on the definition and prohibition of torture in line with 
article 1 of CAT, information on OPCAT, and a new draft law on the establishment of a torture 
investigation commission, which he had requested at their 9 March 2007 meeting. He indicated 
that the Attorney General and the Minister of Justice were requested to use the draft laws as a 
basis for bills for consideration by the Federal Executive Council and onward transmission to the 
National Assembly for passage into law. 
</p>
<p>72. On 16 May 2007, the Government announced the release of all prisoners over 70, and 
those over 60 who have been on death row for 10 years or more; an information which was 
confirmed by the letter of the Nigerian Government dated 14 September 2007 (see paragraph 6 
above). The Special Rapporteur welcomes this information and has requested the Government to 
provide detailed information on this process, including the numbers of prisoners released, the 
names of the death row prisoners that have been released, and the dates of their release. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to President Obasanjo for taking these 
important initiatives. He calls upon the Government to expeditiously follow through. 
</p>
<p>74. As a member of the Human Rights Council, Nigeria has pledged cooperation with human 
rights treaty bodies, timely submission of State party reports, and declared its readiness to 
welcome Special Rapporteurs and to submit itself to universal periodic review. The invitation of 
the Government to the Special Rapporteur and the cooperation extended to him demonstrates 
Nigeria&#8217;s willingness to open itself up to independent and objective scrutiny of its human rights 
situation, and reaffirms its commitment to cooperate with the international community in the 
area of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In this continuing spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government, with the assistance of the international community 
(i.e. the United Nations and other actors), take decisive steps to implement the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>

<p><b>Impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The absolute prohibition of torture should be considered for incorporation into 
the Constitution;

<p><b> (b) The highest authorities, particularly those responsible for law enforcement 
activities, should declare unambiguously that the culture of impunity must end and that 
torture and ill-treatment by public officials will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted. 
The message should be spread that torture is an extremely serious crime which will be 
punished with severe (long-term) prison sentences; 
 (c) The crime of torture should be defined as a matter of priority in accordance 
with article 1 of the Convention against Torture, with penalties commensurate with the 
gravity of torture;

to criminal investigations should be established, similar to the Economic and Financial 
Crimes Commission;

<p><b> (e) The right to legal counsel should be legally guaranteed from the moment of 
arrest; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The power to order or approve arrest and supervision of the police and

Protocol; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Those legally arrested should not be held in facilities under the control of their 
interrogators or investigators for more than the time required by law to obtain a judicial 
warrant of pretrial detention, which should not exceed 48 hours. After this period they 
should be transferred to a pretrial facility under a different authority, where no further 
unsupervised contact with the interrogators or investigators should be permitted; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) The maintenance of custody registers should be scrupulously ensured, including 
recording of the time and place of arrest, the identity of the personnel, the actual place of 
detention, the state of health upon arrival of the person at the detention centre, the time at 
which the family and a lawyer were contacted and visited the detainee, and information on 
compulsory medical examinations upon being brought to a detention centre and upon 
transfer; </b></p>

</p>
<p><b> (k) Confessions made by persons in custody without the presence of a lawyer and

Special Rapporteur urges the Government to thoroughly investigate all allegations 
contained in appendix I to the present report with a view to bringing the perpetrators to 
justice; 
 (n) Victims of torture and ill-treatment should receive substantial compensation 
proportionate to the gravity of the physical and mental harm suffered, as well as adequate

<p><b>Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) The release of non-violent offenders from confinement in pretrial detention

</p>
<p><b>Appendix I 
</b></p>
<p><b>PLACES OF DETENTION - INDIVIDUAL CASES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The following accounts are based on allegations by detainees while being interviewed by 
the Special Rapporteur. If detainees requested confidentiality, their allegations are not contained 
in the present appendix. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur conducted visits to detention facilities unannounced and was able 
to hold private interviews with detainees, in general. It should be mentioned that the 
Government on its own initiative organized a programme, including visits to a number of 
facilities (e.g. Kuje Prison, and Force CID, Garki) which the Special Rapporteur subsequently 
visited unannounced. While detainees in such facilities reported that they were aware of the visit, 
that the facilities were cleaned in advance, and at Force CID, Garki most detainees were 
allegedly transferred away before the visit of the Special Rapporteur, these incidences had no 
impact on the subsequent findings. The individual case histories are based on well-substantiated 
allegations of detainees. In many cases allegations of torture or ill-treatment were corroborated 
by medical evidence. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  STATE SECURITY SERVICES 
  </b>(Visited on 4 and 8 March 2007)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. On 4 and 8 March, the Special Rapporteur attempted to visit the detention facility at the 
headquarters of the State Security Services (SSS) in Abuja. On 8 March, he also tried to visit the 
State Security Services&#8217; detention facility in Kaduna. On all three occasions he was refused 
entry. This denial of access constitutes a deliberate and flagrant violation of the terms of 
reference for the visit agreed upon by the Government. Since he received credible allegations of 
torture by this intelligence agency, the denial of his right to assess for himself the allegations by 
inspecting unannounced the facilities and interviewing detainees in private leads him to strongly 
suspect that the authorities wished to conceal evidence. On the last day of the mission, the 
Special Rapporteur met representatives of the SSS: Mr. S. Agbase, Director of Enforcement, 
Mr. Ibrahim Bakut, Director of Administration, and Mr. Felix Ikumapayi. In the course of this 
meeting it was confirmed that the facility in Kaduna contains detention cells, which the 
authorities there (i.e. Mr. Musa Tbautum, Officer in Charge and Mr. Baba Thomas, Assistant to 
the Officer in Charge) had earlier denied and was reason for the denial of access. 
</p>
<p><b>II. KUJE MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON, KUJE, 
FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY 
          </b>(Visited on 4 March 2007)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>4. Kuje Medium Security Prison is located on the outskirts of Abuja. Originally an 80 bed 
facility, its current official capacity is 320 inmates. On the day of the visit, 529 prisoners were 
detained there. Ninety-one percent were awaiting trial prisoners; and of these 62 per cent </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>were charged with armed robbery, 11 per cent for homicide, and 27 per cent for other offences. 
The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. Abdul-Rahman Ashafa, the Controller, and 
Mr. Kabir Umar Funtua, Assistant Controller of Prisons. A new building providing additional 
space for 120 detainees is currently in the process of being built. 
</p>
<p>5. <b>General conditions and treatment in detention</b>. The prison director and his staff were 
fully cooperative and allowed unrestricted access to all detainees and ensured private interviews. 
The Special Rapporteur received allegations about the practice of caning as a disciplinary 
punishment. Detainees also reported that they are punished for minor offences such as 
possession of cigarettes. They are beaten with sticks and cables, either in plain sight of other 
detainees, or in a backyard from where other detainees can hear the screaming. The detainees 
are later brought to the prison&#8217;s hospital where they receive first aid. According to the 
allegations, the most recent caning was carried out the month prior to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
visit. The prison director confirmed the practice, stated that it would only be carried out after 
consultation with the prison&#8217;s doctor, and that the most recent case was in October 2006. As 
another form of disciplinary punishment, detainees are put into solitary confinement in the &#8220;back 
cell&#8221; (1.5 x 2 m cell) where they are held for no longer than two days according to the prison 
director. However, the Special Rapporteur received numerous accounts by detainees that they 
were held there for up to two weeks. 
</p>
<p>6. The water is of poor quality, and detainees complain about the quality (e.g. the rice is 
contaminated with small stones) and quantity of food. Only a small number of prisoners having 
the necessary financial means can order food from outside the prison (&#8220;self-feeding 
programme&#8221;). There is no possibility to make phone calls, neither to contact family members or 
a legal representative. Doctors provide only pain relievers, regardless of the medical complaint. 
</p>
<p>7. The cells for pretrial prisoners are heavily overcrowded (Cell No. 1: capacity 136, actual 
population 235; Cell No. 2: capacity 128, actual population 246 detainees). Bedding is 
insufficient. Although bunk beds are available, many detainees have to sleep on the floor, under 
the beds of others, or have to share. There are two toilets per cell. Detainees are locked up in the 
cell for the entire day, except from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Furthermore, pretrial detainees are barred 
from participating in any recreational, vocational or educational activities. 
</p>
<p>8. The cell for convicts is less crowded. These prisoners can participate in recreational, 
vocational or educational activities. Pretrial detainees might be transferred to the convict cell if 
they pay, or are in bad health. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Medium Custody Cell No. 1: pretrial detainees 
</b></p>
<p>9. <b>Sunday Ogar</b>, aged 25, construction worker, Edo State. On 4 July 2002, he was arrested 
from the construction site he was working in connection with the theft of US $150,000. He was 
accused of conspiracy and robbery. Taken to Force CID, Garki, he was tortured by the police 
during his two months of detention there. During one three-day period, he was brought to an 
office, stripped naked, handcuffed, beaten on the head, and suspended from the ceiling for 
approximately one hour from his handcuffs. He reports no visible injuries remaining except for 
hearing problems. He did not report the torture when he arrived at the prison, nor was a medical </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>examination carried out upon his arrival. On 6 September 2002, he was remanded in custody in 
Kuje Prison. In October 2005, his case came to the High Court and he was granted bail for 
Naira 8,000, which he was unable to afford. He has not received visits from his family, nor does 
he have a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>Abel Dayo Adeagbo</b>, aged 18, Ekiti State. On 25 February 2006, he was arrested in Lube 
(between Abuja and Kuje Prison) because he went to the house of a police officer, which he had 
mistaken for a brothel. He was involved in scuffle with the police officer during which he 
suffered a head injury. He was brought to Lube Police Station, where he was beaten and 
deprived of food for three days. On 1 March 2006, he was remanded in Kuje Prison. He did not 
report any experience of torture in prison. 
</p>
<p>11. <b>Gbokos Oswuo</b>, aged 37, wood merchant, Rivers State. On 28 August 2006, he was 
arrested in Abuja by the State Security Service (SSS) in his hotel room. The SSS officers in 
civilian clothes forcibly entered his room at midnight, handcuffed him and brought him to the 
SSS headquarters in Abuja, where he was detained without being able to inform any relatives or 
a lawyer. He was interrogated about kidnappings and hostages in the Niger Delta. On 30 August 
around midnight, he was blindfolded, handcuffed and shackled and brought to a cemetery 
outside of Abuja. He was threatened with death, told, &#8220;Have your last prayer&#8221;, suspended from a 
tree and beaten with cables. He was tortured to force him to admit his involvement in 
hostage-takings, to which he later confessed. Mr. Oswuo was able to provide the Special 
Rapporteur with a detailed sketch of the location of his cell, which was located in the basement 
of the SSS&#8217; headquarters. He also reported that during his detention Mr. Asari Dokubo and a 
person named Osmajla from Kanu State had been kept there as well. The latter reportedly has 
been detained incommunicado for two years at the SSS facility on terrorism charges. Up until 
mid November 2006, Mr. Oswuo was held incommunicado at which time the lawyer retained by 
his wife was able to trace him. He saw his lawyer for the first time when his case was brought to 
the High Court. The confession obtained under torture was forwarded to the High Court, and 
although he informed his lawyer that he had been tortured, no action was been taken in this 
regard. On 14 November 2006, he was brought to Kuje Prison. He reports no abuse at the prison. 
He is able to order food from outside the prison (self-feeding). 
</p>
<p>12. <b>Yusuf Lado Osman</b>, aged 32, Kogi State. On 15 February 2004, he was arrested in his 
shop by plainclothes SSS officers on suspicion of vandalizing pipelines. He was brought together 
with other suspects to the SSS detention centre in Lokaja. He was detained there incommunicado 
for three months. The other suspects were released on bail. He reports that he did not confess and 
was not tortured. In May 2004, he was brought to Kuje Prison, and was not tortured or subjected 
to corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>13. <b>Enefiok Asuquo</b>, aged 26, Akwa Ibom State. He has been awaiting trial in Kuje Prison 
since 2001 on charges of armed robbery. In the six years he has spent in Kuje Prison, he has only 
had one court hearing. He reports that he was subjected to solitary confinement, shackled and 
beaten with a baton about three months ago. The injuries could not be confirmed by the forensic 
expert. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4

</p>
<p><b>B.  Medium Custody Cell No. 2: pretrial detainees 
</b></p>
<p>14. <b>Benjamin Saro</b>, aged 24, an artist, Benue State. On 19 January 2001, he was arrested in a 
police raid, and charged with conspiracy and armed robbery. He reports that he was beaten with 
black wooden batons and cable wires, and money was demanded from him by the police. In the 
more than six years he has been in Kuje Prison awaiting trial, he reports that his case has been 
brought before the court only to be adjourned more than 100 times. In the prison he was beaten 
several times with a wooden and a plastic stick as a disciplinary measure. His next meeting with 
his lawyer is expected to be on 6 March 2007. 
</p>
<p>15. <b>Sunday Ofukwu</b>, aged 37, Delta State. Detained in Kuje Prison since 2003, he is awaiting 
trial for homicide. His case has been subjected to over 60 adjournments, typically because no 
witnesses were presented. He reports that he was interrogated in a 5 x 5 m cell in the basement of 
Force CID, Garki. He is next expected to appear in court on 14 March 2007. 
</p>
<p>16. <b>O.D.</b>, aged 17, student, Imo State. He is awaiting trial in Kuje Prison for one month. 
Seven months earlier, he was arrested and detained incommunicado at Force CID, Garki, for 
six months on suspicion of illegal firearms possession. He was beaten with an iron rod and 
slapped on the ear by CID officers in order to extract a confession. He did not receive any 
medical treatment, despite continuing complaints of pain in his ear. He has no lawyer and 
has had no contact with his family for seven months. He was last brought to court 
on 28 February 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Maximum Custody Cell: convicted prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>17. <b>Austin Udeme</b>, aged 43, an economist, Akwa Ibom State. In May 2006, he was arrested in 
Abuja by police on suspicion of financial crimes. He was detained for two weeks in Maitama 
Police Station. Over the course of one week, between 8.30 p.m. and midnight, after the senior 
officers had left, he was interrogated by an IPO in the first floor room. He was beaten with a 
wooden baton and the butt of a gun while he was handcuffed; cabled with electrical wire; and 
flogged with strips of rubber. After two weeks he was taken to the detention centre in the 
office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Awolowo Road, Lagos. He was 
detained there for five months; nine days of which were spent in the Military Hospital in Lagos 
as a result of the beatings he sustained. He was later released, but rearrested and brought to 
Kuje Prison on 1 November 2006, where he is awaiting trial. He reports that he was not 
subjected to ill-treatment in Kuje Prison; he is generally better treated than other pretrial 
detainees because he has money. Because of his poor health he is able to stay in the cell with the 
convicts, who enjoy significantly better conditions and less overcrowding than pretrial detainees; 
he is on the self-feeding programme. 
</p>
<p>18. <b>Abdulahi Ibrahim</b>, aged 44, Kano State. He has been awaiting trial since January 2007 
in Kuje Prison. On 11 December 2006, he was arrested and taken to Force CID, Garki, 
Abuja on suspicion of financial crimes. Until 23 December, he was detained incommunicado. 
On one occasion, in a room on the second floor of the CID building, between 9.30 a.m. and 
4 p.m., he was tortured on the orders of two police officers, one male and one female: his limbs 
were wrapped with strips of rubber starting from the extremities in order to restrict circulation; 
and his arms and legs were tied behind his back, and he was suspended from a metal bar under 
his arms for about two hours. At 4.30 p.m. he was presented with a paper to write a statement, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>which he refused to sign. At 6.45 p.m. he was told to sign the statement and he again refused. 
He described four 4 x 4 m cells in the CID, which held about 142 persons at the time of his 
detention. While at the CID, he begged for food to be smuggled in for him. On 23 December, he 
was able to pass a message through a CID officer to his lawyer, whose efforts, including contacts 
with the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police, led to his release. On 4 January 2007, 
however, on the orders of the female officer, he was rearrested and brought to Kuje Prison. 
He reports that although he is awaiting trial, he can afford to pay for a place in the convicts&#8217; cell. 
He last appeared in court on 26 February 2007. 
</p>
<p>19. <b>Observations</b>. The Special Rapporteur concludes that the conditions of detention for 
pretrial detainees are inhuman. The sanitary conditions are deplorable. The Special Rapporteur 
notes with strong concern that some detainees have been held in these conditions for up to 
six years while awaiting trial. As far as the conditions of detention of convicted prisoners are 
concerned, they were deemed slightly better. 
</p>
<p>20. <b>As a follow-up to his 4 March visit, by letter dated 4 May 2007, the Special 
Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning recent allegations of violence in Kuje Prison. 
According to the allegations received: On 28 March 2007, the inmates sought to complain 
to the yard master about the shortage of clean drinking water provided to them. When 
they insisted to see the yard master, the warders attempted to use batons to force the 
inmates back into Medium Custody 1 cell. An armed squad arrived shortly thereafter and 
shot three inmates. Other warders armed with sticks, iron and other objects proceeded to 
beat the inmates. Seven inmates were reportedly identified by the warders as leading the 
protestors and taken to a cell in the yard where they were beaten and tortured until they 
gave up their protest three days after the incident. As a result, two of these prisoners died: 
Mr. Mathew Mato, a mobile police constable charged with armed robbery, and an elderly 
inmate named Joseph, who was facing charges of corruption. It has been reported that 
since the violence, inmates in the yard are served one cup of water in the morning and in 
the evening; complaints are ignored; and at the slightest provocation, the warders bring 
out and beat the offending inmate.</b>

                         </b>(Visited on 4 March 2007) 
</p>
<p>21. Force CID, Garki, is the Nigeria Police Force&#8217;s principal CID for FCT and the rest of the 
country. The Special Rapporteur was received by the Commissioner of Police, Columbus Okaro, 
the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Christopher Katso, and the Chief Superintendent of Police, 
Mr. Aval M. Mohammed. According to the Deputy Commissioner, the total capacity of the CID 
is 150 inmates. 
</p>
<p>22. <b>General conditions and treatment in detention</b>. The authorities of the CID were 
cooperative and allowed unrestricted access to and private interviews with the detainees. 
However, there was a significant delay and the Special Rapporteur was only able to access 
the facility at nightfall after having waited for approximately 45 minutes. Due to the lack of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>electricity in the cells the interviews had to be conducted with flash lights. The Special 
Rapporteur notes with concern that the detention facility did not have the possibility to 
provide light during night which, in his opinion, does not allow officers to protect detainees 
against inter-prisoner violence, among other things. 
</p>
<p>23. Upon arrival about 30 detainees were present in the cells, several of whom separately 
reported that approximately 400 detainees were removed from the CID two days earlier. 
The Special Rapporteur suggests that the removal of detainees was a deliberate attempt to 
hide evidence from the Special Rapporteur. Despite the maximum period of police custody 
stipulated in Nigerian law, being two days, many detainees have been held for several months at 
CID Garki. 
</p>
<p>24. <b>Musa Oasr</b>, aged 36. On 21 December 2006, he was arrested in Jos, Plateau State, on 
suspicion of armed robbery, and on 23 December, he was brought to Force CID, Garki. A few 
days after his arrival, he was tortured by four to five CID officers: a bicycle inner tube was 
tightly wrapped around his left hand in order to restrict blood circulation; and he was brought to 
the basement of the building, forced to stand on a table, handcuffed on the right hand to a hook 
on the ceiling, and was hung from his hand when the table was removed. He was beaten during 
his one hour suspension. He was taken down after he confessed. No medical attention was 
provided, and consequently he will not regain the use of his arm. 
</p>
<p>25. <b>Haruna Adamu</b>, aged 41, Kano State. In May 2006, he was arrested in Kano on suspicion 
of burglary, and transferred to Force CID in November 2006. Two days after his arrival at the 
CID he was taken out of the cell by plain clothed officers and brought to the basement, where 
one of his arms was fixed with a chain to the ceiling. He was suspended from his arm for about 
ten minutes and beaten, including with cables, in order to extract a confession. He confessed and 
signed a statement. Despite his arrest in May 2006, he has not yet been brought before a judge. 
26. <b>Mohammed Jamiu</b>, aged 23, <b>Yusuf Abubakr</b>, aged 30, and <b>Mohammed Usman</b>, 
aged 27, all from Kebbi State, held in the same cell, all reported torture and ill-treatment in the 
basement of the CID. They reported that there were approximately 60 other detainees in their 
cell two days prior to the arrival of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>27. <b>Swendy Uzedomen</b>, aged 28, Edo State. Suspected of armed robbery, he has been 
detained at the CID for about five months. In November and December of 2006, and 
January 2007, he was severely tortured in the basement by CID officers (Mr. Ashron, Mr. Agist, 
Mr. Zaccari): handcuffed and hung by his hand from a ceiling fan fixture, beaten, and shot in his 
left shin. As a result of being tortured, he has lost the use of his right hand and is suffering from a 
serious infection of his leg. He has been shackled almost since he arrived at the CID. He is held 
in a cell with about 24 other detainees. 
</p>
<p>28. <b>Chukuma</b>, aged 25, Abia State. He corroborates Mr. Uzedomen&#8217;s account with a similar 
experience. 
</p>
<p>29. <b>Recommendations</b>. The Special Rapporteur expresses strong concern that the vast 
majority of detainees had been removed from CID Garki only two days before his arrival to 
conceal evidence. He recommends that prompt and independent investigations of all torture 
allegations be carried out in order to bring those responsible to justice (i.e. the alleged </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>perpetrators, Mr. Ashon, Mr. Agist and Mr. Zaccari; and those senior officers who were under a 
duty to investigate as soon as there were reasonable grounds to believe that an act of torture had 
been committed, namely the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner). He recommends that 
lighting is improved in the evening hours to enable officers to protect detainees against 
inter-prisoner violence. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned over the sanitary conditions, 
the lack of sufficient clean water, as well as the very limited quantity of food provided, and lack 
of medical treatment for the detainees. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. NIGERIA POLICE FORCE, STATE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
DEPARTMENT, PANTI, YABA, LAGOS, LAGOS STATE 
                                  </b>(Visited on 6 March 2007) 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. Olayinka B. Balogun, the Deputy 
Commissioner of the Panti CID. 
</p>
<p>31. <b>General conditions and treatment in detention</b>. The Special Rapporteur expresses with 
strong concern that this is one of the worst detention facilities he has ever seen. After a lengthy 
and heated discussion with the Deputy Commissioner, the Special Rapporteur was finally 
allowed to conduct private interviews with the detainees. When requesting entry to the &#8220;torture 
room&#8221;, the Deputy Commissioner and guards attempted to mislead the Special Rapporteur and 
guide him to another building. Access to the &#8220;torture room&#8221; was secured only by telephone 
instructions from the IGP, Mr. Sunday Ehindero. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Cell behind Human Rights Desk 
</b></p>
<p>32. The cell is located at the end of a small corridor behind the human rights desk. 
The 72 male detainees accused of armed robbery inside have been there from five months to 
more than two years. The room is severely overcrowded, badly lit, and filthy. None of the 
detainees have left the cell since their arrival, have seen a lawyer or been visited by family 
members, who in many cases are not aware of their whereabouts. One detainee had been shot in 
the foot in the cell four weeks earlier. There are 16 female detainees held in the adjacent cell. 
33. <b>Eriemiatoe Bright</b>, aged 26, Benin City, Edo State. On 26 February 2007, he was arrested 
at Barbeach and brought to the CID. On 2 March in the evening, he was tortured by four officers 
for almost two hours: suspended upside down in the &#8220;torture room&#8221;, beaten with a stick and a 
metal baton. He confessed, and was then brought to the cell behind the Human Rights Desk for 
medical treatment. Severe skin injuries were still visible at the time of the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur. He reports that torture is regularly practised. 
</p>
<p>34. <b>Jakson Onyeukw</b>, aged 24, Lagos. On 19 February 2006, he was arrested by the Special 
Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Ikeja, Lagos, on suspicion of having stolen Naira 11 million. 
Four days after the arrest he was shot with an AK-47 in his left and right foot by an officer 
named Kopra Friday. Denied medial treatment, Mr. Onyeukw treated himself in the cell by using 
a candle flame to cauterize his wound. He remained in incommunicado detention for three 
months, and his bank account and property were seized. From SARS he was transferred to 
CID Panti where he is awaiting trial. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>35. <b>John Olugmade</b>. He reported that it was common for other detainees to be forced by the 
guards to torture each other. Very little food is provided and the detainees must pay for what 
they receive; the detainees are starving. One person died recently. He reported that suspected 
armed robbers are perceived as less than human by the officials. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  &#8220;Torture room&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>36. The &#8220;torture room&#8221; is located in &#8220;Ojo Adekolu Hall D9&#8221;, which is a separate bungalow 
behind the main building on the premises of the CID. When entering the bungalow, one comes 
into a large room furnished with desks and chairs where investigators take statements. At the 
very end of this room, on the left hand side, a doorway covered with a curtain leads to the torture 
room, which comprises a smaller roofed section, and a larger open-air section. 
</p>
<p>37. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur some 125 individuals, including 
three women, and children as young as eleven years, were detained under extremely inhuman 
conditions. The room was heavily overcrowded, extremely hot, humid and filthy. Detainees had 
to sleep directly on the earth floor or on small pieces of cardboard. A makeshift hole in the 
ground served as a toilet. The smell was unbearable, even more so by the stench of one injured 
detainee&#8217;s decaying foot. None of the detainees had seen a lawyer, judge, or been able to contact 
family members, although some had been there for more than two months. Food, provided on the 
basis of bribes to the guards, is insufficient and of poor quality. People were found to be 
starving. 
</p>
<p>38. Almost every detainee in this room had serious physical marks of torture, ranging from 
skin injuries inflicted with a heated machete or from a beating with a metal bar to cases of 
untreated gunshot wounds. 
</p>
<p>39. Detainees reported that they were forced by officers to torture each other: on the ground 
face down, the hands and feet of the victim are bound together behind their back, from which 
they are raised and left suspended from an iron bar. To increase the pain, the victim&#8217;s back is 
weighed down with a heavy engine part, which was found in the room. This practice takes place 
in front of the other detainees, including children, with the aim to threaten and intimidate them. 
The Special Rapporteur found in the cell metal bars and other instruments whose shapes 
corresponded to detainees&#8217; injuries. It was reported that one person died in the cell shortly prior 
to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. 
</p>
<p>40. <b>Bayo Abdur Mohammed Adekunk</b>, aged 22, Kwara State. He has been detained at the 
CID for about two months. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur it was clear, given 
that he was provided no medical attention, that he was at risk of life-threatening complications 
arising from a gunshot wound sustained in connection with his arrest. His foot was in an 
advanced state of decay and he was in urgent need of an amputation to save his life. 
</p>
<p>41. <b>Elijah John</b>, aged 43, Abia State. He was shot by police during arrest, and at the time of 
the visit of the Special Rapporteur it was apparent, given that he was provided no medical 
attention, that he was at risk of life-threatening complications arising from his gun shot wounds. 
He was detained in the torture room and placed adjacent to the toilet. 
42. <b>Ernest Gryson</b>, a United States citizen. He was held in the torture room in handcuffs. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p>43. <b>Eleven-year-old boy</b>. He had been detained for two weeks in the torture room. He was too 
weak to stand and complained of hunger. 
</p>
<p>44. <b>Goke Olawale</b>. He demonstrated the torture methods used by the CID officers. He 
reported that that IPO who tortured him is Sgt Dickson. 
</p>
<p>45. Ms.<b> Tokonbo Akinoele</b>. She was detained with two other women among 
approximately 120 male detainees. She did not complain about any harassment from the male 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>46. Ms.<b> Shuttuola Wasilat</b>. She reported that IPO Friday tortured her. 
</p>
<p>47. Ms.<b> Jamiu Sikiry</b>. Another female detainee in the torture room. 
</p>
<p>48. <b>Recommendations</b>. In his debriefing, the Deputy Commissioner stated that the officials 
&#8220;would try not to torture&#8221;, however the detainees in the torture room were not &#8220;normal 
criminals&#8221;, but armed robbers. The women in the room were reportedly not detainees but in the 
process of being screened, and that due to a lack of space they are locked up with men. The 
Deputy Commissioner assured that the severely injured persons, Mr. Abdurmo Adekunk and 
Mr. John, would immediately receive proper medical care and no detainee would have to fear 
reprisals for having spoken to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>49. By telephone on 10 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur made a direct plea to 
Mr. Sunday Ehindero, the Inspector General of Police, for urgent medical treatment, and 
assurances were received in this regard (in addition, follow-up letters were sent on 6 and 
27 April). Appeals for assistance were also sent to the Controller General of Prisons, the Minister 
of Justice/Attorney General, as well as the President of the Republic. 
</p>
<p>50. A visit on 3 April 2007 by United Nations officials found the &#8220;torture room&#8221; in CID Panti 
emptied. According to the officers in charge Mr. John and Mr. Abdurmo Adekunk were brought 
to court shortly after the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The District Court Chief Prosecutor, 
Magistrate Court Yaba, indicated that Mr. Abdurmo Adekunk (case file C 26/07) was sentenced 
for armed robbery and imprisoned at Ikoyi Island Prison, Lagos. However, upon inquiries by the 
Lagos Prison Controller, the Head of Ikoyi Prison reported that Mr. Abdurmo Adekunk did not 
appear on the current list of inmates. Furthermore, according to the files of the Investigating 
Police Officer, CID Panti, on 12 March 2007, Mr. John&#8217;s case (charge number - N/23/2007) was 
transferred to Magistrate Court No. 12, Ebute - Meta, Lagos. However, to date, no records 
related to this case ever reached the court. 
</p>
<p>51. On 21 May 2007, on the occasion of the InterAction Council of Former Heads of State 
and Government in Vienna, the Special Rapporteur raised the case of the above men with 
President Obasanjo. On 28 May, President Obasanjo wrote to the Special Rapporteur to assure 
him of the assistance of the IGP in the follow-up to these cases. On 6 June, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterated his appeal for information on the situation of these detainees to the 
newly inaugurated IGP, Mr. Mike Okiro. By letter dated 14 September 2007, the Government </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>stated that it is &#8220;committed to unravelling the circumstances leading to and surrounding the 
deaths, which it has established, of two of the detainees, namely; Mr. Elijah John and 
Mr. Bayo Abdurmo Adekunk. Their deaths are presently being investigated and the 
Government is committed and determined to hold all these found guilty, accountable.&#8221;<b>a</b> 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur recommends that independent investigations of all those 
responsible for the appalling conditions in the &#8220;torture room&#8221; and of torture allegations be 
carried out in order to bring those responsible to justice (i.e. the alleged perpetrators; those senior 
officers who were under a duty to investigate as soon as there were reasonable grounds to 
believe that acts of torture had been committed, including the Commissioner and the Deputy 
Commissioner; and the medical staff at the CID for denial of medical treatment). The authorities 
should ensure that separation of males and females, as well as adults and children, is rigorously 
implemented. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  PORT HARCOURT PRISON, PORT HARCOURT, RIVERS STATE 
</b>(Visited on 7 March 2007)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. B. K. Bogunjoko, the State Controller of 
Prisons, Rivers State, Mr. A. B. Olusola, the Chief Inspector of Prison, and Mr. Alpheous Ottan, 
the Duty-Officer. Built in 1918 and one of the largest in the country, the prison was originally 
built to house 804 inmates. On the day of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the total number of 
detainees was 2,420, served by about 194 staff. Ninety-two per cent of the inmates are pretrial 
detainees; 4.5 per cent are facing the death penalty; and there were a total of 19 female detainees, 
who are locked up in a separate wing. 
</p>
<p>54. <b>General conditions and treatment in detention</b>. According to the Chief Inspector of 
Prison disciplinary measures are set out in the prison regulations and include flogging as well as 
detention in a punishment cell. Corporal punishment is inflicted for the offence of bodily harm 
against an inmate or warden or participation in a prison riot, and requires the consent of the 
prison&#8217;s doctor. According to the official, the last caning was carried out two years ago. Solitary 
confinement is only possible for up to two days. Reportedly, there has been one case of staff 
misbehaviour which has been sanctioned with extra-duty. Detainees can leave the cells from 
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that staff members have not received 
any salary for already three months. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>a
</b>  However, on 20 September 2007, in a meeting with the Special Rapporteur in Geneva, the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Representative of Nigeria informed him that Mr. John and Mr. Adekunk were 
subsequently found to be alive and have received medical treatment. Despite repeated requests 
for details of their situation, including their whereabouts and medical treatment reports, no 
information has been provided to date. </p>

prisoners, they can leave their cells from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. However, they are not allowed to 
leave the vicinity of their buildings. Since a mass jailbreak in 2005 they are excluded from 
participating in recreational or vocational activities. Like other cells, death row cells are severely 
overcrowded and lack all basic facilities.

On 6 January 2007, he was sentenced to six lashes for the destruction of a mobile phone. 
According to the punishment book the medical officer did not deem him fit enough for 
the punishment. The lashing took place in the yard under the mango tree with a koboko 
(three-braided cow-hide whip). Mr. Illaya claims to have been punished for having smoked a 
cigarette and that, at the time of the incident, he had been taken immediately out of his cell and 
beaten by the warders. 
</p>
<p>62. <b>Samson Nnumita</b>, aged 97, Imo State. He was arrested in 1997, and convicted in 2003. At 
the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, he was in a very poor state of health. Since he was

<p><b>B.  Reception cell; new arrivals 
</b></p>
<p>69. Newly arrived detainees are locked up in the reception cell which is located next to the 
football pitch. The cell was severely overcrowded with approximately 60 detainees - some of 
them children - locked up. There are only 18 bunk beds and one toilet. The majority of detainees 
have to sleep sitting on the floor, because there is not enough space for them to lie down on the 
ground. Detainees reportedly have to pay Naira 50 to the prison wardens to shower. Guards 
retain money from visiting family members and make prisoners pay for food. A meal of beans 
without any sauce is served three times. Some detainees have been in the reception cell for more 
than one year, although the stay is meant to be temporary until processing of the detainee has 
been completed.

bed. There is one convicted prisoner and 13 pretrial detainees guarded by 17 female prison 
guards. According to the detainees, they can leave their cells from 8 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. and are 
allowed to engage in activities, such as sewing etc. The guards here report that caning is not 
practiced anymore and the last instance of solitary confinement was imposed a long time ago. 
Guards have received some training by a human rights NGO and became sensitised not to cane.

<p>78. <b>Rachael Dawari</b>, aged 26. On 7 September 2006, she was arrested on suspicion of murder, 
and taken to CID Port Harcourt. She was detained for one week in a separate women&#8217;s cell. 
During the interrogation by two male police officers, she was handcuffed, beaten with a machete 
and forced to sign a statement. In prison she was not subjected to ill-treatment, but separation is 
allegedly used as disciplinary measure. Voluntary work and visits are possible in prison. The 
detainees are allowed to stay outside their cells from 8 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. She has not seen her son 
since her arrest. She receives support from Female Legal Aid, but has no lawyer. She is awaiting 
trial.

visited by the Special Rapporteur the cells were clean and empty. According to the prison guards 
the cell is not used anymore. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Infirmary 
</b></p>
<p>81. There are two doctors and 13 nurses working in the infirmary. Reportedly, many detainees 
suffer from tuberculosis and/or malaria as well as HIV/AIDS. The supply of drugs is generally 
insufficient. There are no drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis available nor X-rays. There 
have been three deaths in total this year. 
</p>
<p>82. <b>O.O.</b>, aged 16. Awaiting trial in Port Harcourt Prison for six months, he is currently in the 
infirmary. 
</p>
<p>83. <b>Alfredo Okike</b>, aged 72. In May or June 2006, he was arrested in connection with a land 
dispute with his brother, and is awaiting trial. He has been in the infirmary for nine months, since 
he arrived to Port Harcourt Prison. 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Rufus Awyuwuk</b>, aged 77, Imo State. He was detained in 1996, and convicted in 2003. 
He suffers from diabetic, hypertension, and needs medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>85. <b>Recommendations</b>. As a priority, the Special Rapporteur recommends the separation of 
children from adult prisoners. Pending consideration of alternative measures to detention for the 
children, they should be transferred to the section for female detainees. The children should be 
provided adequate educational, vocational and recreational activities, including the use of the 
library. The Special Rapporteur recommends the release of Samson Nnumita, Alfredo Okike and 
Rufus Awyuwk on humanitarian grounds, given their advanced ages and state of health. 
Detainees on death row should enjoy the same recreational and vocational activities as other 
detainees.

</p>
<p>89. <b>Christopher Adefe</b>, aged 20, Gala Park. On 1 March 2007, he was detained along with 
two others by 12 police officers on suspicion of selling a stolen handset, and brought to the 
Mobile Police Office at the CID around 5 or 6 p.m. He described it as the yellow-painted 
building situated immediately to the right upon entry to the CID compound. He described the 
interior as 14 x 14 m with a ply-wood division. Their hands were tied behind their backs, and for 
about an hour, eight officers beat them with machetes, canes, and a horse whip. They signed 
confessions in the end, and no treatment was provided for their injuries. They sustained 
numerous lesions, which were still visible at the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur. He is 
unable to afford a lawyer. He has been visited by his girlfriend. 
</p>
<p>90. <b>Prince Diaku</b>, aged 22. On 1 March 2007, he was arrested and taken to the police station 
of Omoku. He reports that he was beaten by an officer with a baton, and struck on the knee with 
the butt of a gun. He suffers from a large haematoma on his knee, and is unable to move it. His 
parents are unaware of where he is and he has no lawyer. 
</p>
<p>91. <b>Torsi Nunieh</b>, aged 24, laundry tradesman, Ogoni. On 8 February 2007, he was arrested 
by police at home on suspicion of stealing Naira 1 million. The police seized his property, 
including his motor bike, handset, shoes, shirt, and trousers, and Naira 7,800. He was first taken 
to Bori Police Station, Ogoni, and around 12 February, to the office of the Swift Operation 
Squad (SOS), Port Harcourt. He was held there for two weeks in a cell with about 15 people. 
He was then brought to CID. In the first office on the right of the entry gate, he was 
handcuffed behind his back, his feet were bound with rope, and he was beaten with a baton and 
machete all over his body. A gun muzzle was pressed to his right shoulder. He last saw his wife 
on 28 February. 
</p>
<p>92. <b>L.A.</b> On 18 December 2006, he was arrested at his home around 10 am by the &#8220;Agip 
Army&#8221; (security services of Agip), on suspicion of stealing oil tools from &#8220;Agip Newbase&#8221;. 
He was taken to Bori Camp, where the &#8220;Agip Army&#8221; commander ordered him beaten with a 
chair for 30 minutes. On 22 December, he was taken to the CID. Their investigation turned up 
nothing, and the officers decided that this was a federal matter, and he was transferred to Force 
CID, Abuja. He was held there for about two weeks. Since nothing was found, he was brought 
back to Port Harcourt CID for release. However, he remains in detention without charge or 
having been brought before a judge. 
93. <b>George Elijah</b>, aged 18, Akwa Ibum State. Around 24 January 2007, he was arrested 
together with <b>Prince Akpotu</b>, aged 22, a driver, Delta State, on suspicion of stealing a handset. 
They were taken to Bori Camp and held there for about one month. They were beaten with 
machetes with their hands bound behind their backs. They were then brought to the CID, taken 
to the office adjacent to the compound entrance. Over a period of five days, their hands were 
cuffed, heads forced under the table, struck with machetes, batons, and a koboko (three-braided 
cow-hide whip). They were questioned over the identity of a person. They have not had contact 
with any family or have had access to a lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Gate house; &#8220;engine room&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>94. The gate house, or &#8220;engine room&#8221; - the alleged place of torture - is a yellow-painted 
building situated immediately to the right upon entry to the CID compound. The interior is 
approximately 14 x 14 m with a ply-wood division, and consists of three small rooms. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur met Mr. Ben Awor, Assistant Superintendent of Police, attached to 
State CID. He denied any allegations of torture or ill-treatment taking place in the building. 
However, when the Special Rapporteur identified a koboko (a three-braided cow-hide whip of 
the type which corresponded to the allegations) in the room, he was told by investigating officers 
that it was an item of evidence in a case. When the Special Rapporteur attempted to photograph 
it, a plainclothes officer reached in from a window and fled with it. He was later ordered back 
and the item was photographed. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Central Police Station 
</b></p>
<p>95. The Central Police Station is a two-floor building with offices on the first floor and eight 
cells on the ground floor. At the time of the visit, the Officer in Charge was Sunday Kuryas. The 
cells are overcrowded, dark and filthy. The women&#8217;s cell (with three detainees) is located within 
the cells where male detainees are kept. A bucket serves as a toilet. Detainees have to sit and 
sleep on the concrete floor, and complain about the lack of food. 
</p>
<p>96. <b>Young boy</b>. On a bench in the corridor, a young boy with severe injuries on his legs and 
arms was found. He was barely able to sit or to stand up and was in need of medical treatment. 
Officers arrived and intimidated the boy, who subsequently declined to be interviewed and was 
brought outside of the building under armed guard. 
</p>
<p>97. Ms.<b> Niskuk and Idosqeits</b>, sisters, both aged 23. Since 26 February 2007, they have been 
detained. The police demands the family pay Naira 20,000 to release them. They are detained in 
a separate cell together with one other woman. They are not provided food and have no 
possibility to shower. 
</p>
<p>98. Ms. <b>Gertrud Daniel</b>, aged 20. She has been detained incommunicado for one week, is 
HIV positive, but reports no allegations of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>99. <b>Recommendations</b>. The Special Rapporteur recommends that prompt and independent 
investigations of all torture allegations be carried out in order to bring those responsible to justice 
(i.e. the alleged perpetrators including Ben Awor; those senior officers who were under a duty to 
investigate as soon as there were reasonable grounds to believe that an act of torture had been 
committed).

                          </b>(Visited on 8 March 2007) 
</p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. Ernest Ibhaze, the Commissioner of Police, 
and Mr. Alkali Usman Yakubu Eway, Assistant. 
</p>
<p>101. <b>General conditions and treatment in detention</b>. Numerous allegations were received 
indicating that torture was carried out in a specific room, known as the &#8220;Panteka&#8221;, on the 
left-hand side on the first floor of the CID. There is a general climate of fear, and many detainees 
declined to speak with the Special Rapporteur, or they ask for confidentiality (&#8220;They will kill me 
if I give you my name.&#8221;). Detainees reported that the visit was expected and that they were 
forced to clean their cells some days before. The cells, which are located on the ground floor, are </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 41 
 
</p>
<p>overcrowded and in poor condition. In total 76 detainees are held there. They all have to sit and 
sleep on the ground, none of the cells are lit, and there is no toilet. Thirty-six detainees were 
recently shown on a local TV channel, where they had to state that the conditions of detention in 
Kaduna are good. Those who refused were allegedly tortured. It was reported that a detainee was 
recently shot dead outside of the cell. 
</p>
<p>102. <b>Sunday Agada</b>, aged 23, Benue State. On 26 February 2007, he was arrested on suspicion 
of armed robbery and taken to Tafa Police Station. The next day he was taken to the CID, where 
he was beaten by a number of officers. He has not received medical treatment for the injuries he 
sustained, including those on his buttocks. 
</p>
<p>103. <b>R. Jale</b>, aged 20, Kaduna State. On 22 February 2007, he was arrested, and brought to the 
State CID. In the torture room (Panteka), he was handcuffed, threatened with death, and beaten 
with a wooden stick for an hour. 
</p>
<p>104. <b>Ayo James</b>, aged 35, Calabar. On 2 February 2007, he was arrested in Kaduna on 
suspicion of armed robbery, and brought from the police station to the CID. He was tortured for 
three days, during the daytime for 30 minute to one hour sessions. He was beaten with sticks, 
cables and a sturdy, long bamboo stick. He eventually confessed after the beatings. 
</p>
<p>105. <b>Petrus Umaru</b>, aged 18, Kaduna. On 16 January 2007, he was arrested on suspicion of 
robbery. He was initially brought to a police station where he was beaten with a stick before 
being transferred to the CID later that day. He was tortured in the Panteka for over two days. 
He was beaten with a heavy bamboo stick for about 40 minutes and threatened with death. 
</p>
<p>106. <b>Mohammed &#8220;Mame&#8221; Bello</b>, aged 27. He was arrested on 8 February 2007, on suspicion 
of armed robbery. He was shot by the police in his right leg when he was arrested, and taken 
shortly thereafter to St. Gerard&#8217;s Hospital to get a bandage. He has not received appropriate 
treatment since then. As a result his wound has become seriously infected and without immediate 
treatment his life is at risk. He is unable to walk and cannot move from the place he is sitting (in 
the corridor between the cells). He has no lawyer and is held incommunicado. In the subsequent 
debriefing meeting, the Commissioner of Police explained the lack of medical treatment by the 
lack of financial resources. His assistant, Mr. Eway, however asserted that the detainee was 
brought several times to the local hospital, though this was proved to be untrue upon examining 
Mr. Bello&#8217;s files. The case of Mr. Bello has been included in the communications sent in relation 
to the two severely injured detainees at CID Panti, Lagos (see para. 44 of the annex). By letter 
dated 14 September 2007, the Government informed that Mr. Bello was alive and in prison 
custody in Kaduna. A photograph and medical certificate of Mr. Bello following his treatment 
was also provided by the Government. 
</p>
<p>107. <b>Samaila Adamu</b>, aged 27, Fulani, Kaduna State. On 2 March 2007, he was arrested in 
connection with the theft of a cow. During his interrogation at the CID, in the &#8220;torture room&#8221;, he 
was beaten with a wooden stick and was raised to a height of about two metres by three 
policemen and released. He was forced to sign a confession. He has not been taken to court yet. 
</p>
<p>108. <b>Aboal Hassan</b>, aged 17, Kaduna State. In July 2006, he was arrested on suspicion of 
burglary, and taken to the CID Station. He was interrogated in the Panteka. Over the course of 
four days he was beaten, and whipped. His hands and feed were bound together and he was </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>suspended and swung from the ceiling for 15 minutes at a time. He was forced to sign a 
statement. He has been to court twice, he has no lawyer, and his family is not aware of his 
whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>109. <b>Danladi Hamadi</b>, aged 35. In December 2006, he was arrested about 40 km outside 
Kaduna on suspicion of vandalizing oil pipelines. He was shot in his left leg and taken to 
Gwagwade Police Station. He was beaten with a wooden stick on his wound. After one day he 
was taken to Force CID Headquarters in Kaduna, where he was interrogated, but was not 
ill-treated. In Kaduna he was brought to the general hospital for treatment, whereupon the doctor 
recommended him to be hospitalized. The officers refused. He was brought to court in the first 
week of March 2007, and was granted bail. However, because he has not been able to produce a 
certificate of security, the bail has not yet been effected. 
</p>
<p>110. Ms. <b>Paulina John</b>, aged 35, a nurse. Since 24 February 2007, she has been detained in the 
women&#8217;s cell, and accused of performing an abortion. She reports that she was treating a woman, 
who was six months pregnant, and who subsequently lost her baby. She was interrogated at the 
CID, but was not ill-treated. However she was threatened that if she told anyone about her 
detention she would never be released. She has a lawyer, but police deny him visits. She further 
complains that she is refused access to toilet facilities. 
</p>
<p>111. <b>Recommendations</b>. The Special Rapporteur recommends that immediate medical 
assistance be provided to injured detainees, in particular to Mr. Bello. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that prompt and independent investigations of all torture allegations be carried out 
in order to bring those responsible to justice (i.e. Commissioner of Police Ernest Ibhaze, his 
assistant Alkali Usman Yakubu, the Officer in Charge, as well as Sergeant Danlame, from 
Wakawa, Sabu Police Station, who had been identified by several detainees as a perpetrator of 
torture). 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  KADUNA MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON, KADUNA, KADUNA STATE 
</b>(Visited on 8 March 2007)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. Momodu, the Controller of Prisons, 
Mr. Patrick Ondoma, Chief Inspector of Prison and his staff. Kaduna Prison was built in 1915 
for an inmate population of 547. On the day of the visit, the population was 959, which is served 
by 224 staff. Sixty-three percent of the detainees are awaiting trial; 11 percent were on 
death row, including one woman; and there were ten women detained in total. 
</p>
<p>113. <b>General conditions of detention and treatment</b>. The Special Rapporteur had a 
comparably good impression of the prison. The facilities are clean; detainees get enough food 
and have the possibility for recreational or vocational activities (except those who are 
condemned). With the exception of some allegations on ill-treatment in the women&#8217;s wing, 
he did not receive any strong allegations of torture committed inside the prison. There seems 
to be a consensus among the staff not to inflict corporal punishment. At the time of the visit, 
104 condemned prisoners were held in the prison (Building 5, and in cells next to the gallows), 
many of them already for more than 10 years. Two condemned prisoners were convicted on the 
basis of Sharia law. While he did not receive any explicit allegations of torture, detainees 
complained to the Special Rapporteur that they are barred from participating in any educational, 
vocational or recreational activity. The Special Rapporteur was informed that detainees on death </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
  page 43 
 
</p>
<p>row do not know the exact date of their execution, leaving them under constant fear that they 
could be taken to the gallows at any moment. Visiting family members are left in doubt whether 
their visit has been the last one and do not have the possibility for a final goodbye. Furthermore, 
the body of the executed is not returned to the family for a funeral, but kept as a property of the 
State. Condemned prisoners in cells next to the gallows receive significantly more food than 
other detainees. All detainees have to pay for the arising expenses if admitted to the prison&#8217;s 
hospital. According to the prison authorities, detainees are punished with solitary confinement of 
up to three days for disciplinary offences. However, there were allegations that detainees were 
held in solitary confinement in excess of three days. Prison staff members have not received any 
salary for already three months. 
</p>
<p>114. <b>Sunday John</b>, aged 40, Edo State. On 23 July 2004, he was arrested on suspicion of theft. 
He was brought to CID in Gwagwade, Kaduna where he was detained for five months. He 
confessed under torture, which included being suspended upside down for almost two hours. 
He reports that torture is rampant at this CID; he described the torture room on the first floor. 
At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, he was detained in the punishment cell for one day. 
<b>Abel Samuel</b>, Edo State. He was also arrested in connection with the above case. He was shot by 
officers during the interrogations. The perpetrators were alleged to be Officers Backfire, 
Yayabos, Bako, and Ajeogo. 
115. When conducting interviews with those detainees who were held in the punishment cell, 
the Special Rapporteur found a <b>teenage boy</b>, who was locked up in the cell, additionally 
shackled on the feet, and apparently suffering from a strong mental condition. Due to his 
confused state it was not possible to receive clear information from him. It is the Rapporteur&#8217;s 
opinion that the boy should be seen by a competent psychiatrist and the shackles removed. 
</p>
<p>116. <b>Albert Emem</b>, aged 24, Anambra State. In November 2005, he was arrested in Jos on 
suspicion of robbery. He was detained at CID, in Jos, for two months, and later for one month at 
the CID, in Kaduna. He reports that he was beaten with a heavy piece of wood in Kaduna. 
On 19 January 2006, he was transferred to Kaduna Prison. Since May 2006, he has been detained 
in isolation of the other prisoners as he has had problems with some of them. He can leave his 
cell from morning until 1:30 pm daily. 
</p>
<p>117. <b>Sunday Ikechukwu</b>, aged 39 years. In 2003, he was convicted for robbery. He is presently 
in the prison hospital, suffering from a serious dermatological condition, for which he cannot 
receive appropriate treatment without the necessary medication. 
</p>
<p>118. <b>Yusuf Bashair</b>. In 1998, he was condemned to death for robbery; which was commuted to 
life imprisonment in 1999. He maintains his innocence. 
</p>
<p><b>Female detainee wing 
</b></p>
<p>119. When visited by the Special Rapporteur there were 10 women detained in this wing, 
including 2 convicted and 1 condemned. Seven are awaiting trial. The general conditions of the 
facility are good. However, the Special Rapporteur received allegations of inhumane and 
degrading treatment, according to which women had been chained to their bed for up to three 
days. Furthermore, prison staff had been accused of seizing presents received from visitors. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>120. Ms. <b>Zainab Yahaya</b>, aged 31. For the last two years, she has been detained awaiting trial 
for charges of fraud. Prior to this, she has been detained on numerous occasions for up to several 
weeks at Metro Police Station, Kaduna. On these occasions, she reports that she was arrested and 
rearrested by Sergeant Haruna, who brought her to a warehouse and attempted to rape her. The 
police seized her property. At the police station, she was handcuffed, suspended naked from a 
pole resting on two tables and beaten up. She reports that she was pregnant at the time and lost 
her baby as a result. The prison doctor wrote a letter recommending her release, which was 
supported by the prison director and prison controller. She was granted bail, however the amount 
of Naira 1.7 million in cash is not a condition that she can meet. She reports that all the witnesses 
that have been produced against her by the complainant are members of the police. 
</p>
<p>121. Ms. <b>Halima David</b>, aged 38, Kaduna State. She has been awaiting trial already for 
six years for killing eight children. After her arrest she was taken to the CID, where she was 
detained for one month. She was beaten by a female police officer, forced to swallow teargas, 
and fainted as a result. She cannot recall signing a statement. She reports that she was pregnant at 
the time, lost the baby, was not provided medical treatment, and had to buy medicine with her 
own money. In prison she was beaten by male and female officers. However things improved 
with the arrival of the new prison director. She has had no contact with her seven children, and 
does not know where they are, since her husband died while she was prison. She cannot afford 
a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>122. Ms. <b>Raby Ismail</b>, aged 36 years. She is detained in Kaduna Prison, awaiting the outcome 
of her appeal to the Court of Appeal, Kaduna. Prior to this she was awaiting trial in Kano Prison 
for two years before she was sentenced by the High Court of Kano (No. 11). She has a lawyer 
from Kano. 
</p>
<p>123. <b>Recommendations</b>. The Special Rapporteur recommends that condemned prisoners be 
permitted to participate in the recreational, vocational and educational activities available to 
other detainees. All cases of ill-treatment in the women&#8217;s wing, should be fully investigated, 
leading to disciplinary measures and criminal prosecution against the perpetrators. </p>

<p><b>Appendix II 
</b></p>
<p> By letter dated 14 September 2007, the Nigerian Government provided comments to the 
preliminary version of the report transmitted to it on 9 July 2007: 
</p>
<p>1. I write in fulfilment of Nigeria&#8217;s commitment to the Human Rights Council and in 
acknowledgement of the final draft report submitted by Mr. Manfred Nowak, Special Rapporteur 
on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, on his visit to 
Nigeria from 4 to 10 March 2007. The Federal Government of Nigeria wishes, on behalf of the 
people of Nigeria, to thank the Special Rapporteur for the painstaking effort which he has taken 
to detail the findings of his visit in the report. 
</p>
<p>2. As a state party to the majority of the international human rights instruments, including the 
Convention on Torture, and as a member of the Human Rights Council, Nigeria remains firmly 
committed to the promotion, protection and advancement of human rights, as well as to the 
special procedures mechanism of the Committee against Torture, which affords members the 
opportunity to evaluate and review, through independent and impartial observers, the human 
rights records of all members. Indeed, we consider it to be consistent with the objective of this 
administration to promote a Rule of Law environment that will deepen our democracy. It is 
against this background that the visit of Mr. Manfred Nowak, Special Rapporteur on Torture, 
was undertaken at the invitation and support of the Federal Government of Nigeria. We are 
gratified that the Special Rapporteur highlighted the cooperation he received during his visit, 
including at the highest levels. 
</p>
<p>3. The principal aim of the visit was to &#8216;assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment in 
Nigeria&#8217; and to &#8216;offer assistance to the justice, police and prison sectors&#8217; in the Government&#8217;s 
effort to fulfil its commitments under the Convention, in a way that enables the Nigerian 
Government to correct, improve and strengthen its observance of human rights requirements in 
governance. It was clear to the Government that to achieve these the inquiry had to be open, 
unfettered and objective. It is indeed quite gratifying to note that the Special Rapporteur in his 
report acknowledged the commitment and willingness of the Nigerian Government to subject 
itself to the universal periodic review. He also acknowledged the country&#8217;s commitment to 
establishing the necessary legal framework for the promotion and protection of human rights, 
through the signing, ratification and domestication of various international and regional 
instruments. 
</p>
<p>4. The only hitch during the visit was in connection with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s inability to 
inspect the holding cells of the Directorate of State Services (DSS). The Government views this 
hitch more as an administrative lapse rather than a deliberate attempt to conceal anything from 
him. The Special Rapporteur arrived at the location without prior knowledge on Sunday night; 
the low-level cadres he met had neither authority nor instruction to let him into the facility. 
However, in spite of the need for free and unfettered access to places of concern and interest, it is 
the view of the Nigerian Government that these visits be properly coordinated to achieve the 
desired results. The Government regrets this unfortunate incident, which it hopes can be avoided 
in future through proper coordination and communication. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.4 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p>5. The Government notes with satisfaction that the Special Rapporteur has accorded due 
significance to the enormous challenges faced by the State, such as the size of the population and 
country, ethnic and religious diversity, high level of crime, poverty, federal character, etc. in 
addressing developmental, human rights issues and crime in the country. While the Government 
does not intend to justify torture and ill-treatment under any circumstances, it is hoped that the 
international community understands the enormous challenges faced by law-enforcement 
agencies in a developing nation as our own. Some of these challenges are highlighted in the 
Special Rapporteurs report and may have a direct correlation with his observations on the 
attitude of the police to suspects; the lack of an effective complaints mechanism; the 
unsatisfactory state of detention facilities; the under-resourced and over-stretched criminal 
justice system; Sharia Law and corporal punishment, etc. 
</p><p>6. Whereas the Government takes the various conclusions reached and recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur in good spirit and good faith, it takes serious exception to the 
sweeping generalization on the alleged widespread nature and application of torture in the 
Nigerian Police and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) formations, based on his 
visits to only three police posts (out of more than 3,000 around the country), notably in Abuja, 
Kaduna and Lagos. The Government is of the view that the conclusion is indeed too sweeping 
and generalized. It is not logical to use information from a small sample (in this case less 
than 0.1 per cent) to reach a universal conclusion. 
</p>
<p>7. It is also important to underscore the fact that Police officers are accountable and that they 
do not operate with such impunity as suggested in the report. The Police Service Commission, 
the National Human Rights Commission, and various disciplinary organs at respective police 
formations, are empowered to examine and address these excesses when they are reported. Such 
disciplinary actions are reported regularly in the vibrant Nigerian press. This notwithstanding, 
the Government welcomes the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur to increase the 
training received by the police and to broaden their sensitivity and awareness on human rights 
issues. It would be pleasing to note that bold steps are already being taken to train and reposition 
the police along this path. The human rights desk, already established in every police station and 
command is to ensure that the rights of the accused are respected and the rule of law applied in 
the administration of law and justice. 
</p><p>8. The Government also views, with grave seriousness and importance, the concerns raised 
by the Special Rapporteur about the fate of three detainees who he interviewed and whose 
whereabouts became unknown shortly after his visit, which made him to conclude, again without 
any reasonable basis, that extrajudicial killings were &#8216;widespread&#8217; across the country. The 
Government recognizes the negative effect the fear of reprisals by interviewees will have on the 
entire review process and is therefore committed to unravelling the circumstances leading to and 
surrounding the deaths, which it has established, of two of the detainees, namely; Mr. Elijah John 
and Mr. Bayo Abdurmo Adekunk. Their deaths are presently being investigated and the 
Government is committed and determined to hold all these found guilty, accountable. On the 
other hand, the Government is pleased to report that the third detainee, Mr. Mohammed Bello, is 
alive and in prison custody in Kaduna. 
</p>
<p>9. While appreciating the concern for the safety and welfare of the detainees shown by the 
Special Rapporteur, the Government rejects the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur, based only 
on these two isolated cases, that extra judicial killing is a widespread practice across the country. </p>

</p>
<p>It must be underscored that the Special Procedure process is designed to assist members to 
improve, promote and/or strengthen their human rights capacity and records. For this reason, 
disparaging remarks and conclusions which are largely unsubstantiated must be avoided 
especially in the interest of objectivity and fairness. 
</p><p>10. Nigeria welcomes the recommendations made in the report for the decongestion of its 
prisons and the improvement of the welfare of the prisoners. The Government is pleased to 
confirm that it has, as part of the decongestion process, released all prisoners over 60 and 
70 years old, as well as all prisoners on death row who have served for more than 10 years. The 
Government has also built new prisons and is committed to the building of additional prisons, in 
the broader interest of improving the detention condition of detainees and inmates. 
</p>
<p>11. Finally, the Nigerian Government finds the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report useful and would 
endeavour to incorporate some of his recommendations in its broader plan of completely 
eliminating torture and ill-treatment in law enforcement. The Government also recognizes the 
continuous nature of this evaluative process and therefore welcomes the call made by the Special 
Rapporteur on the international community to support and assist in the building of capacities that 
would enable the country attain and reach the noble objective of projecting and promoting the 
highest standards of human rights.
