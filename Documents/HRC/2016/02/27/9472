<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Vernor Mu&#241;oz, visited Germany 
from 13 to 21 February 2006.  The Special Rapporteur extends his gratitude to the Government 
of Germany for the invitation and to those whom he met in the course of the visit. 
</p>
<p> During the mission, the Special Rapporteur analysed the enjoyment of the right to 
education in light of four cross-cutting themes:  (1) the impact of the German federal system; 
(2) the reform of the education system initiated as an outcome of the results of the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) programme for international student 
assessment (PISA); (3) the education system structure; and (4) the paradigm shift on migration, 
in conjunction with demographic changes and socio-economic factors. 
 The Constitution of Germany provides that the &#8220;L&#228;nder&#8221; (states) have almost a full 
jurisdiction in educational matters.  Each &#8220;Land&#8221; (state) has extensive powers on education 
matters, regulated by legislation adopted by its Parliament.  Consequently, Germany does not 
have a unified education system, since there is no consistent framework across the different 
L&#228;nder.  At the federal level, different bodies are in charge of certain tasks related to policy 
debates and national coordination.  One of the most important is the Standing Conference of the 
Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the L&#228;nder (KMK), which ensures coordination 
between and among the L&#228;nder and the federal authorities and is in charge of education, research 
and cultural policies, as well as advanced training.  Moreover, the administration of education is 
under shared supervision of the central administration and self-governing local authorities and as 
a result schools have reduced autonomy. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, several studies undertaken under the PISA programme have revealed that in 
Germany there is high co-relation between social/migrant background of students and 
educational achievement.  This, among other reasons, has been a trigger for education reform.  
The reform focuses mainly on the necessity to move to a system which supports better the 
specific learning needs of each individual student.  On this point, the Special Rapporteur urges 
the Government to reconsider the multitrack school system, which is selective and could lead to 
a form of de facto discrimination.  Indeed, the Special Rapporteur believes that the classification 
process which takes place at lower secondary level (average age of students is 10, depending on 
each Land&#8217;s regulation) does not assess students in an adequate manner and instead of being 
inclusive, is exclusive; since he could verify during the visit that, for example, poor and migrant 
children - as well as children with disabilities - are negatively affected by the classification 
system. 
</p>
<p> Finally, regarding migrant children and children with disabilities, the Special Rapporteur 
considers that it is necessary to take action to overcome social disparities and to ensure equitable 
and equal educational opportunities to every child, especially those who are part of a 
marginalized sector of the population. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In this addendum to his report, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education reports 
on his mission to Germany, which took place from 13 to 21 February 2006.  The Special 
Rapporteur expresses his sincere appreciation to the Government of Germany for the cooperation 
extended to him in preparation, and throughout the course of his mission.  In particular, he is 
grateful to the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), 
and the Secretariat of the Standing Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs 
(KMK).  He also extends his thanks to the authorities of the various L&#228;nder he was able to visit.  
Special thanks are also extended to the German Institute of Human Rights, as well as to all the 
education authorities, teachers, students, teacher unions, parents, parents&#8217; organizations and 
researchers for their assistance and their time. 
</p>
<p>2. The objective of the mission was to understand, in the spirit of cooperation and dialogue, 
how Germany endeavours to implement the human right to education, the measures taken for its 
successful realization and the obstacles encountered. 
</p>
<p>3. Throughout his mission, the Special Rapporteur considered the enjoyment of the right to 
education in light of four cross-cutting themes, namely:  (1) the impact of the German federal 
system, taking into account the effects of the reunification, on a coherent and uniform education 
policy, and in the context of the demands of European integration and globalization; (2) the 
reform of the education system initiated as an outcome of the results of the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) programme for international student 
assessment (PISA); (3) the education system structure; and (4) the paradigm shift on migration, 
in conjunction with demographic changes and socio-economic factors. 
</p><p>4. The Special Rapporteur notes that it is impossible to address in depth all 
right-to-education issues in Germany or to do justice to the situation, in view of the 
wealth of experience and sophistication of the German education system, within the 
allocated word limit. 
</p>
<p>5. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Federal Minister of Education and 
Research and the Minister of State at the Federal Chancellery and Commissioner of the Federal 
Government for Migration, Refugees and Integration, as well as with senior officials of the 
Federal Ministries of Education, Science and Research; Family, Youth and Sports; Foreign 
Affairs and the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the 
L&#228;nder.  The Special Rapporteur met with members of the Federal Parliament.  In the course of 
the visit, the Special Rapporteur also met with the Commissioner of the Land Brandenburg for 
National and International Affairs; and representatives of the Ministries of Education of Land 
Brandenburg and Land Berlin, as well as the Minister of Education and Senior Officials of the 
Ministries of Education of Land Bayern. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of United Nations agencies 
and several non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  He also met with teachers, parents and 
students; trade unions; journalists and academics.  The Special Rapporteur visited preschool 
education facilities, Grundschule (primary schools), Hauptschule, Gesamtschule, F&#246;rderschule 
and Gymnasium, as well as a centre and school for children with cerebral palsy, in Berlin, 
Potsdam, Munich, Cologne and Bonn. </p>

</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere thanks to all those whom he met.  He also 
expresses his deep appreciation for the warmth and frankness in the meetings he had and for the 
constructive self-criticism expressed by some of his interlocutors at the governmental level.  The 
meetings allowed him to appreciate the unequivocal commitment of the Government to provide 
education to all. 
</p>
<p><b>I. THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION:  PRINCIPLES,  
NORMS AND STANDARDS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) provided the foundation 
for the international legal framework regarding the right to education.  Subsequently, the right to 
education was enshrined in a wide range of international and regional human rights instruments, 
including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the European Social Charter. 
</p>
<p>9. The Government of Germany has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 
as well as other major human rights treaties including the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Social Charter.  
These treaties contain important provisions related to the right to education and provide a 
framework for legislation and policy at national level. 
</p>
<p>10. According to international human rights law, in particular the relevant provisions of 
ICESCR and CRC, together with general comments Nos. 11 and 13 of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the right to education, that right includes, inter alia, 
non-discriminatory, economic and geographical access to schools; availability of quality schools 
services and infrastructures; appropriate, adequate and quality education provided to students 
and an education adapted to the social and cultural environment.  Primary education should be 
compulsory and free, secondary education available to all and progressively free and higher 
education accessible to all on the basis of capacity and progressively free.  In short, the right to 
education can be understood as a right to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, goods and 
services necessary for the realization of that right.  A State party to the relevant international 
treaties has an obligation to ensure the realization of the right to education, to the maximum of 
its available resources. 
</p>
<p>11. States parties to international human rights treaties have an obligation to give effect to the 
provisions contained in the treaties.  This includes an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil 
human rights, including the right to education.  In view of its ratification of international legal 
instruments such as ICESCR, CEDAW, CRC, the European Convention on Human Rights and 
the Human Rights European Social Charter, the Government of Germany has an obligation to 
respect, protect and fulfil the right to education for those within its jurisdiction. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>12. In addition to its international legal obligations, Germany has committed to achieving 
various education-related goals through its participation in recent international and regional 
conferences including, inter alia, the Millennium Summit of the General Assembly, the 
International Conference on Population and Development, the Fourth World Conference on 
Women, the World Summit for Social Development, the United Nations General Assembly 
Special Session for Children, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, and the United Nations General Assembly Special Session 
on HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Domestic legal framework and national policies 
</b></p>
<p>13. Germany is a federal country and the constitution (the Basic Law) provides the 16 L&#228;nder 
(states) with nearly sole jurisdiction in educational matters.  The Basic Law gives only limited 
power to the Federal State in order to ensure the unhindered movement of citizens throughout the 
country and their fundamental constitutional rights, such as parental rights, academic freedom or 
equality before the law.  It is the Minister of Education and Research (Bundesminister fur 
Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) that is responsible for some educational aspects at the federal 
level. 
</p>
<p>14. On culture and science related issues, the Basic Law contains some fundamental 
provisions:  the entire school system is under State supervision (art. 7, sect. 1), and it guarantees 
freedom for art, science, research and teaching (art. 5, sect. 3), freedom of belief and creed 
(art. 4), religious instruction in accordance with the doctrines of the religious communities 
(art. 7, sects. 2 and 3), the right to establish private schools (art. 7, sect. 4), the freedom to 
choose one&#8217;s profession and place of training (art. 12, sect. 1), equality before the law 
(art. 3, sect. 1) as well as parental rights (art. 6, sect. 2). 
</p>
<p>15. Through the legislation adopted by their parliaments, the L&#228;nder have extensive 
legislative authorities and powers in the field of education, especially in relation to schools, 
higher education and adult education.  The ministries at the Land level have the authority to issue 
statutory and administrative decisions and exercise supervisory functions over all educational 
structures under their jurisdiction. 
</p><p>16. Since the establishment of the Federal Republic, the role of the federal authorities in 
education has often led to policy debates, while the need for national coordination resulted in the 
creation of various federal level bodies.  The most relevant one for the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur is the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the 
L&#228;nder (KMK) which was founded in 1948, even before the establishment of the Federal 
Republic.  The fact that all its resolutions should be adopted unanimously by the participating 
ministers is one of the most important features of the KMK.  Once a resolution is adopted, it is 
implemented by the L&#228;nder through their own legislative and administrative acts and procedures.  
The KMK is able to ensure coordination between and among the different L&#228;nder and the 
Federal State.  It also aims to provide a minimum common ground for the German education 
system.  The KMK is responsible for education policies, higher education and research policies, 
further and advanced training, as well as cultural policies and provides a forum to express views 
and present common concerns. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>17. The Basic Law provides for special forms of cooperation between the federal 
Government and the L&#228;nder with regard to specific issues, such as educational planning and the 
promotion of scientific research institutions and projects at supra-regional level.  Another body 
established at the federal level in the early 1970s, the Commission for Education Planning and 
Research Promotion (BLK), is responsible for this cooperation.  It is an intergovernmental body, 
which cooperates with the various sectoral conferences of ministers.  The BLK enhances 
innovation through the promotion of pilot programmes.  Following Germany&#8217;s recent federalism 
reform, the joint Federation-L&#228;nder task &#8220;Educational Planning&#8221; has been redefined as 
&#8220;Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Education System by International Standards&#8221; (see new 
article 91 (b) of the German Basic Law). 
</p>
<p>18. Vocational education and training represent an exception to the generally limited role 
of federal institutions in the education field.  The Federal Institute for Vocational Training 
(BIBB) has long been a key player in this field.  There are several national institutes active in 
educational research, but no national agency is responsible for such policy relevant functions as 
standard-setting, performance evaluation or school development.  In recent years, new demands 
have emerged for a greater federal role.  This was demonstrated by the establishment and the 
success of the <i>Forum bildung</i> (led by BLK and BMBF) and a study commissioned by the federal 
Government &#8220;On the development of national educational standards&#8221;, supported the L&#228;nder in 
establishing national standards in the education field.  In this context, a national institute for 
monitoring the implementation of educational standards in the school system - Institute for 
Quality Development in the Education System - was created in 2004 with financial support from 
the L&#228;nder and the federal Government.  National standards are indeed set in dual vocational 
training through training regulations and framework curricula in agreement between the federal 
Government, the L&#228;nder and the social parties.  For vocational training in full-time schools, the 
process of developing competency-oriented (&#8220;national&#8221;) educational standards across the L&#228;nder 
was initiated in the Standing Conference in mid-2005.  First results are expected in mid-2007.  
The Institute for Quality Development in the Education System (IQB) was established by the 
L&#228;nder and is also financed by them without support from the federal Government. 
</p>
<p>19. The administration of education is rather centralized in the different L&#228;nder, even if small 
differences can be detected.  Most L&#228;nder administers education in line with common European 
models characterized by shared responsibility between the central administration headed by the 
Minister of Education and self-governing local authorities.  In the education sector, regional and 
district authorities operate under the direct supervision of the Minister of Education.  These 
authorities are responsible for legal and professional supervision and inspection.  Schools operate 
in a highly regulated environment:  operational rules are defined by higher authorities and 
schools themselves have relatively little impact on teaching programmes, personnel or material 
resources.  Measured by the PISA index of school autonomy, German schools are less 
autonomous than the OECD average. 
</p>
<p>20. The structure of local government consists of 445 district governments, 313 of which are 
town municipalities.  In addition, the three city states of Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg have the 
status of a Land.  The role of local governments differs among the L&#228;nder.  While in most of the 
L&#228;nder, the local government is confined to assuring the physical infrastructure of schools, in 
other L&#228;nder it is increasing.  For instance, in North-Rhine-Westphalia, the 150 municipal 
self-governments have played a noticeable role in shaping the school system.  In 
Baden-Wurttemberg, the government has transferred many administrative services from the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>ministry of education to the local governments.  Municipal authorities may play a role in 
personnel policy as well, as the employers of auxiliary personnel, kindergarten teachers or, in 
some cases, replacement of teachers.  
</p>
<p>21. Germany has established mechanisms to ensure teacher participation in the development 
of teaching policies.  Their involvement is ensured not only through teachers&#8217; organizations but 
also by their direct participation in different consultative bodies, such as councils at the school, 
regional and land levels.  Teachers are represented by trade unions and professional associations.  
Most teachers are organized into two main groups of unions:  the Trade Union of Education and 
Science that belongs to the German Trade Union Confederation and then several unions which 
form part of the German Federation of Civil Servants. 
</p>
<p>22. Trade unions and teachers&#8217; organizations are consulted regarding most of the matters that 
affect them.  They also represent the interest of their corporation at the federal level with regard 
to initiatives developed by the KMK. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  KEY FEATURES OF THE GERMAN EDUCATION SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p>23. Germany - together with Belgium and the Netherlands - is one of the three OECD 
countries that have increased the age of compulsory education to 18.  The school system 
is characterized by relatively high enrolment rates at all school levels.  In 2001, for example, 
89 per cent of the 15-19 years of age were enrolled in schools, which was well above the OECD 
average (78 per cent).  It has to be stressed, however, that at upper secondary level more than 
half the students attend school on a part-time basis as part of their vocational education, and the 
proportion of upper secondary students enrolled in programmes that provide qualifications to 
enter university (Abitur) is lower (37 per cent) than the OECD country average of 49 per cent. 
</p>
<p>24. The structure of the German school system is complex and diverse.  Although Germany 
does not have a unified school structure there is, in practice, a recognizable common framework 
across the different L&#228;nder.  It is interesting to note that despite general acknowledgement of the 
importance of preschool education, preschool is not yet seen as a fully integrated part of the 
school system in its narrower sense.  It comprises facilities (largely kindergartens) for children 
from age 3 to 6, which is the age for obligatory entry in school.  Children of 6 who have not yet 
attained a sufficient level of development to attend primary school have further options such as 
Schulkindergartens or Vorklassen.  These institutions are either assigned to the preschool or the 
primary sector depending on the particular Land.  Attendance is usually voluntary, although in 
most L&#228;nder the authorities are entitled to make it compulsory for children who have reached 
school age (6 years) but are not yet ready for school. 
</p>
<p>25. Once children reach the age of 6, they are, as a rule - except for the above-mentioned 
example - obliged to attend primary school.  All children integrate the Grundschule which covers 
four years, except for Berlin and Brandenburg where the Grundschule covers six years.  The 
transition from primary school to one of the different lower secondary schools where pupils 
should remain until the completion of their full-time compulsory school attendance is dealt with 
differently according to the Land.  The lower secondary level, which starts relatively early (at the 
age of 10 in most L&#228;nder), is highly fragmented.  At that lower secondary level, there is a greater 
variety of programmes and school types than in most European countries:  Hauptschule (lower 
level secondary school programme, is in most cases integrated with primary schools and </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>normally covers grade 5 to 9, and provides access to vocational education and training), 
Realschule (intermediate level general secondary school; it normally covers grade 5 to 10, and 
provides access to upper secondary education); Gymnasium (academic school that combines 
lower and upper secondary levels and lasts 8 to 9 years); integrated schools (Gesamtschule) and 
multi-track schools (comprehensive schools providing a unified programme or various 
programmes in a single institution; Special education schools (Sonderschulen/Forderschulen) for 
children with special needs; and finally, alternative schools (typically private schools, especially 
religious affiliated schools).  It should be noted that not all L&#228;nder have all existing school types.  
In some L&#228;nder there are no Haupschule or integrated schools.  Moreover, private schools are 
not necessarily organized according to the main format of the lower secondary level in most 
L&#228;nder. 
</p>
<p><b>III. EDUCATION REFORM IN LIGHT OF THE OECD PROGRAMME  
FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ASSESSMENT (PISA) 
</b></p>
<p>26. In 1997, OECD member countries launched the programme for international student 
assessment (PISA) with the aim of monitoring the extent to which students near the end of 
compulsory schooling have acquired the knowledge and skills essential for full participation in 
society.  PISA assessments began comparing students&#8217; knowledge and skills in the areas of 
reading, mathematics, science and problem solving.  The assessment of student performance in 
selected schools took place with the understanding, though, that students&#8217; success in life depends 
on a much wider range of competencies (which have also been developed and used by the 
OECD). 
</p>
<p>27. In Germany, the issue of pupil performance has for some time been the subject of public 
policy debate.  The Standing Conference has actively taken up the issue with its resolution of 
October 1997 (called &#8220;Constance&#8221; resolution) and its participation in international and national 
comparative surveys.  The Standing Conference has also expressed its intention to use 
competition between the L&#228;nder as a means to improve education quality. 
</p>
<p>28. In that regard, and in order to be able to introduce targeted quality improvement 
measures, regular assessments of educational outcomes to benchmark strengths and weaknesses 
in the education system are a key requirement.  Therefore, the Standing Conference is involved 
in various simultaneous surveys, such as PISA, PISA-E, thematic reviews on PISA and PISA-E, 
PIRLS/IGLU; IGLU-E, TIMSS-study and DESI. 
</p>
<p>29. As mentioned above, PISA is a programme undertaken by the OECD and is part of a 
longer term and broadly based quality assurance strategy.  It comprises a periodic review with a 
different focus each time (PISA 2000 focused on reading literacy; PISA 2003 on mathematical 
literacy and PISA 2006 on scientific literacy).  PISA-E is the extension of the international 
survey to a comparative study between the L&#228;nder.  In the framework of the thematic reviews on 
PISA and PISA-E, the Standing Conference commissioned additional thematic reviews on social 
background and school performance; reading literacy; the role of school, family and peers with 
regard to subject and trans-disciplinary learning; mathematical literacy, scientific literacy and 
problem-solving competencies.  Besides the above national reports, the federal Government in 
consultation with the L&#228;nder also very much supported the preparation of international thematic 
PISA reports, thus in particular the report on the performance of students with a migration 
background in an international comparison.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>30. The international study PIRLS/IGLU (Progress in International Reading Literacy 
Study/International Grundschul-Lese-Untersuchung) is carried out by the international 
association for the evaluation of educational achievement.  This study allows to assess the level 
of understanding of texts by pupils in the 4th grade.  IGLU-E is the extension of the IGLU study 
at the national level with a comparison between the L&#228;nder. 
</p>
<p>31. In the DESI (Deutsch-English-Sch&#252;lerleistungen-International/German-English 
International Student Performance) national comparative survey, basic information about the 
performance level of pupils in 9th grade was collected with regard to English as well as to the 
command of the German language.  The objective of the study was to develop explanatory 
approaches with regard to education and school policy international, the revision of curricula, 
textbooks and teaching materials, as well as with regard to teacher training. 
</p>
<p>32. The results of the various cycles of PISA and PISA-E show that school performance in 
Germany was partly below the OECD average (PISA 2000), at the average (PISA 2003), and 
partly a little above the average (problem solving skills in PISA 2006).  Weaknesses were 
identified particularly with regard to tasks which require a qualitative understanding of the 
context and which cannot be solved by resorting to routine knowledge.  Moreover, the study 
established a correlation between the social background and the acquisition of competencies.  
Young people from families with a migrant background - especially families which speak a 
language other than German at home remain on average clearly below the competence level 
achieved by 15-year-old students whose parents were born in Germany.  Support for pupils from 
a migrant background seems more successful in other countries than in Germany. 
</p>
<p>33. The PISA shock has been a trigger for a new education reform.  The poor results scored 
by German students in the PISA study caused a great shock in the country.  The main finding of 
PISA shows that Germany has the highest co-relation between social background and 
educational achievement compared to other industrialized countries. 
</p>
<p>34. After a first evaluation of the results reported for Germany, the Standing Conference 
agreed on seven priority fields of action:  (1) improvement of language competence as early as 
preschool education especially for children with a migration background; (2) strengthening of 
the link between the preschool sector and primary school with the aim of an early school entry; 
(3) improvement of primary education and the continuous improvement of reading literacy and 
basic understanding of mathematical and scientific concepts; (4) efficient support of 
educationally disadvantaged children with particular regard to children and youths with a 
migrant background; (5) thorough development and assurance of the quality of teaching and 
schools on the basis of binding educational standards and result-oriented evaluation; 
(6) improvement of professionalism in teaching with particular regard to diagnostic and 
methodical competence as an element of systematic school development; (7) expansion of the 
provision of school and non-school activities for the whole day with the aim of increasing 
opportunities for education and support with particular regard to pupils with educational deficits 
and especially gifted pupils. 
</p>
<p>35. The first measure of language support at preschool level was considered as a key measure 
by the German authorities.  It is felt that this support should be anchored even more strongly in 
the educational work of children&#8217;s day facilities and preschool classes and parents are to be more 
strongly involved.  The use and further development of a methodological set of instruments for </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>the expansion of diagnosis and the support of language competencies are of particular 
importance in this respect.  In this connection, important instruments are the determination of 
language level prior to compulsory education and, building on that, language support courses by 
which the L&#228;nder want to assure adequate competencies for all children entering primary school. 
</p>
<p>36. Parents are now involved in the educational process of their children through German 
courses and increased information and availability of advice about preschool opportunities.  The 
improvement of the qualification of educators is also planned through training reforms and 
intensive in-service training on intercultural education and language support.  In order to 
optimize the transition of children to primary schools, educators are to cooperate to a greater 
extent with primary school teaching staff.  Some L&#228;nder are even providing joint- in-service 
training for those involved in preschool and school education. 
</p>
<p>37. At the primary level, German authorities are aiming at reducing the number of school 
deferments and at encouraging early enrolment in primary school.  In view of the PISA results, 
the majority of L&#228;nder decided to intensify cooperation between preschool facilities and primary 
school by allowing flexible school enrolment phases.  This flexible phases offer the opportunity 
to complete the first two years in one to three years depending on individual abilities.  The other 
objective is to enrol all children in primary school on schedule in order to avoid deferment in 
school entry.  This would also allow mixing various age groups allowing for targeted specific 
support for faster and slower learners. 
</p>
<p>38. The skills areas defined in PISA were included in the revision of the curricula for schools 
at the lower secondary level, which focused on:  (1) the acquisition of basic competencies in 
German and mathematics, as well as the promotion of social competencies; (2) the drawing up of 
binding standards and evaluation criteria related to different age groups.  The requirements lay 
down the abilities, competencies and knowledge which pupils should have at each step of their 
school career; (3) alongside a clearer definition of the compulsory elements, scope will be 
provided or expanded for teaching methods to encourage pupils and strengthen problem-solving 
thinking.  The KMK considers that the mastering of the German language is key to school 
success and full integration in the German society.  In that regard, language learning classes are 
offered to children whose mother tongue is not German and/or who have insufficient knowledge 
of German.  In addition to those intensified classes, additional care for all pupils in the 
afternoons helps intensify language learning. 
</p>
<p>39. Among the priorities identified by the KMK, measures for the effective support of 
educationally disadvantaged children with and without migrant background are implemented.  
Besides language support classes, mechanisms of cooperation between schools and child welfare 
centres were established in order to develop networking and cooperative structures, support and 
advice on support initiatives.  Furthermore, special contingents of teachers of German as a 
second language, as well as the recruitment of teachers with migrant background are intended to 
support the success at school of pupils with migrant background.  At the lower secondary level, a 
number of L&#228;nder are initiating or supporting programmes or pilot projects in schools aiming at 
reducing the number of children leaving school without qualification.  Their objective is to 
strengthen the motivation and individual responsibility of pupils in the transition into the labour 
market.  This includes practical learning classes at Hauptschulen, the combination of formal </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>learning at school and work experience, vocational orientation days as well as pilot projects for 
vocational orientation and preparation.  There are programmes to promote the integration in the 
labour market of young adults threatened by unemployment, in particular migrants and pupils 
with German language deficits.  These measures are carried out, for example, by vocational 
schools in cooperation with youth and community work organizations. 
</p>
<p>40. Among the many measures identified, teacher training and full day schools are to be 
implemented also as a matter of priority.  The reform of teacher training implies making teaching 
methods and counselling more professional.  In that regard, teachers should be trained to 
reinforce their didactical and methodological competencies as well as their competencies in 
diagnoses of student performance.  Training is particularly important for German language 
teachers who would have to teach German to children for whom German is not their mother 
tongue.  As a result of the resolution &#8220;Standards for teacher training:  education studies&#8221; 
(resolution of the Standing Conference of 16 December 2004) - the L&#228;nder implemented training 
and further training modules in teacher training for the increased further training of teaching staff 
with regard to teaching theory and methodological competencies.  In that regard, the Special 
Rapporteur noted that despite governmental efforts to reinforce and strengthen language 
teaching, the results seem to be below expectations.  In his view the problem lies with the fact 
that German is taught as a second language to children who speak another language at home but 
teachers often use the same methodology they use to teach German speaking students.  Existing 
methodologies teaching German as a second or target language should be expanded and used 
when required. 
</p>
<p>41. Moreover, efforts are being implemented by more and more L&#228;nder to set up whole-day 
provisions and full-time schools.  This includes the combination of teaching for all pupils, 
distributed in a compulsory manner across morning and afternoon with extra-curricular 
activities, as well as schools offering additional educational and care facilities on, at least, three 
days per week.  In some L&#228;nder, the above measures are supplemented by afternoon activities 
carried out by partners outside school premises, such as music classes, sports associations, etc. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  EDUCATION CHALLENGES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Initial considerations 
</b></p>
<p>42. Germany has good public education coverage (approximately 90 per cent), an underlying 
factor in the country&#8217;s remarkable scientific and technological development.  Besides the fact 
that the State provides funding for many of the educational needs under this coverage, it should 
be stressed that very extensive State coverage of educational needs helps forestall the emergence 
of private education businesses, which could hinder the development of a sense of social 
solidarity among the population.  For this reason, efforts to strengthen public education should 
continue and should be extended to reach those population sectors which are currently at risk of 
being excluded. 
</p>
<p>43. As noted by the Special Rapporteur, it is in the German tradition to come up with 
institutional responses to meet any problems arising in the educational system, thereby ensuring 
that the country&#8217;s educational reforms respond to its economic, social and political challenges. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>44. The reunification of Germany, for example, posed enormous challenges in virtually all 
development areas, including that of institution-building, entailing the need for efforts to 
mitigate poverty and to devise coherent and efficient educational management models, given that 
the wide disparities between the areas previously forming part of the former German Democratic 
Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany remained in place and required urgent attention. 
</p>
<p>45. Accordingly, the new political and territorial configuration of the Federation should 
respond to the educational needs of the country&#8217;s more impoverished regions, which have been 
unable to resolve crucial problems relating to quality of education and to educational 
opportunities - or the lack thereof.  Given the increasing autonomy exercised by the L&#228;nder in 
developing their educational systems, it would seem that, at the federal level, it is not always 
possible to ensure that these processes are egalitarian.  For example, the per capita budgetary 
allocations for education vary significantly from Land to Land, and the federal Government is 
unable to intervene in any decisive manner to restore the balance between them. 
</p>
<p>46. The discrepancies between the educational systems operating in the different L&#228;nder 
(some of which follow a two-track, and others even a three-track, system) could be considered a 
matter of a range of choices.  In practice, however, the lack of uniformity can cause difficulties 
for pupils whose families have to move home, for example.  There would seem to be problems in 
ensuring that educational opportunities are provided in a uniform manner, given that the 
availability of education depends on the place where pupils and their families actually live. 
</p>
<p>47. Germany, like many other countries, is facing various challenges which impact education 
policies and reforms.  Globalization means that education has a leading role in ensuring 
Germany&#8217;s competitiveness at the international level.  Even more rapid changes in the working 
world as a result of globalization are continuing to increase the need for highly qualified 
workers.  Unskilled workers are less and less needed.  The even more rapid increase in 
knowledge and in the availability of knowledge is creating great opportunities for personal, 
societal and economic progress, whilst at the same time increasing the risk of exclusion for those 
people who do not have adequate access to continuous further education in the course of their 
lives. 
</p>
<p>48. These changes and the increasing complexity of society require values which enable 
participation in the further development of society.  Growing European and international 
integration are placing high demands on intercultural and language competencies as well as the 
willingness to be mobile.  The demographic changes aggravate such challenges. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur notes that the successful reform of the German education system 
as a whole presupposes both reforms of content and structure.  Seven priorities should be 
highlighted:  (1) move from a selective education system to a system which supports the 
individual and focuses on the person&#8217;s specific learning abilities; (2) schools should be more 
independent, meaning that schools should be flexible and autonomous in the use of fundings, 
recruitment of teachers and implementation of central objectives; (3) improve education contents 
and methods, especially through systematic language training for migrants, strengthening 
reading skills, and introduction of new media; (4) strengthen democratic school culture by giving 
the child more autonomy and the possibility for children to use their competencies; (5) structures 
should give anyone a chance to develop his and her own potential, through strengthened 
kindergarten opportunities, introduction of full-day schools, and abandoning the multi-track </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>school system.  Regarding the latter, it should be noted that - despite successful foreign examples 
of one school system for all pupils which allows children to learn together for a longer period of 
time thus encouraging all children to reach better results - the discussion of the multi-track 
system, which appears extremely selective to the Special Rapporteur, seems to trigger great 
anxiety and resistance, especially anxiety over the loss of privilege for those who benefit most 
from the current system; (6) a different training for teachers who should not only be specialized 
in their teaching field but also at the pedagogical level; (7) greater investments and funds for 
early-childhood support, for which funds should be better invested and distributed.  Many 
L&#228;nder are already extremely active in implementing various of the above priorities, such as 
priorities 1, 3, 6 and 7. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Social opportunities and education opportunities 
</b></p>
<p>50. As pointed out by the Special Rapporteur in his previous reports,<b>1</b> education serves 
purposes which are clearly specified in international human rights instruments and it cannot be 
reduced merely to tackling problems arising in the political and economic domains.  It is 
accordingly clear that, judging by the inequalities affecting education, there is an overarching 
social inequality by which education is determined. 
</p>
<p>51. The relative inequalities persisting in the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, 
have been sufficiently documented both in social and economic studies and in educational 
literature.  It is known, for example, that close on 1.5 million persons live in straitened social and 
economic circumstances and depend on State assistance to meet their domestic needs. 
</p>
<p>52. Social imbalances also affect the demographic make-up of the L&#228;nder, since some of 
these are experiencing heavy immigration flows and have higher poverty levels than others. 
</p>
<p>53. These social and economic restrictions come hand in hand with educational limitations 
which also impede the school performance and intellectual development of school pupils.  The 
effects of this social inequality are reflected in the opportunities for educational advancement, as 
may be seen from the studies by PISA. 
</p>
<p><b>Fragmented and selective approach 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur noted that the system of classifying schoolchildren in lower 
secondary education (which starts from age 10) includes an individual assessment of the pupil by 
teachers who have not always been properly trained in performing this kind of service.  This 
process is governed by a statute which varies from Land to Land, another factor compounding 
the problems already identified.  The Special Rapporteur believes that the education authorities 
might be attaching disproportionate weight to the linguistic competence of schoolchildren, given 
that one of the key elements of the classification assessment is their proficiency in German.  This 
element has the effect of discriminating against schoolchildren of foreign origin whose mother 
tongue is not German. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Documents E/CN.4/2005/50 and E/CN.4/2006/45. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>55. It is clear that this early classification militates against the less advantaged children and 
teenagers, such as those living in poverty, of immigrant origin or with disabilities.  This 
conclusion is supported by one incontrovertible fact:  at the <i>Hauptschule</i>, poor children of 
immigrant origin are over-represented, while at the <i>Gymnasium </i>they are underrepresented.  As a 
result, the system would appear to have a negative effect, since the disadvantaged end up being 
doubly disadvantaged. 
</p>
<p>56. The classification system tends to move the educational system away from an inclusive 
approach and to favour separation as an educational strategy, since it is based on the use of an 
educational structure which does not always categorize pupils appropriately.  In this context, one 
of the IGLU studies has demonstrated, for example, that 44 per cent of classification decisions 
were out of step with the actual abilities of the children concerned.  This fact is of legal 
relevance, since it impinges on the principle of the best interests of the child, as stipulated in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>57. These considerations incline the Special Rapporteur to believe that there might be a 
connection between the structure of the educational system, the performance of the teachers (as 
those responsible for classifying the children) and the pupils themselves, since, in other 
countries, it is unusual to find children being classified from the age of 10. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also learned that some 20 per cent of male pupils of immigrant 
origin attending the <i>Hauptschule</i> left before finishing school or were unable to find jobs even 
when they did have school-leaving certificates.  These pupils have to compete with others, like 
them, who are unemployed, and also with job-seekers who have better educational qualifications, 
a situation which serves to exclude them even further. 
</p>
<p>59. Neither PISA nor PIRLS make any direct connection between the structure and the 
effectiveness of educational services, since they are not directly concerned with this relationship.  
The Special Rapporteur is fully aware that the three-track structure forms part of an extensive 
and strongly entrenched tradition in Germany, but he also notes a number of factors indicating 
that the educational structure does in fact have a decisive effect on the completeness and 
effectiveness of education and the quality of the teaching provided.  Attention has been drawn to 
the existence of alternative structures, such as the <i>Gesamtschule</i>, which also replicate the 
classification system, however, even though they are held up as models of comprehensive 
education. 
</p>
<p>60. On the basis of his observations, the Special Rapporteur believes that the educational 
system should be structured in such a way as to render it more permeable - in other words, more 
responsive to the needs and rights of the pupils, bearing in mind that children develop in 
different ways and come from different cultural backgrounds and, most important, that any 
educational system should proceed from the principle of diversity as the cornerstone of its 
operation. 
</p>
<p>61. Mothers and fathers, together with the pupils themselves, should have a real possibility to 
participate in the adoption of decisions relating to classification and other essential aspects of the 
educational system.  This possibility should be established in law. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>62. According to reports received, it is possible that, in some L&#228;nder, education is understood 
exclusively to mean school attendance.  Even though the Special Rapporteur is a strong advocate 
of public, free and compulsory education, it should be noted that education may not be reduced 
to mere school attendance and that educational processes should be strengthened to ensure that 
they always and primarily serve the best interests of the child.  Distance learning methods and 
home schooling represent valid options which could be developed in certain circumstances, 
bearing in mind that parents have the right to choose the appropriate type of education for their 
children, as stipulated in article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights.  The promotion and development of a system of public, government-funded 
education should not entail the suppression of forms of education that do not require attendance 
at a school.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur received complaints about threats to 
withdraw the parental rights of parents who chose home-schooling methods for their children. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Education of migrant children and children of migrant background 
</b></p>
<p>63. For many years, Germany never regarded itself as a country which takes in immigrants.  
People coming to Germany in search of work over the last few decades have not been seen as 
communities putting down roots in the country and, in the popular view, it was thought that they 
would eventually return to their countries of origin.  Contrary to this view, communities 
originating from different countries, in particular Turkey, have made their lives in Germany and 
settled there permanently.  Even though several decades have passed since these communities 
first arrived, thousands of German children of foreign origin still need to be better integrated in 
the country&#8217;s educational systems and in society as a whole. 
</p>
<p>64. The educational debate in Germany revolves not only around the issue of quality of 
education and related aspirations, but also about the country&#8217;s need to embrace other European 
integration processes, such as the agreements on the Schengen area, the common European 
asylum policy and the European Refugee Fund of the European Union, among others.  The 
principle of unity in diversity goes beyond the mere adoption of international agreements and 
also involves extensive processes of research and practical action within the country, enabling it 
to respond to an increasingly intricate intercultural landscape. 
</p>
<p>65. The problem of language is a key element of this landscape and is also of crucial 
importance for meaningful progress in the educational system, since children, once they 
complete primary school, are assigned to different types of schools on the basis, among other 
considerations, of their competence in German.  In many cases, lack of tuition in the children&#8217;s 
mother tongue impedes their educational development. 
</p>
<p>66. Despite the specific features characterizing German communities of immigrant origin, the 
Special Rapporteur is of the view that this problem is more social than ethnic in nature, since 
these communities are generally to be found in the less advantaged strata of society.  It is clear 
that the various disparities affecting immigrant populations which have accumulated over the 
years have not been properly addressed and that the principal educational need to be tackled at 
the current time relates accordingly to the issue of quality, if the social disparities between 
students and the lack of educational opportunities, which result in unemployment and social </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>exclusion, are to be remedied.  In the Government&#8217;s view, providing equal educational 
opportunities and attending to the individual needs of each pupil are benchmarks for the quality 
of the educational system.  From the outset, efforts to improve the quality of teaching cannot 
succeed in the absence of equitable and egalitarian conditions in the school system, relating to 
the questions of access and regular attendance, and also the provision of support for and attention 
to basic social and educational needs.  Unless education is viewed as a human right which must 
be upheld for every child, it will be difficult to meet the specific needs of German pupils whose 
parents or grandparents came from foreign countries. 
</p>
<p>67. As clearly demonstrated in studies conducted by PISA, there is a marked gap between 
school performance and actual employment opportunities, since educational qualifications are 
needed to enter the job market.  For example, one of every three unemployed persons in Munich 
is of immigrant origin and unemployment among those who lack training, according to the 
Federal Employment Agency (2001), is at the level of 20 per cent in the west and 50 per cent in 
the east of the country. 
</p>
<p>68. Among the communities which are indisputably foreign, it is probably persons in an 
illegal immigration situation who encounter the greatest difficulties in the area of education and, 
as the Special Rapporteur was informed, the declaration by the German Government made at the 
time of ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child<b>2</b> has the effect of according 
precedence to consideration of a child&#8217;s status as a refugee over recognition of that child&#8217;s status 
as the holder of certain rights.  Indeed, according to the information provided to the Special 
Rapporteur, children with a refugee background are not covered by the compulsory school 
system.  Even after the implementation of a positive reform on this matter by several federal 
states, there are still three (Baden-W&#252;rttemberg, Hessen and Saarland) that exclude children with 
an insecure law status from it.  These federal states developed a system for refugee children, 
which is called &#8220;School right&#8221;.  The Special Rapporteur considers that this system has certain 
disadvantages, such as the School right is not compulsory, the fact that the school authorities 
receive no information from the registry office that a refugee child is in its area, there are 
problems to finance remedial teaching and extra tuition and the fact that the right to attend 
school depends on capacities and physical structures available.  Furthermore, according to 
information provided with regard to the Land of Berlin, there is a discrepancy in legislation 
regarding obligation of education until 18 years and refugee legislation where the age of majority 
is 16 years and not 18.  This discrepancy permits leaving out of education young refugees. 
</p>
<p>69. The situation described above shows that there is a discrepancy between immigration law 
and the right to education.  There is in fact no evident connection between the status of refugee 
under law and the right to education enshrined in international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The declaration states that:  Nothing in the Convention may be interpreted as implying that 
</p>
<p>unlawful entry by an alien into the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany or his unlawful 
stay there is permitted; nor may any provision be interpreted to mean that it restricts the right of 
the Federal Republic of Germany to pass laws and regulations concerning the entry of aliens and 
the conditions of their stay or to make a distinction between nationals and aliens. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>70. During interviews conducted by the Special Rapporteur with refugee organizations, he 
was informed that many children and teenagers stay away from school for fear of being found 
out and possibly deported. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur also learnt that refugee reception centres often lie far from 
schools, another factor deterring refugee children from attending school.  In addition, it was 
argued that refugee students have no opportunity to receive vocational training.  The Special 
Rapporteur was informed after his visit that, in the field of educational funding law [Federal 
Training Assistance Act (BAf&#246;G) and Social Code (SGB III)], the federal Government intends to 
present an amendment which will contain improved conditions for migrants.  Foreign students 
who already have a long-term residence entitlement or who have at least lived in Germany for a 
long time and can count on permanence under residency law will be funded without a previous 
minimum earnings period of their parents. 
</p>
<p>72. In the case of illegal immigrants living in Germany, the situation is rather less clear and, 
as the Special Rapporteur was informed, the response by the various L&#228;nder and the federal 
Government has been far from uniform.  In many cases this response has been no more than a 
certain measure of tolerance (&#8220;Duldung&#8221;) which, although deportation is usually avoided, still 
leaves the persons concerned uncertain about their status and exacerbates their sense of 
insecurity.  Illegal immigrant children usually do not know that they can still attend school and 
their families are also unaware that they can request a particular immigration status, in 
accordance with the laws in force in Germany.  The German legal system differentiates between 
foreigners whose residency status is not secured and who are known to the authorities 
(e.g. people with exceptional leave to remain Duldung), asylum-seekers, and those who are not 
known to the authorities, so-called illegals.  According to the information brought to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur, illegal children are completely excluded from the 
compulsory school system in the majority of the federal states.  This is worsened by the fact that 
headmasters have the duty to call the immigration office if they receive information about an 
illegal child, which has grave consequences on the right to education of the children, because 
families with an illegal residence status have to deal with the threat that a headmaster might call 
the immigration office if they try to send their children to school.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>73. At the invitation of the Government and the education authorities, the Special Rapporteur 
had the opportunity, during his mission, to visit the Amaro Kher school in Cologne, whose 
pupils are primarily Roma children of illegal immigrant families.  &#8220;Amaro Kher&#8221; is a centre 
financed by the city of Cologne and by the State of North-Rhine-Westphalia, which aims to 
prepare a larger group of Roma children to attend at a later stage regular schools or 
kindergartens<b>4</b>.  The programme is specially addressed to Roma and Sinti children who have so 
far had no experience of school education or have shown &#8220;anti-social&#8221; behaviour.  While the 
Government is clearly providing educational services for this community, the fact remains that 
Roma children are subjected to harsh discrimination and suffer severe inequalities, in terms of

</p>
<p>both budgetary allocations and school facilities.  It is also alleged that there are serious problems 
in finding teachers qualified and willing to teach these children.  The Amaro Kher school is a 
prominent example of the determination of this community and of a clear commitment by the 
Government, which must be further encouraged so as to transform this school and others like it 
into educational centres of the same level as other mainstream educational institutions. 
</p>
<p>74. Germany&#8217;s commitment to its communities of immigrant origin has a sound foundation 
and must respond to the needs and challenges identified by international studies and by local 
analysts.  The demographic make-up of the country is undergoing radical change and it is 
possible that, in some 20 or 30 years, more than one third of all schoolchildren will be of 
immigrant origin.  Given this reality, the Special Rapporteur stresses the need for a decisive and 
creative response, since, if the inequality which currently prevails in the educational system is to 
persist, unemployment levels will rise, increasing the burden of State assistance for the 
unemployed with the resulting consequences.  The creation of educational opportunities for all 
members of the population is therefore a fundamental political and economic need in Germany. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Education of children with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>75. One of the major challenges facing the Federal Republic of Germany relates to the 
situation of the disabled.  At the request of the Special Rapporteur, the German Government 
responded to a questionnaire on the situation regarding the right to education of these persons, 
which constituted one of the topics of its main report for this period. 
</p>
<p>76. In the case of Germany, a campaign has been mounted for the so-called &#8220;integration&#8221; of 
disabled persons in educational processes.  The notion of &#8220;integration&#8221; is problematic and lacks 
any clear legal definition; it should, however, include the notion of &#8220;inclusion&#8221;, underpinned by 
the adoption in December 2006 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
Germany aims to ratify the Convention in March 2007.

<p>77. Integration may be understood as a process in which people are obliged to adapt to a 
predetermined model.  Seen in this way, it is a top-down process which gives no heed to the 
special educational needs and specific characteristics of each individual, including 
schoolchildren and students with disabilities.  It is not the individuals who should adapt to the 
educational system but the reverse.  Inclusion, on the other hand, responds to the needs and 
rights of individuals and renders it incumbent on the State to ensure that all children receive 
education together in the same school environment.  There are signs that, in Germany&#8217;s case, 
insufficient progress has been made towards the inclusion of the disabled in ordinary schools 
and, while it is clear that the country has excellent specialized centres for the disabled, these are 
primarily designed to offer medical attention. 
</p>
<p>78. One of the main difficulties in this area springs from the fact that the education 
authorities accord very limited opportunities to the parents of disabled children to choose the 
best options for their sons or daughters.  Added to which, it seems that parents have no 
opportunity to choose the educational structure in which they would like their children to study 
and thus the system, from the very outset, falls short of the needs of families and of the disabled 
individuals themselves. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3

</p>
<p>79. As noted by the Special Rapporteur, it is not the norm for disabled children to be 
included in ordinary schools.  As a result, the policy of integration promoted by the Government 
could be viewed as a form of segregation which has the result of placing most disabled 
schoolchildren in special schools.  The actual level of inclusion in ordinary schools differs 
widely from one Land to another.  In Berlin, for example, it appeared that 45 per cent of 
disabled children attend ordinary public schools, while in Bavaria there are between 50,000 
and 60,000 disabled children, of whom only 17,000 are attending ordinary schools. 
</p>
<p>80. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that most of the schools which he visited 
lacked the necessary structures and amenities for the admission and accommodation of children 
with motor disabilities.  This should, however, be seen as an isolated observation, which does not 
necessarily reflect the situation countrywide. 
</p>
<p>81. In certain L&#228;nder, the so-called &#8220;active participation principle&#8221;, which constitutes one of 
the pillars of public education, seems to act as an obstacle to the inclusion in ordinary schools of 
children with intellectual disabilities, demonstrating the priority given to a results-based 
approach which is strongly quantitative in nature, as manifested by the tendency to focus on the 
shortcomings, rather than the potential, of such children. 
</p>
<p>82. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was unable to detect any rights-based approach in the 
German system which<b> </b>would help steer the country&#8217;s educational policies in the direction of 
including children with disabilities.  In the absence of such a rights-based approach, the 
concerted efforts mounted by the L&#228;nder will have the end-result of further segregating such 
children, instead of placing them in ordinary educational settings which would enable them to 
enjoy at least the following conditions:  early identification of special education needs and early 
childhood intervention; the promotion of curriculum development that is common to all learners 
and fosters human rights education and learning; the guarantee of mandatory pre-service and 
in-service training of teachers and school administrators; the provision of individualized student 
support where necessary; the linking of all areas of education reform to ensure consistency 
throughout with the right to education and inclusive education.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Early childhood education and care 
</b></p>
<p>83. Without question, Germany has done a great deal to develop education from an early age.  
The Special Rapporteur heard a number of reports, however, indicating that this work has been 
primarily prompted by a concern to develop language skills and by the conviction that formal 
education should begin at the age of 3 or 4.  The Special Rapporteur hopes that this situation will 
not entail the risk of over-institutionalizing preschool education and eliminating play as both a 
teaching resource and as a basic right. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Repporteur was informed that the creation of a needs-based and 
quality-oriented education and care provision for children, as set out most recently in the 
Day-care Expansion Act (Tagesbetreuungsausbaugesetz - TAG), represents the highest priority 
for the federal Government.  The quality campaign is also being progressed in terms of content

<p>by the L&#228;nder.  With the &#8220;Joint framework of the L&#228;nder for early-years education in 
kindergarten facilities&#8221;, the L&#228;nder have succeeded in reaching agreement on the principles of 
educational work in day-care facilities for children which is given concrete form through the 
curricula at Land level.  The curricula of the L&#228;nder strengthen the educational remit of the child 
day-care facilities on a sustained basis.  The core of these curricula are the so-called education or 
support areas.  Here the subject of language support enjoys a certain priority status, although the 
curricula also focus on other educational areas such as mathematics, sciences and education in 
the arts. 
</p>
<p>85. PISA has demonstrated that it is not only the children of immigrants who experience 
language problems, but other children as well.  As a result, the formal imposition of language 
standards is insufficient to ensure quality education, since the children&#8217;s language skills are the 
product of the educational substance and skills which shape the entire learning process.  Without 
any doubt, the issue of language skills as an entry requirement for preschool education (tested in 
an exam which children have to take at the age of 4) is one which should be more extensively 
discussed, since it undoubtedly promotes exclusion - or least delays - in the school attendance of 
certain children (both German and others) who, for a variety of reasons, are not proficient in 
German. 
</p>
<p>86. In any event, it is certain that early education is part of the continuous education to which 
all children are entitled.  For this reason, it would be a good idea to make provision for its 
definitive inclusion in the ordinary education system and, clearly, for it to be provided free of 
charge. 
</p>
<p>87. According to book eight of the Social Code - Child and Youth Welfare, the system of 
day-care facilities for children is legally and organizationally linked to child and youth welfare, 
hence to public welfare (social services) and not to the field of education (school system).  While 
the school system falls under the jurisdiction of the L&#228;nder, the legislative authority for public 
welfare lies with the Federation and the L&#228;nder and the burden of funding lies with the L&#228;nder 
and municipalities. 
</p>
<p>88. Early childhood care is not compulsory.  There is therefore a need to encourage parents 
to send their children to kindergarten but also to ensure that it is free of charge and, of course, the 
need to support the professional training of staff.  Kindergarten as a structure aiming at 
supporting inclusion, especially of children with a migrant background, was also highlighted in 
the course of the visit.  The realization of the educational mission of the kindergarten is one of 
the priorities of the reform of the German education system.  This involves the need to improve 
cooperation between kindergarten and primary schools.  It involves the further development of 
cross-L&#228;nder coordination of education plans, a significant improvement in training, in particular 
of kindergarten teachers, and support for the introduction of new educational plans and the 
strengthening of research in this field. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Germany has extensive public education coverage and is one of the few countries 
which has raised the age of compulsory school attendance to 18.  The country also has a 
high level of school attendance in all areas.  There are, however, certain shortcomings, 
owing primarily to the complex structure of the educational system, mostly related to </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b>difficulties encountered by children in certain marginalized categories, such as children 
from lower social classes, of immigrant origin or with disabilities.  This has the effect of 
making the educational system somewhat exclusive in nature. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>One of the main causes of this exclusion is the system of classification, which is 
carried out at a very early age and following criteria that are neither clear nor uniform.  
The resulting evaluation depends to a large extent on the particular regulations in force in 
each Land and on the teachers, who are not always properly trained to carry out this task.  
Germany should reform its educational system in such a way that it preserves its current 
merits, such as the high level of school attendance, while overcoming its inequalities and 
the lack of opportunity for certain population sectors.  A rights-based approach to 
education would make it possible to conduct the necessary reforms to meet the educational 
needs of all members of the population. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends to the Government of the Federal Republic of 
Germany: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) That it include uniform safeguards for the right to education in the 
constitutions of its L&#228;nder and in its Basic Law, which will also promote consistency with 
processes under way in the rest of Europe and ensure that due attention is given to the 
corresponding State obligations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) That these safeguards should ensure the participation of the parents of 
schoolchildren, as appropriate, in all decisions relating to the placement of their children in 
educational centres and to the choice of the modes of education; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) That an extensive national debate should be launched on the relationship 
between the educational systems currently in operation and the phenomena of exclusion 
and marginalization of schoolchildren, in particular those of immigrant origin or with 
disabilities.  This debate should also consider the appropriateness of maintaining a two or 
three-track system; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) That preschool education should form part of the ordinary education system, 
that it should be provided free of charge and accessible to all children, and that the 
arrangements for admission to preschool education should be reviewed to ensure that the 
right to education is not withheld from any child; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) That, working in association with universities and teacher-training colleges, 
the accent should be placed on educational theory, in particular, on methods of teaching 
human rights, rather than on specific subject areas; 
 (f) That a study should be conducted into ways of levelling out the salary and 
professional conditions applicable to teachers in the different school systems and levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) That it should review the policy and practice of classifying school pupils (at 
the age of 10) used to assess children for entry to the lower secondary level of education, 
with a view to determining whether classification at such an early age is appropriate to the 
rights, interests and needs of the children themselves; </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/29/Add.3 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p><b> (h) That it should step up the social, economic and educational support provided 
to schoolchildren whose mother tongue is not German; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) That human-rights-based studies should be conducted into ways of boosting 
the quality of education in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Given the risk that, under the current system, children living in Germany might be 
denied the right to education, it is recommended that studies be carried out to clarify the 
actual school attendance situation of asylum-seeking children, refugee children or children 
without the proper papers; and also to appraise as a matter of urgency the legal framework 
for the protection and promotion of the human right of such children to education, 
including exploring the possibility of withdrawing Germany&#8217;s reservations and 
declarations made to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>It is also recommended: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) That arrangements be set in place to improve the compilation and processing 
of complaints relating to violations of the right to education of refugees, refugee applicants 
and asylum-seekers, and also of persons who do not have a legal immigration status; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) That consideration be given to the possibility of ratifying the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) That Federal law and state law be reformed so as to ensure that they 
strengthen the obligation of the educational authorities to provide education to persons 
with disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) That efforts be made to promote the inclusion of schoolchildren with 
disabilities in the ordinary education system; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) That more persons with disabilities be trained as teachers; 
 (f) That, as a matter of urgency, a national inventory be compiled of the 
accessibility conditions of school buildings and plans drawn up for their reconstruction, so 
as to facilitate access by persons with disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) That the necessary measures should be adopted to ensure that the home 
schooling system is properly supervised by the State, thereby upholding the right of 
parents to employ this form of education when necessary and appropriate, bearing in mind 
the best interests of the child; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) That the level of implementation of the first phase of the World Human 
Rights Education Programme should be appraised, in accordance with General Assembly 
resolutions 59/113 A and B.
