Cenovus has strong second-quarter operational performance
Oil sands production increases, operating costs decline
Calgary, Alberta (July 28, 2016) – Cenovus Energy Inc. (TSX: CVE) (NYSE: CVE) continued to deliver strong and reliable
operating performance in the second quarter of 2016. The company remains on track with its plans to bring on two new oil
sands  expansion  phases  and  achieve  up  to  $500  million  in  capital,  operating  and  general  and  administrative  (G&A)  cost
reductions compared with its original 2016 budget.
“We’ve achieved significant sustainable improvements in our cost structure over the last year and a half, and we’ll remain
vigilant  on  costs  to  maximize  our  competitive  position  in  this  challenging  and  volatile  commodity  price  environment,”  said
Brian Ferguson, Cenovus President & Chief Executive Officer. “Our reduced cost base and strong operational performance,
coupled with an improvement in benchmark oil and natural gas prices from the lows reached earlier this year, contributed to a
solid second quarter.”
Key developments
●  Decreased  per-barrel  oil  sands  operating  costs  by  24%  and  per-barrel  conventional  crude  oil  operating  costs  by  9%
compared with the second quarter of 2015
●  Achieved production at Foster Creek of almost 69,000 barrels per day (bbls/d) net in June. Second-quarter production was
nearly 65,000 bbls/d net, 11% higher than in the same period of 2015. Foster Creek is on track to exit the year with volumes
above 70,000 bbls/d net
●  Increased production at Christina Lake to more than 78,000 bbls/d net, 8% higher than in the second quarter of 2015
●  The Foster Creek phase G and Christina Lake phase F expansion projects remain on track to add incremental production in
the third quarter
●  Exited the quarter with nearly $8 billion in liquidity, including $3.8 billion in cash, $4 billion in unused credit facilities, and
net debt to capitalization of 17%

Overview
Cenovus’s  strong  operational  performance  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  included  a  9%  increase  in  combined  oil  sands
production  and  a  24%  decrease  in  per-barrel  oil  sands  operating  costs  compared  with  the  same  quarter  of  2015.  The
company’s year-over-year financial performance was negatively impacted by the significant decline in crude oil and natural
gas prices from the previous year’s quarter. However, an increase in crude oil and natural gas prices from the multi-year lows
reached in the first three months of 2016 contributed to improved cash flow compared with the first quarter of this year.
Oil production
Production at Cenovus’s Foster Creek oil sands project averaged approximately 65,000 bbls/d net in the second quarter, 11%
higher  than  in  the  same  period  a  year  earlier  when  a  precautionary  shutdown  due  to  nearby  forest  fire  activity  reduced
volumes by approximately 10,500 bbls/d net. Operations at Foster Creek have not been affected by forest fire activity in 2016.
June production averaged just under 69,000 bbls/d net as Cenovus continued to ramp up new sustaining well pads at Foster
Creek and brought a number of wells that were down for servicing back online, as planned. At the end of June, the company
had commissioned the majority of the facilities for its Foster Creek expansion phase G, which is on track to be completed and
add  incremental  oil  volumes  in  the  third  quarter,  with  ramp-up  expected  over  an  18-month  period.  Cenovus  continues  to
anticipate exiting 2016 with Foster Creek production above 70,000 bbls/d net.
Production at Christina Lake averaged approximately 78,000 bbls/d net in the second quarter, an 8% increase from the same
period a year earlier. The increase was largely due to the completion of the Christina Lake optimization project in late 2015
and  the  reliable  performance  of  the  operation’s  facilities.  Christina  Lake  phase  F  remains  on  track  for  first  oil  in  the  third
quarter and is expected to ramp up over a 12-month period. During the second quarter, Cenovus successfully commissioned
its 100 megawatt Christina Lake cogeneration power plant, with full ramp-up expected in the third quarter. The company is
spending a small amount of capital to complete detailed engineering on Christina Lake phase G and is in the process of
rebidding work on the project. Cenovus expects to provide more information at the time of its 2017 budget announcement in
December about the potential to restart phase G, which was put on hold in late 2014 due to the decline in oil prices.
“Given the strength of our balance sheet and financial position as well as our high level of confidence that the cost reductions
we’ve achieved will be largely sustainable, I’m optimistic about the potential to resume construction on some of our deferred
projects,” said Ferguson. “However, we still need additional clarity on federal fiscal and regulatory policies that could impact
our operating environment.”
In the second quarter, Cenovus undertook precautionary staff evacuations at its Christina Lake and Pelican Lake operations
due to nearby forest fire activity. While non-essential personnel at Christina Lake were sent home for several days in May due
to heightened forest fire risk, essential staff remained at site and safely continued full production. In June, a forest fire near
Pelican Lake prompted the orderly shutdown and precautionary evacuation of all personnel from site for two days. Operations
and staffing were restored to normal levels in a safe and timely manner.

“I’m extremely pleased with the composure and professionalism our teams have displayed in carrying out these precautionary
measures  to  protect  our  people  and  operations  this  wildfire  season,”  said  Kieron  McFadyen,  Cenovus  Executive  Vice-
President & President, Upstream Oil & Gas. “Fortunately, everyone has remained safe, and our infrastructure has not been
impacted by forest fires. Our thoughts go out to everyone who was affected by the fire that devastated Fort McMurray this
spring.”
Cost reductions
Cenovus remains on track with its target to reduce capital, operating and G&A costs by up to $500 million this year compared
with its original 2016 budget. The company expects about two-thirds of its realized cost reductions achieved since the end of
2014 will be sustainable even in a higher commodity price environment.
“I want to acknowledge the hard work of everyone at Cenovus in finding ways to reduce costs over the last year and a half,”
said Ferguson. “This has made us stronger and more financially resilient, and we’ll continue to look for further efficiencies in
the months ahead.”
Per-barrel operating costs continued to decline in the second quarter, compared with the same period in 2015, including a
24% reduction in combined oil sands operating costs to $8.06 per barrel (bbl). Oil sands non-fuel operating costs fell by 19%
to $6.54/bbl primarily as a result of higher production volumes, better prioritization of repairs and maintenance and improved
well pump performance. During the second quarter, Christina Lake recorded a larger credit under Alberta’s greenhouse gas
emissions regulations than in the second quarter of last year, which also helped to reduce operating costs.
As previously announced, Cenovus completed its planned workforce reduction program in the second quarter, bringing total
staff reductions since the end of 2014 to 31%. In the second quarter, Cenovus recorded severance costs of approximately $19
million related to its 2016 workforce reductions.
Financial performance
The year-over-year decline in West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Western Canadian Select (WCS) and AECO natural gas prices
of  21%,  30%  and  53%,  respectively,  as  well  as  a  decline  in  average  market  crack  spreads  contributed  to  a  decrease  in
second-quarter operating cash flow to $541 million, 42% lower than in the same period of 2015. Upstream operating cash flow
was down 45% to $348 million.
The company’s refining and marketing business had strong operating performance in the second quarter, with operating cash
flow  of  $193  million.  This  represents  a  $216  million  improvement  from  the  first  quarter  of  the  year,  primarily  driven  by  a
recovery in market crack spreads and better utilization rates. Year over year, operating cash flow from refining and marketing
was down 36% in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to lower average market crack spreads driven by higher storage
levels for refined product and a 75% narrowing of the Brent-WTI price differential.
Cenovus  ended  the  second  quarter  of  2016  with  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of  approximately  $3.8  billion.  Including  $4.0
billion in undrawn capacity under its committed credit facility, the
Cenovus Energy Inc.

company has nearly $8 billion in liquidity available, with no debt maturing until the fourth quarter of 2019. At the end of the
second quarter, the company’s net debt to capitalization was 17% compared with 28% at the end of the second quarter of
2015. Its net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was 1.9 times on a
trailing 12-month basis, compared with 1.5 times at the end of the same period a year ago.
Cenovus  has  an  active  hedging  program  and  will  evaluate  additional  hedging  opportunities  for  2017  and  2018  to  help
maintain its financial resilience.
Guidance update
Cenovus has updated its 2016 full-year guidance to reflect actual results for the first six months of the year and the company’s
estimates for the second half of 2016. The revisions primarily reflect expectations for continued improvement in company-wide
operating costs and lower anticipated capital spending at Cenovus’s oil sands business. Updated guidance is available at
cenovus.com under “Investors.”

News Release
●   Operating costs were $14.00/bbl in the quarter, 9% lower than in the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower
repairs and maintenance, chemical, electricity and workforce costs.
Natural gas
●   Natural gas production averaged 399 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) in the second quarter of 2016, down 11%
from the same period a year earlier, primarily due to expected natural declines and the company’s 2015 sale of its
royalty and fee land business.
●   Operating costs fell 7% to $1.06 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in the quarter compared with the same period a year
earlier.
Downstream
●   Cenovus’s Wood River Refinery in Illinois and Borger Refinery in Texas, which are jointly owned with the operator,
Phillips 66, continued to have strong operational performance in the second quarter of 2016, including:
¡
¡
processing a combined average of 458,000 bbls/d gross of crude oil (100% utilization) compared with 441,000
bbls/d gross in the same period in 2015 (96% utilization)
  producing  a  combined  average  of  483,000  bbls/d  gross  of  refined  products  compared  with  462,000  bbls/d
gross a year earlier.
●   Cenovus  had  operating  cash  flow  of  $193  million  from  refining  and  marketing  in  the  quarter  compared  with
$300 million in the second quarter of 2015. The company’s refining operating cash flow is calculated on a first-in, first-
out (FIFO) inventory accounting basis. Using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting method employed by most U.S.
refiners,  Cenovus’s  operating  cash  flow  from  refining  and  marketing  would  have  been  $107  million  lower  in  the
second quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2015, operating cash flow would have been $101 million lower on a
LIFO reporting basis.
Financial
Corporate and financial information
●   Operating cash flow was $541 million in the second quarter, down 42% from the same period a year earlier, largely
due to lower oil and natural gas prices and sales volumes as well as reduced operating cash flow from refining and
marketing, primarily due to lower market crack spreads.
●   In the second quarter of 2016, Cenovus had capital spending of approximately $236 million, down 34% from a year
earlier,  with  the  bulk  of  the  investment  going  towards  the  company’s  oil  sands  operations.  Capital  investment  in
Cenovus’s oil sands crude oil operations was $138 million, 47% lower than in the same period of 2015. Investment in
conventional oil was $32 million in the second quarter, 6% lower than in the same quarter in 2015, while refining and
marketing investment was $53 million, a 10% increase, due in part to the debottlenecking project at the Wood River
Refinery. Capital investment in natural gas was $3 million in the second quarter, compared with $2 million in the year-
earlier period.
●   For the quarter, operating cash flow in excess of capital invested was $74 million from Cenovus’s conventional oil
business and $7 million from natural gas. Operating cash

flow from refining and marketing exceeded capital investment by $140 million, while operating cash flow from the
flow from refining and marketing exceeded capital investment by $140 million, while operating cash flow from the
company’s oil sands crude oil operations exceeded capital spending by $94 million.
●   After investing approximately $236 million during the second quarter, Cenovus had free cash flow of $204 million
compared with free cash flow of $120 million in the same period a year earlier.
●   Net loss was $267 million in the second quarter compared with net income of $126 million in the same period of
2015.  The  loss  was  primarily  due  to  a  decline  in  operating  earnings,  unrealized  risk  management  losses  of
$284 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with unrealized losses of $151 million in the second quarter of
2015, and non-operating unrealized foreign exchange losses of $18 million compared with unrealized gains of $99
million in the year-earlier period.
●   G&A  expenses  were  $94  million  in  the  quarter,  22%  higher  than  in  the  same  period  of  2015.  The  increase  was
primarily  due  to  recorded  severance  costs  of  approximately  $19  million  and  a  non-cash  expense  of  $17  million
related to office building leases in Calgary in excess of Cenovus’s current and near-term requirements.
●   At June 30, 2016, the company’s net debt to capitalization was 17% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.9 times.
The debt to capitalization ratio was 34% and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.8 times. Over the long term, Cenovus
continues to target a debt to capitalization ratio of between 30% and 40% and debt to adjusted EBITDA of between
1.0 and 2.0 times. The company expects these ratios may be outside of the target ranges at different points in the
economic cycle.
●   The Board of Directors has declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.05 per share, payable on September 30, 2016 to
common shareholders of record as of September 15, 2016. Based on the July 27, 2016 closing share price on the
Toronto Stock Exchange of $17.50, this represents an annualized yield of about 1.1%. Declaration of dividends is at
the sole discretion of the Board and will continue to be evaluated on a quarterly basis. Over the long term, Cenovus
intends to target a meaningful dividend that is sustainable when prices are at the bottom of the commodity cycle.
Increases  in  the  dividend  would  be  considered  with  sustained  improvements  in  the  company’s  margins  and
production base.
Commodity price hedging
●   Since the release of its first quarter earnings statement on April 27, 2016, Cenovus has added the following hedges
for the period 2016 through 2018:
¡ 
¡ 
¡ 
¡ 
¡
for July through December 2016, 30,000 bbls/d of WTI collars with a floor price of US$45.39/bbl
  for January through June 2017, 17,000 bbls/d of WTI swaps at US$48.97/bbl
  for July through December 2017, 25,000 bbls/d of WTI collars with a floor price of US$44.10/bbl
  for July through December 2017, 10,000 bbls/d of Brent swaps at US$53.09/bbl
  for January through June 2018, 10,000 bbls/d of Brent swaps at US$54.06/bbl
●   As of today, the company has approximately 32% of its oil production hedged for the remainder of 2016 at a volume-
weighted average floor price of C$63.38/bbl.
●   In the second quarter of 2016, Cenovus had realized after-tax hedging losses of $5 million as the company’s contract
prices trailed average benchmark prices. Cenovus had unrealized after-tax hedging losses of $207 million during the
quarter.

●   Including hedging, market access commitments and downstream integration largely provided by the company’s two
U.S. refineries, Cenovus has positioned itself to mitigate the impact of swings in the Canadian light-heavy oil price
differential  for  more  than  85%  of  its  anticipated  2016  heavy  oil  production.  Together,  these  mechanisms  help  to
support Cenovus’s financial resilience during this challenging period for the industry.
Other developments
●   Across  Cenovus’s  operations,  staff  successfully  demonstrated  their  commitment  to  safety  by  achieving  more  than
50 days without a recordable injury during the second quarter, the first time the company reached this milestone.
●   In  the  second  quarter, Corporate  Knights magazine  named  Cenovus  as  one  of  the  50  Best  Corporate  Citizens  in

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Crude oil production from our Conventional business segment continues to generate dependable near-term cash flow. This
production provides diversification to our revenue stream and enables further development of our oil sands assets. Our natural
gas production acts as an economic hedge for the natural gas required as a fuel source at both our oil sands and refining
operations and provides cash flow to help fund our growth opportunities.

Refining and Marketing
Our operations include two refineries located in Illinois and Texas that are jointly owned with and operated by Phillips 66, an
unrelated  U.S.  public  company.  The  gross  crude  oil  capacity  of  the  Wood  River  and  Borger  refineries  is  approximately
314,000 barrels per day and 146,000 barrels per day, respectively. Our refining operations allow us to capture the value from
crude oil production through to refined products, such as diesel, gasoline and jet fuel, to partially mitigate volatility associated
with regional North American light/heavy crude oil price differential fluctuations. This segment also includes our crude-by-rail
terminal  operations,  located  in  Bruderheim,  Alberta,  and  the  marketing  of  third-party  purchases  and  sales  of  product
undertaken  to  provide  operational  flexibility  for  transportation  commitments,  product  quality,  delivery  points  and  customer
diversification.

In the second quarter, crude oil prices continued to be volatile with West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) reaching US$50 per
barrel  for  the  first  time  in  almost  a  year.  While  crude  oil  prices  improved  from  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  our  companywide
netback in the first half of 2016 was $5.84 per BOE, before realized risk management activities, which remains significantly
lower  than  in  prior  years.  As  a  result,  we  continue  to  focus  on  maintaining  our  financial  resilience  and  safe  and  reliable
operations.  We  are  on  track  to  reduce  our  planned  2016  capital,  operating,  general  and  administrative  spending  by
approximately $500 million, relative to our original budget released in December 2015. Our ongoing efforts to reduce costs
have helped our balance sheet remain strong, with approximately $3.8 billion of cash on hand at June 30, 2016.
Consistent with the improvement in crude oil benchmark prices, our average realized crude oil price more than doubled from
the first quarter of 2016 to $33.87 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016. However, this was 32 percent lower than our
average realized price in the second quarter of 2015.
In the second quarter, we:
●   Decreased our total crude oil operating costs by 22 percent or $48 million, compared with 2015;
●   Realized  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  netbacks,  before  risk  management  gains,  of  $15.48  per  barrel  (2015  –  $28.76  per
barrel) and $0.30 per Mcf (2015 – $1.53 per Mcf), respectively;
●   Achieved Cash Flow of $440 million, a significant increase from the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher commodity
prices;
●   Incurred  Operating  Losses  of  $39  million  or  $1.65  per  barrel  of  crude  oil  equivalent  sold  compared  with  Operating
Earnings of $151 million or $6.11 per barrel of crude oil equivalent in the second quarter of 2015;
●   Implemented  workforce  reductions  identified  in  the  first  quarter,  which  resulted  in  an  11  percent  reduction  from  our
workforce at December 31, 2015; and
●   Continued  to  progress  our  two  oil  sands  expansion  phases  which  is  expected  to  add  80,000  gross  barrels  per  day  of
production capacity.

OPERATING RESULTS
Total crude oil production declined in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as higher production from our Oil Sands
segment was more than offset by lower production from our Conventional properties.

Production at Foster Creek was higher in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to a nearby forest fire
reducing production by approximately 10,500 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015. Production in the second quarter
of 2016 benefited from new wells brought online in the second quarter. Production in the first half of the year was slightly lower
than  in  2015.  Production  in  the  first  quarter  of  2016  was  impacted  by  a  higher  than  average  number  of  wells  down  for
servicing,  which  have  since  been  brought  back  online,  and  improved  wellbore  conformance  during  2015  that  accelerated
production from more mature wells.
Production  from  Christina  Lake  increased  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  due  to  additional  wells  and
reliable performance of our facilities.
We successfully drilled four extended-reach horizontal wells at Foster Creek. The wells had an average horizontal length of
over 1,600 meters. Longer horizontal wells can access a greater portion of the reservoir, potentially reducing development
costs.
Thanks  to  the  continued  focus  and  safety  leadership  of  teams  working  at  our  upstream  and  downstream  operations,  we
operated for over 50 days without a recordable injury. This is the first time Cenovus has reached this milestone, demonstrating
the commitment of our staff to working safely.
Our Conventional crude oil production decreased by 20 percent in the second quarter and 19 percent on a year-to-date basis
due to expected natural declines and the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in July 2015. Divested
assets contributed an average of 4,300 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015 and 4,500 barrels per day on a year-to-
date basis. In addition, production at Pelican Lake was shut-down for two days as a safety precaution due to a nearby forest
fire; there was no damage to our facilities. Lost production has been estimated at approximately 650 barrels per day for the
quarter.

(1) Includes NGLs.
(2) The crude oil price and transportation and blending costs exclude the cost of purchased condensate which is blended with
the heavy oil. On a per-barrel of unblended crude oil basis, the cost of condensate was $19.76 per barrel for the second
quarter (2015 – $22.58 per barrel) and $19.91 per barrel for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (2015 – $22.43 per
barrel).
(3) Employee  long-term  incentive  costs  in  prior  periods  were  reclassified  from  operating  expenses  to  general  and
administrative costs to conform to the presentation adopted for the year ended December 31, 2015.
(4) The netbacks do not reflect non-cash write-downs of product inventory.
Consistent with the decline in benchmark prices and widening heavy oil differentials, our average crude oil netback in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, excluding realized risk management gains and losses, decreased compared with
2015.  Our  realized  bitumen  price  is  influenced  by  the  cost  of  condensate  used  in  blending.  As  the  cost  of  condensate
increases relative to the price of blended crude oil, our realized bitumen price declines. In addition, our cost for condensate is
generally higher than benchmark due to transportation between market hubs and field locations, partially offset by the impact
of  inventory  timing  in  a  rising  price  environment.  In  the  second  quarter  we  experienced  some  of  the  benefit  of  using
condensate purchased at a lower price earlier in the year.
The weakening of the Canadian dollar on a year-to-date basis, compared with 2015, had a positive impact on our crude oil
price of approximately $1.77 per barrel.
In 2016, our average natural gas netback, excluding realized risk management gains and losses, decreased primarily due to
lower sales prices, consistent with the decline in the AECO benchmark price.
Refining
In the second quarter, crude utilization increased due to consistent performance of both the Wood River and Borger refineries.
In the second quarter of 2015, unplanned outages at our Borger refinery resulted from process unit outages and a power
interruption.
On  a  year-to-date  basis,  crude  utilization  increased.  Consistent  performance  in  the  current  quarter  was  slightly  offset  by
planned and unplanned maintenance at our Wood River and Borger refineries in the first quarter of 2016. In the first half of
2015, we experienced unplanned outages and completed a planned turnaround at the Borger refinery.

Operating Cash Flow from Refining and Marketing in the three and six months ending June 30, 2016 was $193 million and
$170 million, respectively. Operating Cash Flow was lower compared with 2015 primarily due to lower average market crack
spreads and higher operating costs, partially offset by higher utilization rates, improved margins on the sale of secondary
products, weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and widening heavy and medium crude oil differentials.

(1) These benchmark prices do not reflect our realized sales prices. For our average realized sales prices and realized risk
management results, refer to the operating netbacks table in the Operating Results section of this MD&A.
(2) The average Canadian dollar WCS benchmark price for the second quarter of 2016 was $41.61 per barrel (2015 – $57.01
per barrel) and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $34.24 per barrel (2015 – $49.54 per barrel).
(3) The average Canadian dollar condensate benchmark price for the second quarter of 2016 was $56.79 per barrel (2015 –
$71.27 per barrel) and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $52.17 per barrel (2015 – $63.93 per barrel).
Crude Oil Benchmarks
The  average  Brent,  WTI  and  WCS  benchmark  prices  improved  from  the  first  quarter  of  2016  due  to  significant  supply
disruptions and strong demand. Although benchmark prices strengthened, crude oil prices remained approximately 26 percent
lower than in the second quarter of 2015 due to excessive inventories. High inventory levels have been driven by the decision
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to discontinue its role as the swing supplier of crude oil in
response to U.S. production growth.
The global imbalance of crude oil supply and demand improved in the second quarter of 2016. Reductions in capital spending
resulted in lower U.S. production compared with 2015. Prices also benefited from temporary supply disruptions in Canada and
Nigeria,  which  offset  strong  production  from  Saudi  Arabia  and  Iran.  Demand  growth  remains  positive  due  to  higher  than
expected  increases  from  the  U.S.,  Europe  and  India.  However,  numerous  concerns  may  limit  near-term  crude  oil  price
increases. The risk of instability in the European Union, economic uncertainty in China, the resolution of supply outages or a
resurgence in U.S. supply as producers quickly look to capitalize on any price rally, in combination with high inventory levels,
are likely to discourage higher crude oil prices.
WTI  is  an  important  benchmark  for  Canadian  crude  oil  since  it  reflects  inland  North  American  crude  oil  prices  and  its
Canadian dollar equivalent is the basis for determining royalties for a number of our crude oil properties. The average Brent-
WTI differential narrowed compared with the second quarter of 2015 and on a year-to-date basis as a result of declining U.S.
supply and the lifting of the U.S. export ban.
Cenovus Energy Inc.
Second Quarter 2016 Report
Page 12
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
WCS is blended heavy oil which consists of both conventional heavy oil and unconventional diluted bitumen. The average
WTI-WCS  differential  was  wider  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  and  on  a  year-to-date  basis  compared  with  2015.  The
differential  widened  despite  the  steep  decline  in  WTI  compared  with  2015  as  U.S.  domestic  light  oil  supply  declined  and
increased  imports  of  global  medium  crude  into  the  U.S.  are  expected  to  compete  for  coker  capacity,  pressuring  heavy  oil
prices.
Blending condensate with bitumen and heavy oil enables our production to be transported through pipelines. Our blending
ratios range from approximately 10 percent to 33 percent. The WCS-Condensate differential is an important benchmark as a
narrower differential generally results in an increase in the recovery of condensate costs when selling a barrel of blended
crude oil. Since the supply of condensate in Alberta does not meet the demand, Edmonton condensate prices may be driven
by U.S. Gulf Coast condensate prices plus the cost attributed to transporting the condensate to Edmonton.
Average condensate prices were weaker relative to the WTI benchmark price in the second quarter of 2016 due to the Alberta
forest fires reducing heavy oil production and the associated decline in diluent demand. In contrast, condensate was sold at
par with WTI during the second quarter of 2015.
Refining Benchmarks
The  Chicago  Regular  Unleaded  Gasoline  (“RUL”)  and  Chicago  Ultra-low  Sulphur  Diesel  (“ULSD”)  benchmark  prices  are
representative of inland refined product prices and are used to derive the Chicago 3-2-1 crack spread. The 3-2-1 crack spread
is an indicator of the refining margin generated by converting three barrels of crude oil into two barrels of regular unleaded
gasoline and one barrel of ultra-low sulphur diesel using current month WTI-based crude oil feedstock prices and valued on a
last in, first out accounting basis.
Average Chicago 3-2-1 crack spreads and Group 3 crack spreads decreased in the three and six months ended June 30,
2016,  compared  with  2015  due  to  higher  global  refined  product  inventory  and  strengthening  of  the  WTI  benchmark  price
compared with Brent, as evidenced by narrowing of the Brent-WTI differential.
Our realized crack spreads are affected by many other factors such as the variety of feedstock crude oil, refinery configuration
and product output, the time lag between the purchase and delivery of crude oil feedstock, and the cost of feedstock, which is
valued on a first in, first out (“FIFO”) accounting basis.
Natural Gas Benchmarks
Average  natural  gas  prices  decreased  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  and  on  a  year-to-date  basis  compared  with  2015
primarily  due  to  record-high  storage  levels  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada  resulting  from  a  warmer  than  normal  winter  and  the
resiliency of North American supply.
Foreign Exchange Benchmarks
Revenues are subject to foreign exchange exposure as the sales prices of our crude oil, natural gas and refined products are
determined by reference to U.S. benchmark prices. A decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar compared with the U.S.
dollar has a positive impact on our reported results. Likewise, as the Canadian dollar strengthens, our reported results are
lower. In addition to our revenues being denominated in U.S. dollars, we have chosen to borrow U.S. dollar long-term debt. In
periods  of  a  weakening  Canadian  dollar,  our  U.S.  dollar  debt  gives  rise  to  unrealized  foreign  exchange  losses  when
translated to Canadian dollars.
Cenovus Energy Inc.
Second Quarter 2016 Report
Page 13
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
In the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar due to lower
commodity prices and the expectation of higher U.S. interest rates. The weakening of the Canadian dollar in the first half of the
year, compared with 2015, had a positive impact of approximately $374 million on our revenues. As at June 30, 2016, the
Canadian dollar was stronger relative to the U.S. dollar on December 31, 2015, which resulted in $395 million of unrealized
foreign exchange gains on the translation of our U.S. dollar debt.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Selected Consolidated Financial Results
While crude oil prices improved from the first quarter of 2016, they were considerably lower than in the second quarter of 2015
and continued to have a significant impact on our financial results. The following key performance measures are discussed in

Combined Oil Sands and Conventional revenues declined 29 percent in the second quarter and 33 percent on a year-to-date
basis, compared with 2015, due to lower commodity prices and reduced sales volumes, partially offset by weakening of the
Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015 also
reduced revenues. These declines were partially offset by lower royalties.
Revenues from our Refining and Marketing segment in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased 13 percent
and 18 percent, respectively. Refining revenues declined due to the decrease in refined product pricing, consistent with lower
Chicago RUL and Chicago ULSD benchmark prices. The decrease in our reported revenues was partially offset by higher
refined  product  output  and  weakening  of  the  Canadian  dollar  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  Revenues  from third-party  sales
undertaken by the marketing group in the second quarter of 2016 increased from 2015 as higher purchased crude oil and
natural  gas  volumes  were  partially  offset  by  lower  sales  prices.  On  a  year-to-date  basis,  marketing  revenues  decreased
compared with 2015 due to lower sales prices, partially offset by higher purchased crude oil and natural gas volumes.
Corporate and Eliminations revenues relate to sales and operating revenues between segments and are recorded at transfer
prices based on current market prices.
Further information regarding our revenues can be found in the Reportable Segments section of this MD&A.

Operating Cash Flow
Page 14
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure used to provide a consistent measure of the cash generating performance of
our  assets  for  comparability  of  our  underlying  financial  performance  between  periods.  Operating  Cash  Flow  is  defined  as
revenues less purchased product, transportation and blending, operating expenses and production and mineral taxes plus
realized gains less realized losses on risk management activities. Items within the Corporate and Eliminations segment are
excluded from the calculation of Operating Cash Flow.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared With June 30, 2015
Operating Cash Flow declined 42 percent in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to:
●   A 32 percent decrease in our average crude oil sales price and a 46 percent decrease in our average natural gas sales
price, consistent with lower associated benchmark prices;
●   Lower Operating Cash Flow from Refining and Marketing as a result of lower average market crack spreads and higher
operating costs, partially offset by higher utilization rates, improved margins on the sale of secondary products, weakening
of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and widening heavy and medium crude oil differentials; and
●   A two percent decline in our crude oil sales volumes as well as an 11 percent decline in natural gas sales volumes.
These declines in Operating Cash Flow were partially offset by:
●   A $58 million decrease in crude oil transportation and blending costs primarily due to lower condensate prices, partially
offset by an increase in condensate volumes and transportation costs; and
●   A  $48  million  decrease  in  crude  oil  operating  expenses  primarily  due  to  lower  fuel  costs,  repairs  and  maintenance
activities, chemicals, electricity, workforce reductions, and workover activities.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared With June 30, 2015
Operating Cash Flow declined 54 percent in the first six months of 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to:
●   A 38 percent decrease in our average crude oil sales price and a 35 percent decrease in our average natural gas sales
price, consistent with lower associated benchmark prices;
●   Lower Operating Cash Flow from Refining and Marketing as a result of lower average market crack spreads and higher
operating costs, partially offset by improved margins on the sale of secondary products, weakening of the Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar and higher utilization rates; and
●   A five percent decrease in our crude oil sales volume and a 12 percent decline in our natural gas sales volumes.
These declines to Operating Cash Flow were partially offset by:
●   A $133 million decrease in crude oil transportation and blending costs primarily due to lower condensate prices, partially
offset by an increase in condensate volumes and higher transportation costs;
●   A  $97  million  decrease  in  crude  oil  operating  expenses  primarily  due  to  workforce  reductions,  lower  chemical  costs,
decreased  repairs  and  maintenance  costs,  a  reduction  in  fuel  costs  due  to  lower  natural  gas  prices  and  a  decline  in
workover activities; and
●   A $21 million decline in royalties primarily due to a decrease in crude oil sales prices.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Operating  Earnings  (Loss)  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  used  to  provide  a  consistent  measure  of  the  comparability  of  our
underlying financial performance between periods by removing non-operating items. Operating Earnings (Loss) is defined as
Earnings  (Loss)  Before  Income  Tax  excluding  gain  (loss)  on  discontinuance,  gain  on  bargain  purchase,  unrealized  risk
management gains (losses) on derivative instruments, unrealized foreign exchange gains (losses) on translation of U.S. dollar
denominated notes issued from Canada, foreign exchange gains (losses) on settlement of intercompany transactions, gains
(losses) on divestiture of assets, less income taxes on Operating Earnings (Loss) before tax, excluding the effect of changes in
statutory income tax rates and the recognition of an increase in U.S. tax basis.

Operating Earnings declined in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to lower
Cash Flow, as discussed above, the recognition of a non-cash expense of $17 million ($31 million on a year-to-date basis) in
connection with certain Calgary office space in excess of Cenovus’s current and near-term requirements and a larger deferred
income tax recovery in the prior periods, partially offset by lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”).

Net Earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased primarily due to:
●   A decline in Operating Earnings, as discussed above;
●   Unrealized risk management losses of $284 million in the quarter compared with unrealized losses of $151 million in the
second quarter of 2015; and
●   Non-operating unrealized foreign exchange losses of $18 million related to the translation of our U.S. dollar denominated
debt compared with unrealized gains of $99 million in 2015.
These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  a  higher  deferred  income  tax  recovery  in  2016  primarily  due  to  the  impact  of
unrealized risk management losses.
Net Earnings improved for the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to non-operating unrealized foreign exchange
gains of $395 million compared with unrealized losses of $415 million in 2015 and a higher deferred income tax recovery.
These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  a  decline  in  Operating  Earnings,  as  discussed  above,  and  unrealized  risk
management losses of $433 million on a year-to-date basis compared with unrealized losses of $296 million in 2015.

Capital  investment  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  declined  34  percent  and  37  percent  respectively,
compared with 2015, as we reduced our spending in light of the low commodity price environment.
Oil Sands capital investment focused primarily on sustaining capital related to existing production, as well as work to complete
the phase G expansion at Foster Creek and the Christina Lake expansion phase F. Conventional capital investment focused
on maintenance capital and spending for our CO2 enhanced oil recovery project at Weyburn.
Capital investment in the Refining and Marketing segment focused on the debottlenecking project at Wood River, in addition
to capital maintenance, projects to improve our refinery reliability and safety, and environmental initiatives.
Further information regarding our capital investment can be found in the Reportable Segments section of this MD&A.
Capital Investment Decisions
Our disciplined approach to capital allocation includes prioritizing our uses of cash flow in the following manner:
●   First, to capital for our existing business operations;
●   Second, to paying a dividend as part of providing strong total shareholder return; and
●   Third, for growth or discretionary capital.
Our approach to capital allocation includes evaluating all opportunities using specific rigorous criteria within the context of
achieving  our  objectives  of  maintaining  a  prudent  and  flexible  capital  structure  and  strong  balance  sheet  metrics,  which
position us to be financially resilient in times of lower cash flow. In addition, we continue to evaluate other corporate and
financial  opportunities,  including  generating  cash  from  our  existing  portfolio.  Refer  to  the  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources
section of this MD&A for further information.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Our reportable segments are as follows:
Oil Sands, which includes the development and production of
bitumen  and  natural  gas  in  northeast  Alberta.  Cenovus’s
bitumen  assets  include  Foster  Creek,  Christina  Lake  and
Narrows  Lake  as  well  as  projects  in  the  early  stages  of
development,  such  as  Grand  Rapids  and  Telephone  Lake.
Certain  of  Cenovus’s  operated  oil  sands  properties,  notably
Foster  Creek,  Christina  Lake  and  Narrows  Lake,  are  jointly
owned with ConocoPhillips, an unrelated U.S. public company.
Conventional, which includes the development and production
of conventional crude oil, NGLs and natural gas in Alberta and
Saskatchewan, including the heavy oil assets at Pelican Lake,
the  carbon  dioxide  enhanced  oil  recovery  project  at  Weyburn
and emerging tight oil opportunities.
Refining and Marketing, which is responsible for transporting,
selling  and  refining  crude  oil  into  petroleum  and  chemical
products.  Cenovus  jointly  owns  two  refineries  in  the  U.S.  with
the operator Phillips 66, an unrelated U.S. public company. In
addition, Cenovus owns and operates a crude-by-rail terminal in
Alberta.  This  segment  coordinates  Cenovus’s  marketing  and
transportation initiatives to optimize product mix, delivery points,
  
transportation commitments and customer diversification.
Corporate  and  Eliminations,  which  primarily  includes  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  on  derivative  financial
instruments, gains and losses on divestiture of assets, as well as other Cenovus-wide costs for general and administrative,
financing activities and research costs. As financial instruments are settled, the realized gains and losses are recorded in the
operating  segment  to  which  the  derivative  instrument  relates.  Eliminations  relate  to  sales  and  operating  revenues,  and
purchased  product  between  segments,  recorded  at  transfer  prices  based  on  current  market  prices,  and  to  unrealized
intersegment profits in inventory.

In northeastern Alberta, we are a 50 percent partner in the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake oil sands projects.
We  have  several  emerging  projects  in  the  early  stages  of  development,  including  our 100  percent-owned  projects  at
Telephone Lake and Grand Rapids. The Oil Sands segment also includes the Athabasca natural gas property, from which a
portion of the natural gas production is used as fuel at the adjacent Foster Creek operations.
Significant developments in our Oil Sands segment in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 include:
●   Crude oil netbacks, excluding realized risk management activities, of $14.43 per barrel, a 47 percent decrease from the
second quarter of 2015;
●   Decreasing our crude oil operating costs by $20 million or $2.51 per barrel to $8.06 per barrel;
●   Higher production at Foster Creek by 11 percent to an average of 64,544 barrels per day; and
●   Reducing capital investment by $121 million.

(1) Revenues include the value of condensate sold as heavy oil blend. Condensate costs are recorded in transportation and
blending expense. The crude oil price excludes the impact of condensate purchases.
Revenues
Pricing
In the second quarter, our average realized crude oil sales price was $30.59 per barrel. While our average price improved
from the first quarter price of $10.13 per barrel, it was 33 percent lower than in the second quarter of 2015. The decline in our
realized crude oil price was consistent with the decrease in the WCS and Christina Dilbit Blend (“CDB”) benchmark prices.
Weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and increased sales into the U.S. market, which generally secure
a higher sales price, positively impacted our realized sales prices.
Our realized bitumen price is influenced by the cost of condensate used in blending. As the cost of condensate increases
relative to the price of blended crude oil, our realized bitumen price declines. In addition, our cost for condensate is generally
higher  than  benchmark  due  to  transportation  between  market  hubs  and  field  locations,  partially  offset  by  the  impact  of
inventory timing in a rising price environment.
The  WCS-CDB  differential  widened  to  a  discount  of  US$2.64  per  barrel  (2015  –  discount  of  US$2.00  per  barrel).  In  the
second quarter, 90 percent of our Christina Lake production was sold as CDB (2015 – 88 percent), with the remainder sold
into  the  WCS  stream.  Christina  Lake  production,  whether  sold  as  CDB  or  blended  with  WCS  and  subject  to  a  quality
equalization charge, is priced at a discount to WCS.

Second Quarter 2016 Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Production at Foster Creek was higher compared with 2015 primarily due to an 11-day precautionary shut-down in the second
quarter of 2015 due to a nearby forest fire, which reduced production by approximately 10,500 barrels per day. Production in
the second quarter of 2016 benefited from new wells that were brought online in the second quarter.
Production from Christina Lake increased compared with the second quarter of 2015 due to additional wells and consistent
performance of our facilities.
Condensate
The bitumen currently produced by Cenovus must be blended with condensate to reduce its thickness in order to transport it to
market. Revenues represent the total value of blended crude oil sold and include the value of condensate. Consistent with the
widening of the WCS-Condensate differential during the second quarter, the proportion of the cost of condensate recovered
decreased.
Royalties
Royalty calculations for our oil sands projects are based on government prescribed pre- and post-payout royalty rates which
are  determined  on  a  sliding  scale  using  the  Canadian  dollar  equivalent  WTI  benchmark  price.  Royalty  calculations  differ
between properties.
Royalties at Foster Creek, a post-payout project, are based on an annualized calculation which uses the greater of: (1) the
gross revenues multiplied by the applicable royalty rate (one to nine percent, based on the Canadian dollar equivalent WTI
benchmark price); or (2) the net profits of the project multiplied by the applicable royalty rate (25 to 40 percent, based on the
Canadian dollar equivalent WTI benchmark price). Gross revenues are a function of sales volumes and realized sales prices.
Net  profits  are  a  function  of  sales  volumes,  realized  sales  prices  and  allowed  operating  and  capital  costs.  The  royalty
calculation was based on gross revenues as compared with a calculation based on net profits for 2015.
Royalties at Christina Lake, a pre-payout project, are based on a monthly calculation that applies a royalty rate (ranging from
one to nine percent, based on the Canadian dollar equivalent WTI benchmark price) to the gross revenues from the project.

Royalties decreased $13 million in the second quarter relative to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the decline in
crude oil sales prices, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes.
Expenses
Transportation and Blending
Transportation and blending costs decreased $40 million or nine percent. Blending costs declined primarily as a result of
lower condensate prices partially offset by higher condensate volumes from increased production. Our condensate costs were
higher than the average benchmark price in the second quarter due to the transportation expense associated with moving the
condensate to our oil sands projects. However, we experienced some of the benefit of using condensate purchased at a lower
price earlier in the year.
Transportation costs increased due to tariffs from additional sales to the U.S. market, which generally secure higher sales
prices, and shipping higher volumes due to increased production. Additionally, costs increased due to charges associated
with capacity commitments in excess of our current production. Future production growth is expected to reduce our per-barrel
transportation costs.
Transportation costs also increased as a result of moving higher volumes by rail in the current quarter compared with 2015.
We transported an average of 10,810 gross barrels per day of crude oil by rail, consisting of 16 unit train shipments (2015 –
5,210 gross barrels per day, eight unit train shipments). The 16 unit trains were loaded at our crude-by-rail terminal, located in
Bruderheim, Alberta.
Operating
Primary  drivers  of  our  operating  expenses  for  the  second  quarter  were  workforce,  fuel,  chemical  costs,  repairs  and
maintenance, and workovers. Total operating expenses decreased $20 million primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices
that reduced fuel costs, lower repairs and maintenance activities, lower electrical costs and workforce reductions.

●   Lower repairs and maintenance costs due to a focus on critical operational activities;
●   Higher production volumes; and
●   A reduction in workover expenses due to fewer pump changes.
At Christina Lake, fuel costs decreased due to lower natural gas prices partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption on a
per-barrel basis. Non-fuel operating expenses declined due to higher production and recording a credit due to the revaluation
of greenhouse gas credits because of regulation amendments, partially offset by additional fluid, waste handling and trucking
costs from increased activity levels.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our average realized crude oil sales price was $20.28 per barrel, a 43 percent
decrease  from  2015.  The  decline  in  our  realized  crude  oil  price  was  consistent  with  the  decrease  in  the  WCS  and  CDB
benchmark prices, partially offset by weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and increased sales into the
U.S. market, which generally secure a higher sales price.
In the first half of 2016, 90 percent of our Christina Lake production was sold as CDB (2015 – 87 percent), with the remainder
sold into the WCS stream.

Production at Foster Creek was slightly lower compared with 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, new wells were brought
online and wells down for servicing early in 2016 were brought back online, partially offsetting the lower production in the first
quarter. Production at Foster Creek in the first half of 2015 was reduced by approximately 5,300 barrels per day, net, due to an
11-day shut-down as a safety precaution due to a nearby forest fire.
Production from Christina Lake increased in the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to production from additional wells and
improved performance of our facilities.

Royalties decreased $16 million, primarily related to the decline in crude oil sales prices, partially offset by an increase in
sales volumes.
At Foster Creek, low crude oil sales prices and the true-up of the 2015 royalty calculation decreased the overall royalty rate in
the first half of 2016. In addition, we received regulatory approval in 2015 to include certain capital costs incurred in previous
years in our royalty calculation and recorded an associated credit, decreasing the overall royalty rate. Excluding the credit, the
effective royalty rate in 2015 for Foster Creek would have been 5.0 percent.
The Christina Lake royalty rate decreased in 2016 as a result of lower realized sales prices.

Expenses
Transportation and Blending
Page 23
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Transportation  and  blending  costs  decreased  $106  million  or  12  percent.  Blending  costs  declined  primarily  due  to  lower
condensate prices, partially offset by an increase in condensate volumes consistent with higher production. Our condensate
costs  exceeded  the  average  benchmark  price  in  2016  primarily  due  to  the  utilization  of  higher  priced  inventory  and  the
transportation cost associated with moving the condensate to our oil sands projects.
Transportation costs increased primarily due to tariffs from additional sales to the U.S. market, which generally secure higher
sales  prices,  and  shipping  higher  volumes  due  to  increased  production.  Additionally,  costs  increased  due  to  charges
associated with capacity commitments in excess of our current production. Future production growth is expected to reduce our
per-barrel transportation costs.
Lower volumes were moved by rail in the first half of 2016; however, rail costs increased slightly as we transported volumes
across farther distances. We transported an average of 7,718 gross barrels per day of crude oil by rail, consisting of 23 unit
train shipments (2015 – 8,522 gross barrels per day, 26 unit train shipments). The 23 unit trains were loaded at our crude-by-
rail terminal, located in Bruderheim, Alberta.
Operating
Primary drivers of our operating expenses in the first half of 2016 were workforce, fuel, workovers, chemicals, and repairs and
maintenance. Total operating expenses decreased $37 million primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices that reduced
fuel costs, a decline in repairs and maintenance, and reduced workforce.

Athabasca property is used as fuel at Foster Creek. Our natural gas production for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, net of internal usage, was 18 MMcf per day and 17 MMcf per day, respectively (2015 – 21 MMcf per day and 20 MMcf
per day respectively).
Operating cash flow from our Oil Sands natural gas production was $nil in the second quarter (2015 – $1 million) and $1
million on a year-to-date basis (2015 – $4 million), declining primarily due to lower natural gas sales prices.

Capital investment at Foster Creek and Christina Lake focused on sustaining capital related to existing production and drilling
stratigraphic  test  wells  in  the  first  quarter  to  help  identify  well  pad  locations  for  sustaining  wells  and  near-term  expansion
phases. Activity in the first half of the year also related to Foster Creek expansion phase G and Christina Lake expansion
phase  F,  both  of  which  remain  on  track.  Capital  investment  declined  in  the  second  quarter  and  on  a  year-to-date  basis
primarily  due  to  spending  reductions  in  response  to  the  low  commodity  price  environment.  Lower  capital  investment  at
Christina Lake is also attributable to the completion of the optimization project in 2015.
Capital investment at Narrows Lake focused on detailed engineering during the first half of 2016. Capital investment declined
in 2016 compared with 2015 due to the suspension of construction at Narrows Lake.
Emerging Projects
Telephone Lake capital investment declined in 2016 in response to the current low commodity price environment. In the first
half of 2015, Telephone Lake capital investment focused on front-end engineering work for the central processing facility.
Capital investment at Grand Rapids decreased during the first half of 2016 as spending was limited to the wind down of the
SAGD pilot. In the first half of 2015, a third pilot well pair was drilled at Grand Rapids.

Future Capital Investment
We  have  adopted  a  more  moderate  and  staged  approach  to  future  oil  sands  expansions  due  to  the  low  commodity  price
environment.
Existing Projects
Foster Creek is currently producing from phases A through F, with some initial capacity in phase G becoming available late in
the second quarter. Capital investment for 2016 is forecast to be between $280 million and $310 million. We plan to continue
focusing on sustaining capital related to existing production as well as completing expansion phase G. We expect phase G to
add  initial  design  capacity  of  30,000  gross  barrels  per  day  in  the  third  quarter  of  2016,  with  ramp-up  to  design  capacity
expected to take 12 to 18 months. Spending related to construction work on phase H was deferred in response to the low
commodity price environment, pushing the expected start-up to beyond 2017. Phase H has an initial design capacity of 30,000
gross barrels per day. In December 2014, we received regulatory approval for expansion phase J, a 50,000 gross barrels per
day phase.
Christina Lake is producing from phases A through E. Capital investment for 2016 is forecast to be between $280 million and
$310 million, focused on sustaining capital related to existing production and expansion phase F. We anticipate adding gross
production  capacity  of  50,000  barrels  per  day  from  phase  F  in  the  third  quarter  of  2016,  with  ramp-up  to  design  capacity
expected to take 12 to 18 months. Construction work on phase G was deferred in 2015 in response to the low commodity price
environment, pushing the expected start-up to beyond 2017. Phase G has an initial design capacity of 50,000 gross barrels
per  day.  We  received  regulatory  approval  in  December  2015  for  the  phase  H  expansion,  a  50,000  gross  barrels  per  day
phase.
Capital  investment  at  Narrows  Lake  in  2016  is  forecast  to  be  between  $10  million  and  $20  million,  focusing  on  phase  A
detailed engineering.
Emerging Projects
Capital investment for our new resource plays is forecast to be between $35 million and $45 million in 2016.
Depreciation, Depletion & Amortization
We deplete crude oil and natural gas properties on a unit-of-production basis over proved reserves. The unit-of-production rate
takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with future development expenditures required to develop those
proved reserves. This rate, calculated at an area level, is then applied to our sales volume to determine DD&A in a given
period. We believe that this method of calculating DD&A charges each barrel of crude oil equivalent sold with its proportionate
share of the cost of capital invested over the total estimated life of the related asset as represented by proved reserves.
The following calculation illustrates how the implied depletion rate for our upstream assets could be determined using the
reported consolidated data:
($ millions, unless otherwise indicated)
Upstream Property, Plant and Equipment

December 31, 2015  
12,627  
19,671  
32,298

While this illustrates the calculation of the implied depletion rate, our depletion rates are slightly higher and result in a total
average  rate  ranging  between  $13.50  to  $14.50  per  BOE.  Amounts  related  to  assets  under  construction,  which  would  be
included  in  the  total  upstream  cost  base  and  would  have  proved  reserves  attributed  to  them,  are  not  depleted.  Property
specific rates will exclude upstream assets that are depreciated on a straight-line basis. As

such,  our  actual  depletion  will  differ  from  depletion  calculated  by  applying  the  above  implied  depletion  rate.  Further
information on our accounting policy for DD&A is included in our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30  2016,  Oil  Sands  DD&A  decreased  $2  million  and  $24  million,  respectively,
primarily due to lower DD&A rates partially offset by higher sales volumes. The average depletion rate for the first six months
of  2016  was  approximately  $11.55  per  barrel  compared  with  $11.65  per  barrel  in  2015  as  the  impact  of  proved  reserves
additions offset higher PP&E and future development expenditures. Future development costs, which compose approximately
60 percent of the depletable base, increased due to expansion of the development area at Christina Lake.
CONVENTIONAL
Our  Conventional  operations  include  dependable  cash  flow  producing  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  assets  in  Alberta  and
Saskatchewan, including a CO2 enhanced oil recovery project in Weyburn, our heavy oil asset at Pelican Lake that uses
polymer flood and waterflood technology and emerging tight oil assets in Alberta. The established assets in this segment are
strategically  important  for  their  long-life  reserves,  stable  operations  and  diversity  of  crude  oil  produced.  The  cash  flow
generated in our Conventional operations helps to fund future growth opportunities in our Oil Sands segment while our natural
gas production acts as an economic hedge for the natural gas required as a fuel source at both our oil sands and refining
operations.
Significant developments that impacted our Conventional segment in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 include:
●   Crude oil and natural gas netbacks, excluding realized risk management activities, of $18.06 per barrel (2015 – $31.69 per
barrel) and $0.28 per Mcf (2015 – $1.59 per Mcf), respectively;
●   Crude oil production averaging 55,476 barrels per day, decreasing 20 percent due to natural declines and the sale of our
royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business. Divested assets contributed an average of 4,300 barrels per day in the
second quarter of 2015;
●   Reducing our crude oil operating costs by $28 million. Operating costs per barrel decreased nine percent due to lower
repairs and maintenance and workover activities, chemical consumption, electricity prices and workforce reductions; and
●   Generating Operating Cash Flow net of capital investment of $83 million, a decrease of 69 percent.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Our Conventional crude oil assets produce a diverse spectrum of crude oils, ranging from heavy oil, which secures a price
based on the WCS benchmark, to light oil, which secures a price closer to the WTI benchmark.
Our realized crude oil sales price averaged $42.03 per barrel in the second quarter, a 25 percent decrease from the second
quarter of 2015, consistent with lower crude oil benchmark prices, net of applicable differentials. However, this is a 41 percent
increase from the first quarter 2016 realized average price of $29.82 per barrel.

Crude oil production declined due to expected natural declines and the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands
business. Divested assets contributed an average of 4,300 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015.
Production  at  Pelican  Lake  was  shut-down  for  two  days  as  a  safety  precaution  due  to  a  nearby  forest  fire;  there  was  no
damage to our facilities. Lost production has been estimated at approximately 650 barrels per day, for the quarter.
Condensate
The heavy oil currently produced by Cenovus must be blended with condensate to reduce its thickness in order to transport it
to market. Revenues represent the total value of blended crude oil sold and include the value of condensate. Consistent with
the  widening  of  the  WCS-Condensate  differential  during  the  second  quarter,  the  proportion  of  the  cost  of  condensate
recovered decreased.
Royalties
Royalties  decreased  in  the  second  quarter  primarily  due  to  lower  realized  sales  prices  and  a  decrease  in  sales  volumes
partially offset by additional royalty burdens at Pelican Lake, Weyburn and other conventional assets resulting from the sale of
our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015. In the second quarter, the effective crude oil royalty rate for our
Conventional properties was 15.5 percent (2015 – 10.2 percent).
Crown royalties at Pelican Lake are determined under oil sands royalty calculations. Pelican Lake is a post-payout project,
therefore royalties are based on an annualized calculation which uses the greater of: (1) the gross revenues multiplied by the
applicable royalty rate (one to nine percent, based on the Canadian dollar equivalent WTI benchmark price); or (2) the net
profits of the project multiplied by the applicable royalty rate (25 to 40 percent, based on the Canadian dollar equivalent WTI
benchmark price). Gross revenues are a function of sales volumes and realized sales prices. Net profits are a function of sales
volumes, realized sales prices and allowed operating and capital costs. The Pelican Lake crown royalty calculation is based
on net profits.
In the second quarter of 2016, production and mineral taxes decreased consistent with the decline in crude oil prices and due
to the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015.
Expenses
Transportation and Blending
Transportation and blending costs decreased $18 million. Blending costs declined due to lower condensate prices as well as
a decrease in condensate volumes, consistent with lower production.
Transportation charges were lower largely due to a decline in sales volumes and a reduction in the volumes moved by rail,
partially  offset  by  additional  costs  due  to  pipeline  capacity  commitments  in  excess  of  our  current  production.  We  did  not
transport any volumes by rail in the second quarter of 2016 (2015 – 822 barrels per day).
Operating
Primary drivers of our operating expenses in the second quarter of 2016 were workforce, workovers, property taxes and lease
costs, and electricity. Operating costs declined nine percent to $14.00 per barrel primarily due to:
●   A  decline  in  repairs  and  maintenance  and  workover  costs  as  a  result  of  focusing  on  critical  activities  and  achieving
operational efficiencies;
●   Lower chemical costs associated with reduced polymer consumption;
●   Reduced electricity costs as a result of a decrease in consumption and a decline in prices; and
●   Workforce reductions.
These decreases were partially offset by lower production.

Royalties
Royalties decreased $7 million primarily due to lower realized sales prices and a decrease in sales volumes partially offset by
additional  royalty  burdens  at  Pelican  Lake,  Weyburn  and  other  conventional  assets  resulting  from  the  sale  of  our  royalty
interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015. In the first six months of 2016, the effective crude oil royalty rate for our
Conventional properties was 14.3 percent (2015 – 9.0 percent). The Pelican Lake crown royalty calculation was based on net
profits in both 2016 and 2015.
Production and mineral taxes decreased on a year-to-date basis, consistent with lower crude oil prices in 2016, and due to the
sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015.
Expenses
Transportation and Blending
Transportation and blending costs decreased $27 million. Blending costs declined primarily due to lower condensate prices
as well as a decrease in condensate volumes, consistent with lower production.
Transportation  charges  were  lower  largely  due  to  a  decline  in  sales  volumes  and  a  reduction  in  volumes  moved  by  rail,
partially offset by additional costs due to pipeline capacity commitments in excess of our current production. In the first half of
2016, we did not transport any volumes by rail (2015 – 1,204 barrels per day).
Operating
Primary drivers of our operating expenses in the first six months of 2016 were workforce costs, workover activities, electricity,
property  taxes  and  lease  costs,  chemical  consumption,  and  repairs  and  maintenance.  Operating  expenses  declined  $60
million or $1.49 per barrel.
The per unit decline was primarily due to:
●      A decline in repairs and maintenance and workover costs due to a focus on critical operational activities;
●      Lower chemical costs associated with reduced polymer consumption;
●      Workforce reductions; and
●      Lower electricity costs as a result of a decrease in consumption and a decline in prices.
These decreases were partially offset by lower production.

Revenues
Pricing
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, our average natural gas sales price decreased 46 percent to $1.52 per Mcf
and 35 percent to $1.92 per Mcf, respectively. This is consistent with the decline in the AECO benchmark price.
Production
Production decreased by 11 percent to 381 MMcf per day in the second quarter and 386 MMcf per day on a year-to-date basis
due to expected natural declines and from the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business, which produced
14 MMcf and 17 MMcf per day, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
Royalties
Royalties increased as a result of additional royalty burdens due to the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands
business, partially offset by lower prices and production declines. The average royalty rate in the second quarter was 4.1
percent (2015 – 1.1 percent) and 4.3 percent (2015 – 1.4 percent) on a year-to-date basis.
Expenses
Transportation
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, transportation costs were relatively consistent with 2015. Cost reductions
due to the decline in sales volumes were offset by additional charges from a true-up of 2015 transportation contracts.
Operating
Primary drivers of our operating expenses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were property taxes and lease
costs,  and  workforce.  Operating  expenses  decreased  by  $7  million  and  $12  million,  respectively,  primarily  due  to  lower
workforce costs, electricity due to lower pricing, and repairs and maintenance.
Risk Management
Risk management activities resulted in an impact of $nil in the second quarter and realized losses of $1 million on a year-to-
date basis (2015 – gains of $15 million in the second quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis), consistent with average
benchmark prices approaching our contract prices.

project at Weyburn. Capital investment declined in the first half of 2016 primarily due to spending reductions on crude oil
activities in response to the low commodity price environment.

Drilling activity in the first six months of 2016 focused on natural gas recompletions performed to optimize production.
Future Capital Investment
We are taking a more moderate approach to developing our conventional crude oil opportunities due to the low commodity
price environment. We plan to focus on drilling projects that are considered to be relatively low risk, with short production cycle
times and strong expected returns.
Our 2016 crude oil capital investment forecast is between $125 million and $150 million with spending plans mainly focused
on maintaining and optimizing current production volumes.
DD&A
We deplete crude oil and natural gas properties on a unit-of-production basis over proved reserves. The unit-of-production rate
takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with future development expenditures required to develop those
proved reserves. This rate, calculated at an area level, is then applied to our sales volume to determine DD&A in a given
period. We believe that this method of calculating DD&A charges each barrel of crude oil equivalent sold with its proportionate
share of the cost of capital invested over the total estimated life of the related asset as represented by proved reserves.
Conventional  DD&A  decreased  $116  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  due  to  a  decline  in  sales  volumes  and  lower
DD&A rates. The average depletion rate decreased approximately 20 percent in 2016 as the impact of lower proved reserves
due  to  the  slowdown  of  our  development  plans  was  more  than  offset  by  lower  PP&E.  PP&E  declined,  in  part,  from  an
impairment charge of $184 million associated with our Northern Alberta CGU recorded at December 31, 2015 and a decrease
in estimated decommissioning costs. Future development costs, which compose approximately 40 percent of the depletable
base, declined from 2015 due to minimal capital investment planned at Pelican Lake in the near term.
DD&A decreased $56 million on a year-to-date basis. The impact of lower sales volumes and lower DD&A rates were partially
offset by a $170 million impairment charge associated with our Northern Alberta CGU recorded in the first quarter of 2016.
REFINING AND MARKETING
We  are  a  50  percent  partner  in  the  Wood  River  and  Borger  refineries,  which  are  located  in  the  U.S.  Our  Refining  and
Marketing segment positions us to capture the value from crude oil production through to refined products such as diesel,
gasoline  and  jet  fuel.  Our  integrated  approach  provides  a  natural  economic  hedge  against  widening  crude  oil  price
differentials by providing lower feedstock prices to our refineries.
This  segment  also  captures  our  marketing  and  transportation  initiatives  as  well  as  our  crude-by-rail  terminal  operations
located in Bruderheim, Alberta. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, 17 and 24 unit trains, respectively, were
loaded at Bruderheim, including one unit train for a third party.

(1)      Represents 100 percent of the Wood River and Borger refinery operations.
(2)      The official nameplate capacity, based on 95 percent of the highest average rate achieved over a continuous 30-day
period.
On a 100-percent basis, our refineries have total processing capacity of approximately 460,000 gross barrels per day of crude
oil,  including  processing  capability  of  up  to  255,000  gross  barrels  per  day  of  blended  heavy  crude  oil.  We  also  have
processing capacity of 45,000 gross barrels per day of NGLs. The ability to process a wide slate of crude oils allows us to
economically  integrate  our  heavy  crude  oil  production.  Processing  less  expensive  crude  oil  creates  a  feedstock  cost
advantage, illustrated by the discount of WCS relative to WTI. The amount of heavy crude oil processed, such as WCS and
CDB, is dependent on the quality and quantity of available crude oil with the total input slate being optimized at each refinery
to maximize economic benefit. Our crude utilization represents the percentage of total crude oil processed in our refineries
relative to the total capacity.
Crude oil runs increased in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015. Higher heavy crude oil volumes were processed
due to the optimization of our total crude input slate, which reduces our feedstock costs. Refined product output increased due
to consistent performance of both the Wood River and Borger refineries. In the second quarter of 2015, unplanned outages at
our Borger refinery resulted from process unit outages and a power interruption.
On a year-to-date basis, crude oil runs and refined product output increased. Consistent performance in the current quarter
was partially offset by planned and unplanned maintenance at our Wood River and Borger refineries in the first quarter of
2016. In the first half of 2015, we experienced unplanned outages and completed a planned turnaround at the Borger refinery.

Gross Margin
Our realized crack spreads are affected by many factors, such as the variety of feedstock crude oil, refinery configuration and
the proportion of gasoline, distillate and secondary product output; the time lag between the purchase of crude oil feedstock
and the processing of that crude oil through our refineries; and the cost of feedstock. Our feedstock costs are valued on a FIFO
accounting basis.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, our gross margin declined primarily due to lower average market crack
spreads as a result of higher global refined product inventory and narrowing of the Brent-WTI differential by 75 percent. This
was partially offset by:
●   An increase in refined product output;
●   Improved margins on the sale of our secondary products, such as coke, asphalt and sulfur, due to lower overall feedstock
costs consistent with the decline in WTI;
●   The weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S.
dollar in the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, compared with 2015, had a positive impact of approximately $18
million and $39 million, respectively, on our refining gross margin; and
●   Widening heavy and medium crude oil differentials.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Our  refineries  do  not  blend  renewable  fuels  into  the  motor  fuel  products  we  produce.  Consequently,  we  are  obligated  to
purchase Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”). In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the cost of our RINs
were $67 million and $129 million, respectively (2015 – $40 million and $93 million, respectively). The increase is consistent
with the rise in the ethanol RINs benchmark price.
Revenues from third-party crude oil and natural gas sales undertaken by the marketing group in the second quarter increased
two percent from 2015. Higher purchased crude oil and natural gas volumes were partially offset by lower sales prices. On a
year-to-date basis, revenues from third-party sales decreased eight percent compared with 2015 due to lower sales prices,
partially offset by higher purchased crude oil and natural gas volumes.
Operating Expense
Primary drivers of operating expenses in the second quarter of 2016 and on a year-to-date basis were labour, maintenance
and utilities. Reported operating expenses increased in the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis compared with 2015
primarily due to weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and additional maintenance activities, partially
offset by a decline in utility costs resulting from lower natural gas prices.

Capital  expenditures  in  the  first  half  of  2016  focused  on  the  debottlenecking  project  at  Wood  River,  capital  maintenance,
projects to improve our refinery reliability and safety, and environmental initiatives. Start-up of the Wood River debottlenecking
project is anticipated in the third quarter of 2016.
In 2016, we expect to invest between $230 million and $280 million mainly related to the debottlenecking project at Wood
River, in addition to maintenance, reliability and environmental initiatives.
DD&A
Refining and the crude-by-rail terminal assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated service life of each
component of the facilities, which range from three to 40 years. The service lives of these assets are reviewed on an annual
basis. Refining and Marketing DD&A increased by $5 million in the second quarter and $14 million on a year-to-date basis,
primarily due to the change in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate.
CORPORATE AND ELIMINATIONS
The Corporate and Eliminations segment includes intersegment eliminations relating to transactions that have been recorded
at transfer prices based on current market prices, as well as unrealized intersegment profits in inventory. The gains and losses
on risk management represent the unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to derivative financial instruments used
to  mitigate  fluctuations  in  commodity  prices,  and  the  unrealized mark-to-market  gains  and  losses  on  the  long-term  power
purchase contract and interest rate swaps. In the second quarter of 2016, our risk management activities resulted in $284
million  of  unrealized  losses  (2015  –  $151  million  of  unrealized  losses).  On  a  year-to-date  basis,  we  had  $433  million  of
unrealized  losses  (2015  –  $296  million  of  unrealized  losses).  The  Corporate  and  Eliminations  segment  also  includes
Cenovus-wide costs for general and administrative, financing and research costs.

Expenses
General and Administrative
Page 34
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Primary drivers of our general and administrative expenses in 2016 were workforce, office rent and information technology
costs. General and administrative expenses increased by $17 million in the second quarter and $6 million on a year-to-date
basis.  Savings  from  workforce  reductions,  lower  information  technology  costs  and  discretionary  spending  were  offset  by
severance costs of approximately $19 million recorded in the second quarter related to the workforce reductions implemented
in  April  2016.  Additionally,  a  non-cash  expense  of  $17  million  ($31  million  on  a  year-to-date  basis)  was  recorded  in
connection with certain Calgary office space in excess of Cenovus’s current and near-term requirements.
Finance Costs
Finance  costs  include  interest  expense  on  our  long-term  debt  and  short-term  borrowings  as  well  as  the  unwinding  of  the
discount on decommissioning liabilities. Finance costs increased $6 million and $9 million, respectively, in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 as weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar increased reported interest on
our U.S. dollar denominated debt.
The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was 5.3 percent
(2015 – 5.3 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively).

The  majority  of  unrealized  foreign  exchange  gains  resulted  from  the  translation  of  our  U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt.  The
Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, at June 30, 2016 was slightly weaker compared with March 31, 2016, resulting in
unrealized losses of $18 million in the second quarter. The Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, strengthened by six
percent from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 resulting in year-to-date unrealized gains of $395 million.
DD&A
Corporate and Eliminations DD&A includes provisions in respect of corporate assets, such as computer equipment, leasehold
improvements and office furniture. Costs associated with corporate assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated service life of the assets, which range from three to 25 years. The service lives of these assets are reviewed on an
annual basis. DD&A in the second quarter was $19 million (2015 – $21 million) and $36 million on a year-to-date basis (2015
– $42 million).

Tax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which Cenovus and its subsidiaries operate are
subject to change. We believe that our provision for income taxes is adequate. There are usually a number of tax matters
under review and as a result, income taxes are subject to measurement uncertainty. The timing of the recognition of income
and deductions for the purpose of current tax expense is determined by relevant tax legislation.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred losses for income tax purposes, which will be carried back to
recover income taxes previously paid in Canada or recognized as a deferred tax recovery. In the second quarter of 2015, the
current tax expense included an acceleration of current tax payable on prior year partnership earnings due to certain corporate
restructuring transactions.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, a deferred tax recovery was recorded. The recovery was largely due to the
reversal of timing differences associated with the recognition of partnership income, unrealized risk management losses, the
recognition of a benefit from capital losses not previously recognized and 2015 losses, partially offset by a one-time charge of
approximately $168 million from the revaluation of the deferred tax liability due to the increase in the Alberta corporate tax rate.
The benefit of the capital losses was recognized as a result of the agreement to dispose of the royalty interest and mineral fee
title lands business.
Our effective tax rate is a function of the relationship between total tax expense and the amount of earnings before income
taxes.  The  effective  tax  rate  differs  from  the  statutory  tax  rate  as  it  reflects  higher  U.S.  tax  rates,  permanent  differences,
adjustments for changes in tax rates and other tax legislation, variations in the estimate of reserves and differences between
the provision and the actual amounts subsequently reported on the tax returns.
Our  effective  tax  rate  differs  from  the  statutory  rate  due  to  approximately  $395  million  of  unrealized  non-taxable  foreign
exchange gains.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Operating Activities
Cash from operating activities decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 mainly due to lower Cash Flow,
as discussed in the Financial Results section of this MD&A. Excluding risk management assets and liabilities, working capital
was $4,141 million at June 30, 2016 compared with $4,337 million at December 31, 2015.
We anticipate that we will continue to meet our payment obligations as they come due.
Investing Activities
Capital  investment  declined  in  the  current  quarter  and  on  a  year-to-date  basis  primarily  due  to  spending  reductions  in
response to the low commodity price environment.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities decreased in the second quarter of 2016 as we paid dividends of $0.05 per share or $42
million (2015 – $0.2662 per share or $223 million, of which $125 million was paid in cash with the remainder reinvested in
common shares issued from treasury through our dividend reinvestment plan).
During the first half of 2016, we paid dividends of $0.10 per share or $83 million (2015 – $0.5324 per share or $445 million of
which $263 million was paid in cash). In the first half of 2015, cash from financing activities included 67.5 million common
shares issued at a price of $22.25 per share for net proceeds of $1.4 billion, which was partially offset by a net repayment of
short-term borrowings.
Our long-term debt at June 30, 2016 was $6,132 million (December 31, 2015 – $6,525 million) with no principal payments due
until  October  2019  (US$1.3  billion).  The  principal  amount  of  long-term  debt  outstanding  in  U.S.  dollars  has  remained
unchanged since August 2012. The $393 million decrease in long-term debt is due to strengthening of the Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar.
As at June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our debt agreements.
Available Sources of Liquidity
We expect cash flow from our crude oil, natural gas and refining operations to fund a portion of our cash requirements. Any
potential shortfalls may be required to be funded through prudent use of our balance sheet capacity, management of our asset
portfolio and other corporate and financial opportunities that may be available to us.

facilities.
Under the committed credit facility, Cenovus is required to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 percent; we
are well below this limit.
Base Shelf Prospectus
Cenovus filed a base shelf prospectus in 2016. The base shelf prospectus allows us to offer, from time to time, up to US$5.0
billion,  or  the  equivalent  in  other  currencies,  of  debt  securities,  common  shares,  preferred  shares,  subscription  receipts,
warrants, share purchase contracts and units in Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere where permitted by law. The base shelf
prospectus will expire in March 2018.
As at June 30, 2016, there have been no issuances under the prospectus.

Financial Metrics
Page 37
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
We monitor our capital structure and financing requirements using, among other things, non-GAAP financial metrics consisting
of Debt to Capitalization and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. We define our non-GAAP measure of Debt as short-term borrowings
and the current and long-term portions of long-term debt. We define Capitalization as Debt plus Shareholders’ Equity. We
define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before finance costs, interest income, income tax expense, DD&A, goodwill and asset
impairments, unrealized gains (losses) on risk management, foreign exchange gains (losses), gains (losses) on divestiture of
assets and other income (loss), net, calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis. These metrics are used to steward our overall
debt position and as measures of our overall financial strength.

(1)    Net Debt is defined as Debt net of cash and cash equivalents.
(2)    Net Debt to Capitalization is defined as Net Debt divided by Net Debt plus Shareholders’ Equity.
Over  the  long-term,  we  target  a  Debt  to  Capitalization  ratio  of  between  30  percent  to  40  percent  and  a  Debt  to  Adjusted
EBITDA  of  between  1.0  times  to  2.0  times.  At  different  points  within  the  economic  cycle,  we  expect  these  ratios  may
periodically be outside of the target range.
Debt to Capitalization remained consistent as the lower long-term debt balance, from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar, was offset by the decrease in Shareholders’ Equity. Debt to Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result
of lower Adjusted EBITDA, primarily due to a decline in Cash Flow from lower commodity prices, partially offset by the lower
long-term debt balance.
Additional  information  regarding  our  financial  metrics  and  capital  structure  can  be  found  in  the  notes  to  the  Consolidated

We have entered into various commitments in the normal course of operations primarily related to demand charges on firm
transportation  agreements  and  operating  leases  on  buildings.  In  addition,  we  have  commitments  related  to  our  risk
management program and an obligation to fund our defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans. For
further information, see the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
During  the  first  half  of  2016,  net  transportation  commitments  decreased  by  approximately  $1  billion  primarily  due  to  a  net
decrease in toll estimates. These agreements, some of which are subject to regulatory approval, are for terms up to 20 years
subsequent to the date of commencement, and should help align our future transportation requirements with our anticipated
production growth. As at June 30, 2016, total transportation commitments were $26 billion.
As  at  June  30,  2016,  there  were  outstanding  letters  of  credit  aggregating  $246  million  issued  as  security  for  performance
under certain contracts (December 31, 2015 – $64 million).
Legal Proceedings
We are involved in a limited number of legal claims associated with the normal course of operations and we believe we have
made adequate provisions for such claims. There are no individually or collectively significant claims.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Page 38
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
For a full understanding of the risks that impact Cenovus, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Risk
Management section of each of our 2015 annual MD&A and first quarter 2016 MD&A. A description of the risk factors and
uncertainties  affecting  Cenovus  can  be  found  in  the  Advisory  and  a  full  discussion  of  the  material  risk  factors  affecting
Cenovus can be found in our AIF for the year ended December 31, 2015, together with updates in our first quarter 2016 MD&A
and the updates provided below in this MD&A.
Cenovus is exposed to a number of risks through the pursuit of our strategic objectives. Some of these risks impact the oil and
gas  industry  as  a  whole  and  others  are  unique  to  our  operations.  Actively  managing  these  risks  improves  our  ability  to
effectively execute our business strategy. We continue to be exposed to the risks identified in our 2015 annual MD&A and AIF.
The following provides an update on our risks related to commodity prices, derivative financial instruments and abandonment
and reclamation costs.
Commodity Price Risk
Fluctuations in commodity prices and refined product prices impacts our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,
growth, access to capital and cost of borrowing.
We  partially  mitigate  our  exposure  to  commodity  price  risk  through  the  integration  of  our  business,  financial  instruments,
physical  contracts  and  market  access  commitments.  Financial  instruments  undertaken  within  our  refining  business  by  the
operator,  Phillips  66,  are  primarily  for  purchased  product.  For  details  of  our  financial  instruments,  including  classification,
assumptions made in the calculation of fair value and additional discussion on exposure of risks and the management of
those risks, see Notes 17 and 18 to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) The power contracts were effectively terminated on March 7, 2016. Recent litigation between third parties has caused
some uncertainty regarding termination of the contracts. Any related liability or asset to Cenovus is not determinable at this
time.
In the second quarter of 2016, we incurred realized losses on crude oil risk management activities, consistent with the average
benchmark  price  exceeding  our  contract  prices.  In  the  first  half  of  2016,  we  recorded  realized  gains  on  crude  oil  risk
management activities as our contract prices exceeded average benchmark prices. Unrealized losses were recorded on our
crude oil financial instruments in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to the realization of settled
positions and changes in market prices.
Unrealized losses were recorded on our interest rate hedge positions due to decreases in benchmark interest rates.
Risks Associated With Derivative Financial Instruments
Financial instruments expose Cenovus to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations. This risk is
partially mitigated through credit exposure limits, frequent assessment of counterparty credit ratings and netting arrangements,
as outlined in our Credit Policy.
Cenovus Energy Inc.
Second Quarter 2016 Report
Page 39
 
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Financial  instruments  also  expose  Cenovus  to  the  risk  of  a  loss  from  adverse  changes  in  the  market  value  of  financial
instruments  or  if  we  are  unable  to  fulfill  our  delivery  obligations  related  to  the  underlying  physical  transaction.  Financial
instruments may limit the benefit to Cenovus of commodity price increases. These risks are minimized through hedging limits
that are reviewed annually by the Board, as required by our Market Risk Mitigation Policy.
Abandonment and Reclamation Cost Risk
The current oil and gas asset abandonment, reclamation and remediation (“A&R”) liability regime in Alberta limits each party’s
liability to its proportionate ownership of an asset. In the case where one party becomes insolvent and is unable to fund the
A&R activities, the solvent parties can claim the insolvent party’s share of the costs (orphaned asset) against the Orphan Well
Association (the “OWA”). The OWA administers orphaned assets and is funded through a levy imposed on licensees and
approval holders, including Cenovus, based on each party’s proportionate share of the oil and gas industry’s deemed A&R
liabilities for facilities, wells and unreclaimed sites.
In May, 2016, the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench issued a decision in the case of Redwater Energy Corporation (“Redwater”)
that trustees and receivers of insolvent parties may disclaim to the Alberta Energy Regulator (the “AER”) uneconomic oil and
gas  assets  before  starting  the  sales  process  for  the  insolvent  party’s  assets.  Prior  to  Redwater,  the  sales  process  for  the
insolvent  party’s  assets  would  have  typically  included  both  the  economic  and  uneconomic  assets,  and  only  in  instances
where the sales process failed to sell all of the assets, would the remaining assets be classified as orphaned assets by the
AER and disclaimed to the OWA. The changes brought about by the Redwater decision and subsequent actions by the AER
in  response  to  Redwater  could  expose  licenses  and  approval  holders,  including  Cenovus,  to  increased  OWA  levies  and
impact Cenovus’s ability to transfer licenses and approvals associated with any acquisition or divestiture activities.
Based  on  the  current  economic  environment,  the  number  of  orphaned  wells  in  Alberta  may  increase  significantly  and
accordingly, the aggregate value of the A&R liabilities assumed by the OWA may increase. It is unclear how these liabilities
will be satisfied by the OWA and the manner, if any, through which the OWA or provincial regulators may seek compensation
for such liabilities from industry participants, including Cenovus. While the impact on Cenovus of any legislative, regulatory or
policy decisions as a result of the Redwater decision cannot be reliably or accurately estimated, any cost recovery or other
measures  taken  by  applicable  regulatory  bodies  may  impact  Cenovus  and  materially  and  adversely  affect,  among  other
things, Cenovus’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, the AER released Bulletin
2016-16 on June 20, 2016 in response to the Redwater decision, implementing important changes to the AER’s procedures
relating to liability management ratings, license eligibility and transfers, which may impact Cenovus’s ability to transfer its
licenses, approvals or permits, and which may further result in increased costs, delays and abandonment or restructuring of
projects and transactions.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Management is required to make estimates and assumptions, and use judgment in the application of accounting policies that
could have a significant impact on our financial results. Actual results may differ from estimates and those differences may be
material.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  used  are  subject  to  updates  based  on  experience  and  the  application  of  new
information. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board. Further
details  on  the  basis  of  preparation  and  our  significant  accounting  policies  can  be  found  in  the  notes  to  the  Consolidated
Financial Statements and annual MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Critical Judgments in Applying Accounting Policies
Critical judgments are those judgments made by Management in the process of applying accounting policies that have the
most significant effect on the amounts recorded in our annual and interim Consolidated Financial Statements. There have
been no changes to our critical judgments used in applying accounting policies during the first six months of 2016. Further
information  can  be  found  in  the  notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  annual  MD&A  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2015.
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
Critical  accounting  estimates  are  those  estimates  that  require  Management  to  make  particularly  subjective  or  complex
judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing
basis and any revisions to accounting estimates are recorded in the period in which the estimates are revised.
Changes in Accounting Policies
There were no new or amended accounting standards or interpretations adopted during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Cenovus Energy Inc.
Second Quarter 2016 Report
Future Accounting Pronouncements
Page 40
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
A description of additional accounting standards and interpretations that will be adopted in future periods can be found in the
notes to the annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT
There have been no changes to internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) during the three months ended June 30, 2016
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR.
Internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
OUTLOOK
Although benchmark crude oil prices have strengthened in the second quarter of 2016, heavy oil differentials have remained
relatively flat and our realized prices and netbacks remain below historical levels. Additional confidence in commodity prices,
our ability to sustain cost reductions as well as fiscal and regulatory certainty are required before we will consider further
expansion of existing projects or developing emerging opportunities. We will commit to project reactivation only if we believe it
does not undermine the strength of our balance sheet.
The following outlook commentary is focused on the next 12 months.
Commodity Prices Underlying our Financial Results
Our crude oil pricing outlook is influenced by the following:
response
to
to
the  supply
●  We expect the general outlook for crude oil prices will be tied
primarily 
the  current  price
environment, the impact of supply disruptions and the pace of
growth  in  global  demand  as  influenced  by  macro-economic
events. Overall, we expect crude oil price volatility and a modest
price improvement in the second half of 2016. Anticipated global
supply  declines,  combined  with  annual  increases  in  demand
growth,  should  support  prices  in  the  remainder  of  the  year,
constrained  by  the  need  to  draw  down  surplus  crude  oil
inventories and re-entry of Iranian crude oil supply into markets.
●  We anticipate the Brent-WTI differential to remain narrow now
that the U.S. is exporting crude oil to overseas markets. Overall,
the differential will likely be set by transportation costs; and
●  We expect that the WTI-WCS differential will widen due to declining U.S. light tight oil supply and as a result of additional
Canadian supply as production outages caused by the Alberta forest fires are brought back online.
(1)     Refer to the foreign exchange rate sensitivities found
within our current guidance available at cenovus.com.
U.S. refining crack spreads are expected to weaken in the second half of the year as high global refined product inventories
continue to weigh on product prices while seasonal U.S. demand weakens during fall and winter periods.
Cenovus Energy Inc.
Second Quarter 2016 Report
Page 41
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Further  weakening  of  natural  gas  prices  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  reflects  lower  seasonal  demand  and  record-high
storage levels. Pricing is anticipated to improve throughout the second half of 2016 due to lower supply growth and stronger
demand growth, although price escalation should be limited by the continued need for coal-to-gas substitution in the power
sector.
We expect the Canadian dollar to continue to be tied with strengthening of crude oil prices, tempered by differing interest rate
expectations between Canada and the U.S. Overall, ignoring the decline in oil price, a weaker Canadian dollar will have a
positive impact on our revenues and Operating Cash Flow.
Our  exposure  to  the  light/heavy  price  differentials  is  composed  of  both  a  global  light/heavy  component  as  well  as  a
transportation cost component. While we expect to see volatility in crude oil prices, we mitigate our exposure to light/heavy
price differentials through the following:
Protection Against Canadian Congestion
(1)    Excludes additional 18,000 bbls/d heavy oil capacity
expected  as  a  result  of  the  Wood  River  debottlenecking
project (expected in the second half of 2016).
(2)    Expected gross production capacity.
●    Integration  –  having  heavy  oil  refining  capacity  capable  of
processing Canadian heavy oil. From a value perspective, our
refining  business  positions  us  to  capture  value  from  both  the
WTI-WCS differential for Canadian crude oil and the Brent-WTI
differential from the sale of refined products;
●    Financial  hedge  transactions  –  limiting  the  impact  of
fluctuations  in  upstream  crude  oil  prices  by  entering  into
financial transactions that fix the WTI-WCS differential;
●  Marketing arrangements – limiting the impact of fluctuations
in  upstream  crude  oil  prices  by  entering  into  physical  supply
transactions  with  fixed  price  components  directly  with  refiners;
and
●  Transportation commitments and arrangements – supporting
transportation projects that move crude oil from our production
areas to consuming markets and also to tidewater markets.
Key Priorities for 2016
Maintain Financial Resilience
Maintaining our financial resilience, while maintaining safe operations, continues to be our top priority. At June 30, 2016, we
had $3.8 billion of cash on hand and $4.0 billion of undrawn capacity under our committed credit facility. Our debt has a
weighted average maturity of approximately 15 years, with no debt maturing until the fourth quarter of 2019. Although we have
a strong balance sheet, we have undertaken additional measures in 2016 to remain financially resilient, including reductions
in capital, operating and general and administrative costs.
Attack Cost Structures
We  will  continue  to  focus  on  reducing  our  cost  structure.  We  are  on  track  to  reduce  our  planned  2016  capital,  operating,
general  and  administrative  spending  by  approximately  $500  million,  relative  to  our  original  budget  released  in  December
2015. We must ensure that, over the long term, we maintain an efficient and sustainable cost structure, and maximize the
strengths of our functional business model.
Operational Excellence
We  are  focused  on  executing  our  work  programs  safely,  responsibly  and  efficiently  through  standardized  processes,
procedures and controls. We use a manufacturing approach to optimize value, manage risk and improve performance. We are
focused on reducing the environmental impact of our operations and engaging with people and communities who may be
affected by our operations in a transparent, timely and respectful way.

For the period ended June 30, 2016
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SEGMENTED DISCLOSURES
Page 46
Consolidated Financial Statements
Cenovus Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, (together “Cenovus” or the “Company”) are in the business of developing, producing
and  marketing  crude  oil,  natural  gas  liquids  (“NGLs”)  and  natural  gas  in  Canada  with  marketing  activities  and  refining
operations in the United States (“U.S.”).
Cenovus is incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act and its shares are listed on the Toronto (“TSX”) and
New York (“NYSE”) stock exchanges. The executive and registered office is located at 2600, 500 Centre Street S.E., Calgary,
Alberta,  Canada,  T2G  1A6.  Information  on  the  Company’s  basis  of  preparation  for  these  interim  Consolidated  Financial
Statements is found in Note 2.
Management has determined the operating segments based on information regularly reviewed for the purposes of decision
making,  allocating  resources  and  assessing  operational  performance  by  Cenovus’s  chief  operating  decision  makers.  The
Company  evaluates  the  financial  performance  of  its  operating  segments  primarily  based  on  operating  cash  flow.  The
Company’s reportable segments are:
●   Oil  Sands, which  includes  the  development  and  production  of  bitumen  and  natural  gas  in  northeast  Alberta.
Cenovus’s bitumen assets include Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake as well as projects in the early
stages of development, such as Grand Rapids and Telephone Lake. Certain of the Company’s operated oil sands
properties,  notably  Foster  Creek,  Christina  Lake  and  Narrows  Lake,  are  jointly  owned  with  ConocoPhillips,  an
unrelated U.S. public company.
●   Conventional, which includes the development and production of conventional crude oil, NGLs and natural gas in
Alberta and Saskatchewan, including the heavy oil assets at Pelican Lake, the carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery
project at Weyburn and emerging tight oil opportunities.
●
Refining  and  Marketing,  which  is  responsible  for  transporting,  selling  and  refining  crude  oil  into  petroleum  and
Refining  and  Marketing,  which  is  responsible  for  transporting,  selling  and  refining  crude  oil  into  petroleum  and
chemical products. Cenovus jointly owns two refineries in the U.S. with the operator Phillips 66, an unrelated U.S.
public  company.  In  addition,  Cenovus  owns  and  operates  a  crude-by-rail  terminal  in  Alberta.  This  segment
coordinates Cenovus’s marketing and transportation initiatives to optimize product mix, delivery points, transportation
commitments  and  customer  diversification.  The  marketing  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  sourced  from  Canada,
including physical product sales that settle in the U.S., is considered to be undertaken by a Canadian business. U.S.
sourced crude oil and natural gas purchases and sales are attributed to the U.S.
●   Corporate and Eliminations, which primarily includes unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivative financial
instruments,  gains  and  losses  on  divestiture  of  assets,  as  well  as  other  Cenovus-wide  costs  for  general  and
administrative, financing activities and research costs. As financial instruments are settled, the realized gains and
losses are recorded in the operating segment to which the derivative instrument relates. Eliminations relate to sales
and  operating  revenues,  and  purchased  product  between  segments,  recorded  at  transfer  prices  based  on  current
market  prices,  and  to  unrealized  intersegment  profits  in  inventory.  The  Corporate  and  Eliminations  segment  is
attributed to Canada, with the exception of unrealized risk management gains and losses, which have been attributed
to the country in which the transacting entity resides.
Employee stock-based compensation costs previously included in operating expense have been reclassified to general and
administrative expense to conform to the presentation adopted for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, an expense of $4 million and $3 million, respectively, were reclassified.
The  following  tabular  financial  information  presents  the  segmented  information  first  by  segment,  then  by  product  and
geographic location.

5. DIVESTITURES
In the first quarter of 2015, the Company divested an office building, recording a gain of $16 million.
6. IMPAIRMENTS
A) Cash-Generating Unit (“CGU”) Impairments
As at June 30, 2016, there were no indicators of impairment.
2016 Impairments
As  at  March  31,  2016,  the  Company  determined  that  the  carrying  amount  of  the  Northern  Alberta  CGU  exceeded  its
recoverable amount, resulting in an impairment loss of $170 million. The impairment was recorded as additional depreciation,
depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) in the Conventional segment. The Northern Alberta CGU includes the Pelican Lake and
Elk  Point  producing  assets  and  other  emerging  assets  in  the  exploration  and  evaluation  stage.  Future  cash  flows  for  the
Northern Alberta CGU declined due to lower forward crude oil prices.
The recoverable amount was determined using fair value less costs of disposal. The fair value for producing properties was
calculated based on discounted after-tax cash flows of proved and probable reserves using forward prices and cost estimates,
consistent with Cenovus’s independent qualified reserves evaluators (Level 3). Future cash flows were estimated using a two
percent inflation rate and discounted using a rate of 10 percent. As at March 31, 2016, the recoverable amount of the Northern
Alberta CGU was estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates. There were no impairments of
goodwill for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Key Assumptions
As at March 31, 2016, the recoverable amounts of Cenovus’s upstream CGUs were determined based on fair value less costs
of disposal or an evaluation of comparable asset transactions. Key assumptions in the determination of future cash flows from
reserves include crude oil and natural gas prices, costs to develop and the discount rate. All reserves have been evaluated as
at December 31, 2015 by independent qualified reserves evaluators.
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices
The forward prices as at March 31, 2016, used to determine future cash flows from crude oil and natural gas reserves are:
Remainder
WTI (US$/barrel) (1)
WCS (C$/barrel) (2)
AECO (C$/Mcf) (3) (4)
(1) West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil.
(2) Western Canadian Select (“WCS”) crude oil blend.
(3) Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) natural gas.
(4) Assumes gas heating value of one million British Thermal Units per thousand cubic feet.

Discount and Inflation Rates
Evaluations of discounted future cash flows are initiated using the discount rate of 10 percent and inflation is estimated at two
percent, which is common industry practice and used by Cenovus’s independent qualified reserves evaluators in preparing
their  reserves  reports.  Based  on  the  individual  characteristics  of  the  asset,  other  economic  and  operating  factors  are  also
considered, which may increase or decrease the implied discount rate.

Sensitivities
As  at  March  31,  2016,  changes  to  the  assumed  discount  rate  or  forward  price  estimates  over  the  life  of  the  reserves
independently would have the following impact on the 2016 impairment of the Northern Alberta CGU:

B) Asset Impairments
There were no asset impairments for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, $21 million of previously capitalized E&E costs related to exploration assets within
the  Saskatchewan  CGU  were  deemed  not  to  be  technically  feasible  and  commercially  viable,  and  were  recorded  as
exploration expense in the Conventional segment.

subscription receipts, warrants, share purchase contracts and units in Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere where permitted by
law.  The  base  shelf  prospectus  will  expire  in  March  2018  and  replaced  the  Company’s  US$2.0  billion  base  debt  shelf
prospectus. In addition, the Company had a $1.5 billion Canadian base debt shelf prospectus that expired on July 25, 2016.

Cenovus’s  capital  structure  objectives  and  targets  have  remained  unchanged  from  previous  periods.  Cenovus’s  capital
structure consists of Shareholders’ Equity plus Debt. Debt is defined as short-term borrowings, and the current and long-term
portions of long-term debt. Net debt includes the Company’s short-term borrowings, and the current and long-term portions of
long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents. Cenovus’s objectives when managing its capital structure are to maintain
financial flexibility, preserve access to capital markets, ensure its ability to finance internally generated growth and to fund
potential acquisitions while maintaining the ability to meet the Company’s financial obligations as they come due.
Cenovus  monitors  its  capital  structure  and  financing  requirements  using,  among  other  things,  non-GAAP  financial  metrics
consisting of Debt to Capitalization and Debt to Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and DD&A (“Adjusted EBITDA”).
These metrics are used to steward Cenovus’s overall debt position as measures of Cenovus’s overall financial strength.
Over the long term, Cenovus targets a Debt to Capitalization ratio of between 30 and 40 percent and a Debt to Adjusted
EBITDA ratio of between 1.0 and 2.0 times. At different points within the economic cycle, Cenovus expects these ratios may
periodically be outside of the target range.

Cenovus  will  maintain  a  high  level  of  capital  discipline  and  manage  its  capital  structure  to  help  ensure  sufficient  liquidity
through all stages of the economic cycle. To manage its capital structure, Cenovus may, among other actions, adjust capital
and operating spending, adjust dividends paid to shareholders, purchase shares for cancellation pursuant to normal course
issuer bids, issue new shares, issue new debt, draw down on its credit facilities or repay existing debt.
Effective April 22, 2016, the Company extended the maturity date of the $1.0 billion tranche of the committed credit facility from

In addition, Cenovus has in place a US$5.0 billion base shelf prospectus, the availability of which is dependent on market
conditions.
Under the committed credit facility, the Company is required to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 percent.
The Company is well below this limit.
As at June 30, 2016, Cenovus is in compliance with all of the terms of its debt agreements.

17. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cenovus’s consolidated financial assets and financial liabilities consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and accrued revenues, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, risk management assets and liabilities, available for sale
financial  assets,  long-term  receivables,  short-term  borrowings  and  long-term  debt.  Risk  management  assets  and  liabilities
arise from the use of derivative financial instruments.
A) Fair Value of Non-Derivative Financial Instruments
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accrued revenues, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, and short-term borrowings approximate their carrying amount due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair values of long-term receivables approximate their carrying amount due to the specific non-tradeable nature of these
instruments.
Long-term debt is carried at amortized cost. The estimated fair values of long-term borrowings have been determined based
on period-end trading prices of long-term borrowings on the secondary market (Level 2). As at June 30, 2016, the carrying
value of Cenovus’s long-term debt was $6,132 million and the fair value was $6,024 million (December 31, 2015 carrying
value – $6,525 million, fair value – $6,050 million).
Available  for  sale  financial  assets  comprise  private  equity  investments.  These  assets  are  carried  at  fair  value  on  the
Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets. Fair value is determined based on recent private placement transactions (Level
3) when available. The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of available for sale financial
assets:

(1) Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale financial assets are recorded in other comprehensive income.
B) Fair Value of Risk Management Assets and Liabilities
The  Company’s  risk  management  assets  and  liabilities  consist  of  crude  oil,  condensate,  power  purchase  contracts,  and
interest rate swaps. Crude oil, condensate and, if entered, natural gas contracts, are recorded at their estimated fair value
based on the difference between the contracted price and the period-end forward price for the same commodity, using quoted
market prices or the period-end forward price for the same commodity extrapolated to the end of the term of the contract (Level
2). The fair value of power purchase contracts are calculated internally based on observable and unobservable inputs such as
forward  power  prices  in  less  active  markets  (Level  3).  The  unobservable  inputs  are  obtained  from  third  parties  whenever
possible and reviewed by the Company for reasonableness. The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated using external
valuation models which incorporate observable market data, including quoted market prices and interest rate yield curves
(Level 2).

Sensitivities – Risk Management Positions
The  following  table  summarizes  the  sensitivity  of  the  fair  value  of  Cenovus’s  risk  management  positions  to  fluctuations  in
commodity prices or interest rates, with all other variables held constant. Management believes the price and interest rate
fluctuations identified in the table below are a reasonable measure of volatility. The impact of fluctuating commodity prices and
interest rates on the Company’s open risk management positions could have resulted in unrealized gains (losses) impacting
earnings before income tax based on the risk management positions in place as follows:

For the period ended June 30, 2016
19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
A) Commitments
Cenovus has entered into various commitments in the normal course of operations primarily related to demand charges on
firm transportation agreements. In addition, the Company has commitments related to its risk management program and an
obligation to fund its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans. Additional information related to the
Company’s  commitments  can  be  found  in  the  notes  to  the  annual  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company’s transportation commitments decreased approximately $1 billion
primarily due to a net decrease in toll estimates. These agreements, some of which are subject to regulatory approval, are for
terms up to 20 years subsequent to the date of commencement. As at June 30, 2016, total transportation commitments were
$26 billion.
As  at  June  30,  2016,  there  were  outstanding  letters  of  credit  aggregating  $246  million  issued  as  security  for  performance
under certain contracts (December 31, 2015 – $64 million).
B) Legal Proceedings
Cenovus is involved in a limited number of legal claims associated with the normal course of operations. Cenovus believes it
has made adequate provisions for such legal claims. There are no individually or collectively significant claims.

(1)  Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as revenues less purchased product, transportation and blending,
operating expenses and production and mineral taxes plus realized gains less  realized losses on risk management activities.
Items within the Corporate and Eliminations segment are excluded from the calculation of Operating Cash Flow.
(2)  Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash from operating activities excluding net change in other assets and
liabilities and net change in non-cash working capital, both of which are  defined  on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.
(3)  Operating Earnings (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that is used to provide a consistent measure of the comparability of our
underlying financial performance between periods by removing  non-operating items. Operating Earnings (Loss) is defined as
Earnings  (Loss)  Before  Income  Tax  excluding  gain  (loss)  on  discontinuance,  gain  on  bargain  purchase,  unrealized  risk
management    gains  (losses)  on  derivative  instruments,  unrealized  foreign  exchange  gains  (losses)  on  translation  of  U.S.
dollar denominated notes issued from Canada, foreign exchange gains (losses) on  settlement of intercompany transactions,
gains (losses) on divestiture of assets, less income taxes on Operating Earnings (Loss) before tax, excluding the effect of
changes in statutory income tax  rates and the recognition of an increase in U.S. tax basis.
(4)  The 2015 effective tax rate reflects an increase to the tax basis of Cenovus’s U.S. assets, the two percent increase in the
Alberta corporate income tax rate and the benefit from recognition of  previously unrecognized capital losses.
(5)  On June 29, 2015, the Alberta government enacted a two percent increase in the corporate income tax rate. The rate
increase was effective July 1, 2015.

one barrel (bbl). BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of one bbl to six Mcf is based
on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent value
equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil compared to natural gas is
significantly different from the energy equivalency conversion ratio of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis is not an
accurate reflection of value.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Page 69
Supplemental Information
Basis of Presentation Cenovus reports financial results in Canadian dollars and presents production volumes on a
net  to  Cenovus  before  royalties  basis,  unless  otherwise  stated.  Cenovus  prepares  its  financial  statements  in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Non-GAAP Measures
This quarterly report contains references to non-GAAP measures as follows:
●   Operating cash flow is defined as revenues, less purchased product, transportation and blending, operating expenses,
production and mineral taxes plus realized gains, less realized losses on risk management activities and is used to
provide  a  consistent  measure  of  the  cash  generating  performance  of  the  company’s  assets  for  comparability  of
Cenovus’s underlying financial performance between periods. Items within the Corporate and Eliminations segment
are excluded from the calculation of operating cash flow.
●   Cash  flow  is  defined  as  cash  from  operating  activities  excluding  net  change  in  other  assets  and  liabilities  and  net
change  in  non-cash  working  capital,  both  of  which  are  defined  on  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Cash  Flows  in
Cenovus’s interim and annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flow is a measure commonly used in the oil
and  gas  industry  to  assist  in  measuring  a  company’s  ability  to  finance  its  capital  programs  and  meet  its  financial
obligations.
●   Free cash flow is defined as cash flow less capital investment.
●   Operating earnings is used to provide a consistent measure of the comparability of the company’s underlying financial
performance  between  periods  by  removing  non-operating  items.  Operating  earnings  is  defined  as  earnings  before
income  tax  excluding  gain  (loss)  on  discontinuance,  gain  on  bargain  purchase,  unrealized  risk  management  gains
(losses)  on  derivative  instruments,  unrealized  foreign  exchange  gains  (losses)  on  translation  of  U.S.  dollar
denominated notes issued from Canada, foreign exchange gains (losses) on settlement of intercompany transactions,
gains (losses) on divestiture of assets, less income taxes on operating earnings (loss) before tax, excluding the effect
of changes in statutory income tax rates and the recognition of an increase in U.S. tax basis.
●   Debt to capitalization, net debt to capitalization, debt to adjusted EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBITDA are ratios
that management uses to steward the company’s overall debt position as measures of the company’s overall financial
strength. Debt is defined as short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the current portion. Net debt is defined
as  debt  net  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  Capitalization  is  defined  as  debt  plus  shareholders’  equity.  Net  debt  to
capitalization is defined as net debt divided by net debt plus shareholders’ equity. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as
earnings before finance costs, interest income, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, goodwill
and asset impairments, unrealized gains or losses on risk management, foreign exchange gains or losses, gains or
losses on divestiture of assets and other income and loss, calculated on a trailing 12-month basis.
These measures do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and therefore are considered non-GAAP
measures. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures
have been described and presented in this quarterly report in order to provide shareholders and potential investors
with additional information regarding Cenovus’s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.
This information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with
IFRS.  For  further  information,  refer  to  Cenovus’s  most  recent  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (MD&A)
available at cenovus.com.
Netbacks reported in this quarterly report are calculated as set out in the Annual Information Form (AIF). Heavy oil
prices  and  transportation  and  blending  costs  exclude  the  costs  of  purchased  condensate,  which  is  blended  with
heavy oil. For the second quarter of 2016, the cost of condensate on a per-barrel of unblended crude oil basis was as
follows: Christina Lake – $26.24 and Foster Creek – $24.76.
