CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements”, as defined in
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"), of expected future developments
that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they
contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,”
“plans,” “estimates,” or “anticipates” or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans or
intentions. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, margins,
costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to our strategies, objectives,
expectations, intentions, resources and expectations regarding future industry trends are forward-
looking statements made under the safe harbor of the PSLRA except to the extent such
statements relate to the operations of a partnership or limited liability company. In addition, we,
through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements
concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time,
and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected. We derive
many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are
based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable,
we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is
impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, which
we refer to as “cautionary statements,” are disclosed under “Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 of PBF Energy Inc.,
which we refer to as our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the SEC.
All forward-looking information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and subsequent written
and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Some of the factors that we
believe could affect our results include:
• supply, demand, prices and other market conditions for our products, including volatility in
commodity prices;
• the effects of competition in our markets;
•changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and capital costs;
• adverse developments in our relationship with both our key employees and unionized
employees;
•our ability to operate our businesses efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs
(including general and administrative expenses) and generate earnings and cash flow;
•our substantial indebtedness;
•our supply and inventory intermediation arrangements expose us to counterparty credit and
performance risk;
•termination of our A&R Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity, as we would be required to finance our intermediate and refined products
inventory covered by the agreements. Additionally, we are obligated to repurchase from J. Aron
certain intermediates and finished products located at the Paulsboro and Delaware City
refineries’ storage tanks upon termination of these agreements;
•restrictive covenants in our indebtedness that may adversely affect our operational flexibility;
•payments to the current and former holders of PBF LLC Series A Units and PBF LLC Series B
Units under our tax receivable agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim;
•our assumptions regarding payments arising under PBF Energy's tax receivable agreement and
other arrangements relating to our organizational structure are subject to change due to various
factors, including, among other factors, the timing of exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for
shares of our Class A common
3
stock as contemplated by the tax receivable agreement, the price of our Class A common stock at
the time of such exchanges, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, and the amount
and timing of our income;
•our expectations and timing with respect to our acquisition activity and whether such
acquisitions are accretive or dilutive to shareholders;
•our expectations with respect to our capital improvement and turnaround projects;
•the status of an air permit to transfer crude through the Delaware City refinery's dock;
•the impact of disruptions to crude or feedstock supply to any of our refineries, including
disruptions due to
problems at PBFX or with third party logistics infrastructure or operations, including pipeline,
marine and rail transportation;
•the possibility that we might reduce or not make further dividend payments;
•the inability of our subsidiaries to freely pay dividends or make distributions to us;
•the impact of current and future laws, rulings and governmental regulations, including the
implementation of rules and regulations regarding transportation of crude oil by rail;
•the effectiveness of our crude oil sourcing strategies, including our crude by rail strategy and
related commitments;
•adverse impacts related to recent legislation by the federal government lifting the restrictions on
exporting U.S. crude oil;
•adverse impacts from changes in our regulatory environment, such as the effects of compliance
with the California Global Warming Solutions Act (also referred to as "AB32"), or actions taken by
environmental interest groups;
•market risks related to the volatility in the price of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”)
required to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standards and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emission
credits required to comply with various GHG emission programs, such as AB32;
•our ability to complete the successful integration of the completed acquisitions of Chalmette
Refining, L.L.C and related logistic assets (collectively, the “Chalmette Acquisition”) and the
Torrance refinery and related logistics assets (collectively, the “Torrance Acquisition”) into our
business and to realize the benefits from such acquisitions;
•liabilities arising from the Chalmette Acquisition and/or Torrance Acquisition that are unforeseen
or exceed our expectations;
•risk associated with the operation of PBFX as a separate, publicly-traded entity;
•potential tax consequences related to our investment in PBFX; and
•any decisions we make with respect to our energy-related logistical assets that may be
transferred to PBFX.
We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material
factors that are important to you. In addition, in light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters
referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
may not in fact occur. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on those
statements.
Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do
not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral
forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the foregoing.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE, UNIT, PER SHARE, PER UNIT AND BARREL DATA)
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Description of the Business
PBF Energy Inc. (“PBF Energy”) was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2011 and completed
an initial public offering in December 2012. PBF Energy is the sole managing member of PBF
Energy Company LLC (“PBF LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company, with a controlling
interest in PBF LLC and its subsidiaries. PBF Energy consolidates the financial results of PBF
LLC and its subsidiaries and records a noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial
statements representing the economic interests of PBF LLC's members other than PBF Energy.
PBF LLC, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, owns and operates oil refineries and
related facilities in North America. PBF Holding Company LLC (“PBF Holding”) is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of PBF LLC. PBF Finance Corporation (“PBF Finance”) is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of PBF Holding. Delaware City Refining Company LLC (“Delaware City Refining” or
“DCR”), PBF Power Marketing LLC, PBF Energy Limited, Paulsboro Refining Company LLC,
Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Company LLC, Toledo Refining Company LLC, Chalmette
Refining, L.L.C. (“Chalmette Refining”) and MOEM Pipeline LLC are PBF LLC’s principal
operating subsidiaries and are all wholly-owned subsidiaries of PBF Holding. In addition, PBF
LLC, through Chalmette Refining, holds an 80% interest in and consolidates Collins Pipeline
Company and T&M Terminal Company.
As of June 30, 2016, PBF LLC also holds a 49.4% limited partner interest and all of the incentive
distribution rights in PBF Logistics LP (“PBFX”), a publicly traded master limited partnership
(refer to Note 2 “PBF Logistics LP” of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements). PBF Logistics GP LLC (“PBF GP”) owns the noneconomic general partner interest
and serves as the general partner of PBFX and is wholly-owned by PBF LLC. PBF Energy,
through its ownership of PBF LLC, consolidates the financial results of PBFX and its subsidiaries
and records a noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial statements representing the
economic interests of PBFX's unit holders other than PBF LLC. Collectively, PBF Energy and its
consolidated subsidiaries, including PBF LLC, PBF Holding, and PBFX are referred to
hereinafter as the “Company” unless the context otherwise requires.
On February 6, 2015, the Company completed a public offering of 3,804,653 shares of Class A
common stock in a secondary offering (the “February 2015 secondary offering”). All of the shares
in the February 2015 secondary offering were sold by funds affiliated with Blackstone Group L.P.,
or Blackstone, and First Reserve Management, L.P., or First Reserve. In connection with the
February 2015 secondary offering, Blackstone and First Reserve exchanged all of their
remaining PBF LLC Series A Units for an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock
of PBF Energy, and as a result, Blackstone and First Reserve no longer hold any PBF LLC
Series A Units or shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock. PBF Energy did not receive any
proceeds from the February 2015 secondary offering.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company owns 97,825,983 PBF LLC Series C Units and the
Company's current and former executive officers and directors and certain employees and others
beneficially own 4,964,901 PBF LLC Series A Units. As of June 30, 2016, the holders of the
Company's issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock have 95.2% of the voting
power in the Company and the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy through their
holdings of Class B common stock have the remaining 4.8% of the voting power in the Company.
Substantially all of the Company’s operations are in the United States. The Company operates in
two reportable business segments: Refining and Logistics. The Company’s oil refineries are all
engaged in the refining of crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, and are
aggregated into the Refining segment. PBFX is a publicly traded master limited partnership that
was formed to operate logistical assets such as crude oil and refined petroleum products
terminals, pipelines, and storage facilities. PBFX's operations are aggregated into the Logistics
segment. Prior to the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase on April 29, 2016 (refer to "Note 3
Acquisitions"), PBFX did not generate third party revenue and intersegment revenues from
affiliates are eliminated in consolidation. Prior to the PBFX initial public offering in May 2014,
PBFX's assets, other than those acquired in connection with the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase,
were operated within the refining operations of the Company's Delaware City and Toledo
refineries. The assets, did not generate third party revenue nor, apart from Delaware Pipeline
Company LLC, any intra-entity

revenue and were not considered to be a separate reportable segment. To generate earnings
and cash flows from operations, the Company is primarily dependent upon processing crude oil
and selling refined petroleum products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable costs and
other expenses. Crude oil and refined petroleum products are commodities; and factors largely
out of the Company’s control can cause prices to vary over time. The potential margin volatility
can have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, earnings and cash flow.
Basis of Presentation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management,
considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations
and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 of PBF Energy. The results of operations for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No.
2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" ("ASU 2015-
02"), which changed existing consolidation requirements associated with the analysis a reporting
entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities,
including limited partnerships and variable interest entities. The Company’s adoption of this
guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16, "Business Combinations
(Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments" ("ASU 2015-16"),
which requires (i) that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are
identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment
amounts are determined, (ii) that the acquirer record, in the same period’s financial statements,
the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as
a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been
completed at the acquisition date, (iii) that an entity present separately on the face of the income
statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings
by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the
provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The adoption of this
guidance did not materially affect any of the Company's financial statements or related
disclosures.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2015-14,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date” (“ASU
2015-14”), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with
Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”) for all entities by one year. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 will
replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. Under
ASU 2015-14, this guidance becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition
method. Under ASU 2015-14, early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance
Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes" ("ASU 2015-17"), which requires deferred tax liabilities
and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. Under ASU
2015-17, this guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016
and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE, UNIT, PER SHARE, PER UNIT AND BARREL DATA)
15, 2016 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted as of the beginning
of an annual or interim period after the issuance of the ASU. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic
825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU
2016-01”), which amends how entities measure equity investments that do not result in
consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method and how they present changes
in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to
their own credit. ASU 2016-01 also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects
of current GAAP but does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in
debt securities and loans. Under ASU 2016-01, this guidance becomes effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted in certain circumstances. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new
standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”), to
increase the transparency and comparability about leases among entities. The new guidance
requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all
lease contracts. It also requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-
02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and requires a
modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):
Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments No. 2016-06 March 2016 a consensus of
the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” (“ASU 2016-06”), to increase consistency in practice in
applying guidance on determining if an embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the
economic characteristics of the host contract, specifically for assessing whether call (put) options
that can accelerate the repayment of principal on a debt instrument meet the clearly and closely
related criterion. The guidance in ASU 2016-06 applies to all entities that are issuers of or
investors in debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt
host) with embedded call (put) options. ASU 2016-06 is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard
on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”)
which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payments to
employees. The guidance in ASU 2016-09 requires all income tax effects of awards to be
recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled rather than recording
excess tax benefits or deficiencies in additional paid-in capital. The guidance in ASU 2016-09
also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee’s shares than it can today for tax
withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to
account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 also contains additional guidance for
nonpublic entities that do not apply to the Company. ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and requires a modified retrospective
approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”) which requires
credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be presented as an allowance rather than as
a write-down. This approach is an improvement to current GAAP because an entity will be able
to record reversals of credit losses (in situations in which the estimate of credit losses declines) in
current period net income, which in turn should align the income statement recognition of credit
losses with the reporting period in which changes occur. Current GAAP prohibits reflecting those
improvements in current period earnings. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2019, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption.
Early adoption is permitted for

disclosures.
2. PBF LOGISTICS LP
On May 14, 2014, PBFX completed its initial public offering (the “PBFX Offering”) of 15,812,500
common units. In addition, on April 5, 2016, PBFX completed a public offering of an aggregate of
2,875,000 common units, including 375,000 common units that were sold pursuant to the
exercise of an over-allotment option, for net proceeds of $51,575, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and other offering expenses (the “April 2016 PBFX Equity Offering”).
On April 29, 2016, PBFX purchased 4 refined product terminals located in the greater
Philadelphia region (the “East Coast Terminals”) from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline,
L.P. for total cash consideration of $100,000 (the “PBFX Plains Asset Purchase”), less a
preliminary estimate for working capital, which is subject to final purchase price valuation and
working capital adjustment. This acquisition expands PBFX's storage and terminaling footprint
and introduces third-party customers to its revenue base. The acquisition was financed through a
combination of cash on hand and borrowings from the PBFX senior secured revolving credit
facility (the “PBFX Revolving Credit Facility”).
As of June 30, 2016, PBF LLC holds a 49.4% limited partner interest in PBFX (consisting of
2,572,944 common units and 15,886,553 subordinated units) and all of PBFX's incentive
distribution rights, with the remaining 50.6% limited partner interest held by public common unit
holders. PBF LLC also owns indirectly a non-economic general partner interest in PBFX through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, PBF GP, the general partner of PBFX. During the subordination
period (as set forth in the partnership agreement of PBFX) holders of the subordinated units are
not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the
minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly
distribution from prior quarters. If PBFX does not pay distributions on the subordinated units, the
subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. Each subordinated
unit will convert into one common unit at the end of the subordination period.
PBFX engages in the receiving, handling, storage and transferring of crude oil, refined products
and intermediates from sources located throughout the United States and Canada for PBF
Energy in support of certain of its refineries, as well as for third party customers. As of June 30,
2016, all of PBFX’s revenue is derived from either third-party or affiliate revenue at its East Coast
Terminals or long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with PBF Holding, which include
minimum volume commitments, for receiving, handling, storing and transferring crude oil and
refined products. PBF Energy also has agreements with PBFX that establish fees for certain
general and administrative services and operational and maintenance services provided by PBF
Holding to PBFX. These transactions, other than those with third parties, are eliminated by PBF
Energy in consolidation.
PBFX’s initial assets consisted of a light crude oil rail unloading terminal at the Delaware City
refinery that also services the Paulsboro refinery (which is referred to as the “Delaware City Rail
Terminal”), and a crude oil truck unloading terminal at the Toledo refinery (which is referred to as
the “Toledo Truck Terminal”) that are integral components of the crude oil delivery operations at
three of PBF Energy’s refineries. In a series of drop-down transactions subsequent to the PBFX
Offering, PBF Holding distributed certain additional assets to PBF LLC which, in turn, contributed
such assets to PBFX consisting of the Delaware City heavy crude unloading rack, which is also
capable of unloading light crude oil (the "DCR West Rack"), a tank farm and related facilities
located at PBF Energy's Toledo refinery, including a propane storage and loading facility (the
"Toledo Storage Facility"), and a products pipeline, truck rack and related facilities located at our
Delaware City refinery (collectively the "Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack").
Additionally, on April 29, 2016, PBFX made its initial third-party asset purchase acquiring the
East Coast Terminals.
PBFX, a variable interest entity, is consolidated by PBF Energy through its ownership of PBF
LLC. PBF LLC through its ownership of PBF GP, has the sole ability to direct the activities of
PBFX that most significantly impact its economic performance. PBF LLC is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of PBFX for accounting purposes.

3. ACQUISITIONS
Chalmette Acquisition
On November 1, 2015, the Company acquired from ExxonMobil, Mobil Pipe Line Company and
PDV Chalmette, L.L.C., 100% of the ownership interests of Chalmette Refining, which owns the
Chalmette refinery and related logistics assets (collectively, the "Chalmette Acquisition"). The
Chalmette refinery, located outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, is a dual-train coking refinery and
is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil. Subsequent to the closing of the
Chalmette Acquisition, Chalmette Refining is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF Holding.
Chalmette Refining is strategically positioned on the Gulf Coast with logistics connectivity that
offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities, including the potential
to export products and provides geographic diversification into PADD 3.
Chalmette Refining owns 100% of the MOEM Pipeline, providing access to the Empire Terminal,
as well as the CAM Connection Pipeline, providing access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port
facility through a third party pipeline. Chalmette Refining also owns 80% of each of the Collins
Pipeline Company and T&M Terminal Company, both located in Collins, Mississippi, which
provide a clean products outlet for the refinery to the Plantation and Colonial Pipelines. Also
included in the acquisition are a marine terminal capable of importing waterborne feedstocks and
loading or unloading finished products; a clean products truck rack which provides access to
local markets; and a crude and product storage facility.
The aggregate purchase price for the Chalmette Acquisition was $322,000 in cash, plus
inventory and final working capital of $245,963. As described below, the valuation of the working
capital was finalized in the first quarter of 2016. The transaction was financed through a
combination of cash on hand and borrowings under PBF Holding's asset based revolving credit
agreement (the “Revolving Loan”).
The Company accounted for the Chalmette Acquisition as a business combination under GAAP
whereby we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition at their
estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess consideration transferred over the
estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The final
purchase price and fair value allocation were completed as of March 31, 2016. During the
measurement period, which ended in March 2016, adjustments were made to the Company's
preliminary fair value estimates related primarily to inventories and accounts payable.
The following table summarizes the final amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities
assumed as of the acquisition date. The total purchase consideration and the fair values of the
assets and liabilities at the acquisition date were as follows:

In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Chalmette Refining, the Company acquired
Collins Pipeline Company and T&M Terminal Company, which are both C-corporations for tax
purposes. As a result, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability of $25,721 attributable to
the book and tax basis difference in the C-corporation assets, which had a corresponding impact
on noncontrolling interests of $5,144.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 include the results of operations of the Chalmette refinery whereas the same periods in
2015 do not include the results of operations of the Chalmette refinery. On an unaudited pro
forma basis, the revenues and net income of the Company assuming the acquisition had
occurred on January 1, 2014, are shown below. The unaudited pro forma information does not
purport to present what the Company’s actual results would have been had the acquisition
occurred on January 1, 2014, nor is the financial information indicative of the results of future

PBFX Plains Asset Purchase
On April 29, 2016, PBFX's wholly-owed subsidiary, PBF Logistics Products Terminals LLC,
completed the purchase of the East Coast Terminals, including product storage tanks, pipeline
connections to the Colonial Pipeline Company, Buckeye Partners, Sunoco Logistics Partners
and other proprietary pipeline systems, truck loading lanes and marine facilities capable of
handling barges and ships. This acquisition expands PBFX's storage and terminaling footprint
and introduces third-party customers to its revenue base.
The aggregate purchase price for the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase was $100,000, less a
preliminary estimate for working capital of $1,664, which is subject to final purchase price
valuation and working capital adjustment. The consideration for the transaction was funded by
PBFX with $98,336 in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. PBFX borrowed an
additional $98,500 under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility, which was used to

repay $98,336 of the PBFX Term Loan (as defined below) in order to release $98,336 in
marketable securities that had collateralized the PBFX Term Loan.
PBFX accounted for the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase as a business combination under GAAP
whereby PBFX recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition at their
estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess consideration transferred over the
estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The final
purchase price and its allocation are dependent on final reconciliations of working capital and
other items subject to agreement by both parties.
The total purchase consideration and the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities at the
acquisition date were as follows:

2015 do not include the results of operations of the East Coast Terminals. For the period from its
acquisition on April 29, 2016 to June 30, 2016, the East Coast Terminals contributed revenues of
$3,314 and net income of $1,529. On an unaudited pro forma basis, the revenues and net income
of the Company assuming the PBFX Asset Purchase had occurred on January 1, 2015, are
shown below. The unaudited pro forma information does not purport to present what the
Company’s actual results would have been had the PBFX Asset Purchase occurred on

Inventory under inventory supply and intermediation arrangements included certain crude oil
stored at the Company’s Delaware City refinery's storage facilities that the Company was
obligated to purchase as it was consumed in connection with its Crude Supply Agreement that
expired on December 31, 2015; and light finished products sold to counterparties in connection
with the A&R Intermediation Agreements and stored in the Paulsboro and Delaware City
refineries' storage facilities.
Due to the lower crude oil and refined product pricing environment beginning at the end of 2014
and continuing throughout 2015 and into 2016, the Company recorded adjustments to value its
inventories to the lower of cost or market. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the
Company recorded an adjustment to value its inventories to the lower of cost or market which
increased operating income and net income by $157,780 and $95,264, respectively, reflecting
the net change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $1,058,273 at March 31,
2016 to $900,493 at June 30, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company
recorded an adjustment to value its inventories to the lower of cost or market which increased
operating income and net income by $216,843 and $130,973, respectively, reflecting the net
change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $1,117,336 at December 31, 2015 to
$900,493 at June 30, 2016.
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded an adjustment to value its
inventories to the lower of cost or market which increased operating income and net income by
$105,958 and $63,363, respectively, reflecting the net change in the lower of cost or market
inventory reserve from $668,902 at March 31, 2015 to $562,944 at June 30, 2015. During the six
months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded an adjustment to value its inventories to
the lower of cost or market which increased operating income and net income by $127,166 and
$76,045, respectively, reflecting the net change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve
from $690,110 at December 31, 2014 to $562,944 at June 30, 2015.

The Company has the obligation to repurchase certain intermediates and finished products that
are held in the Company’s refinery storage tanks at the Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries
in accordance with the A&R Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron & Company, a subsidiary of
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“J. Aron”). As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a
liability is recognized for the Inventory supply and intermediation arrangements and is recorded
at market price for the J. Aron owned inventory held in the Company's storage tanks under the
A&R Inventory Intermediation Agreements, with any change in the market price being recorded in
cost of sales.
The Company is subject to obligations to purchase Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”)
required to comply with the Renewable Fuels Standard. The Company's overall RINs obligation
is based on a percentage of domestic shipments of on-road fuels as established by the
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). To the degree the Company is unable to blend the
required amount of biofuels to satisfy its RINs obligation, RINs must be purchased on the open
market to avoid penalties and fines. The Company records its RINs obligation on a net basis in
Accrued expenses when its RINs liability is greater than the amount of RINs earned and
purchased in a given period and in Prepaid expenses and other current assets when the amount
of RINs earned and purchased is greater than the RINs liability.
8. MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The U.S Treasury securities purchased by the Company with the proceeds from the PBFX
Offering are used as collateral to secure a three-year, $300,000 term loan facility entered into by
PBFX (the “PBFX Term Loan”). PBFX anticipates holding the securities for an indefinite amount
of time (the securities will be rolled over as they mature). As necessary and at the discretion of
PBFX, these securities are expected to be liquidated and the proceeds used to fund future capital
expenditures. While PBFX does not routinely sell marketable securities prior to their scheduled
maturity dates, some of PBFX's investments may be held and restricted for the purpose of
funding future capital expenditures and acquisitions, so these investments are classified as
available-for-sale marketable securities as they may occasionally be sold prior to their scheduled
maturity dates due to the unexpected timing of cash needs. The carrying value of these
marketable securities approximates fair value and are measured using Level 1 inputs. The
maturities of the marketable securities range from one to three months and are classified on the
balance sheet in current assets as of June 30, 2016. As described in "Note 3 - Acquisitions",
$98,336 of marketable securities
21
PBF ENERGY INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE, UNIT, PER SHARE, PER UNIT AND BARREL DATA)
were sold by PBFX to fund the consideration for the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase during the
three months ended June 30, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held $136,144 and $234,258,
respectively, in marketable securities. As of June 30, 2016, the marketable securities were
classified as current whereas at December 31, 2015, they were classified as non-current. The
classification of the marketable securities on the balance sheet is consistent with the PBFX Term
Loan they collateralize. The gross unrecognized holding gains and losses as of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 were not material. The net realized gains or losses from the sale of
marketable securities were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015.
9. INCOME TAXES
PBF Energy files federal and applicable state corporate income tax returns and recognizes
income taxes on its pre-tax income, which to date has consisted solely of its share of PBF LLC’s
pre-tax income (approximately 95.1% as of December 31, 2015 and approximately 95.2% as of
June 30, 2016). PBF LLC is organized as a limited liability company and PBFX is a master
limited partnership, both of which are treated as “flow-through” entities for federal income tax
purposes and therefore are not subject to income taxes apart from the income tax attributable to
two subsidiaries of Chalmette Refining that are treated as C-Corporations for income tax
purposes. As a result, PBF Energy's condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect
any benefit or provision for income taxes on the pre-tax income or loss attributable to the
noncontrolling interests in PBF LLC or PBFX apart from the income tax of $366 and $1,165 for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 attributable to those two C-Corporation
subsidiaries of Chalmette Refining.
The income tax provision in the PBF Energy condensed consolidated financial statements of
operations consisted of the following:

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Environmental Matters
The Company’s refineries are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to the discharge of
materials into the environment or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment, waste
management and the characteristics and the compositions of fuels. Compliance with existing and
anticipated laws and regulations can increase the overall cost of operating the refineries,
including remediation, operating costs and capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade
equipment and facilities.
In connection with the Paulsboro refinery acquisition, the Company assumed certain
environmental remediation obligations. The environmental liability of $11,340 recorded as of
June 30, 2016 ($10,367 as of December 31, 2015) represents the present value of expected
future costs discounted at a rate of 8.0%. The current portion of the environmental liability is
recorded in Accrued expenses and the non-current portion is recorded in Other long-term
liabilities. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, this liability is self-guaranteed by the
Company.
In connection with the acquisition of the Delaware City assets, Valero Energy Corporation
(“Valero”) remains responsible for certain pre-acquisition environmental obligations up to
$20,000 and the predecessor to Valero in ownership of the refinery retains other historical
obligations.
In connection with the acquisition of the Delaware City assets and the Paulsboro refinery, the
Company and Valero purchased ten year, $75,000 environmental insurance policies to insure
against unknown environmental liabilities at each site. In connection with the Toledo refinery
acquisition, Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) (“Sunoco”) remains responsible for environmental remediation
for conditions that existed on the closing date for twenty years from March 1, 2011, subject to
certain limitations.
In connection with the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery, the Company obtained $3,936 in
financial assurance (in the form of a surety bond) to cover estimated potential site remediation
costs associated with an agreed to Administrative Order of Consent with the EPA. The estimated
cost assumes remedial activities will continue for a minimum of 30 years. Further, in connection
with the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery, the Company
23
PBF ENERGY INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE, UNIT, PER SHARE, PER UNIT AND BARREL DATA)
purchased a ten year, $100,000 environmental insurance policy to insure against unknown
environmental liabilities at the refinery.
In connection with the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase, PBFX is responsible for the environmental
remediation costs for conditions that existed on the closing date up to a maximum of $250 per
year for 10 years, with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. remaining responsible for any and all
additional costs above such amounts during such period. The environmental liability of $2,273
recorded as of June 30, 2016 represents the present value of expected future costs discounted at
a rate of 1.83%. At June 30, 2016 the undiscounted liability is $2,500 and PBFX expects to make
aggregate payments for this liability of $1,250 over the next five years. The current portion of the
environmental liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the non-
current portion is recorded in other long-term liabilities.
In 2010, New York State adopted a Low-Sulfur Heating Oil mandate that, beginning July 1, 2012,
requires all heating oil sold in New York State to contain no more than 15 parts per million
(“PPM”) sulfur. Since July 1, 2012, other states in the Northeast market began requiring heating
oil sold in their state to contain no more than 15 PPM sulfur. Currently, all of the Northeastern
states and Washington DC have adopted sulfur controls on heating oil. Most of the Northeastern
states will now require heating oil with 15 PPM or less sulfur by July 1, 2018 (except for
Pennsylvania and Maryland - 500 ppm sulfur required). All of the heating oil the Company
currently produces meets these specifications. The mandate and other requirements do not
currently have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.
The EPA issued the final Tier 3 Gasoline standards on March 3, 2014 under the Clean Air Act.
This final rule establishes more stringent vehicle emission standards and further reduces the
sulfur content of gasoline starting in January of 2017.  The new standard is set at 10 PPM sulfur
in gasoline on an annual average basis starting January 1, 2017, with a credit trading program to
provide compliance flexibility. The EPA responded to industry comments on the proposed rule
and maintained the per gallon sulfur cap on gasoline at the existing 80 PPM cap. The standards
set by the new rule are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
The EPA was required to release the final annual standards for the Reformulated Fuels Standard
(“RFS”) for 2014 no later than Nov 29, 2013 and for 2015 no later than Nov 29, 2014. The EPA
did not meet these requirements but did release proposed standards for 2014. The EPA did not
finalize this proposal in 2014. The EPA published the final 2014-2016 Renewable standards late
in 2015. The EPA essentially set the standards for 2014 and 2015 at the estimated actual
renewable fuel used in each year given they were for the most part regulating activities that had
already occurred. In setting the 2016 standards the EPA recognized the E10 blend wall and used
the general waiver authority to set the 2016 renewable fuel requirement lower than the original
requirements stated in the Energy Independence Security Act (“EISA”). These new standards are
being challenged by both renewable fuel producers and obligated parties in legal actions. The
courts are attempting to consolidate some of these challenges. It appears unlikely the courts will
be able resolve these issues before EPA releases the final 2017 standards late in 2016
assuming they stay on schedule. The EPA did propose the 2017 standards in May of 2016 and
raised the requirements above the 2016 standards. Numerous public interest groups have
publicly indicated that they believe that the EPA is relying on perhaps somewhat aggressive
expectations of E15 and E85 marketing in proposing the new standards. The EPA is receiving
comments on the new proposal and is targeting to release the final rule by the end of November
2016 as required. The Company is currently evaluating the final standards and they may have a
material impact on the Company's cost of compliance with RFS 2.
The EPA published a Final Rule to the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) Section 316(b) in August 2014
regarding cooling water intake structures, which includes requirements for petroleum refineries.
The purpose of this rule is to prevent fish from being trapped against cooling water intake
screens (impingement) and to prevent fish from being drawn through cooling water systems
(entrainment). Facilities will be required to implement Best Technology Available (BTA) as soon
as possible, but state agencies have the discretion to establish implementation time lines. The
Company continues to evaluate the impact of this regulation, and at this time does not anticipate
it having a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In addition, on December 1, 2015 the EPA finalized revisions to an existing air regulation
concerning Maximum Achievable Control Technologies (“MACT”) for Petroleum Refineries. The
regulation requires additional continuous monitoring systems for eligible process safety valves
relieving to atmosphere, minimum flare gas heat (Btu) content, and delayed coke drum vent
controls to be installed by January 30, 2019. In addition, a program for ambient fence line
monitoring for benzene will need to be implemented by January 30, 2018. The Company is
currently evaluating the final standards to evaluate the impact of this regulation, and at this time
does not anticipate it will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
In late 2015, the EPA initiated enforcement proceedings against companies it believes produced
invalid RINs. The Company purchased RINs to satisfy a portion of its obligations under the
Renewable Fuels Standard program for calendar year 2012 and had purchased some RINs the
EPA considered invalid. The Company continues to purchase RINs to satisfy its obligations
under the RFS program, and on April 11, 2016, PBF Holding was notified by the EPA that the
EPA’s records indicated that PBF Holding used potentially invalid RINs generated by one of the
companies. The EPA directed PBF Holding to resubmit reports to remove the potentially invalid
RINs and to replace the invalid RINs with valid RINs with the same D Code. The Company has
retired the invalid RINs and on May 6, 2016, the counterparty who sold the RINs to the Company
replaced the RINs. The counterparty has also agreed to indemnify the Company for certain
penalties to the extent imposed by the EPA. On July 28, 2016, the Company and the EPA
entered an Administrative Settlement Agreement to resolve the matter which requires the
payment of a $250 penalty. The Company expects to be reimbursed by the counterparty for this
penalty under the indemnification agreement. In any event, the penalty is not expected to have a
material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
The Company is also currently subject to certain other existing environmental claims and
proceedings. The Company believes that there is only a remote possibility that future costs
related to any of these other known contingent liability exposures would have a material impact
on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
PBF LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement
The holders of limited liability company interests in PBF LLC, including PBF Energy, generally
have to include for purposes of calculating their U.S. federal, state and local income taxes their
share of any taxable income of PBF LLC, regardless of whether such holders receive cash
distributions from PBF LLC. PBF Energy ultimately may not receive cash distributions from PBF
LLC equal to its share of such taxable income or even equal to the actual tax due with respect to
that income. For example, PBF LLC is required to include in taxable income PBF LLC’s
allocable share of PBFX’s taxable income and gains (such share to be determined pursuant to
the partnership agreement of PBFX), regardless of the amount of cash distributions received by
PBF LLC from PBFX, and such taxable income and gains will flow-through to PBF Energy to the
extent of its allocable share of the taxable income of PBF LLC. As a result, at certain times, the
amount of cash otherwise ultimately available to PBF Energy on account of its indirect interest in
PBFX may not be sufficient for PBF Energy to pay the amount of taxes it will owe on account of
its indirect interests in PBFX.
Taxable income of PBF LLC generally is allocated to the holders of PBF LLC units (including
PBF Energy) pro-rata in accordance with their respective share of the net profits and net losses of
PBF LLC. In general, PBF LLC is required to make periodic tax distributions to the members of
PBF LLC, including PBF Energy, pro-rata in accordance with their respective percentage
interests for such period (as determined under the amended and restated limited liability
company agreement of PBF LLC), subject to available cash and applicable law and contractual
restrictions (including pursuant to our debt instruments) and based on certain assumptions.
Generally, these tax distributions are required to be in an amount equal to our estimate of the
taxable income of PBF LLC for the year multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest
effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an
individual or corporate resident in New York, New York (taking into account the nondeductibility
of certain expenses). If, with respect to any given calendar year, the aggregate periodic tax
distributions were less than the actual taxable income of PBF LLC multiplied by the assumed tax
rate, PBF LLC is required to make a “true up” tax distribution, no later than March 15 of the
following year, equal to such difference,
25
PBF ENERGY INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE, UNIT, PER SHARE, PER UNIT AND BARREL DATA)
subject to the available cash and borrowings of PBF LLC. PBF LLC obtains funding to pay its tax
distributions by causing PBF Holding to distribute cash to PBF LLC and from distributions it
receives from PBFX.
Tax Receivable Agreement
PBF Energy entered into a tax receivable agreement with the PBF LLC Series A and PBF LLC
Series B Unit holders (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) that provides for the payment by PBF
Energy to such persons of an amount equal to 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that PBF
Energy is deemed to realize as a result of (i) increases in tax basis, as described below, and (ii)
certain other tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax
benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For purposes of the Tax
Receivable Agreement, the benefits deemed realized by PBF Energy will be computed by
comparing the actual income tax liability of PBF Energy (calculated with certain assumptions) to
the amount of such taxes that PBF Energy would have been required to pay had there been no
increase to the tax basis of the assets of PBF LLC as a result of purchases or exchanges of PBF
LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy's Class A common stock and had PBF Energy not
entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will
continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless: (i) PBF Energy exercises
its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) PBF Energy breaches any of its material
obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or (iii) certain changes of control occur, in
which case all obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally be accelerated
and due as calculated under certain assumptions.
The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are obligations of PBF Energy
and not of PBF LLC, PBF Holding or PBFX. In general, PBF Energy expects to obtain funding for
these annual payments from PBF LLC, primarily through tax distributions, which PBF LLC makes
on a pro-rata basis to its owners. Such owners include PBF Energy, which holds a 95.2% interest
in PBF LLC as of June 30, 2016 (95.1% as of December 31, 2015). PBF LLC obtains funding to
pay its tax distributions by causing PBF Holding to distribute cash to PBF LLC and from
distributions it receives from PBFX.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company has recognized a liability for the tax receivable agreement of
$661,418 ($661,418 as of December 31, 2015) reflecting the estimate of the undiscounted
amounts that the Company expects to pay under the agreement.
11. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
With respect to dividends and distributions paid during the six months ended June 30, 2016, PBF
LLC made aggregate non-tax quarterly distributions of $0.60 per unit to its members, of which
$58,696 was distributed pro-rata to PBF Energy and the balance was distributed to its other
members. PBF Energy used this $58,696 to pay quarterly cash dividends of $0.30 per share of
Class A common stock on March 8, 2016 and May 31, 2016.
With respect to distributions paid during the six months ended June 30, 2016, PBFX paid a
distribution on outstanding common and subordinated units of $0.41 per unit on March 8, 2016
and $0.42 per unit on May 31, 2016, for a total distribution of $31,099, of which $16,496 was
distributed to PBF LLC and the balance was distributed to its public unit holders.
12. TREASURY STOCK
On August 19, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
$200,000 of the Company's Class A common stock (the “Repurchase Program”). On October 29,
2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved an additional $100,000 increase to the
existing Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program expires on September 30, 2016. No
repurchases of the Company's Class A common stock were made during the six months ended
June 30, 2016. From the inception of the Repurchase Program through June 30, 2016, the
Company has purchased approximately 6.05 million shares of the Company's Class A common
stock through open market transactions under the Repurchase Program, for a total of $150,804.
These repurchases may be made from time to time through various methods, including open
market transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated
transactions or otherwise, certain of which may

be effected through Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 plans. The timing and number of shares
repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, capital availability, legal
requirements and economic and market conditions. The Company is not obligated to purchase
any shares under the Repurchase Program, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued
at any time without prior notice.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company has the ability to purchase an additional $149,196 in common
stock under the approved Repurchase Program.

14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The tables below present information about the Company's financial assets and liabilities
measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of
the inputs utilized to determine the fair values as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative contracts
executed with the same counterparty; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are
presented on a gross basis in the tables below. We have posted cash margin with various
counterparties to support hedging and trading activities. The cash margin posted is required by
counterparties as collateral deposits and cannot be offset against the fair value of open contracts
except in the event of default. We have no derivative contracts that are subject to master netting
arrangements that are reflected gross on the balance sheet.

The valuation methods used to measure financial instruments at fair value are as follows:
Money market funds categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value
based on quoted market prices and included within Cash and cash equivalents.
Marketable securities, consisting primarily of US Treasury securities, categorized in Level 1 of
the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices.
The commodity contracts categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair
value based on quoted prices in an active market. The commodity contracts categorized in Level
2 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value using a market approach based upon
future commodity prices for similar instruments quoted in active markets.
The commodity contracts categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy consist of commodity
price swap contracts that relate to forecasted purchases of crude oil for which quoted forward
market prices are not readily available due to market illiquidity. The forward prices used to value
these swaps were derived using broker quotes, prices from other third party sources and other
available market based data.
The derivatives included with inventory supply arrangement obligations, derivatives included
with inventory intermediation agreement obligations and the catalyst lease obligations are
categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are measured at fair value using a market
approach based upon commodity prices for similar instruments quoted in active markets.
•
•
Non-qualified pension plan assets are measured at fair value using a market approach based on
published net asset values of mutual funds as a practical expedient. As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, $9,811 and $9,325, respectively, were included within Deferred charges
and other assets, net for these non-qualified pension plan assets.

(a) The estimated fair value, categorized as a Level 2 measurement, was calculated based on
the present value of future expected payments utilizing implied current market interest rates
based on quoted prices of the Senior Secured Notes and the PBFX Senior Notes.
(b) The estimated fair value approximates carrying value, categorized as a Level 2 measurement,
as these borrowings bear interest based upon short-term floating market interest rates.
(c) Catalyst leases are valued using a market approach based upon commodity prices for similar
instruments quoted in active markets and are categorized as a Level 2 measurement. The
Company has elected the fair value option for accounting for its catalyst lease repurchase
obligations as the Company's liability is directly impacted by the change in fair value of the
underlying catalyst.
15. DERIVATIVES
The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain exposures to commodity price risk.
Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company’s crude supply agreement contained purchase
obligations for certain volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks. In addition, the Company
entered into Inventory Intermediation Agreements commencing in July 2013 that contain
purchase obligations for certain volumes of intermediates and refined products. The purchase
obligations related to crude oil, feedstocks, intermediates and refined products under these
agreements are derivative instruments that have been designated as fair value hedges in order to
hedge the commodity price volatility of certain refinery inventory. The fair value of these purchase
obligation derivatives is based on market prices of the underlying crude oil and refined products.
The level of activity for these derivatives is based on the level of operating inventories.
As of June 30, 2016, there were no barrels of crude oil and feedstocks (no barrels at
December 31, 2015) outstanding under these derivative instruments designated as fair value
hedges and no barrels (no barrels at December 31, 2015) outstanding under these derivative
instruments not designated as hedges. As of June 30, 2016, there were 3,300,487 barrels of
intermediates and refined products (3,776,011 barrels at December 31, 2015) outstanding under
these derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and no barrels (no barrels at
December 31, 2015) outstanding
30
PBF ENERGY INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE, UNIT, PER SHARE, PER UNIT AND BARREL DATA)
under these derivative instruments not designated as hedges. These volumes represent the
notional value of the contract.
The Company also enters into economic hedges primarily consisting of commodity derivative
contracts that are not designated as hedges and are used to manage price volatility in certain
crude oil and feedstock inventories as well as crude oil, feedstock, and refined product sales or
purchases. The objective in entering into economic hedges is consistent with the objectives
discussed above for fair value hedges. As of June 30, 2016, there were 30,486,500 barrels of
crude oil and 5,857,000 barrels of refined products (39,577,000 and 4,599,136, respectively, as
of December 31, 2015), outstanding under short and long term commodity derivative contracts
not designated as hedges representing the notional value of the contracts.
The following tables provide information about the fair values of these derivative instruments as
of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the line items in the condensed consolidated

16. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company's operations are organized into two reportable segments, Refining and Logistics.
Operations that are not included in the Refining and Logistics segments are included in
Corporate. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements and
are included in Eliminations.
Refining
As of June 30, 2016, the Company's Refining Segment includes the operations of its four
refineries which are located in Toledo, Ohio, Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey
and New Orleans, Louisiana. The refineries produce unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil,
petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States. The
Company purchases crude oil, other feedstocks and blending components from various third-
party suppliers. The Company sells products throughout the Northeast, Midwest and Gulf Coast
of the United States, as well as in other regions of the United States and Canada, and is able to
ship products to other international destinations.
Logistics
The Company formed PBFX, a publicly traded master limited partnership, to own or lease,
operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines,
storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX's assets consist of (i) a rail terminal which
has a double loop track and ancillary pumping and unloading equipment located at the Delaware
City refinery; (ii) a truck terminal comprised of six lease automatic custody transfer units
accepting crude oil deliveries by truck located at the Toledo refinery; (iii) a heavy crude rail
unloading rack located at the Delaware City refinery; (iv) a tank farm, including a propane storage
and loading facility at the Toledo Refinery; (v) an interstate petroleum products pipeline and a 15-
lane truck loading rack both located at the Delaware City refinery; and (vi) the East Coast
Terminals consisting of product storage tanks and terminal operations with pipeline connections
to the Colonial Pipeline Company, Buckeye Partners, Sunoco Logistics Partners and other
proprietary pipeline systems, truck loading lanes and marine facilities capable of handling barges
and ships. PBFX provides various rail, truck and marine terminaling services, pipeline
transportation services and storage services to PBF Holding and/or its subsidiaries and third
party customers through fee-based commercial agreements. Apart from the East Coast
Terminals, PBFX currently does not generate third party revenue and, as such, intersegment
related-party revenues are eliminated in consolidation. Prior to the PBFX Offering, PBFX's assets
were operated within the refining operations of the Company's Delaware City and Toledo
refineries and did not generate third party revenue nor, apart from Delaware Pipeline Company
LLC, any intra-entity revenue and were not considered to be a separate reportable segment.
The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based primarily on income from
operations. Income from operations includes those revenues and expenses that are directly
attributable to management of the respective segment. The Logistics segment's revenues include
inter-segment transactions with the Company's Refining segment at prices the Company
believes are substantially equivalent to the prices that could have been negotiated with
unaffiliated parties with respect to similar services. Activities of the Company's business that are
not included in the two operating segments are included in Corporate. Such activities consist
primarily of corporate staff operations and other items that are not specific to the normal
operations of the two operating segments. The Company does not allocate certain items of other
income and expense, including income taxes, to the individual segments. The Refinery
segment's operating subsidiaries and PBFX are primarily pass-through entities with respect to
income taxes.
Disclosures regarding our reportable segments with reconciliations to consolidated totals for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 are presented below.
Total assets of each segment consist of net property, plant and equipment, inventories, cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivables and other assets directly associated with the segment’s
operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of deferred tax assets, property, plant and
equipment and other assets not directly related to our refinery and logistic operations.

outstanding PBF LLC Series A Units to Class A common stock of PBF Energy. The net
income attributable to PBF Energy, used in the numerator of the diluted earnings per share
calculation is adjusted to reflect the net income, as well as the corresponding income tax
expense (based on a 39.6% statutory tax rate for both the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 40.2% statutory tax rate for both the three and six months ended June 30,
2015) attributable to the converted units.

18. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Torrance Acquisition
On July 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of the Torrance refinery and related
logistics assets (collectively, the "Torrance Acquisition") from ExxonMobil Oil Corporation and its
subsidiary, Mobil Pacific Pipeline Company (together, the "Sellers"). The Torrance refinery,
located in Torrance, California, is a high-conversion, delayed-coking refinery. The facility is
strategically positioned in Southern California with advantaged logistics connectivity that offers
flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities primarily in the California,
Las Vegas and Phoenix area markets.
In addition to refining assets, the transaction includes a number of high-quality logistics assets
including a sophisticated network of crude and products pipelines, product distribution terminals
and refinery crude and product storage facilities. The most significant of the logistics assets is a
crude gathering and transportation system which delivers San Joaquin Valley crude oil directly
from the field to the refinery. Additionally, included in the transaction are several pipelines which
provide access to sources of crude oil including the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, as
well as clean product outlets with a direct pipeline supplying jet fuel to the Los Angeles airport.
The refinery also has crude and product storage facilities.
The purchase price for the assets was $537,500, plus preliminary working capital of $460,934,
which is subject to final valuation within ninety days of closing. In addition, the Company
assumed certain pre-existing environmental and regulatory emission credit obligations in
connection with the Torrance Acquisition. The transaction was financed through a combination of
cash on hand including proceeds from our October 2015 Equity Offering, the 2023 Senior
Secured Notes offering and borrowings under our Revolving Loan. A determination of the
acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and the working
capital at closing calculation is pending the completion of an independent appraisal and other
evaluations.
The Torrance Acquisition provides the Company with a broader more diversified asset base and
increases the number of operating refineries from four to five and the Company's combined crude
oil throughput capacity. The acquisition also provides the Company with a presence in the
attractive Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts ("PADD") 5 market.
Rail Facility Revolving Credit Facility
On July 15, 2016, the Rail Facility was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity from
April 29, 2017 to October 31, 2017. The amendment also reduced the aggregate commitment to
the amount outstanding, therefore, eliminating the commitment fee and requires the Company to
repay $20,000 of the outstanding balance on or prior to January 1, 2017.
Dividend Declared
On July 29, 2016, the Company announced a dividend of $0.30 per share on outstanding Class
A common stock. The dividend is payable on August 23, 2016 to Class A common stockholders
of record at the close of business on August 9, 2016.
PBFX Distributions
On July 29, 2016, the Board of Directors of PBF GP announced a distribution of $0.43 per unit on
outstanding common and subordinated units of PBFX. The distribution is payable on August 23,
2016 to PBFX unit holders of record at the close of business on August 9, 2016.
Related Party
On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into a consulting services agreement with Thomas D.
O'Malley, the former Executive Chairman of the Company. Compensation for the services under
the agreement will be $1,000 annually.

ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of PBF Energy Inc. included in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the unaudited financial
statements and related notes included in this report. The following discussion contains “forward-
looking statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance.
Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such
forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We caution that assumptions,
expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from
actual results and the differences can be material. Please see “Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements.”
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to PBF Energy and its
consolidated subsidiaries, including PBF LLC, PBF Holding and its subsidiaries and PBFX and
its subsidiaries.
Overview
We are one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded
transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum
products in the United States. We sell our products throughout the Northeast, Midwest and Gulf
Coast of the United States, as well as in other regions of the United States and Canada, and are
able to ship products to other international destinations. We were formed in 2008 to pursue
acquisitions of crude oil refineries and downstream assets in North America. As of June 30,
2016, we owned and operated four domestic oil refineries and related assets, which we acquired
in 2010, 2011 and 2015. As of June 30, 2016, our refineries have a combined processing
capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 730,000 barrels per day (“bpd”), and a
weighted-average Nelson Complexity Index of 11.7. We operate in two reportable business
segments: Refining and Logistics.
As of June 30, 2016, our four refineries are located in Toledo, Ohio, Delaware City, Delaware,
Paulsboro, New Jersey and New Orleans, Louisiana. Our Mid-Continent refinery at Toledo
processes light, sweet crude, and has a throughput capacity of 170,000 bpd and a Nelson
Complexity Index of 9.2. The majority of Toledo’s West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) based crude
is delivered via pipelines that originate in both Canada and the United States. Since our
acquisition of Toledo in 2011, we have added additional truck and rail crude unloading
capabilities that provide feedstock sourcing flexibility for the refinery and enables Toledo to run a
more cost-advantaged crude slate. Our East Coast refineries at Delaware City and Paulsboro
have a combined refining capacity of 370,000 bpd and Nelson Complexity Indices of 11.3 and
13.2, respectively. These high-conversion refineries process primarily medium and heavy, sour
crudes and have the flexibility to receive crude and feedstock via both water and rail. We have
expanded and upgraded existing on-site railroad infrastructure at our Delaware City refinery,
including the expansion of the crude rail unloading facilities that was completed in February
2013. The Delaware City rail unloading facility, which was transferred to PBFX in 2014, allows
our East Coast refineries the flexibility to source WTI-based crudes from Western Canada and
the Mid-Continent, when doing so provides cost advantages versus traditional Brent-based
international crudes. We believe this sourcing optionality can be a beneficial component to the
profitability of our East Coast refining system in certain crude pricing environments. The
Chalmette refinery, located outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, is a 189,000 bpd, dual-train
coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 12.7 and is capable of processing both light and
heavy crude oil. The facility is strategically positioned on the Gulf Coast with strong logistics
connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities,
including the potential to export products.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned 97,825,983 PBF LLC Series C Units and our current and former
executive officers and directors and certain employees and others held 4,964,901 PBF LLC
Series A Units (we refer to all of the holders of the PBF LLC Series A Units as “the members of
PBF LLC other than PBF Energy”). As a result, the holders of our issued and outstanding shares
of our Class A common stock have approximately 95.2% of the voting power in us, and the
members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy through their holdings of Class B common stock
have approximately 4.8% of the voting power in us.

Recent Developments
Recent significant business developments affecting the Company are discussed below.
Torrance Acquisition
On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired from ExxonMobil Oil Corporation (“ExxonMobil”) and its
subsidiary, Mobil Pacific Pipeline Company (together, the “Torrance Sellers”), the Torrance
refinery and related logistics assets (collectively, the “Torrance Acquisition”). The Torrance
refinery, located on 750 acres in Torrance, California, is a high-conversion 155,000 barrel per
day, delayed-coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 14.9. The facility is strategically
positioned in Southern California with advantaged logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw
material sourcing and product distribution opportunities primarily in the California, Las Vegas and
Phoenix area markets. The Torrance Acquisition is expected to further increase the Company's
total throughput capacity to approximately 900,000 bpd.
In addition to refining assets, the Torrance Acquisition includes a number of high-quality logistics
assets including a sophisticated network of crude and products pipelines, product distribution
terminals and refinery crude and product storage facilities. The most significant of the logistics
assets is a 171-mile crude gathering and transportation system which delivers San Joaquin
Valley crude oil directly from the field to the refinery. Additionally, included in the transaction are
several pipelines which provide access to sources of crude oil including the Ports of Long Beach
and Los Angeles, as well as clean product outlets with a direct pipeline supplying jet fuel to the
Los Angeles airport. The Torrance refinery also has crude and product storage facilities with
approximately 8.6 million barrels of shell capacity.
The purchase price for the assets was $537.5 million, plus preliminary working capital of $460.9
million, which is to subject to final valuation within ninety days of closing. In addition, the
Company assumed certain pre-existing environmental and regulatory emission credit obligations
in connection with the Torrance Acquisition. The transaction was financed through a combination
of cash on hand including proceeds from our October 2015 Equity Offering and the 2023 Senior
Secured Notes offering and borrowings under our Revolving Loan. A determination of the
acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and the working
capital at closing is pending the completion of an independent appraisal and other evaluations.
The Torrance Acquisition provides the Company with a broader more diversified asset base and
increases the number of operating refineries from four to five and the Company's combined crude
oil throughput capacity. The acquisition also provides the Company with a presence in the
attractive Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts ("PADD") 5 market.
Factors Affecting Comparability Between Periods
Our results have been affected by the following events, which must be understood in order to
assess the comparability of our period to period financial performance and financial condition.
PBFX Plains Asset Purchase
On April 29, 2016, PBFX's wholly-owed subsidiary, PBF Logistics Products Terminals LLC,
completed the purchase of the assets of four refined product terminals located in the greater
Philadelphia region (the “East Coast Terminals”) from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline,
L.P. The East Coast Terminals include a total of 57 product tanks with a total shell capacity of
approximately 4.2 million barrels, pipeline connections to the Colonial Pipeline Company,
Buckeye Partners, Sunoco Logistics Partners and other proprietary pipeline systems, 26 truck
loading lanes and marine facilities capable of handling barges and ships.With the Plains Asset
Purchase, PBFX increased its total shell capacity to over 8.1 million barrels. This acquisition
expands PBFX's storage and terminaling footprint and introduces third-party customers to its
revenue base.
The total cash consideration for the Plains Asset Purchase was approximately $100.0 million,
less estimated working capital of $1.7 million, which is subject to final valuation. The transaction
was financed by PBFX with
39
$98.3 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. PBFX borrowed an additional
$98.5 million under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility, which were used to repay $98.3 million
of the PBFX Term Loan in order to release $98.3 million in marketable securities that had
collateralized the PBFX Term Loan.
April 2016 PBFX Equity Offering
On April 5, 2016, PBFX completed a public offering of an aggregate of 2,875,000 common units,
including 375,000 common units that were sold pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment
option, for net proceeds of $51.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and other offering expenses (the “April 2016 PBFX Equity Offering”). As a result of the April 2016
PBFX Equity Offering, as of June 30, 2016, PBF LLC holds a 49.4% limited partner interest in
PBFX and owns all of PBFX's IDRs, with the remaining 50.6% limited partner interest owned by
public common unit holders.
Chalmette Acquisition
On November 1, 2015, the Company acquired from ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Mobil Pipe Line
Company and PDV Chalmette, Inc., 100% of the ownership interests of Chalmette Refining,
which owns the Chalmette refinery and related logistics assets. The Chalmette refinery, located
outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, is a dual-train coking refinery and is capable of processing
both light and heavy crude oil. Subsequent to the closing of the Chalmette Acquisition, Chalmette
Refining is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF Holding.
Chalmette Refining owns 100% of the MOEM Pipeline, providing access to the Empire Terminal,
as well as the CAM Connection Pipeline, providing access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port
facility through a third party pipeline. Chalmette Refining also owns 80% of each of the Collins
Pipeline Company and T&M Terminal Company, both located in Collins, Mississippi, which
provide a clean products outlet for the refinery to the Plantation and Colonial Pipelines. Also
included in the acquisition are a marine terminal capable of importing waterborne feedstocks and
loading or unloading finished products; a clean products truck rack which provides access to
local markets; and a crude and product storage facility.
The aggregate purchase price for the Chalmette Acquisition was $322.0 million in cash, plus
inventory and working capital of $246.0 million, which was finalized in the first quarter of 2016.
The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the
Company’s Revolving Loan.
Initial Public Offering of PBFX and Subsequent Drop-Down Transactions
On May 14, 2014, PBFX completed its initial public offering (the “PBFX Offering”) of 15,812,500
common units, including 2,062,500 common units issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-
allotment option. Subsequent to the PBFX Offering, PBF Holding and PBF LLC entered into a
series of drop-down transactions with PBFX and completed the acquisition of the East Coast
Terminals.
PBFX is a fee-based, growth-oriented, Delaware master limited partnership formed by PBF
Energy to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products
terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX engages in the
receiving, handling and transferring of crude oil and the receipt, storage and delivery of crude oil,
refined products and intermediates. PBFX’s assets consist of a light crude oil rail unloading
terminal at the Delaware City refinery that also services the Paulsboro refinery (which we refer to
as the “Delaware City Rail Terminal”), a crude oil truck unloading terminal at the Toledo refinery
(which we refer to as the “Toledo Truck Terminal”), the DCR West Rack, the Toledo Storage
Facility, the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack and the East Coast Terminals.
Apart from the East Coast Terminals, PBFX’s revenue is derived from long-term, fee-based
commercial agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy, which include minimum volume
commitments, for receiving, handling, transferring and storing crude oil and refined products.
These transactions are eliminated by PBF Energy in consolidation.
During 2014, PBFX acquired from PBF LLC the DCR West Rack, a heavy crude oil rail
unloading facility (also, capable of unloading light crude oil) at the Delaware City refinery and the
Toledo Storage Facility, a tank farm and related facilities located at our Toledo refinery, including
a propane storage and loading facility.
40
On May 14, 2015, PBF LLC contributed to PBFX all of the issued and outstanding limited liability
company interests of Delaware Pipeline Company LLC and Delaware City Logistics Company
LLC, whose assets consist of a product pipeline, truck rack and related facilities located at our
Delaware City refinery (collectively referred to as the “Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck
Rack”).
Amended and Restated Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility
On an ongoing basis, the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement ("Revolving
Loan") is available to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In
November and December 2015, PBF Holding increased the maximum availability under the
Revolving Loan to $2.60 billion and $2.64 billion, respectively, in accordance with its accordion
feature.
Senior Secured Notes Offering
On November 24, 2015, PBF Holding and PBF Finance Corporation issued $500.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of 7.0% senior secured notes due 2023 (the "2023 Senior Secured
Notes"). The net proceeds were approximately $490.0 million after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discount and offering expenses. The Company used the proceeds for general
corporate purposes, including to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Torrance Acquisition.
Rail Facility Revolving Credit Facility
Effective March 25, 2014, PBF Rail Logistics Company LLC (“PBF Rail”), an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of PBF Holding, entered into a $250.0 million secured revolving credit
agreement (the “Rail Facility”). The primary purpose of the Rail Facility is to fund the acquisition
by PBF Rail of coiled and insulated crude tank cars and non-coiled and non-insulated general
purpose crude tank cars (the “Eligible Railcars”) before December 2015. The amount available to
be advanced under the Rail Facility equals 70% of the lesser of the aggregate Appraised Value
of the Eligible Railcars, or the aggregate Purchase Price of such Eligible Railcars, as these terms
are defined in the credit agreement.
On April 29, 2015, the Rail Facility was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity from
March 31, 2016 to April 29, 2017, reduce the total commitment from $250.0 million to $150.0
million, and reduce the commitment fee on the unused portion of the Rail Facility. Additionally,
the total commitment amount was reduced further to $100.0 million in 2016, and the Rail Facility
was amended again on July 15, 2016 to, among other things, extend the maturity from April 29,
2017 to October 31, 2017. The amendment also reduced the aggregate commitment to the
amount outstanding, therefore, eliminating the commitment fee, and requires the Company to
repay $20.0 million of the outstanding balance on or prior to January 1, 2017. At any time prior to
maturity PBF Rail may repay any advances without premium or penalty.
PBFX Debt Facilities
On May 12, 2015, PBFX entered into an Indenture among the Partnership, PBF Logistics
Finance Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of PBFX (“PBF
Logistics Finance,” and together with PBFX, the “Issuers”), the Guarantors named therein (certain
subsidiaries of PBFX) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee, under which
the Issuers issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due
2023 (the “PBFX Senior Notes”). PBF LLC has provided a limited guarantee of collection of the
principal amount of the PBFX Senior Notes, but is not otherwise subject to the covenants of the
indenture. Of the $350.0 million aggregate PBFX Senior Notes, $19.9 million were purchased by
certain of PBF Energy’s officers and directors and their affiliates pursuant to a separate private
placement transaction. After deducting offering expenses, PBFX received net proceeds of
approximately $343.0 million from the PBFX Senior Notes offering.
J. Aron Intermediation Agreements
On May 29, 2015, PBF Holding entered into amended and restated inventory intermediation
agreements (the “A&R Intermediation Agreements”) with J. Aron & Company (“J. Aron”) pursuant
to which certain terms of the existing inventory intermediation agreements were amended,
including, among other things, pricing and an extension of the term for a period of two years from
the original expiry date of July 1, 2015, subject to certain early termination rights. In addition, the
A&R Intermediation Agreements include one-year renewal clauses by mutual consent of both
parties.
Pursuant to each A&R Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron will continue to purchase and hold title
to certain of the intermediate and finished products (the “Products”) produced by the Paulsboro
and Delaware City refineries (the “Refineries”), respectively, and delivered into tanks at the
Refineries. Furthermore, J. Aron agrees to sell the Products back to Paulsboro refinery and
Delaware City refinery as the Products are discharged out of the Refineries' tanks. J. Aron has
the right to store the Products purchased in tanks under the A&R Intermediation Agreements
41
and will retain these storage rights for the term of the agreements. PBF Holding will continue to
market and sell the Products independently to third parties.
Crude Oil Acquisition Agreement Terminations
Effective December 31, 2015, our crude oil supply agreement with Statoil for the Delaware City
refinery expired. Subsequent to the termination of the Statoil supply agreement, we purchase all
of our crude and feedstock needs independently from a variety of suppliers, including Saudi
Aramco and others, on the spot market or through term agreements. Subsequent to the
Chalmette Acquisition we entered into a contract with PDVSA for the supply of 40,000 to 60,000
bpd of crude oil that can be processed at any of our East or Gulf Coast refineries.
Public Offerings
On February 6, 2015, funds affiliated with Blackstone and First Reserve exchanged 3,804,653
PBF LLC Series A units for the same number of shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock
which were subsequently sold in a secondary public offering (the “February 2015 secondary
offering” and collectively with the secondary offerings completed in 2013 and 2014, the
“secondary offerings”). As a result of these secondary offerings, Blackstone and First Reserve no
longer hold any PBF LLC Series A units. The holders of PBF LLC Series B Units, which include
certain current and former executive officers of PBF Energy, received a portion of the proceeds of
the sales of the PBF Energy Class A common stock by Blackstone and First Reserve in
accordance with the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of PBF LLC.
PBF Energy did not receive any proceeds from the secondary offerings.
On October 13, 2015, we completed a public offering of an aggregate of 11,500,000 shares of
Class A common stock (the " October 2015 Equity Offering"), including 1,500,000 shares of
Class A common stock that was sold pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment option, for net
proceeds of $344.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other
offering expenses.
As of December 31, 2015, we owned 97,781,933 PBF LLC Series C Units and our current and
former executive officers and directors and certain employees beneficially owned 4,985,358 PBF
LLC Series A Units, and the holders of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common
stock had 95.1% of the voting power in us and the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy
through their holdings of Class B common stock had the remaining 4.9% of the voting power in
us.
As of June 30, 2016, we currently own 97,825,983 PBF LLC Series C Units and our current and
former executive officers and directors and certain employees and others beneficially own
4,964,901 PBF LLC Series A Units, and the holders of our issued and outstanding shares of
Class A common stock have 95.2% of the voting power in us and the members of PBF LLC other
than PBF Energy through their holdings of Class B common stock have the remaining 4.8% of
the voting power in us.

Results of Operations
The tables below reflect our consolidated financial and operating highlights for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands, except per share data). We
operate in two reportable business segments: Refining and Logistics. Our oil refineries,
excluding the assets owned by PBFX, are all engaged in the refining of crude oil and other
feedstocks into petroleum products, and are aggregated into the Refining segment. PBFX is a
publicly traded master limited partnership that operates logistical assets such as crude oil and
refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines and storage facilities. PBFX's operations are
aggregated into the Logistics segment. Prior to the PBFX Offering and PBFX's acquisition of the
DCR West Rack, the Toledo Storage Facility and the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck
Rack, PBFX's assets were operated within the refining operations of our Delaware City and
Toledo refineries and did not generate third party revenue nor, apart from Delaware Pipeline
Company LLC, any intra-entity revenue and were not considered to be a separate reportable
segment. We did not analyze our results by individual segments as, apart from the East Coast
Terminals, our Logistics segment did not have any third party revenue and substantially all of its
operating results eliminate in consolidation.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Overview— Net income was $120.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to net income of $158.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Net income
attributable to PBF Energy was $103.5 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 ($1.06 per share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on
adjusted fully-converted net income, or $0.14 per share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis
based on adjusted fully-converted net income excluding special items, as described below in
Non-GAAP Financial Measures) compared to net income attributable to PBF Energy of $135.8
million, or $1.57 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2015 ($1.57 per share on
a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on adjusted fully-converted net income, or $0.88 per
share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on adjusted fully-converted net income
excluding special items, as described below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures). The net income
or loss attributable to PBF Energy represents PBF Energy’s equity interest in PBF LLC’s pre-tax
income, less applicable income tax expense. PBF Energy's weighted-average equity interest in
PBF LLC was 95.2% and 94.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
Our results for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were positively impacted by a non-cash
special item consisting of a pre-tax inventory lower of cost or market (“LCM”) adjustment of
approximately $157.8 million or $95.3 million net of tax. Our results for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 were positively impacted by a pre-tax inventory LCM adjustment of approximately
$106.0 million or $63.4 million net of tax. These LCM adjustments were recorded due to
significant changes in the price of crude oil and refined products in the periods presented.
Excluding the impact of the net change in LCM reserve, our results were negatively impacted by
lower crack spreads, increased costs to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard and higher
interest costs, offset by a positive earnings contribution from the Chalmette refinery and higher
throughput in the Mid-Continent.
$ 2.77
Revenues— Revenues totaled $3.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to $3.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $0.3
billion, or 8.7%. Revenues per barrel
45
were $60.74 and $79.46 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a
decrease of 23.6% directly related to lower hydrocarbon commodity prices. For the three months
ended June 30, 2016, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast
refineries averaged approximately 351,700 bpd, 174,200 bpd and 172,200 bpd, respectively. For
the three months ended June 30, 2015, the total throughput rates at our East Coast and Mid-
Continent refineries averaged approximately 349,000 bpd and 142,100 bpd, respectively. The
throughput rates at our East Coast refineries in 2016 compared to 2015 remained relatively
consistent for the periods presented while the increase in throughput at our Mid-Continent
refinery is due to unplanned downtime in the second quarter of 2015. Our Gulf Coast refinery was
not acquired until the fourth quarter of 2015. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the total
barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast refineries averaged approximately
385,300 bpd, 180,000 bpd and 211,800 bpd, respectively. For the three months ended June 30,
2015, the total barrels sold at our East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged
approximately 372,300 bpd and 151,000 bpd, respectively. Total refined product barrels sold
were higher than throughput rates, reflecting sales from inventory as well as sales and purchases
of refined products outside the refinery.
Gross Margin— Gross margin, including refinery operating expenses and depreciation, totaled
$289.9 million, or $4.56 per barrel of throughput, for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $319.3 million, or $7.15 per barrel of throughput, for the three months ended
June 30, 2015, a decrease of $29.4 million. Gross refining margin (as described below in Non-
GAAP Financial Measures) totaled $571.0 million, or $8.98 per barrel of throughput ($413.2
million or $6.50 per barrel of throughput excluding the impact of special items), for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $523.7 million, or $11.72 per barrel of throughput
($417.7 million or $9.35 per barrel of throughput excluding the impact of special items) for the
three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $47.3 million. Excluding the
impact of special items, gross margin and gross refining margin decreased primarily due to lower
crack spreads as persistent above-average refined product inventory levels weighed on margins,
unfavorable movements in certain crude differentials, and increased costs to comply with the
Renewable Fuel Standard, partially offset by higher throughput rates in the Mid-Continent and
positive margin contributions from the Chalmette refinery acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Costs to comply with our obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard, excluding our Gulf
Coast refinery, totaled $70.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $36.1
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. In addition, gross margin and gross refining
margin were positively impacted by a non-cash LCM adjustment of approximately $157.8 million
on a net basis resulting from the change in crude oil and refined product prices from the end of
the first quarter of 2016 to the end of the second quarter of 2016 which, while remaining below
historical costs, increased since the prior quarter. The non-cash LCM adjustment increased gross
margin and gross refining margin by approximately $106.0 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2015.
Average industry refining margins in the Mid-Continent were weaker during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 industry
crack spread was approximately $16.51 per barrel or 19.7% lower in the three months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to $20.57 per barrel in the same period in 2015. Our margins were
negatively impacted from our refinery specific crude slate in the Mid-Continent which was
impacted by a declining WTI/Bakken differential. Alternatively, those margins were positively
impacted by an improving WTI/Syncrude differential, which averaged a premium of $2.72 per
barrel during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a premium of $4.02 per
barrel in the same period of 2015.
The Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was approximately $15.32 per barrel, or
22.7% lower in the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $19.83 per barrel in the
same period in 2015. The Dated Brent/WTI differential was $4.05 lower in the three months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. In addition, the WTI/Bakken
differential was approximately $1.71 per barrel less favorable in the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Reductions in these benchmark crude
differentials typically result in higher crude costs and negatively impact our earnings.
Operating Expenses— Operating expenses totaled $276.6 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $195.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an
increase of $81.6 million, or 41.9%. Of the total $276.6 million of operating expenses for the three
months ended June 30, 2016, $271.5 million or $4.27 per barrel of throughput, related to
expenses incurred by the Refining segment, while the remaining $5.1 million
46
related to expenses incurred by the Logistics segment ($2.8 million of operating expenses for the
three months ended June 30, 2015 related to the Logistics segment). The increase in operating
expenses was mainly attributable to the operations of the Chalmette refinery acquired in
November 2015, which totaled approximately $83.0 million for the quarter. In addition, higher
salary and benefits expenses for the quarter due to increased headcount were offset by lower
maintenance, energy and utility expenses.The operating expenses related to the Logistics
segment consists of costs related to the operation and maintenance of PBFX's assets.
General and Administrative Expenses— General and administrative expenses totaled $43.4
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $39.2 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $4.2 million or 10.7%. The increase in
general and administrative expenses primarily relates to acquisition-related costs for outside and
professional services incurred in support of the Plains Asset Purchase and Torrance Acquisition
of $5.2 million and higher equity compensation expense of $5.6 million related to additional
equity based award grants and the retirement of our Executive Chairman partially offset by
reduced employee related expenses of $6.3 million mainly due to lower incentive compensation
expense. Our general and administrative expenses are comprised of the personnel, facilities and
other infrastructure costs necessary to support our refineries.
Loss (gain) on Sale of Assets— There was a loss of $3.2 million on the sale of assets for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 relating to the sale of railcars in the second quarter of 2016 as
compared to a gain of $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 which related to the
sale of railcars which were subsequently leased back.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense— Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $51.1
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $48.6 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $2.5 million. The increase was a result of additional
depreciation expense associated with the assets acquired in the Chalmette Acquisition and the
Plains Asset Purchase and a general increase in our fixed asset base due to capital projects
completed since the second quarter 2015.
Change in Fair Value of Catalyst Leases— Change in the fair value of catalyst leases
represented a loss of $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a gain
of $1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. These losses and gains relate to the
change in value of the precious metals underlying the sale and leaseback of our refineries’
precious metals catalyst, which we are obligated to repurchase at fair market value on the lease
termination dates.
Interest Expense, net— Interest expense totaled $35.9 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $26.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase
of approximately $9.0 million. This increase is mainly attributable to higher interest costs
associated with the issuance of the PBFX Senior Notes in May 2015 and the 2023 Senior
Secured Notes in November 2015. Interest expense includes interest on long-term debt including
the PBFX credit facilities, costs related to the sale and leaseback of our precious metals catalyst,
financing costs associated with the A&R Inventory Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron, letter
of credit fees associated with the purchase of certain crude oils, and the amortization of deferred
financing costs.
Income Tax Expense— PBF LLC is organized as a limited liability company and PBFX is a
master limited partnership, both of which are treated as “flow-through” entities for federal income
tax purposes and therefore are not subject to income tax apart from the income tax attributable to
certain subsidiaries of PBF Holding or ts subsidiaries that are treated as C-Corporations for
income tax purposes. However, the members of PBF LLC are required to include their
proportionate share of PBF LLC’s taxable income or loss, which includes PBF LLC’s allocable
share of PBFX’s pre-tax income or loss, on their respective tax returns. PBF LLC generally
makes distributions to its members, per the terms of PBF LLC's amended and restated limited
liability company agreement, related to such taxes on a pro-rata basis. PBF Energy recognizes
an income tax expense or benefit in our consolidated financial statements based on PBF
Energy's allocable share of PBF LLC’s pre-tax income or loss, which was approximately 95.2%
and 94.4%, on a weighted-average basis for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. PBF Energy's condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any
benefit or provision for income taxes on the pre-tax income or loss attributable to the
noncontrolling interests in PBF LLC or PBFX
47
(although, as described above, PBF LLC must make tax distributions to all its members on a pro-
rata basis). PBF Energy's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest, for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 42.3% and 40.0%, respectively, reflecting tax
adjustments for discrete items and the impact of earnings in foreign tax jurisdictions.
Noncontrolling Interest— As a result of our initial public offering ("IPO") and the related
reorganization transactions, PBF Energy became the sole managing member of, and has a
controlling interest in, PBF LLC. As the sole managing member of PBF LLC, PBF Energy
operates and controls all of the business and affairs of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries. PBF
Energy consolidates the financial results of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries, including PBFX. With
respect to the consolidation of PBF LLC, the Company records a noncontrolling interest for the
economic interest in PBF LLC held by members other than PBF Energy, and with respect to the
consolidation of PBFX, the Company records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interests
in PBFX held by the public unit holders of PBFX, and with respect to the consolidation of PBF
Holding, the Company records a 20% noncontrolling interest for the ownership interests in two
subsidiaries of Chalmette Refining held by a third party. The total noncontrolling interest on the
consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the Company’s earnings or loss
attributable to the economic interests held by members of PBF Energy other than PBF Energy
and by the public common unit holders of PBFX and by the third party holder of Chalmette
Refining's subsidiaries. The total noncontrolling interest on the balance sheet represents the
portion of the Company’s net assets attributable to the economic interests held by the members
of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy, by the public common unit holders of PBFX and by the third
party interest holder of Chalmette Refining's subsidiaries. PBF Energy's weighted-average equity
noncontrolling interest ownership percentage in PBF LLC for the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 was approximately 4.8% and 5.6%, respectively. The carrying amount of the
noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet attributable to the noncontrolling
interest is not equal to the noncontrolling interest ownership percentage due to the effect of
income taxes and related agreements that pertain solely to PBF Energy.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Overview— Net income was $97.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
net income of $261.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net income attributable to
PBF Energy was $74.1 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30,
2016 ($0.76 per share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on adjusted fully-converted
net income, or a loss of $0.51 per share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on
adjusted fully-converted net loss excluding special items, as described below in Non-GAAP
Financial Measures) compared to net income attributable to PBF Energy of $223.1 million, or
$2.57 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2015 ($2.57 per share on a fully
exchanged, fully diluted basis based on adjusted fully-converted net income, or $1.74 per share
on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on adjusted fully-converted net income excluding
special items, as described below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures). The net income or loss
attributable to PBF Energy represents PBF Energy’s equity interest in PBF LLC’s pre-tax income,
less applicable income tax expense. PBF Energy's weighted-average equity interest in PBF LLC
was 95.2% and 93.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were positively impacted by a non-cash
special item consisting of a pre-tax LCM adjustment of approximately $216.8 million or $131.0
million net of tax. Our results for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were positively impacted by
a pre-tax LCM adjustment of approximately $127.2 million, or $76.0 million net of tax. These LCM
adjustments were recorded due to significant changes in the price of crude oil and refined
products in the periods presented. Excluding the impact of the net change in LCM reserve, our
results were negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in certain crude oil differentials,
lower crack spreads, increased costs to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard, lower
throughput volumes on the East Coast and increased interest costs partially offset by a positive
earnings contribution from the Chalmette refinery and higher throughput in the Mid-Continent.
Throughput volumes on the East Coast were impacted by approximately two weeks of
unplanned downtime as a result of a weather-related loss of power in late January 2016 and a
planned coker turnaround at our Delaware City refinery. Given the prevailing market conditions
and unplanned downtime during the first quarter, we decided to move forward the scheduled
turnaround of the Delaware City coker and other related units which lasted through the remainder
of the first quarter of 2016.
48
Revenues— Revenues totaled $6.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
$6.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion, or
1.7%. Revenues per barrel were $54.28 and $75.43 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, a decrease of 28.0% directly related to lower hydrocarbon commodity prices.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-
Continent and Gulf Coast refineries averaged approximately 333,900 bpd, 165,900 bpd and
174,200 bpd, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the total throughput rates at
our East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged approximately 337,400 bpd and 142,080
bpd, respectively. The decrease in throughput rates at our East Coast refineries in 2016
compared to 2015 is primarily due to the planned and unplanned downtime at our Delaware City
refinery as described above. Our Gulf Coast refinery was not acquired until the fourth quarter of
2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the total barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-
Continent and Gulf Coast refineries averaged approximately 376,200 bpd, 174,900 bpd and
208,800 bpd, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the total barrels sold at our
East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged approximately 367,500 bpd and 154,500 bpd,
respectively. Total refined product barrels sold were higher than throughput rates, reflecting sales
from inventory as well as sales and purchases of refined products outside the refinery.
Gross Margin— Gross margin, including refinery operating expenses and depreciation, totaled
$328.8 million, or $2.68 per barrel of throughput, for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $535.6 million, or $6.17 per barrel of throughput, for the six months ended June 30,
2015, a decrease of $206.8 million. Gross refining margin (as described below in Non-GAAP
Financial Measures) totaled $925.2 million, or $7.54 per barrel of throughput ($708.4 million or
$5.77 per barrel of throughput excluding the impact of special items), for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $989.8 million, or $11.40 per barrel of throughput ($862.6 million or
$9.93 per barrel of throughput excluding the impact of special items) for the six months ended
June 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $64.5 million. Excluding the impact of special items,
gross margin and gross refining margin decreased due to unfavorable movements in certain
crude differentials, lower crack spreads as persistent above-average refined product inventory
levels weighed on margins, increased costs to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard, and
reduced throughput in the East Coast partially offset by higher throughput rates in the Mid-
Continent and positive margin contributions from the Chalmette refinery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2015. Costs to comply with our obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard,
excluding our Gulf Coast refinery, totaled $115.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $72.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. In addition, gross margin and
gross refining margin were positively impacted by a non-cash LCM adjustment of approximately
$216.8 million on a net basis resulting from the change in crude oil and refined product prices
from the year ended 2015 to the end of the second quarter of 2016 which, while remaining below
historical costs, increased since the year end. The non-cash LCM adjustment increased gross
margin and gross refining margin by approximately $127.2 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Average industry refining margins in the Mid-Continent were weaker during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 industry crack
spread was approximately $12.77 per barrel or 29.3% lower in the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to $18.05 per barrel in the same period in 2015. Our margins were negatively
impacted from our refinery specific crude slate in the Mid-Continent which was impacted by a
declining WTI/Bakken differential and an adverse WTI/Syncrude differential, which averaged a
premium of $3.56 per barrel during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a
premium of $2.27 per barrel in the same period of 2015.
The Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was approximately $13.30 per barrel, or
25.4% lower in the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $17.83 per barrel in the
same period in 2015. The Dated Brent/WTI differential and Dated Brent/Maya differential were
$4.53 and $0.45 lower, respectively, in the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
same period in 2015. In addition, the WTI/Bakken differential was approximately $2.63 per barrel
less favorable in the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
Reductions in these benchmark crude differentials typically result in higher crude costs and
negatively impact our earnings.

Operating Expenses— Operating expenses totaled $576.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $432.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase
of $144.5 million, or 33.4%. Of the total $576.6 million of operating expenses for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, $568.2 million or $4.63 per barrel of throughput, related to expenses
incurred by the Refining segment, while the remaining $8.4 million related to expenses incurred
by the Logistics segment ($6.6 million of operating expenses for the six months ended June 30,
2015 related to the Logistics segment). The increase in operating expenses was mainly
attributable to the operating expenses associated with the Chalmette refinery which totaled
approximately $160.0 million and an increase in salaries and benefits of $8.4 million for the first
six months of 2016, partially offset by decreased energy expenses mainly due to lower natural
gas prices of $24.0 million. The operating expenses related to the Logistics segment consists of
costs related to the operation and maintenance of PBFX's assets.
General and Administrative Expenses— General and administrative expenses totaled $81.0
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $75.3 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $5.7 million or 7.6%. The increase in general
and administrative expenses primarily relates to acquisition-related costs for outside and
professional services incurred in support of the Plains Asset Purchase and Torrance Acquisition
of $9.8 million and higher equity compensation expense of $6.2 million related to additional
equity based award grants and the retirement of our Executive Chairman partially offset by
reduced employee related expenses of $10.3 million mainly due to lower incentive compensation
expense. Our general and administrative expenses are comprised of the personnel, facilities and
other infrastructure costs necessary to support our refineries.
Loss (gain) on Sale of Assets— There was a loss of $3.2 million on sale of assets for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 relating to the sale of railcars in the second quarter of 2016 as
compared to a gain of $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 which related to the
sale of railcars which were subsequently leased back.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense— Depreciation and amortization expense totaled
$107.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $96.3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $10.7 million. The increase was a result of
additional depreciation expense associated with the assets acquired in the Chalmette
Acquisition and Plains Asset Purchase and a general increase in our fixed asset base due to
capital projects completed since the second quarter 2015.
Change in Fair Value of Catalyst Leases— Change in the fair value of catalyst leases
represented a loss of $4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a gain of
$4.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. These losses and gains relate to the
change in value of the precious metals underlying the sale and leaseback of our refineries’
precious metals catalyst, which we are obligated to repurchase at fair market value on the lease
termination dates.
Interest Expense, net— Interest expense totaled $73.5 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $49.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of
approximately $24.3 million. This increase is mainly attributable to higher interest costs
associated with the issuance of the PBFX Senior Notes in May 2015 and the 2023 Senior
Secured Notes in November 2015 partially offset by lower letter of credit fees. Interest expense
includes interest on long-term debt including the PBFX credit facilities, costs related to the sale
and leaseback of our precious metals catalyst, financing costs associated with the A&R Inventory
Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron, letter of credit fees associated with the purchase of
certain crude oils, and the amortization of deferred financing costs.
Income Tax Expense— PBF LLC is organized as a limited liability company and PBFX is a
master limited partnership, both of which are treated as “flow-through” entities for federal income
tax purposes and therefore are not subject to income tax apart from the income tax attributable to
certain subsidiaries of PBF Holding or ts subsidiaries that are treated as C-Corporations for
income tax purposes. However, the members of PBF LLC are required to include their
proportionate share of PBF LLC’s taxable income or loss, which includes PBF LLC’s allocable
share of PBFX’s pre-tax income or loss, on their respective tax returns. PBF LLC generally
makes distributions to its members, per the terms of PBF LLC's amended and restated limited
liability company agreement, related to such taxes on a pro-rata basis. PBF Energy recognizes
an income tax expense or benefit in our consolidated
50
financial statements based on PBF Energy's allocable share of PBF LLC’s pre-tax income or
loss, which was approximately 95.2% and 93.4%, on a weighted-average basis for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. PBF Energy's condensed consolidated
financial statements do not reflect any benefit or provision for income taxes on the pre-tax income
or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests in PBF LLC or PBFX (although, as described
above, PBF LLC must make tax distributions to all its members on a pro-rata basis). PBF
Energy's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest, for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 41.9% and 38.5%, respectively, reflecting tax benefit
adjustments for discrete items and the impact of earnings in foreign tax jurisdictions.
Noncontrolling Interest— As a result of our IPO and the related reorganization transactions, PBF
Energy became the sole managing member of, and has a controlling interest in, PBF LLC. As the
sole managing member of PBF LLC, PBF Energy operates and controls all of the business and
affairs of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries. PBF Energy consolidates the financial results of PBF
LLC and its subsidiaries, including PBFX. With respect to the consolidation of PBF LLC, the
Company records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in PBF LLC held by
members other than PBF Energy, and with respect to the consolidation of PBFX, the Company
records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interests in PBFX held by the public unit
holders of PBFX, and with respect to the consolidation of PBF Holding, the Company records a
20% noncontrolling interest for the ownership interests in two subsidiaries of Chalmette Refining
held by a third party. The total noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of operations
represents the portion of the Company’s earnings or loss attributable to the economic interests
held by members of PBF Energy other than PBF Energy and by the public common unit holders
of PBFX and by the third party holder of Chalmette Refining's subsidiaries. The total
noncontrolling interest on the balance sheet represents the portion of the Company’s net assets
attributable to the economic interests held by the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy,
by the public common unit holders of PBFX and by the third party holder of Chalmette Refining's
subsidiaries. PBF Energy's weighted-average equity noncontrolling interest ownership
percentage in PBF LLC for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately
4.8% and 6.6%, respectively. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on our
consolidated balance sheet attributable to the noncontrolling interest is not equal to the
noncontrolling interest ownership percentage due to the effect of income taxes and related
agreements that pertain solely to PBF Energy.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are
calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP
(“non-GAAP”). These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to,
measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations
thereof may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.
Special Items
The non-GAAP measures presented include Adjusted Fully-Converted net income excluding
special items, EBITDA excluding special items, and gross refining margin excluding special
items. The special items for the periods presented relate to an LCM adjustment. LCM is a GAAP
guideline related to inventory valuation that requires inventory to be stated at the lower of cost or
market. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the last-in,
first-out (“LIFO”) inventory valuation methodology, in which the most recently incurred costs are
charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs. Market is
determined based on an assessment of the current estimated replacement cost and net
realizable selling price of the inventory. In periods where the market price of our inventory
declines substantially, cost values of inventory may exceed market values. In such instances, we
record an adjustment to write down the value of inventory to market value in accordance with
GAAP. In subsequent periods, the value of inventory is reassessed and a LCM adjustment is
recorded to reflect the net change in the LCM inventory reserve between the prior period and the
current period. Although we believe that non-GAAP financial measures, excluding the impact of
special items, provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the results and
performance of our business and allow for helpful period-over-period comparisons, such non-
GAAP measures should only be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substit
51
ute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income (Loss)
PBF Energy utilizes results presented on an Adjusted Fully-Converted basis that reflects an
assumed exchange of all PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of Class A common stock of PBF
Energy. We believe that these Adjusted Fully-Converted measures, when presented in
conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to investors to compare PBF Energy
results across different periods and to facilitate an understanding of our operating results. The
differences between Adjusted Fully-Converted and GAAP results are as follows:
Assumed Exchange of all PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy Class A common
stock. As a result of the assumed exchange of all PBF LLC Series A Units, the noncontrolling
interest related to these units is converted to controlling interest. Management believes that it is
1.
useful to provide the per-share effect associated with the assumed exchange of all PBF LLC
Series A Units.
Income Taxes. Prior to the PBF Energy's IPO, we were organized as a limited liability company
treated as a “flow-through” entity for income tax purposes, and even after PBF Energy's IPO,
not all of our earnings are subject to corporate-level income taxes. Adjustments have been
made to the Adjusted Fully-Converted tax provisions and earnings to assume that we had
adopted our post-IPO corporate tax structure for all periods presented and are taxed as a C
corporation in the U.S. at the prevailing corporate rates. These assumptions are consistent with
the assumption in clause 1 above that all PBF LLC Series A Units are exchanged for shares of
PBF Energy Class A common stock, as the assumed exchange would change the amount of
our earnings that is subject to corporate income tax.

stock method for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015,
respectively. Common stock equivalents exclude the effects of options to purchase 3,467,125
and 2,919,125 shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock because they are anti-dilutive
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Common Stock equivalents,
excludes the effects of options to purchase 2,874,500 and 2,874,500 shares of PBF Energy
Class A common stock because they are anti-dilutive for the three and six months ended June

Represents an adjustment to weighted-average diluted shares to assume the full exchange of
existing PBF LLC Series A Units and common stock equivalents as described in (1) above if
not included in the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding calculated in (3) above.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded an adjustment to value
its inventories to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $157.8
million, reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $1,058.3
million at March 31, 2016 to $900.5 million at June 30, 2016. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, the Company recorded an adjustment to value its inventories to the lower of
cost or market which resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $216.8 million, reflecting the change in the
lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $1,117.3 million at December 31, 2015 to
$900.5 million at June 30, 2016.
(5)
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded an adjustment to value
its inventories to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $106.0
million, reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $668.9
million at March 31, 2015 to $562.9 million at June 30, 2015. During the six months ended
June 30, 2015, the Company recorded an adjustment to value its inventories to the lower of
cost or market which resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $127.2 million, reflecting the change in the
lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $690.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $562.9
million at June 30, 2015.
The net impact of these LCM inventory adjustments are included in the Refining segment's
operating income, but are excluded from the operating results presented in the table in order
to make such information comparable between periods. Income taxes related to the net LCM
adjustment was calculated using the Company's statutory corporate tax rate of approximately
39.6% and 40.2% for the 2016 and 2015 periods presented, respectively.
Gross Refining Margin
Gross refining margin is defined as gross margin excluding refinery depreciation, refinery
operating expenses, and gross margin of PBFX. We believe gross refining margin is an important
measure of operating performance and provides useful information to investors because it is a
helpful metric comparison to the industry refining margin benchmarks, as the refining margin
benchmarks do not include a charge for refinery operating expenses and depreciation. In order to
assess our operating performance, we compare our gross refining margin (revenue less cost of
sales) to industry refining margin benchmarks and crude oil prices as defined in the table below.
Gross refining margin should not be considered an alternative to gross margin, operating income,
net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity
presented in accordance with GAAP. Gross refining margin presented by other companies may
not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define this term differently. The
following table presents a reconciliation of gross refining margin to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measure, gross margin, on a historical basis, as applicable, for each of the
periods indicated:

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Our management uses EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance to assist in
comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating
trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual
results against such expectations, and in communications with our board of directors, creditors,
analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. Our outstanding indebtedness for
borrowed money and other contractual obligations also include similar measures as a basis for
certain covenants under those agreements which may differ from the Adjusted EBITDA definition
described below.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and our
computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in our industry. In addition,
Adjusted EBITDA contains some, but not all, adjustments that are taken into account in the
calculation of the components of various covenants in the agreements governing the Senior
Secured Notes and other credit facilities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered as alternatives to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) as measures of
operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not presented as, and
should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before adjustments for items such as equity-based
compensation expense, gains (losses) from certain derivative activities and contingent
consideration, the non-cash change in the deferral of gross profit related to the sale of certain
finished products, the write down of inventory to the LCM, changes in the liability for tax
receivable agreement due to factors out of our control such as changes in tax rates and certain
other non-cash items. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative
measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also have limitations as analytical tools and should
not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under
GAAP. Some of these limitations include that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:
does not reflect depreciation expense or our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for
capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments, on our debt;
does not reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from hedging activities, which may
have a substantial impact on our cash flow;
•does not reflect certain other non-cash income and expenses; and
•excludes income taxes that may represent a reduction in available cash.

During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded an adjustment to value its
inventories to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax impact of $216.8 million
reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $1,117.3 million at
December 31, 2015 to $900.5 million at June 30, 2016. During the six months ended June 30,
2015, the Company recorded an adjustment to value its inventories to the lower of cost or market
which resulted in a net pre-tax impact of $127.2 million reflecting the change in the lower of cost
or market inventory reserve from $690.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $562.9 million at
June 30, 2015.The net impact of these LCM inventory adjustments are included in the Refining
segment's operating income, but are excluded from the operating results presented in the table in
order to make such information comparable between periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations and borrowing availability
under our credit facilities, as more fully described below. We believe that our cash flows from
operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our and our subsidiaries'
capital expenditure, working capital, dividend payments, debt service and share repurchase
program requirements, as well as our obligations under the tax receivable agreement, for the next
twelve months. On July 1, 2016, we closed the Torrance Acquisition with a combination of cash
on hand including proceeds from our October 2015 Equity Offering and the 2023 Senior Secured
Notes offering and borrowings under our Revolving Loan. However, our ability to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations depends, in part, on petroleum market pricing and general
economic, political and other factors beyond our control. We are in compliance with all of the
covenants, including financial covenants, for all of our debt agreements.

Cash Flow Analysis
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $216.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $317.7 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. Our operating cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included
our net income of $97.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $112.5 million, deferred income
taxes of $93.0 million, plus net non-cash charges relating to the change in the fair value of our
inventory repurchase obligations of $26.2 million, pension and other post retirement benefits
costs of $15.4 million, equity-based compensation of $12.7 million, change in the fair value of our
catalyst lease of $4.6 million, loss on sale of assets of $3.2 million, partially offset by a net non-
cash benefit of $216.8 million relating to a LCM inventory adjustment. In addition, net changes in
working capital reflected sources of cash of $68.1 million driven by the timing of inventory
purchases, payments for accrued expenses and accounts payables and collections of accounts
receivables. Our operating cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015 included our net
income of $261.6 million, plus net non-cash charges relating to the change in the fair value of our
inventory repurchase obligations of $89.2 million, depreciation and amortization of $100.8
million, change in deferred income taxes of $74.0 million, pension and other post retirement
benefits costs of $12.9 million, and equity-based compensation of $5.4 million, partially offset by
a net non-cash benefit of $127.2 million relating to a LCM inventory adjustment, change in the fair
value of our catalyst lease of $4.0 million and gain on sale of assets of $1.0 million. In addition,
net changes in working capital reflected uses of cash of $94.1 million driven by the timing of
inventory purchases, payments for accrued expenses and collections of accounts receivables.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $235.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to net cash used in investing activities of $113.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The net cash flows used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30,
2016 was comprised of capital expenditures totaling $111.8 million, expenditures for refinery
turnarounds of $106.6 million, expenditures for other assets of $21.3 million, cash consideration
of $98.3 million used to fund the PBFX Plains Assets Purchase, and a final net working capital
settlement of $2.7 million associated with the the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery, partially
offset by $98.1 million of net maturities of marketable securities and $6.9 million of proceeds from
sale of assets. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was
comprised of capital expenditures totaling $224.1 million, expenditures for refinery turnarounds of
$22.9 million and expenditures for other assets of $5.4 million, partially offset by $138.1 million in
proceeds from the sale of railcars and $0.7 million of net maturities of marketable securities.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $488.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $21.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing
activities consisted of proceeds from the Revolving Loan of $550.0 million, net proceeds from the
PBFX Revolver of $68.5 million and net proceeds from issuance of PBFX common units of $51.6
million, partially offset by distributions and dividends of $76.5 million, repayment of the PBFX
Term Loan of $98.3 million and repayments of the Rail Facility of $7.0 million. For the six months
ended June 30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds
from the issuance of the PBFX Senior Notes of $350.0 million and net proceeds from the Rail
Facility of $6.1 million, partially offset by distributions and dividends of $70.8 million, $251.3
million of net repayments of PBFX revolver and term loan borrowings, purchases of our Class A
common stock of $4.0 million and $8.1 million for deferred financing and other costs.
57
Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, PBF Energy's total liquidity was approximately $1,868.5 million, compared
to total liquidity of approximately $1,544.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Total liquidity is the
sum of our cash and cash equivalents plus the amount of availability under the Revolving Loan.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, PBFX had approximately $263.4 million and
$298.5 million, respectively, of borrowing capacity under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility
which is available to fund working capital, acquisitions, distributions and capital expenditures
and for other general corporate purposes.
In addition, PBF Energy had borrowing capacity of $39.5 and $82.5 million under the Rail Facility
to fund the acquisition of Eligible Railcars as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Working Capital
Working capital for PBF Energy at June 30, 2016 was $2,030.5 million, consisting of $3,932.0
million in total current assets and $1,901.5 million in total current liabilities. Working capital at
December 31, 2015 was $1,526.5 million, consisting of $3,022.0 million in total current assets
and $1,495.5 million in total current liabilities. As of June 30, 2016, our Cash and cash
equivalents included $998.5 million of cash held in an escrow account for the Torrance
Acquisition which was partially funded by borrowings under our Revolving Loan which are not
included in current liabilities.
Capital Spending
Net capital spending was $333.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which primarily
included turnaround costs, safety related enhancements, facility improvements at the refineries,
the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase and the final working capital settlement associated with the
Chalmette Acquisition. We currently expect to spend an aggregate of approximately between
$500.0 to $525.0 million in net capital expenditures during 2016 for facility improvements and
refinery maintenance and turnarounds.
As noted in “Business Developments”, on July 1, 2016 we acquired the Torrance refinery and
related logistic assets. The purchase price for the Torrance Acquisition was $537.5 million in
cash, plus preliminary working capital of $460.9 million, which is subject to final valuation within
ninety days of closing. The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand
including proceeds from our October 2015 Equity Offering and the 2023 Senior Secured Notes
offering and borrowings under the Company's existing Revolving Loan.
Share Repurchases
On August 19, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
$200.0 million of our Class A common stock (the “Repurchase Program”). On October 29, 2014,
the Board of Directors approved an additional $100.0 million increase to the existing Repurchase
Program. The Repurchase Program expires on September 30, 2016. No repurchases of the
Company's Class A common stock were made during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
From the inception of the Repurchase Program through June 30, 2016, the Company has
purchased approximately 6.05 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock under the
Repurchase Program for $150.8 million through open market transactions. The Company
currently has the ability to purchase approximately an additional $149.2 million in common stock
under the approved Repurchase Program.
These repurchases may be made from time to time through various methods, including open
market transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated
transactions or otherwise, certain of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-
18 plans. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors,
including price, capital availability, legal requirements and economic and market conditions. The
Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the Repurchase Program, and
repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
58
Crude and Feedstock Supply Agreements
We previously acquired crude oil for our Delaware City refinery under a supply agreement
whereby Statoil generally purchased the crude oil requirements for the refinery on our behalf and
under our direction. Our agreement with Statoil for Delaware City was terminated effective
December 31, 2015, at which time we began to fully source Delaware City's crude oil and
feedstocks independently. Additionally, for our purchases of crude oil under our agreement with
Saudi Aramco, similar to our purchases of other foreign waterborne crudes, we post letters of
credit and arrange for shipment. We pay for the crude when we are invoiced and the letters of
credit have been lifted.
We have crude and feedstock supply agreements with PDVSA to supply 40,000 to 60,000 bpd of
crude oil that can be processed at any of our East and Gulf Coast refineries.
Inventory Intermediation Agreements
We entered into two separate Inventory Intermediation Agreements (the "Intermediation
Agreements") with J. Aron & Company ("J. Aron") on June 26, 2013, which commenced upon the
termination of the product offtake agreements with MSCG. On May 29, 2015, we entered into
amended and restated inventory intermediation agreements (the "A&R Intermediation
Agreements") with J. Aron pursuant to which certain terms of the existing inventory intermediation
agreements were amended, including, among other things, pricing and an extension of the term
for a period of two years from the original expiry date of July 1, 2015, subject to certain early
termination rights. In addition, the A&R Intermediation Agreements include one-year renewal
clauses by mutual consent of both parties.
Pursuant to each A&R Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron will continue to purchase and hold title
to certain of the intermediate and finished products (the "Products") produced by the Paulsboro
and Delaware City refineries (the "Refineries"), respectively, and delivered into tanks at the
refineries. Furthermore, J. Aron agrees to sell the Products back to the Refineries as the Products
are discharged out of the Refineries' tanks. J. Aron has the right to store the Products purchased
in tanks under the A&R Intermediation Agreements and will retain these storage rights for the
term of the agreements. PBF Holding will continue to market and sell independently to third
parties.
At June 30, 2016, the LIFO value of intermediates and finished products owned by J. Aron
included within inventory on our balance sheet was $371.0 million. We accrue a corresponding
liability for such intermediates and finished products.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2016, other than outstanding letters
of credit in the amount of approximately $424.5 million and operating leases.
Tax Receivable Agreement Obligations
We expect that the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreement will be
substantial. As of June 30, 2016, we have recognized a liability for the tax receivable agreement
of $661.4 million reflecting our estimate of the undiscounted amounts that we expect to pay under
the agreement due to exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy's Class A
common stock that occurred prior to that date, and to range over the next five years from
approximately $37.5 million to $56.6 million per year and decline thereafter. In addition, under
certain circumstances, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated
and determined based on certain assumptions set forth therein. Assuming that the market value
of a share of our Class A common stock equals $23.78 per share (the closing price on June 30,
2016) and that LIBOR were to be 1.85%, we estimate as of June 30, 2016 that the aggregate
amount of these accelerated payments would have been approximately $596.4 million if
triggered immediately on such date. These payment obligations are obligations of PBF Energy
and not of PBF LLC or any of its subsidiaries including PBF Holding or PBFX. However,
because PBF Energy is a holding company with no operations of its own, PBF Energy's ability to
make payments under the tax receivable agreement is dependent upon a number of factors,
including its subsidiaries' ability to make distributions for the benefit of PBF LLC's members,
including PBF Energy, its ability, if necessary, to finance its obligations under the
59
tax receivable agreement and existing indebtedness which may limit PBF Energy's subsidiaries'
ability to make distributions.
Future payments under the tax receivable agreement by us in respect of subsequent exchanges
of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy's Class A common stock would be in
addition to the amounts above and are expected to be substantial. The foregoing numbers are
merely estimates - the actual payments could differ materially and assume that there is no
material changes in the relevant tax law, and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all
tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement. It is possible that future transactions
or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding tax
receivable agreement payments.
Dividend and Distribution Policy
PBF Energy
With respect to dividends and distributions paid during the six months ended June 30, 2016, PBF
LLC made aggregate non-tax quarterly distributions of $0.60 per unit to its members, of which
$58.7 million was distributed to PBF Energy and the balance was distributed to its other
members. PBF Energy used this $58.7 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $0.30 per share
of Class A common stock on March 8, 2016 and May 13, 2016.
On July 29, 2016, the Company announced a dividend of $0.30 per share on outstanding Class
A common stock. The dividend is payable on August 23, 2016 to Class A common stockholders
of record at the close of business on August 9, 2016. PBF LLC intends to make pro-rata
distributions of $0.30 per unit to its members, including PBF Energy. PBF Energy will then use
this distribution to fund the dividend payments to the shareholders of PBF Energy.
PBF Energy currently intends to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of Class A
common stock. The declaration, amount and payment of this and any other future dividends on
shares of Class A common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and we
are not obligated under any applicable laws, our governing documents or any contractual
agreements with our existing owners or otherwise to declare or pay any dividends or other
distributions (other than the obligations of PBF LLC to make tax distributions to its members).
As of June 30, 2016, PBF Energy had $1,765.8 million of unused borrowing availability, which
includes PBF Holding cash and cash equivalents of $1,310.2 million, under the Revolving Loan
to fund its operations, if necessary. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2016, there was sufficient cash
and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities available to make
distributions to PBF LLC, if necessary, in order for PBF LLC to make pro-rata distributions to its
members, including PBF Energy, necessary to fund in excess of one year’s cash dividend
payments by PBF Energy. PBF Holding would have been permitted under its debt agreements to
make these distributions; however, their ability to continue to comply with their debt covenants is,
to a significant degree, subject to its operating results, which are dependent on a number of
factors outside of our control. We believe our and our subsidiaries' available cash and cash
equivalents, other sources of liquidity to operate our business and operating performance
provides us with a reasonable basis for our assessment that we can support our intended
dividend and distribution policy.
PBF Logistics LP
PBFX intends to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of at least $0.30 per unit per quarter, or
$1.20 per unit on an annualized basis, which aggregates to approximately $11.4 million per
quarter or $45.6 million per year, based on the current number of common and subordinated units
outstanding. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, PBFX made a quarterly cash
distribution totaling $31.1 million of which $16.5 million was distributed to PBF LLC and the
balance was distributed to its public unit holders.
On July 29, 2016, the Board of Directors of PBFX's general partner, PBF GP, declared a
distribution of $0.43 per unit on outstanding common and subordinated units of PBFX. The
distribution is payable on August 23, 2016 to PBFX common and subordinated unit holders of
record at the close of business on August 9, 2016.
60
As of June 30, 2016, PBFX had $3.6 million outstanding letters of credit and $263.4 million
available under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility and cash and cash equivalents of $49.9
million to fund its operations, if necessary. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2016, there was sufficient
cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities available to PBFX
to make distributions to unit holders.
61
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates. Our
primary commodity price risk is associated with the difference between the prices we sell our
refined products and the prices we pay for crude oil and other feedstocks. We may use derivative
instruments to manage the risks from changes in the prices of crude oil and refined products,
natural gas, interest rates, or to capture market opportunities.
Commodity Price Risk
Our earnings, cash flow and liquidity are significantly affected by a variety of factors beyond our
control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products and
natural gas. The supply of and demand for these commodities depend on, among other factors,
changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political
affairs, planned and unplanned downtime in refineries, pipelines and production facilities,
production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive and alternative fuels,
and the extent of government regulation. As a result, the prices of these commodities can be
volatile. Our revenues fluctuate significantly with movements in industry refined product prices,
our cost of sales fluctuates significantly with movements in crude oil and feedstock prices and our
operating expenses fluctuate with movements in the price of natural gas. We manage our
exposure to these commodity price risks through our supply and offtake agreements as well as
through the use of various commodity derivative instruments.
We may use non-trading derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risks
associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and feedstocks, finished products and natural
gas outside of our supply and offtake agreements. The derivative instruments we use include
physical commodity contracts and exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial instruments.
We mark-to-market our commodity derivative instruments and recognize the changes in their fair
value in our statements of operations.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had gross open commodity derivative contracts
representing 36.3 million barrels and 44.2 million barrels, respectively, with an unrealized net
gain of $14.5 million and $46.1 million, respectively. The open commodity derivative contracts as
of June 30, 2016 expire at various times during 2016.
We carry inventories of crude oil, intermediates and refined products (“hydrocarbon inventories”)
on our balance sheet, the values of which are subject to fluctuations in market prices. Our
hydrocarbon inventories totaled approximately 24.1 million barrels and 26.8 million barrels at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The average cost of our hydrocarbon
inventories was approximately $88.97 and $83.55 per barrel on a LIFO basis at June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, excluding the net impact of LCM adjustments of
approximately $900.5 million and $1,117.3 million, respectively. If market prices of our inventory
decline to a level below our average cost, we may be required to further write down the carrying
value of our hydrocarbon inventories to market.
Our predominant variable operating cost is energy, which is comprised primarily of natural gas
and electricity. We are therefore sensitive to movements in natural gas prices. Assuming normal
operating conditions, we annually consume a total of approximately 52 million MMBTUs of
natural gas amongst our four refineries as of June 30, 2016. Accordingly, a $1.00 per MMBTU
change in natural gas prices would increase or decrease our natural gas costs by approximately
$52 million.
Compliance Program Price Risk
We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of Renewable Identification
Numbers (“RINs”) required to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Our overall RINs
obligation is based on a percentage of our domestic shipments of on-road fuels as established by
the EPA. To the degree we are unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy our
RINs obligation, we must purchase RINs on the open market. To mitigate the impact of this risk
on our results of operations and cash flows we may purchase RINs when the price of these
instruments is deemed favorable.
62
Interest Rate Risk
The maximum availability under our Revolving Loan is $2.64 billion. Borrowings under the
Revolving Loan bear interest either at the Alternative Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin or at
the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, all as defined in the Revolving Loan. The
Applicable Margin ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% for Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loans and from 0.50%
to 1.25% for Alternative Base Rate Loans, depending on the Company's debt rating. If this facility
were fully drawn, a one percent change in the interest rate would increase or decrease our
interest expense by approximately $26.4 million annually.
The PBFX Revolving Credit Facility and the PBFX Term Loan which bear interest at a variable
rate and expose us to interest rate risk. A 1.0% change in the interest rate associated with the
borrowings outstanding under these facilities would result in a $3.9 million change in our interest
expense, assuming we were to borrow all $360.0 million available under our PBFX Revolving
Credit Facility and the outstanding balance of our PBFX Term Loan was $135.9 million.
In addition, the Rail Facility bears interest at a variable rate and exposes us to interest rate risk.
Maximum availability under the Rail Facility as of June 30, 2016 was $100.0 million. A 1.0%
change in the interest rate associated with the borrowings outstanding under this facility would
result in a $1.0 million change in our interest expense, assuming the $100.0 million available
under the Rail Facility were fully drawn.
We also have interest rate exposure in connection with our A&R Intermediation Agreements
under which we pay a time value of money charge based on LIBOR.
Credit Risk
We are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our
counterparties. We will continue to closely monitor the creditworthiness of customers to whom we
grant credit and establish credit limits in accordance with our credit policy.
63
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
PBF Energy maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information which is required to be disclosed is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including PBF Energy's
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of our system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of June 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, PBF
Energy's principal executive officer and the principal financial officer have concluded that PBF
Energy's disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
On November 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Chalmette Refining. We are in the
process of integrating Chalmette Refining's operations, including internal controls over financial
reporting and, therefore, management's evaluation and conclusion as to the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q excludes any evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of
Chalmette Refining. We expect the integration of Chalmette Refining's operations, including
internal controls over financial reporting to be complete in the year ending December 31, 2016.
Chalmette Refining accounts for 6% of the Company's total assets and 27% of total revenues of
the Company as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Management has not identified any other changes in PBF Energy's internal controls over
financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.
64
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
On July 24, 2013, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control
(“DNREC”) issued a Notice of Administrative Penalty Assessment and Secretary’s Order to
Delaware City Refining for alleged air emission violations that occurred during the re-start of the
refinery in 2011 and subsequent to the re-start. The penalty assessment seeks $460,200 in
penalties and $69,030 in cost recovery for DNREC’s expenses associated with investigation of
the incidents. We dispute the amount of the penalty assessment and allegations made in the
order, and are in discussions with DNREC to resolve the assessment. It is possible that DNREC
will assess a penalty in this matter but any such amount is not expected to be material to the
Company.
As of November 1, 2015, the Company acquired Chalmette Refining, which was in discussions
with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) to resolve self-reported
deviations from refinery operations relating to certain Clean Air Act Title V permit conditions,
limits and other requirements. LDEQ commenced an enforcement action against Chalmette
Refining on November 14, 2014 by issuing a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of
Potential Penalty (the “Order”) covering deviations from 2009 and 2010. Chalmette Refining and
LDEQ subsequently entered into a dispute resolution agreement, the enforcement of which has
been suspended while negotiations are ongoing, which may include the resolution of deviations
outside the periods covered by the Order. It is possible that LDEQ will assess an administrative
penalty against Chalmette Refining, but any such amount is not expected to be material to the
Company.
In late 2015, the EPA initiated enforcement proceedings against companies it believes produced
invalid RINs. We purchased RINs to satisfy a portion of our obligations under the Renewable
Fuels Standard program for calendar year 2012 and had purchased some RINs the EPA
considered invalid. We continue to purchase RINs to satisfy our obligations under the RFS
program, and on April 11, 2016, PBF Holding Company LLC was notified by the EPA that the
EPA’s records indicated that PBF Holding used potentially invalid RINs generated by one of the
companies. The EPA directed PBF Holding to resubmit reports to remove the potentially invalid
RINs and to replace the invalid RINs with valid RINs with the same D Code. The Company has
retired the invalid RINs and on May 6, 2016, the counterparty who sold the RINs to the Company
replaced the RINs. The counterparty has also agreed to indemnify the Company for certain
penalties to the extent imposed by the EPA. On July 28, 2016, the Company and the EPA
entered an Administrative Settlement Agreement to resolve the matter which requires the
payment of a $250,000 penalty. The Company expects to be reimbursed by the counterparty for
this penalty under the indemnification agreement. In any event, the penalty is not expected to
have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following risk factors supplement and/or update the risk factors previously disclosed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015:
Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry
We may not be able to successfully integrate the Chalmette Refinery or the Torrance Refinery
into our business, or realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.
Following the completion of the Chalmette and Torrance Acquisitions, the integration of these
businesses into our operations may be a complex and time-consuming process that may not be
successful. Prior to the completion of the Chalmette Acquisition we did not have any operations
in the Gulf Coast and prior to the completion of the Torrance Acquisition we did not have any
operations in the West Coast. This may add complexity to effectively overseeing, integrating and
operating these refineries and related assets. Even if we successfully integrate these businesses
into our operations, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits and
operating synergies. Our estimates regarding the earnings, operating cash flow, capital
expenditures and liabilities resulting from these acquisitions may prove to be incorrect. These
acquisitions involve risks, including:
•unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired operations;
challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our
•
operations;
65
•
•
•diversion of management time and attention from our existing business;
liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities and
greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental, safety or
other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results; and
the incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating
to acquired assets.
In connection with our recently completed Chalmette and Torrance acquisitions, we did not have
access to all of the type of historical financial information that we may require regarding the prior
operation of the refineries. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to evaluate the probable
impact of these significant acquisitions on our financial performance until we have operated the
acquired refineries for a substantial period of time.
Regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital and
operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.
Both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases ("GHG"), such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to:
(i) establish a cap and trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or “clean” energy
standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources,
and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in
energy supply and use. In addition, the EPA is taking steps to regulate GHGs under the existing
federal Clean Air Act (the "CAA"). The EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions
of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary
sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission
sources, including refineries. These and similar regulations could require us to incur costs to
monitor and report GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations.
In addition, various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken
steps to control GHG emissions, including adoption of GHG reporting requirements, cap and
trade systems and renewable portfolio standards. Efforts have also been undertaken to delay,
limit or prohibit EPA and possibly state action to regulate GHG emissions, and it is not possible
at this time to predict the ultimate form, timing or extent of federal or state regulation. In the event
we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions, we may
not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Such requirements also could
adversely affect demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce. Any increased costs
or reduced demand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operation.
In addition, in certain states multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse
gas and other emissisons are in various phases of consideration or implementation.
Requirements to reduce emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our
facilities as well as implement and manage new emission controls and programs put in place.
For example, Assembly Bill 32 requires the state to reduce its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by
2020. Two regulations implemented to achieve this goal are Cap-and-Trade and the Low Carbon
Fuel Standard (“LCFS”). In 2012, the California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) implemented Cap-
and-Trade. This program currently places a cap on GHGs and we are required to acquire a
sufficient number of credits to cover emissions from our refineries and our in-state sales of
gasoline and diesel. In 2009, CARB adopted the LCFS, which requires a 10% reduction in the
carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel by 2020. Compliance is achieved through blending lower
carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits. Compliance with each
of these programs is facilitated through a market-based credit system. If sufficient credits are
unavailable for purchase or we are unable to pass through costs to our customers, we have to
pay a higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligations,
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Exchange of PBF LLC Series A Units to Class A Common Stock
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, no PBF LLC Series A Units were exchanged for
shares of our Class A common stock in transactions exempt from registration under Section 4(2)
of the Securities Act. We received no other consideration in connection with any exchanges. No
exchanges were made by any of our directors or current executive officers.
Share Repurchase Program
On August 19, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
$200.0 million of the Company's Class A common stock (as amended from time to time, the
"Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program expires on September 30, 2016. In addition,
on October 29, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved an additional $100.0 million
increase to the existing Repurchase Program. These repurchases may be made from time to time
through various methods, including open market transactions, block trades, accelerated share
repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, certain of which may be effected
through Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 plans. The timing and number of shares repurchased will
depend on a variety of factors, including price, capital availability, legal requirements and
economic and market conditions. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under
the Repurchase Program, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time
without prior notice.
There were no repurchases of the Company's Class A Common Stock during the second quarter
of 2016. For the period of time from the inception of the Repurchase Program through June 30,
2016, the Company purchased 6,050,717 shares for $150.8 million. As of June 30, 2016, the
Company had $149.2 million remaining authorization under the Repurchase Program.
