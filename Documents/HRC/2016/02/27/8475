<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Jorge Bustamante, 
conducted an official visit to Japan from 23 to 31 March 2010, where he visited Tokyo, 
Nagoya, Toyota and Hamamatsu. 
</p>
<p> While recognizing that Japan has taken some measures for the protection of 
migrants, in particular to alleviate the impact of the recent economic crisis on them, the 
Special Rapporteur noted that a wide range of challenges are still to be addressed. In 
addition, the integration of migrants in the society is not part of the country&#8217;s central 
Government policy, which essentially focuses on border control. 
</p>
<p> In this context, the Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations to the 
Government, including the need to address the persistence of racial discrimination and 
xenophobia and the lack of legislation that manifestly prohibits these conducts, the 
exploitation of migrants in the labour sector, the lack of interventions by the judiciary and 
police to protect migrants&#8217; rights, the strict policy of detention and deportation of irregular 
migrants, the difficulties for migrant children to access education either in Japanese or 
foreign schools, and the overall lack of a comprehensive immigration policy that respects 
the human rights of migrants and ensures their integration into the Japanese society.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Jorge Bustamante, 
conducted an official visit to Japan from 23 to 31 March 2010 at the invitation of the 
Government. In Tokyo, Nagoya, Toyota and Hamamatsu, the Special Rapporteur met with 
ministers, officials of central and local governments, international organizations, lawyers, 
schoolteachers, academics, members of civil society organizations and migrant women and 
men, and their children. He also visited the Higashi-Nihon Immigration Centre in Ushiku 
and foreign schools and met with migrants&#8217; associations.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government for its 
cooperation and to the various organizations that provided support for his mission, in 
particular the International Organization for Migration and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background: the migration phenomenon in Japan 
</b></p>
<p>3. At the end of 2009, the number of registered foreign residents in Japan was 
2,186,121, which amounts to 1.71 per cent of the country&#8217;s total population of 127.5 
million. While the number of registered foreign residents decreased by 0.03 per cent from 
the end of 2008, it has been on the rise since 1999. Chinese nationals are the largest foreign 
community (680,518) residing in Japan, followed by South and North Koreans (578,495), 
Brazilians (267,456), Filipinos (211,716) and Peruvians (57,464).1 The number of migrants 
in Japan is extremely low compared to other industrialized countries: 13.5 per cent in the 
United States of America, 13.1 per cent in Germany, 10.7 per cent in France and 7.4 per 
cent in Italy.2 
</p>
<p>4. In Japan, migrants are referred to as either &#8220;old comers&#8221; or &#8220;newcomers&#8221;. &#8220;Old 
comers&#8221; are mainly Chinese and Koreans, and their descendants, who came (or were forced 
to come) to Japan before or during the Second World War and remained after the end of the 
war. &#8220;Newcomers&#8221; refers to those who migrated to Japan more recently, mainly since the 
1980s. 
</p>
<p>5. In the late 1970s, Indo-Chinese from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia sought asylum in 
neighbouring countries, including Japan. In the 1980s and 1990s, owing to the economic 
boom in Japan and the difficulty for domestic companies to secure workers, the number of 
migrant workers increased significantly, mainly originating from South-East Asia and Latin 
America. The major amendment to the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act 
in 1990 allowed the Japanese descendents (up to the third generation) to acquire the long-
term residential status without restrictions on employment in Japan. Owing to a strict 
migration policy which did not provide for a wide range of avenues for labour migration, 
however, many migrant workers entered with a short-term visa or under the residential 
status of entertainers or trainees, and became &#8220;overstayers&#8221;. As of January 2010, the 
estimated total number of irregular migrants in Japan is 110,000, owing to the vigorous 
nationwide track-down measures implemented over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>6. The considerable increase of migrants in Japan in the 1980s and 1990s generated 
challenges with regard to their access to social services, health, housing, children&#8217;s 
education, fair conditions of employment and their participation and integration into local

</p>
<p>communities. Many of these issues have only received insufficient attention to date. In 
addition, these problems have been exacerbated by the economic downturn in 2008 that has 
severely and often inequitably impacted migrants. 
</p>
<p>7. With regard to refugees, since the ratification of the 1951 Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees in 1981, the legislation provides for the recognition of refugees and 
granting of refugees status. However, in practice the Government is very reluctant to 
recognize refugees: in 2009, only 30 asylum-seekers were granted refugee status, while 501 
where given a permission to stay for humanitarian reasons. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework for the protection of 
the human rights of migrants  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The international legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Japan is party to a number of core international human rights treaties, in particular 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It also 
ratified the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its Protocol. 
</p>
<p>9. Japan is yet to ratify: the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (hereinafter &#8220;Migrant Workers 
Convention&#8221;); or the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by 
Land, Sea and Air (both of which supplement the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, also not ratified), the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, and the ILO Conventions No. 97 concerning Migration for Employment 
and No. 143 concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion of Equality 
of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers. The Optional Protocols to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities are also yet to be ratified by Japan.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The national legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policy and legislation 
</b></p>
<p>10. As outlined in the report it submitted in 2008 to the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination, Japanese policy regarding foreign workers provides that &#8220;the 
acceptance of foreign workers in professional and technical fields should be more actively 
promoted. On the other hand, with respect to the matter of accepting workers for so-called 
unskilled labour, there is a concern that the Japanese economy and society as well as 
people&#8217;s livelihood may be adversely affected by such an [acceptance of unskilled 
labour].&#8221;3 The Government concludes that &#8220;based on the aforementioned policy, in 
</p>
<p>  
 3 &#8220;Ninth Basic Plan of Employment Measures&#8221;, adopted by the Cabinet in August 1999 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>principle, no foreigner is permitted to enter the country to engage in unskilled labour&#8221;. 
However, there has been a need for unskilled labour in recent years, which has not been 
sufficiently met by the immigration of persons of Japanese descent and the employment of 
foreign trainees and technical interns. Therefore, a considerable number of migrants have 
entered Japan with a short-term visa and have overstayed it, working in Japan as irregular 
migrants.  
</p>
<p>11. The Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act (1951) (hereinafter the 
&#8220;Immigration Control Act&#8221;) is the main legislation regulating migration in Japan. It 
regulates the entry, stay and deportation of migrants in accordance with the policy outlined 
above. In 1989, under an increasing pressure to fill in labour shortages, the Government 
revised the Immigration Control Act to allow descendants (up to the third generation) of 
Japanese emigrants to apply for a long-residence permit in Japan.  These non-nationals of 
Japanese descent are commonly called &#8220;Nikkeijin&#8221;. The vast majority of &#8220;Nikkeijin&#8221; are 
from Brazil and Peru, where their ancestors had emigrated at the beginning of the twentieth 
century. This slight opening up of the migration policy has been criticized as being racially 
discriminatory, since it substantially limited the acceptance of foreigners to those of 
Japanese descent.  
</p>
<p>12. In 1990, the Government established another mechanism, the Industrial Training and 
Technical Internship Programme, under which trainees and interns from developing 
countries come to Japan with a view to learning skills and working under a training 
framework. As discussed later, there are many reports of serious abuses linked to this 
programme.  
</p>
<p>13. As a result of these policies, from 1990 to 2008, the number of migrants from Brazil 
and Peru, including &#8220;Nikkeijin&#8221;, increased from 71,000 to 370,000. Based on statistics 
provided by the Ministry of Labour, the number of foreign workers totaled 562,818 in 
October 2009. The number of trainees and technical interns working in Japan reached 
around 200,000 in 2008. Out of these, trainees, of whom there were 86,826 in 2008, are not 
included in the legal definition of &#8220;worker&#8221; and thus not counted for as &#8220;workers&#8221; since 
they are under a training regime.  
</p>
<p>14. While this opening up of the migration policy and the related increase of migrants 
generated considerable needs in terms of social welfare, medical care, education, housing 
and community life, the revision of the law did not include the establishment of a 
comprehensive policy aimed at recognizing and implementing the rights and welfare of 
migrants in these fields. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur also notes media reports that 
Japan has not pursued policy measures to attract migrant workers to address its labour 
shortage and to ensure their welfare and integration in the Japanese society.4 The current 
Government, before gaining power in 2009, had campaigned for the strengthening of these 
rights and the adoption of a comprehensive immigration policy. However, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that, since then, no action has been taken.   
</p>
<p>15. Finally, there is no legislation in Japan that manifestly prohibits and punishes racial 
discrimination. Various United Nations bodies, in particular the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination5 and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,6 have urged Japan to

</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>adopt such legislation. As noted by these experts, the absence of domestic legislation often 
precludes victims of racial discrimination from seeking judicial remedies, particularly 
against the State. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Institutional structure 
</b></p>
<p>16. Various ministries have responsibilities with regard to migration: the Ministry of 
Justice (immigration control), the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (social welfare 
and employment), the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 
(education), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (consular issues) and the Ministry of Economy, 
Trade and Industry (skilled migrant workers). The Cabinet Secretariat and the Cabinet 
Office are in charge of coordination among these ministries. However, the Special 
Rapporteur notes some stakeholders&#8217; views that such coordination lacks effectiveness since 
the Cabinet Office enjoys neither sufficient power nor budget over the ministries involved 
and is therefore not in a position to effectively coordinate their work. 
</p>
<p>17. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the dissemination of United 
Nations bodies&#8217; decisions is not effective within the governmental structure. He observed 
that various ministries had no knowledge of the recommendations made to Japan by various 
United Nations human rights bodies.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Local level 
</b></p>
<p>18. In the absence of an integration policy at the national level, it is mostly at the 
municipal level that action has been taken for the promotion of migrants&#8217; rights. In 2001, at 
the initiative of the city of Hamamatsu, the Council of Municipalities with a High 
Concentration of Foreign Residents was established to identify solutions to common 
concerns which arose out of the increase of migrants in the 1990s. The Council adopted the 
Hamamatsu Declaration in October 2001, which calls for &#8220;the establishment of a truly 
symbiotic society based on respect of right and fulfilment of duties &#8230; and respect for each 
other&#8217;s cultures and values between Japanese and foreign residents&#8221;.7 It refers to the 
intention of these municipalities to promote a multicultural integration policy. Initially 
formed by 13 cities, it is now a forum where 27 municipalities gather to discuss how to 
better address the needs of migrants. Municipalities part of this initiative include Nagoya, 
Toyota, Hamamatsu, Tokyo, Osaka and Yokohama.   
</p>
<p>19. In addition to being a forum where municipal policies are discussed and evaluated, 
the Council makes efforts to influence the national Government, conscious that the 
problems faced by municipalities can only be resolved with drastic reforms and 
policymaking in terms of education and social security at the national level. In October 
2008, the Council issued a declaration calling on the Government to form a new agency to 
comprehensively deal with immigration policies and increase efforts to strengthen Japanese 
language education.  
</p>
<p>20. In 2006, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications published the Plan for 
the Promotion of Multicultural Coexistence, to encourage local governments to establish 
their own rule for multicultural coexistence.8

</b></p>
<p><b> IV.  Good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Support measures for education of migrant children 
</b></p>
<p>21. Because of the Japanese language barrier, many migrant children have entered 
private foreign or &#8220;ethnic&#8221; schools, while others, who can neither access Japanese schools 
nor foreign private schools because of the costs, are out of school.  
</p>
<p>22. Recognizing that migrant children&#8217;s education was in a worrying state, the 
Government recently started to provide some assistance to migrant children with difficulties 
in adapting to the Japanese language and culture. The Government adopted the immediate 
short-term support measures for foreign residents in Japan in January 2009.9 It launched a 
set of educational measures, such as: provision of bilingual support staff for teaching 
Japanese to children and liaising with parents; preparatory classes for children before they 
enrol in schools; designation of schools for the enrolment of foreign students; appointment 
of staff from NGOs as &#8220;school promoters&#8221; who approach migrant families with children not 
attending school; increased number of Japanese language teachers for migrant children. 
School enrolment guidebooks have also been prepared by the Ministry of Education in 
seven languages containing information on the Japanese education system and procedures 
for enrolling. They are distributed at schools, boards of education, consulates and 
embassies. 
</p>
<p>23. The Government also launched an emergency short-term programme to teach 
Japanese, and basic subjects required in the Japanese educational system, to those migrant 
children who have had to leave foreign private schools as a result of the economic crisis. 
This project costing 4 billion yen and lasting 3 years managed by the International 
Organization for Migration has financed the &#8220;Rainbow Bridge Classrooms&#8221; for migrant 
children to study Japanese and other subjects so that they can then transfer more smoothly 
to Japanese free public schools. This programme also promotes integration by organizing 
cultural activities with local communities.10  
</p>
<p>24. Since policies at the national level are mainly ad hoc and short-term, some 
municipalities have taken the initiative to offer support to migrant children&#8217;s education. The 
city of Hamamatsu, with more than 32,000 migrants, has a population of nearly 20,000 
Brazilians, which is the largest among the Japanese municipalities. The municipality offers 
what it calls a &#8220;Diversified Educational Environment for Foreign Children&#8221;. It offers 
Japanese language support as well as support and tutoring in various languages to allow 
children enrolled in Japanese schools to become accustomed and integrated into Japanese 
school life. It also gives support to foreign schools, which are seen as playing an important 
role in the education of migrant children. Finally, it promotes education that fosters an 
intercultural understanding in primary and junior high school. 
</p>
<p>25. Concerning adult education, several municipalities have taken initiatives to provide 
Japanese-language learning opportunities. In Toyota, the municipality established a fund to 
which companies hiring many migrant workers contribute as part of their corporate 
responsibility. This fund, in which the Toyota Group participates, finances Japanese classes 
for adults. However, following the financial crisis, contributions have decreased 
considerably. At the prefectural level, a similar fund has also been created, where

</p>
<p>companies contribute to hiring Japanese teachers for children of their migrant workers, with 
the contribution by the workers and the prefecture. However, these initiatives are limited to 
the Aichi Prefecture, while, according to municipalities, there is a need for these initiatives 
to be institutionalized across the country.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Assistance in seeking employment 
</b></p>
<p>26. Labour policies are the prerogative of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour. 
Before the economic crisis, the Ministry had some measures in place in order to support 
migrant workers through the public employment offices (called &#8220;Hello Work&#8221;). In addition 
to the services provided to all workers such as the payment of unemployment benefits, the 
545 &#8220;Hello Work&#8221; offices nationwide provide a number of interpreters to assist migrants 
seeking a job, and training sessions to private companies on migrants&#8217; rights with regard to 
pension benefits and labour and social insurance. Owing to the severe impact of the 
economic crisis at the end of 2008 which particularly affected migrant workers, the 
Ministry adopted new measures to deal with the large number of migrant workers who 
approached the &#8220;Hello Work&#8221; offices. It placed more interpreters and counsellors in these 
offices, and established counselling and assistance centres especially dedicated to them in 
regions with a very high number of migrants. For example, in Hamamatsu, as the number 
of migrant workers who came to the offices rose from 200 to 1,614 in February 2009, three 
more offices were established, in addition to the three existing ones: two of them are 
dedicated exclusively to migrants. While the rate of employment found through the &#8220;Hello 
Work&#8221; office in Hamamatsu was 6.9 per cent in February 2009, it rose to 27.8 per cent in 
January 2010, compared to the general rate of employment in Hamamatsu of 21.4 per cent 
for the same month.11        
</p>
<p>27. Nationwide, the number of &#8220;Hello Work&#8221; offices with interpreters rose from 73 in 
2008 to 126 in 2009, and the hours of interpretation rose from 712 to 4,698 per week. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government also funds free training programmes which last around three 
months, targeting around 5,000 migrant workers of Japanese descent and aimed at 
strengthening their communication skills, including Japanese, providing basic knowledge of 
labour legislation and practice in Japan, and guidance on the preparation of resumes and 
interviews. While this is a good initiative, it is of concern that this programme is limited to 
migrants of Japanese descent and is not available to all migrants in need. 
</p>
<p>29. Finally, for those migrant workers who, affected by the recent economic crisis and 
unable to find employment, wish to return to their country, the Government offers the 
provision of financial and other assistance for their return, although this measure has been 
controversial. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Promotion of cultural exchange 
</b></p>
<p>30. With the aim of promoting cultural exchanges and better mutual understanding, a 
number of local municipalities and NGOs organize or support cultural events on a regular 
basis. For instance, Hamamatsu provides assistance to both foreign and Japanese cultural 
groups for the organization of cultural events, such as the Hamamatsu Samba festival.  
</p>
<p>31. Toyota also holds two festivals annually: the Brazilian Festival and the Sticky Rice 
Festival, where the national and migrant communities celebrate together. It also created a

<p><b> D. Proposed new migration policy  
</b></p>
<p>32. In June 2008, the political party in power at the time submitted the Draft Migration 
Policy Framework to the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office, aiming at presenting a draft migration 
bill in the 2009 Diet session, which bill was not adopted due to the change of Government 
that took place in 2009. The major points of the proposed policy were: 
</p>
<p> (a) Promotion of multicultural coexistence and the integration of migrants 
through comprehensive measures of social integration; 
</p>
<p> (b) Creation of an agency for migration, responsible for managing migration 
control, nationality and social integration measures; 
</p>
<p> (c) Abolishment of the Trainees and Technical Interns Programme, replacing it 
with an Employment Programme; 
</p>
<p> (d) Partial introduction of nationality based upon <i>jus soli</i>; 
</p>
<p> (e) Promotion of family-based migration; 
</p>
<p> (f) Acceptance of migrants through economic partnership agreements; and  
</p>
<p> (g) Promotion of &#8220;humanitarian migration&#8221;, including third-country resettlement 
of refugees and protection of refugees from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>33. The new Government has not taken these proposals forward. If adopted, these would 
have represented a notable step forward in ensuring respect for migrants&#8217; rights and their 
integration in the host society.   
</p>
<p><b>  V.  Major challenges in the protection of the human rights of 
migrants  
</b></p>
<p>34. Despite some positive measures adopted at the national and local level in recent 
years, the Special Rapporteur found that many challenges remained to be addressed by the 
Government in order to effectively protect the human rights of migrants and their children.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Lack of comprehensive immigration policy  
</b></p>
<p>35. While Japan started receiving migrant workers 20 years ago, it has yet to adopt a 
comprehensive immigration policy that goes beyond managing the entry and stay of 
migrants. It currently lacks a policy that demonstrates a real commitment to eradicate 
discrimination against migrants and provides for long-term programmes designed to create 
necessary conditions for the effective integration of migrants into the Japanese society. 
Presently, only ad hoc provisional measures are implemented to assist certain categories of 
migrants as needs arise. However, migration has become a permanent reality in Japan, as it 
is in all other industrialized countries. As such, there is a critical need for a long-term vision 
and policy that creates conditions which enable migrants to meaningfully exercise their 
rights and potential as productive members of the Japanese society.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Racism and discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur observed that racism and discrimination based on 
nationality are still common in Japan, including in the workplace, schools, housing, the 
justice system and private establishments. Racist and xenophobic discourse, in particular 
against Korean and Chinese communities, is still widespread. Racist groups regularly 
organize demonstrations expressing strong discriminatory ideas against Koreans or 
Chinese, and have perpetrated aggressive acts against them and their properties. Foreigners 
in general have been also openly discriminated against by signs such as &#8220;Japanese only&#8221; 
that prevent foreigners entering establishments open to the general public. Despite several 
judicial complaints, the courts have not recognized the obligation of the Government at all 
levels to prohibit racial discrimination by all appropriate means, including legislation.  
</p>
<p>37. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern that Japan still has not 
adopted national legislation that manifestly prohibits racial discrimination and xenophobia, 
while, since 2001, United Nations bodies urged Japan to do so in order to comply with its 
obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination. Moreover, some of the Government measures seem to have contributed to 
fuelling discriminatory approaches toward migrants. The Action Plan to Create a Crime-
Resistant Society issued by the National Police Agency states that illegal residents are 
likely to commit crimes and therefore a large reduction in their number is necessary to 
provide public safety.12 The Police also reported to the media that the number of crimes 
committed by foreigners had increased, while the statistics included in their White Paper 
confirm that the number of crimes committed by foreigners and brought to the attention of 
the authorities had actually decreased. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The Industrial Trainees and Technical Interns Programme  
</b></p>
<p>38. Under this programme, a person from a developing country can enter Japan as a 
trainee for a year, and then stay as a technical intern for a maximum period of two years. 
While the aim of this programme is to transfer Japanese technology, skills and knowledge 
to workers of developing countries, it is sometimes used by companies to secure cheap, 
exploitative labour. There are around 200,000 trainees and interns in Japan, and the 
majority of them come from China (67.6 per cent in 2008).  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur heard a considerable number of complaints in relation to 
abuses that take place in the framework of this programme. These abuses relate to the 
payment of very low wages or the confiscation of wages which are paid into an account 
controlled by the employer, the obligation to perform excessive and underpaid or unpaid 
overtime, restrictions on freedom of movement and private life, such as limitations in the 
use of phones or mail or in the possibility to leave the place of work and residence. Many 
trainees also pay considerable amounts of money as a &#8220;guarantee&#8221; prior to leaving their 
country and this money is only paid back if they complete the period of training and 
internship. Some receiving organizations confiscate trainees and interns&#8217; passports in order 
to deter them from complaining or escaping. Alternatively, they are forcibly returned when 
they complain about the way they are treated, and they are not given back the deposit they 
had paid upon return. Finally, violence and sexual abuses, including rapes, have been 
reported. Some of these situations amount to slavery or trafficking.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>40. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, since no effective system was in place 
to monitor the situation of trainees and technical interns and offer them protection and 
referral mechanisms, they remained particularly vulnerable and became victims of serious 
abuses.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur notes that the revised Immigration Control Act of July 2009, 
which came into force in July 2010, introduces a number of measures to increase protection 
of trainees. It introduces a new status of &#8220;Technical Intern Training&#8221; and extends the 
applicability of labour laws to trainees. It also obliges receiving companies to provide 
specific on-the-job training to the trainees and prohibits collection of guarantee money by 
dispatching organizations and receiving companies. Furthermore, according to the 
Government, the Labour Standards Inspection Bodies provide more rigorous inspection and 
administrative guidance to receiving companies to ensure their compliance with labour laws 
and regulations. They may refer serious labour law violations for prosecution; 30 such 
cases were reported in 2009. However, the structure of the programme effectively remains 
the same, and does not introduce a mechanism through which trainees can directly have 
access to an effective protection system.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Lack of interventions by the judiciary and police 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur heard recurring complaints about the fact that the judiciary 
does not recognize migrants&#8217; rights under national legislation applicable to the given 
circumstance, but instead favours Japanese nationals. This is the case when Japanese 
companies adopt discriminatory behaviour against migrant workers or when Japanese men 
are violent with their foreign spouse or children. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur was also informed by some migrants that the police in many 
instances refuse to address complaints submitted by migrants or which relate to conflicts 
between migrants, including complaints by foreign women on domestic violence.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Limited access to housing 
</b></p>
<p>44. Discriminatory policies and behaviour by both private individuals and public 
authorities with regard to migrants&#8217; access to housing have been reported to the Special 
Rapporteur. For example, it was reported that the Aichi Prefecture has a policy of limiting 
the access of migrants and their families to a large public housing complex (about 3,000 
inhabitants) called Homigaoka in the periphery of Toyota. The Special Rapporteur regrets 
that the Prefecture decided to limit the number of applications for apartments in this 
housing complex, despite the fact that there are vacancies. This created an unfortunate 
situation where Brazilian families having lost their employment with the economic crisis 
had to leave the companies&#8217; dormitory but had no access to the public housing complex 
which is significantly cheaper than private accommodation in Japan. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Lack of avenues for regularization of irregular migrants  
</b></p>
<p>45. According to statistics provided by the Government, around 90,000 migrants who 
have overstayed their residence permit live in Japan. In addition, another around 20,000 are 
said to have illegally entered in the country.  
</p>
<p>46. Japan has established 27 categories of residence permits, which reflect its policy of 
accepting only migrant workers in professional or technical fields and those with family- or 
blood-based linkage with Japanese nationals, with a few exceptions of specific categories 
such as students, trainees and interns. Out of the categories based on the performance of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>work, none covers so-called &#8220;blue collars&#8221;, such as factory or construction workers. There 
is no general resident permit that allows the permit-holder to work in any field. As a 
consequence, migrants have practically no possibility of working legally as &#8220;blue collars&#8221;, 
except if they obtain residence permits by virtue of their status as migrants of Japanese 
descent, spouses of Japanese citizens, trainees or technical interns. Therefore, many 
migrants working in factories or the construction sector are irregular. 
</p>
<p>47. Japan does not regularize irregular migrants after a certain period of residence in the 
country: many have lived in Japan for several years, sometimes for more than 15 or 20 
years, and have founded a family with children born and educated in Japan. They live in 
permanent fear of deportation, which affects their entire family. Following a report on 
crime published by the Government in 2003 that pointed to irregular migration as one of the 
causes of the increase in crimes,13 and with the economic stagnation, the Government has 
tightened the control over irregular migrants in the last few years. As a consequence, they 
are increasingly stopped, arrested and deported.  
</p>
<p>48. The only possibility for migrants to acquire a regular status is the &#8220;special 
permission to stay&#8221;. According to the statistics provided by the Ministry of Justice, while 
39,382 persons were subject to deportation procedures in 2008, 8,522 were granted special 
permission to stay.  The majority of the latter were irregular migrants married to a Japanese 
citizen. This permission is granted by the Ministry of Justice based on discretionary criteria 
that are not set out in the law. A request for special permission to stay can only be filed 
during the deportation procedure: when a deportation decision has been taken, the person 
can object to it and on that basis the Ministry of Justice may grant special permission to 
stay. It is of concern to the Special Rapporteur that this process seems to lack transparency 
and there are no legal avenues for irregular migrant workers to regularize their status on the 
basis of their employment.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Detention of irregular migrant workers and asylum-seekers  
</b></p>
<p>49. According to the Immigration Control Act, detention in Immigration Bureau&#8217;s 
detention facilities is the rule for irregular migrants and asylum-seekers without valid 
documents or legal status, although, owing to limitation of space, a number of irregular 
migrants are provisionally released. However, a considerable number of irregular migrants 
and asylum-seekers are detained for very long periods with limited access to judicial 
processes. While a legal counsel is allowed to intervene in the procedures of requesting a 
special permission to stay, such interventions are restricted. Once the permission is denied, 
the person is detained awaiting deportation.  
</p>
<p>50. Another concern relates to the fact that there is no time limit for detention, and if the 
Government cannot deport the person for any reason, it can keep the person detained 
indefinitely. The Special Rapporteur met irregular migrants and asylum-seekers who had 
been detained in the East Japan Immigration Centre for around two years. They were in 
deplorable psychological conditions, detained for a prolonged period of time without 
having been tried for or convicted of any crime and without knowing whether or when they 
would be released. As stated by the Committee against Torture in its concluding 
observations to Japan in 2007 (CAT/C/JPN/CO/1), indefinite detention of migrants or 
asylum-seekers is contrary to article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and Japan should establish limits to the 
length of the detention period for persons awaiting deportation.  
</p>
<p>  
 13 Ibid. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>51. Many of the detainees that the Special Rapporteur met suffered from various 
diseases, in some cases very serious, and the majority complained about not receiving 
adequate health care. They had not been allowed to continue the medication they had been 
taking before they were detained, and were given light medication instead, which was 
seriously compromising their health and possibility of recovering. For example, a detainee 
suffering from diabetes reported he was only given painkillers and his condition had 
worsened tremendously. 
</p>
<p>52. In terms of use of violence in detention centres, while detainees reported that they 
were treated fairly and were not subjected to violence, the Special Rapporteur heard cases 
of use of violence during deportation procedures. For instance, on 22 March 2010, the day 
before the start of the official visit, Abubakar Awudu Suraj, an irregular migrant from 
Ghana who was being deported to his country, died in Narita airport in Tokyo. He had been 
married to a Japanese woman since 2006 and had been held in detention for two years for 
no other reason than staying in the country without a legal permit. While the case is 
currently under criminal investigation, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that it may 
reflect the pattern of violence during deportation procedures, which has been reported to the 
Special Rapporteur.      
</p>
<p>53. With regard to complaints on mistreatments or lack of access to appropriate services 
in detention or during the deportation process, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 
detainees could submit complaints to the Deputy-Director of the detention centre, through 
an opinion box, with a further review of the complaints by the Ministry of Justice. No 
independent mechanism to monitor human rights violations occurring in detention centres 
and examine complaints was available at the time of the visit.  In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur positively notes the establishment of the Immigration Detention<b> </b>Facilities 
Visiting Committee in July 2010. The mandate of the Committee is to &#8220;ensure openness of 
treatment, and improvement of the operation of the facilities&#8221;14 and it is composed of 
independent experts from a variety of backgrounds, including academia, the legal and 
medical fields and international and non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Deportation of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur found that the detention and deportation of irregular 
migrants and asylum-seekers had a severe impact on children. For example, in 2010, he was 
informed of a case of a Peruvian woman who had lived for 16 years in Japan and was 
arrested and detained with her 10-year-old child. They were deported the next morning 
without having the opportunity to meet their lawyer. The child had been born in Japan, 
attended Japanese school and had very limited knowledge of Spanish. In another case of a 
family who had been living in Japan for more than 20 years, with a 14-year-old child who 
was born in Japan and speaks only Japanese, a court ruled that since they did not have a 
residence permit, the father would be deported to Pakistan and the mother and the child to 
the Philippines.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of cases of children who were separated 
from their parents as a consequence of their deportation. In the case of Noriko Calderon, the 
Immigration Bureau ordered the deportation of the entire family. Thereafter, it conceded 
special permission to stay to the child only, allowing her to continue her studies under the 
care of an appropriate custodian. Noriko, a 13-year-old girl who was born in Japan and 
went to Japanese school with very good results, was forced to choose between her right to

</p>
<p>education and her parents. She decided that she wanted to continue her education in Japan, 
and her parents were eventually deported. This case generated fierce debate in the Japanese 
society.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur met with Noriko and other children who were under the 
threat of deportation for themselves or their parents: they all explained that being deported 
would ruin their life and their education, as they were born in Japan, their native language 
was Japanese and they did not speak the language of their parents&#8217; country of origin 
(Spanish or Filipino in many cases). They would not be in a position to continue their 
education in another language, or would lose too many years of education. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Access to public services by irregular migrants  
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the recent reform of the registration 
system for foreign nationals may negatively affect the level of access to public services by 
irregular migrants. The foreigners&#8217; registration system has recently been modified by the 
Revised Basic Resident Registration Act, approved on 15 July 2009. Under the current 
system still in place, there are two registration systems. On the one hand, municipalities 
issue registration certificates to all migrants who stay in Japan for not less than 90 days, 
including irregular migrants. Registration certificates are issued by municipalities of their 
residence and the municipalities provide public services in the field of health, education and 
housing to registered migrants. On the other hand, the Ministry of Justice&#8217;s Immigration 
Bureau issues residence permits only to regular migrants.  
</p>
<p>58. Under the proposed new law, there will only be one registration system. The 
municipal registration certificate will be abolished and replaced by a Resident Card (Zairyu 
Card) that will be issued by the Immigration Bureau to foreigners who have a permission to 
stay in Japan for more than three months.  Foreigners with a Resident Card will be 
registered in municipalities of their residence. This is a positive step for regular migrants 
who will be registered in the same registration system as Japanese citizens and will have a 
smoother access to public services. However, it leaves the situation of irregular migrants 
uncovered, since municipalities will not be in a position to register them anymore. Since 
they will become invisible for municipalities, it is doubtful whether access to essential 
health services will still be provided to them, or whether they will continue to receive 
invitations to send their children to public schools. Despite assurances by the Ministry that 
these services will continue to be provided, it is unclear how this will be ensured in 
practice.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Violence and discrimination against migrant women 
</b></p>
<p>59. According to Government statistics, 6.1 per cent of approximately 730,000 
marriages registered in 2006 were marriages between Japanese and foreigners. In 81 per 
cent of these cases, it consists of a Japanese man and a foreign wife, mainly from China and 
the Philippines. Some 36,000 children of those born in 2006 (3.2 per cent) had one or two 
foreign parents.  
</p>
<p>60. Migrant women face twofold discrimination, as foreigners and as women. Often 
their children also endure consequences of this discrimination. The prevalence of domestic 
violence is high in Japan15 and one may assume that it is even higher in the case of migrant 
</p>
<p>  
 15 The Special Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p>especially women and children reported that &#8220;according to the statistics provided by the Cabinet 
 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>women owing to their special vulnerability, as they depend on their husband&#8217;s approval to 
acquire or renew their spouse visa. Therefore, foreign spouses are in an extremely 
vulnerable and unequal situation: they cannot leave the household for the fear of losing the 
visa and being deported. Some husbands have taken advantage of their dominant position, 
in some cases using violence. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur heard various testimonies from Filipino women and their 
children who are abused by their Japanese husbands or de facto partners. In these cases, he 
is concerned about reports that the courts do not take into account factors such as domestic 
violence and abuse against the children in determining their custody.   
</p>
<p><b> K. Limited access to education by migrant children 
</b></p>
<p>62. According to the School Education Act, elementary and middle education is 
compulsory for Japanese children, but not for foreign children, since the law obliges only 
Japanese nationals to send their children to an elementary school and junior high school. 
According to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japanese 
elementary and secondary schools may accept foreign children of school age &#8220;if they wish 
to enter&#8221; schools.16 Schools and municipalities have no legal obligation to accept migrant 
children and education is not secured for those children as a legal right. Moreover, there is 
no obligation for municipalities to offer specific services or language teaching to migrant 
children. Each municipality determines its own policy at its discretion.  
</p>
<p>63. While migrant children are generally accepted by Japanese schools, there are a 
number of obstacles for migrant children to completing their education in Japanese schools. 
Despite measures that have recently been put in place by the Government, the majority of 
migrant children do not receive necessary assistance to develop appropriate language skills 
and tend to find themselves lost in Japanese schools. In addition, discrimination against 
them is still common, despite the fact that human rights education has been incorporated 
into the school curricula. The Special Rapporteur heard many cases of migrant children 
who feel discriminated by both students and teachers. Compounded by their language 
difficulties, many migrant children end up leaving Japanese schools.  
</p>
<p>64. Given these difficulties, the majority of migrant children attend foreign schools, 
while a considerable number do not attend school at all.17 Most foreign schools are not 
accredited as &#8220;schools&#8221; as defined in article 1 of the School Education Act, as they do not 
fulfil the accreditation criteria determined by the Ministry of Education, such as the 
minimum qualifications of teachers and the implementation of school curricula using 
Japanese textbooks approved by the Ministry. Many Korean schools and some Brazilian 
schools have been only accredited as &#8220;miscellaneous schools&#8221;, while others do not receive 
any accreditation.      
</p>
<p>65. The lack of accreditation as &#8220;schools&#8221; under the School Education Act has a number 
of adverse implications on these foreign schools. First, the Government does not provide 
</p>
<p>  
Office, 13.3 per cent of women living in Japan feared for their life in 2008 because of domestic 
violence. Also in 2008, 68,196 cases of domestic violence were reported to relevant government 
bodies&#8221;  (A/HRC/14/32/Add.4, para. 38). 
</p>
<p> 16 Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, <i>Guide for foreign students to start 
school procedures to enter Japanese schools</i>, p. 1. Available from 
http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/clarinet/003/001/009.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 17 According to governmental statistics, as of May 2008, the number of migrant children enrolled in 
public elementary, middle and high schools was around 75,000. About 29,000 required Japanese-
language teaching. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>any financial support or other services such as free health care and lunches to non-
accredited schools. Thus, foreign schools must rely exclusively on financial contributions 
by parents, which amount to approximately 45,000 yen per month. While miscellaneous 
schools receive some financial support through local governments, it appears that such 
support is limited compared to the support Japanese schools and Western schools receive, 
notably in terms of tax exemptions and subsidies. Second, qualifications acquired at foreign 
schools are not recognized as equivalent to those acquired at accredited schools, which 
creates disadvantages for migrant children when they seek to transfer or take national 
examinations to enter Japanese schools. While a 2003 reform granted access to university 
entrance examinations to graduates of foreign schools, graduates from schools for those 
from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea have been excluded, because of political 
reasons linked to the lack of diplomatic recognition of that country. As a consequence, 
these students are severely discriminated against: their access to university is not 
guaranteed and depends on discretion by each university. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>66. Furthermore, the Government does not ensure that Japanese classes are provided to 
children in foreign schools, which has serious consequences for their integration. For 
example, graduates from Brazilian schools have difficulties in entering Japanese high 
schools, as they must succeed in a written entrance examination in Japanese or English.  
</p>
<p>67. Access to high school is also limited for migrant children who have just arrived in 
Japan. If they are older than the compulsory education age of 15 years and have completed 
nine years of compulsory education, they are not allowed to enter junior high school. In 
order to enter high school, they need to pass the entrance examination. However, no 
training opportunity is provided by the Government to these children in order to prepare for 
the examination: in Tokyo, for example, only a NGO, the Multicultural Centre Tokyo, 
provides this specific training in preparing for the entrance examination. 
</p>
<p>68. As a result, many migrant children cannot attend high school and find themselves 
without any educational opportunity. A good initiative in this regard is the establishment of 
&#8220;special screening&#8221; exams for foreign students in the Prefectural Kadoma Namihaya High 
School in Osaka: the exam subjects are lighter and other special conditions can apply, such 
as the use of dictionaries. Thanks to this, the city of Osaka has the highest success rate of 
foreign students entering high schools in Japan. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that migrant children with disabilities or 
in need of psychological assistance do not receive adequate support. Migrant parents have 
difficulties in obtaining the financial support to which they are entitled for their disabled 
children, and children who require urgent psychological attention must wait eight months to 
one year in order to receive it. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Discrimination in employment 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur received repeated complaints in relation to open 
discrimination against migrant workers by their private employers with regard to 
remuneration, excessive overtime, opportunities for promotion, access to health care for 
accidents in the workplace and unfair dismissals. In many cases, migrant workers, both 
regular and irregular, informed that they are employed under precarious and discriminatory 
conditions, with temporary contracts that do not entitle them to access social security 
services.  
</p>
<p>71. In particular, the Special Rapporteur heard complaints in relation to a company in 
Nagoya that requested migrant workers to perform excessive hours practically every day 
without any compensation. Such demand caused a Chinese female worker to faint after 
having worked for 190 hours of overtime in a month. Furthermore, Brazilian workers from </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>this company indicated that discrimination against migrant workers was blatant: meals in 
the cafeteria of the company were more expensive for foreigners; the same was true for the 
price of uniforms and security accessories. This company eventually dismissed 170 migrant 
workers on 25 December 2008, and ended up dismissing all its migrant workers in April 
</p><p>2009. In addition, the company distributed to other companies a list of those dismissed 
migrant workers who were members of trade unions. 
</p>
<p>72. Brazilian workers recalled that, although Japanese labour regulation explicitly 
prohibits and punishes discriminatory treatment with respect to working conditions by 
reason of the worker&#8217;s nationality, this prohibition is not implemented in practice and 
discrimination is recurrent.  
</p>
<p>73. Against this backdrop, it is of serious concern to the Special Rapporteur that the 
judiciary tends to discriminate against migrants, thereby leaving them with no effective 
remedies. As an illustration, the Special Rapporteur was informed of complaints concerning 
discrimination against and unfair dismissals of migrant workers, which were filed by 
lawyers of the migrant workers&#8217; trade union in the Nagoya District Court. In this case, the 
Court refused to admit all the evidence and dismissed the complaints. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that such failure of the judiciary to recognize and sanction 
discriminatory treatments against migrant workers leaves victims unprotected and may 
condone discrimination against migrant workers in a similar manner by other employers. 
</p>
<p><b> M. Limited access to health and welfare insurance  
</b></p>
<p>74. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reported that, in theory, labour 
standards apply to all, irrespective of nationality. In practice, however, certain categories of 
migrant workers may be left without either employer-based or national health and welfare 
insurance. Migrant workers, particularly those in the manufacturing industry, are employed 
by temporary employment agencies which sometimes neglect to contribute premiums for 
health and welfare insurance, despite their legal obligation to do so. While national health 
insurance provides a safety net for those without employer-based health insurance, many 
migrant workers cannot afford to pay the premiums themselves. Furthermore, in principle, 
the national health insurance is available to foreign nationals who have a residence visa for 
12 months or longer. This effectively creates a lacuna of protection for irregular migrants 
and migrants staying in Japan for a short time. At the municipal level, authorities have 
indicated that the issue of appropriate access to social security and health insurance 
coverage for migrant workers is a major problem.  
</p>
<p><b> N. Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>75. According to the national law regulating elections, migrants cannot vote or run in 
national or local elections, even if they are permanent residents and/or born and raised in 
Japan throughout their lives. However, the Hamamatsu municipality has taken some 
interesting initiatives in this area, considering that migrants should be allowed to take part 
in local decision-making processes in order to be fully integrated into the society. For that 
purpose, the Foreign Residents Assembly has been established in the City Hall to reflect the 
opinion of the migrants&#8217; community in the city. 
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Despite some recent efforts to provide protection and assistance to migrants, 
particularly those who found themselves in difficult situations as a consequence of the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>economic crisis, Japan still faces serious challenges in ensuring that the human rights 
of migrants are respected and protected. These challenges include racism and 
discrimination against migrants, exploitation of migrant workers, a lack of effective 
interventions by the judiciary and police to protect migrants&#8217; rights and the overall 
lack of a comprehensive immigration policy that aims to integrate them as part of the 
society and guarantee the protection of their human rights. In order to abide by its 
international human rights obligations, Japan needs to thoroughly address these 
challenges. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>In this context, the Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations 
to the Government.    
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>In terms of the legislative, institutional and policy framework:  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Japan should ratify: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and 
its two Protocols: the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by 
Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Japan should adopt a comprehensive immigration policy at the national 
level, guided by international human rights law and standards. Such a policy would 
need to:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Spell out a commitment to recognizing migrants as a part of the 
Japanese society, and provide a vision on how to integrate migrants into 
the society and how to guarantee the effective protection of their rights;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Establish long-term measures designed to create necessary conditions 
for this integration to become a reality; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Promote public mass-media campaigns and educational programmes 
which focus on positive values that migrants bring to the host society in 
economic, social and cultural terms. In this context, the Government 
should give a voice to migrants to express their views and their 
experience; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Revise the existing categories of residence permits, based on a realistic 
assessment of demand for semi- or unskilled labour. Japan should 
provide for more flexible categories of residence permits in order to 
accommodate the needs for such labour and to allow migrant workers 
who currently fulfil these needs to regularize their status. 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) A strong central governmental agency should be established to 
coordinate, monitor and evaluate the migration policy and its implementation by 
different ministries. It should be given sufficient powers and resources over the 
ministries involved so as to effectively guide and coordinate their work and to ensure </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>the wide dissemination and implementation of the recommendations made by the 
United Nations bodies to the Government; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) Japan should adopt, as a matter of urgency, national legislation 
specifically on the prevention and elimination of racism, discrimination and 
xenophobia, since the general provision included in the Constitution is not effective in 
protecting migrants from discrimination based on race and nationality. Migrant 
communities should be consulted and encouraged to participate in the process of 
elaboration of this law. The law should, in particular: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Penalize racial discrimination in all its forms, and specifically 
discrimination in the field of employment, housing, health, education, 
social and cultural life; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Guarantee access to effective protection and remedies, including 
compensation, to victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Declare an offence all propaganda which advocates racial superiority or 
hatred and promotes or incites racial discrimination, as provided in 
article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, and prohibit all organizations which 
promote these views. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur shares the 
view of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that 
the reservation made by Japan to article 4 (a) and (b) of the Convention 
is in conflict with the country&#8217;s obligations under article 4, which is of a 
mandatory nature, and that the prohibition of the dissemination of all 
ideas based upon racial superiority and hatred is compatible with the 
rights to freedom of opinion and expression;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Provide for mandatory training on the content and implementation of 
such a law to judges, prosecutors and police officers, as well as 
immigration officers and guards and other public officials who deal with 
migrants on a regular basis; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Further promote educational activities and campaigns that sensitize 
both the general public and more focused audiences such as employers 
from sectors where the majority of migrant workers are employed to 
issues of racism, discrimination and xenophobia;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the judiciary&#8217;s failure 
to recognize and sanction discriminatory treatments of migrants. This failure to 
protect migrants from discrimination may constitute a dangerous encouragement for 
individuals and companies to perpetuate discriminatory behaviour. In addition to the 
adoption of legislation against racial discrimination and xenophobia, urgent measures 
should be taken within the judiciary and law enforcement agencies to guarantee the 
effective implementation of migrants&#8217; rights without discrimination. These measures 
should include specific trainings to judges and law enforcement officers on migrants&#8217; 
rights under the current legislation and their duty to protect those rights.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>In order to prevent labour exploitation of migrants, special attention should be 
given to monitoring the conditions under which private companies employ migrant 
workers. Labour inspectors should be adequately trained on how to effectively 
monitor abuses against migrants, and their procedures should include interviewing 
migrant workers on their conditions of work, with the assistance of interpreters when 
needed. Labour standards inspection offices should be more strict and effective in 
monitoring companies that employ migrant workers through dispatching agencies, 
resulting in violating regulations on wages, contractual stability and safety rules.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>80. <b>Further, the Industrial Trainees and Technical Interns Programme should be 
discontinued and replaced by an employment programme aimed at ensuring the 
original purpose of such programme to transfer skills and technologies to developing 
countries. In the light of the serious human rights violations reported, specific 
legislation should be adopted to regulate the new programme. It should include more 
effective and accessible monitoring and complaint mechanisms for the protection of 
the human rights of participants, to be managed by a body totally independent from 
participating companies, and guarantee access to avenues for redress.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>With respect to the human rights of migrant children:  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Japan should ensure that the principle of the best interests of the child 
guides any judicial and administrative decision which has an impact on children. In 
this regard, Japan should reconsider its reservation to article 37, paragraph (c) of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, so that the best interest of the child is taken 
into consideration in determining whether or not the child deprived of liberty should 
be separated from adults.  In particular, it should ensure that a child is not separated 
from his or her parents against his or her will, except when it is in the best interests of 
the child; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) The right to the State&#8217;s protection of the family as a fundamental group 
unit of society should receive full protection and be systematically taken into 
consideration by Japan in judicial and administrative decisions and policies.  In this 
connection, Japan should reconsider its declaration on article 9, paragraph 1, of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child in order to ensure that children are not 
separated from their parents against their will and best interests as a result of 
deportation. Therefore, Japan should review decision-making processes relating to 
deportation of migrants and ensure that the best interest of the child is systematically 
taken into account as primary consideration in deportation procedures.</b>18<b>  In a similar 
vein, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Japan revisit its declaration on article 
10, paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, so that the authorities 
give due weight to the importance of a family unit in determining applications for 
family reunification; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) The right to education for migrant children should be recognized and 
guaranteed by law. The Government should increase efforts to facilitate migrant 
children&#8217;s study either in Japanese or foreign schools, and to provide assistance in 
learning Japanese to migrant children who wish to study at Japanese schools. The 
Government should develop educational programmes to address structural obstacles 
such as the low Japanese-language proficiency level and different cultural 
backgrounds that cause school non-attendance and marginalization of migrant 
children. The Government should also establish a national policy that guarantees to 
any migrant children access to Japanese-language teaching: this access should not 
depend on the policies that may have been adopted at the municipal level, and should 
be financially supported by the Government at the national level.  In this context, the 
Government should establish special preparation programmes and separate 
examinations for the access of migrant children to high school, in accordance with the 
experience of some schools that have already adopted this system with positive results. 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) Migrant children with disabilities or in need of psychological assistance 
should receive adequate and timely support, in order not to compromise their 
</b></p>
<p>  
 18 With regard to migrant children, the Special Rapporteur refers the Government to the concluding 
</p>
<p>observations addressed by the Committee on the Rights of the Child to Japan in 2010 
(CRC/C/JPN/CO/3, paras. 33, 34, 37 and 38). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3

<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, education and health. Their parents should also receive adequate 
support, as provided by the law, including financial support at least at the same level 
as provided for Japanese children; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) Central and prefectural governments should also increase their financial 
support to foreign schools. Moreover, in order not to discriminate among foreign 
schools, the Government should increase its subsidies to Korean, Brazilian, Peruvian, 
Filipino and other foreign schools and apply tax benefits, in order for them to receive 
the same support as other private international and Japanese schools. Finally, 
graduates of Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea schools should be granted access 
to university access examination, as all other graduates from foreign schools; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f) Japan should increase its efforts to offer opportunities for migrants to 
learn Japanese. In addition to its own programmes, the Government should consider 
entering into a partnership with private companies employing migrant workers and 
encourage them to offer Japanese classes to their foreign employees or to contribute to 
a governmental fund that would finance such classes.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>With regard to the detention of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Clear criteria should be established to limit detention to cases where it is 
strictly necessary. Legislation should provide for alternatives to detention of migrants. 
The Immigration Control Act should be amended to introduce a maximum period of 
detention pending deportation. Under no circumstances, detention should be 
indefinite. The detention of sick persons, minors or parents of minors should be 
avoided; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) Urgent measures should be adopted to improve the level of health care 
provided to migrants in detention centres;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) Training and other awareness-raising activities for officers in charge of 
deportation procedures should be carried out in order to prevent violence during such 
procedures; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) The Immigration Detention Facilities Visiting Committee should be 
given appropriate resources and authority to effectively monitor conditions of 
detention and respond to complaints in a timely manner;</b>19   
</p>
<p> <b>(e) To address discrimination against migrant women, a dedicated 
governmental department should be established and effective measures should be 
adopted. In particular, in case of separation of a Japanese-foreign couple, foreign 
spouses should not lose their residence permits exclusively on the basis of objections 
by their Japanese spouses. The judiciary should recognize and effectively guarantee 
the equal rights of foreign and Japanese spouses with regard to children&#8217;s custody 
and, in cases of domestic violence, where the victim is a foreign spouse, the rights of 
foreign victims should be better upheld. Statistics with regard to judicial decisions in 
this area should be compiled and appropriate studies undertaken in order to assess 
the situation of separated migrant spouses and their children and to adopt 
appropriate corrective measures. 
</b></p>
<p>  
 19 With regard to detention irregular migrants and asylum-seekers pending deportation, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur refers the Government to the concluding observations addressed by the Human Rights 
Committee to Japan in 2008 (CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, para. 20) and the Committee on Torture in 2007 
(CAT/C/JPN/CO/1, para. 14). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>83. <b>With respect to social rights of migrants:  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) The Government should ensure that employers of migrants, including 
temporary employment agencies, abide by their obligation to contribute premiums for 
health and welfare insurance.  Further, the Government should provide for options 
for all migrants to access health insurance. A clear policy on this issue should be 
adopted at the national level, as well as appropriate legislation to guarantee these 
rights; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) The Government should prevent and punish discrimination against 
migrants in access to housing. Any public practice that limits the access of migrants 
and their families to public housing facilities, based on their nationality, should be 
eradicated. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Efforts should be made to grant migrants who have resided in a municipality 
for a certain number of years the right to vote in local elections.
