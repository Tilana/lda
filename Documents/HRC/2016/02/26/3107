issue of statelessness is already under consideration by the General Assembly within the

</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the provisions of international human rights instruments and international

</p>
<p><i>Noting also</i> general recommendation No. 30 of the Committee on the Elimination of

</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality are protected by 
international human rights and refugee law, as well as by instruments on statelessness, 
including, with respect to State parties, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless 
Persons and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair 
and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, <b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 66/133 of 19 December 2011, in which the 
Assembly, inter alia, urged the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees to continue its work with regard to identifying stateless persons, preventing and 
reducing statelessness and protecting stateless persons,  
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 of 
3 December 1986, of the call upon all States to promote human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and to refrain from denying those to individuals in their populations because of 
nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or language,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions on the issue of the nationality of natural 
persons in relation to the succession of States, in particular resolutions 55/153 of 12 
December 2000, 59/34 of 2 December 2004, 63/118 of 11 December 2008 and 66/92 of 9

the articles on nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States prepared 
by the International Law Commission in dealing with issues of nationality of natural 
persons in relation to the succession of States,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the arbitrary deprivation of nationality disproportionately affects 
persons belonging to minorities, and recalling the work done by the Independent Expert on 
minority issues on the subject of the right to nationality, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its deep concern</i> at the arbitrary deprivation of persons or groups of 
persons of their nationality, especially on discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
other status,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that arbitrarily depriving a person of his or her nationality may lead to 
statelessness and, in this regard, expressing concern at the various forms of discrimination 
against stateless persons that may violate the obligations of States under international 
human rights law,  
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons whose 
nationality may be affected by State succession must be fully respected,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the right to a nationality of every human person is a 
fundamental human right enshrined in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; </p>


<p>2. <i>Reiterates</i> that the arbitrary deprivation of nationality, especially on 
discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, is a violation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also</i> <i>reiterates </i>that the prevention and reduction of statelessness are primarily 
the responsibility of States, in appropriate cooperation with the international community;  
</p>
<p>4.  <i>Calls upon</i> all States to refrain from taking discriminatory measures and from 
enacting or maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their 
nationality on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, especially if such measures and 
legislation render a person stateless; 
</p>
<p>5.  <i>Urges</i> all States to adopt and implement nationality legislation with a view to 
avoiding statelessness, consistent with the principles of international law, in particular by 
preventing arbitrary deprivation of nationality and statelessness as a result of State 
succession; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Notes</i> that the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of an individual might be impeded as a result of the arbitrary deprivation of nationality, and 
that such individuals are placed in a situation of increased vulnerability to human rights 
violations; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>7. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality may be 
affected by poverty, social exclusion and limited legal capacity, which have an adverse 
impact on their enjoyment of relevant civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
in particular in the areas of education, housing, employment, health and social security;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reaffirms</i> that every child has the right to acquire a nationality, and 
recognizes the special needs of children for protection against the arbitrary deprivation of 
nationality;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges</i> all States to prevent statelessness through legislative and other 
measures aimed at ensuring that all children are registered immediately after birth and have 
the right to acquire a nationality and that individuals do not become stateless thereafter; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Calls upon</i> States to observe minimum procedural standards in order to 
ensure that decisions concerning the acquisition, deprivation or change of nationality do not 
contain any element of arbitrariness and are subject to review, in conformity with their 
international human rights obligations;  
</p>
<p>11. <i>Encourages</i> States to grant their nationality to persons who had habitual 
residence in their territory before it was affected by the succession of States, especially if 
those persons would otherwise become stateless; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure the access of persons arbitrarily deprived of their 
nationality to effective remedies, including, but not limited to, the restoration of nationality;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Secretary-General submitted in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 13/21 and the conclusions contained therein; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes</i> the intergovernmental event organized by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on 7 December 2011 marking the sixtieth 
anniversary of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and the fiftieth anniversary of the 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, and the pledges made by States at the said 
</p>

<p>event in the field of the reduction of statelessness, prevention of statelessness and 
protection of stateless persons; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Encourages</i> States to consider acceding to the Convention relating to the 
Status of Stateless Persons and the Convention on the Reduction on Statelessness, if they 
have not already done so; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Welcomes</i> the ongoing efforts made in the field of the reduction of 
statelessness and combating arbitrary deprivation of nationality by different United Nations 
bodies and entities and human rights treaty bodies, and notes with appreciation in this 
regard the guidance note of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;The United Nations and 
Statelessness&#8221;, and the guidelines on statelessness issued by the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Urges</i> relevant United Nations human rights mechanisms and appropriate 
treaty bodies and encourages the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees to continue to collect information on the issue of human rights and arbitrary 
deprivation of nationality from all relevant sources, and to take account of such 
information, together with any recommendations thereon, in their reports and activities 
conducted within their respective mandates;  
</p>
<p>18. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to prepare a report on legislative and 
administrative measures that may lead to the deprivation of nationality of individuals or 
groups of individuals, paying particular attention to situations where persons affected may 
be left stateless, to collect in this regard information from States, United Nations agencies 
and other relevant stakeholders and to present the report to the Human Rights Council 
before its twenty-fifth session;  
</p>
<p>19. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this issue in 2014 in accordance with its 
programme of work.
