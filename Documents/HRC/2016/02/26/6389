Social Development of the Economic and Social Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be 
guaranteed their full enjoyment without discrimination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that disability is an evolving concept and that disability results from the 
interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that 
hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also </i>the importance of accessibility to the physical, social, economic and 
cultural environment, to health, education, information and communication, in enabling persons 
with disabilities to enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms fully, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing further</i> the importance of international cooperation for improving the living 
conditions of persons with disabilities in every country, particularly in developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that women and girls with disabilities are often subject to multiple 
discrimination, and emphasizing the need to incorporate a gender perspective in all efforts to 
promote the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons with 
disabilities, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the need to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect 
for their inherent dignity, and in this regard, calls upon Governments to take active measures: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)  To prevent and prohibit all forms of discrimination against persons with disabilities;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)  To ensure, for persons with disabilities, full and effective participation and inclusion, 
respect for their individual autonomy, including the freedom to make one&#8217;s own choices; 
independence; and equality of opportunity; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes</i> the adoption by the General Assembly on 13 December 2006 of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol, and expresses 
the hope that they will enter into force at an early date;

<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes</i> the fact that, since the opening for signature of the Convention and 
Optional Protocol on 30 March 2007, 125 States have signed and 17 have ratified the 
Convention, and that 71 States have signed and 11 have ratified the Optional Protocol, and calls 
upon those States and regional integration organizations that have not yet done so to consider 
signing and ratifying the Convention and the Optional Protocol as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Further welcomes</i> the attention that several special rapporteurs have paid to the 
rights of persons with disabilities in carrying out their mandates, and requests special procedures, 
in carrying out their mandates, to take into account the full and equal enjoyment of all human 
rights by persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, and other mechanisms 
of the Council, to integrate the perspective of persons with disabilities, as appropriate, in 
carrying out their work and in their recommendations so as to facilitate the inclusion of persons 
with disabilities in the work of the Council; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> all stakeholders to give consideration to the rights of persons with disabilities 
at all stages of the universal periodic review, including during the consultations carried out by 
States at the national level for the preparation of information to be submitted for the review, so 
as to include national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations representing 
persons with disabilities in such consultations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Welcomes</i> the attention paid to the rights of persons with disabilities in the work of 
several human rights treaty monitoring bodies and encourages all such bodies to further integrate 
the perspective of persons with disabilities in their work, including in their monitoring activities 
and through the issuing of general comments; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> Governments to address fully, in consultation with, inter alia, national human 
rights institutions and organizations of persons with disabilities, the rights of persons with </p>

 <p></p>
<p>disabilities when fulfilling their reporting obligations under the relevant United Nations human 
rights instruments, and welcomes the efforts of those Governments that have begun to do so;

implementation of the recommendations contained in the study on the human rights of persons

Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, including in cooperation with the 
Department for Economic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> States to raise awareness regarding the rights of persons with 
disabilities, including through public awareness campaigns and training programmes, to combat 
stereotypes, prejudices, harmful practices and attitudinal barriers relating to persons with 
disabilities and to promote positive perceptions and greater social awareness of persons with 
disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also encourages</i> the High Commissioner for Human Rights to take fully into account 
the progressive implementation of standards and guidelines for the accessibility of facilities and 
services of the United Nations system, also taking into account relevant provisions of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and underlines the need for the Council, 
including its Internet resources, to be fully accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Further encourages</i> States to take appropriate measures to identify and eliminate 
obstacles and barriers to accessibility for persons with disabilities, in particular to ensure that 
persons with disabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, 
transportation, information and communications, and to other facilities open or provided to the 
public, both in urban and rural areas; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Welcomes</i> the important role played by national human rights institutions and civil 
society organizations, including organizations of persons with disabilities, in the negotiation of 
</p>
<p>

awareness among them about the work of the human rights system; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Decides</i> to hold an annual interactive debate in one of its regular sessions on the 
rights of persons with disabilities and that the first such debate should be held at its tenth session, 
focusing on key legal measures for ratification and effective implementation of the Convention, 
including with regard to equality and non-discrimination;  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a thematic study to 
enhance awareness and understanding of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, focusing on legal measures key for the ratification and effective implementation of 
the Convention, such as those relating to equality and non-discrimination, in consultation with 
States, civil society organizations, including organizations of persons with disabilities, and 
national human rights institutions, and requests that the study be available on the website of the 
Office of the High Commissioner, in an accessible format, prior to the tenth session of the 
Council;  
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Notes</i> that the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to the 
Assembly at its next session a report on the status of the Convention and the Optional Protocol

with disabilities;  
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur on disability of the Commission for Social
