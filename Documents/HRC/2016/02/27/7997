<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Half of the current global population live in cities, and one third of all urban-
dwellers are poor. The urban poor represent one quarter of the world&#8223;s poor population,1 a 
number that is expected to rise dramatically with continued urbanization, making poverty 
an increasingly urban phenomenon.2 The pace of urban poverty reduction has also been 
slower than rural poverty reduction, indicating an overall urbanization of poverty. The 
higher the level of urbanization, the larger the effect on the proportion of the poor living in 
urban areas.3 Thus, urban poverty poses particular challenges to the basic human rights of 
the population it affects.  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 16/27 of 25 March 2011, the Human Rights Council requested the 
Advisory Committee to undertake comprehensive studies on the urban poor and their 
enjoyment of the right to food, including strategies to improve their protection and best 
practices. At the eight session of the Advisory Committee, a preliminary study 
(A/HRC/AC/8/5) was prepared by the drafting group on the right to food, consisting of Jos&#233; 
Bengoa Cabello, Chinsung Chung, Latif H&#252;seynov, Jean Ziegler and Mona Zulficar.4  
</p>
<p>3. At its eighth session in February 2012, the Advisory Committee adopted 
recommendation 8/2 by consensus, welcoming the preliminary study on the theme 
&#8220;promotion of human rights of the urban poor: strategies and best practices&#8221; and assigned 
the completion of the above-mentioned study to the drafting group on the right to food, to 
be presented to the Advisory Committee at its ninth session. At its ninth session, the 
Advisory Committee discussed the final study by the drafting group (A/HRC/AC/9/3) and 
requested the drafting group to finalize it in light of these discussions, with a view to 
submitting it to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-second session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Causes of urban poverty  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Urbanization and poor infrastructure  
</b></p>
<p>4. A defining characteristic of contemporary urban poverty is that low- and middle-
income countries bear the brunt of both the current and projected population of poor city 
dwellers: 80 per cent of the world&#8223;s urban poor live in developing countries,5 and the 
developing world will continue to see the highest rate of urban growth. By 2030, 93 per 
cent of the world&#8223;s urban population will live in the developing world, 80 per cent in Africa 
and Asia alone.6 The ability of cities to provide basic infrastructure and services has not,

</p>

M&#232;res International/Make Mothers Matter International for its valuable comments.

<p>however, kept pace with the rate of urbanization.7 In 2001, approximately 78 per cent of 
urban residents in least developed countries lived in slums, compared with 6 per cent in the 
developed world.8  
</p>
<p>5. Developing countries have a disproportionate amount of urban poverty because 
urbanization today is spreading at a different speed and scale than that of the forces that 
shaped cities of the now-developed world. The current trend, which the United Nations 
Population Fund describes as the &#8220;second wave&#8221; of urbanization, is faster and larger in 
scale than the urban growth witnessed in Europe and North America. The first wave was 
relatively gradual, occurring over 200 years from around 1750 until 1950. Over two 
centuries, 15 million city dwellers, accounting for 10 per cent of the population, grew to 
423 million, or 52 per cent of the total population. By contrast, the current wave of 
urbanization is relatively rapid and large. The urban population in the developing world 
will continue to grow from 309 million in 1950 (about 18 per cent of the total population) 
to a projected 3.9 billion by 2030 (about 56 per cent). Research indicates that much of the 
urban growth witnessed is centred in smaller cities and towns throughout the developing 
world.9  
</p>
<p><b> B. Globalization and dislocation of rural communities 
</b></p>
<p>6. The increasing economic integration of the world&#8223;s economies has turned both large 
and small cities into the main beneficiaries of growth and opportunity;10 and since jobs 
grow where there is economic activity, people follow the promise of employment into 
cities. However, globalization has inflicted hardship on the urban poor, often exaggerating 
stark inequalities, challenging governance and undermining rule of law, particularly as the 
international flow of illicit drugs and goods becomes harder to control.11  
</p>
<p>7. The conversion of small-scale farming to cash-crop plantations has further uprooted 
many community members from rural to urban areas.12 Rural communities are also 
particularly vulnerable to the threats of climate change (including floods, tropical storms, 
droughts and other natural disasters), which are constantly threatening the livelihoods of the 
1.3 billion people who currently depend on subsistence farming.13 This vulnerability can 
ultimately lead to dislocation of rural communities and forced migration to cities in search 
for opportunities.

</p>
<p>that faces any or all of five shelter deprivations: lack of access to improved water supply; lack of 
access to improved sanitation; overcrowding (three or more persons per room); dwellings made of 
non-durable material; and insecurity of tenure (lack of evidence of documentation to prove secure 
tenure status or de facto or perceived protection from evictions).

<p><b> C. Poor urban planning and lack of good governance 
</b></p>
<p>8. Roughly 72 per cent of urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa and 57 per cent of 
those in Southern Asia are slum dwellers, and urban growth in developing countries 
consists of mostly poor people. Despite this overrepresentation of slum dwellers, city plans 
in developing countries seldom take into account the needs of these people and &#8220;are largely 
configured and redefined basically in accordance with the political influences of real estate 
capital, with large-scale infrastructure designed to fit the needs of economic activity, and in 
keeping with the demands and preferences of middle and upper-income groups&#8221;.14 City 
governments also exacerbate these risks in their enforcement of urban development 
policies, where foreign investments are often introduced. Urban development policies often 
magnify the risk of flash floods, given that the policies are usually planned and 
implemented without the participation of the urban poor, which also results in their 
displacement.15 
</p>
<p>9. State authorities often fail in their responsibility to &#8220;respond effectively to local 
needs in a participatory, transparent and accountable manner&#8221;.16 While cities theoretically 
offer greater access to the centres of political power, they do not manage growth by 
providing good governance and delivering services for households. Policies are not revised, 
or new policies not implemented, to counterbalance the pressures of population growth on 
service capacities and address the failures of urban governance. Corruption and 
cumbersome regulatory requirements in cities also &#8220;lead to a variety of deprivations, such 
as inadequate infrastructure and environmental services, limited access to school and health 
care, and social exclusion&#8221;.17 
</p>
<p><b> D. Natural hazards and climate change 
</b></p>
<p>10. The urban poor often settle in areas at higher risk of floods, landslides and other 
disasters, where inadequate resources and safety nets make recovery more difficult. Indeed: 
&#8220;urban poverty is complicated and intensified by exposure to natural hazards such as 
cyclones, floods, mudslides and earthquakes. When combined with acute vulnerability, 
these hazards can become disasters. While large-scale events are major enough to qualify as 
disasters, others, far more numerous and ultimately affecting many more children and 
families, are too minor or too slow-moving to meet the formal criteria for &#8222;disaster&#8223;. But 
they are still significant enough to turn lives upside down, bringing intense rainfalls that 
flood homes and destroy possessions, prolonged droughts that exhaust an already unreliable 
supply of water, or heat waves that turn unventilated shacks into ovens.&#8221;18 
</p>
<p>11. Climate change also affects food and nutrition security through direct nutritional 
effects, such as changes in consumption quantities and consumption, and through livelihood 
effects, such as changes in employment opportunities and the cost of acquiring adequate 
nutrition. Climate change can affect each of these dimensions, particularly in the light of 
biophysical and social vulnerability.19 The climate affects food and nutrition security

<p>through reduction of income from animal production, reduction of yields of food and cash 
crops, lowered forest productivity, changes in aquatic populations and increased incidence 
of infectious disease. According to the most recent <i>Report on the World Nutrition Situation</i>: 
&#8220;demand for biofuel may divert land away from food cropping and increase risk of harmful 
production practices and environmental degradation. Reducing gender inequity is an 
important part of the solution to global hunger.&#8221;20 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conditions and human rights of the urban poor 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>12. Low incomes, unemployment, volatile food prices and subsequent inability to access 
adequate supplies of safe and nutritious food threaten food and nutrition security.21 Ninety-
seven per cent of urban households are net food buyers, yet urban-dwellers tend to pay 
higher prices that incorporate the cost of transportation along complex distribution chains.22 
The urban poor&#8223;s dependence on cash-based incomes increases together with a decrease in 
reliance on surrounding natural resources. Therefore, having adequate access to food-
producing resources and to healthy ways of acquiring staples are crucial for their food 
security. The recent food crisis not only disproportionately affected the urban poor but also 
showed the critical need to reduce the urban poor&#8223;s dependency on imported food and 
vulnerability to food prices.23 Sharp rises in food prices since 200624 have led to an increase 
in the number of hungry people to more than one billion.25 Food prices have the largest 
direct impact on poverty because many poor households depend on agricultural income and 
have larger shares of expenditure on food. The 2010 increase in food prices may have 
raised poverty by 43.7 million globally and disproportionately affected those who are 
already poor.26 The availability of biofuels, fluctuating oil prices and inappropriate policy 
responses exert pressure on commodity prices and increase price volatility.27 
</p>
<p>13. Since the urban poor rely almost entirely on cash transactions to obtain food, high 
food prices force the poor to turn to alternatives with little or no nutritional value.28 The 
right to food as defined above encompasses not just access to sufficient caloric intake but

end. Global maize prices also rose about 73 per cent in the six months after June 2010. See also

<p>also to food that is nutritionally adequate. Those chronically deprived of the essential 
nutrients suffer from malnutrition (often referred to as &#8220;the hidden hunger&#8221;), which makes 
</p>
<p>them more vulnerable to disease. Those living in urban poverty face inadequate nutrition, 
since food patterns in urban areas increasingly trend towards prepared or processed foods 
that are higher in calories but lower in micronutrients.29 Various nutrition-related risks are 
particularly exacerbated in urban settings.30 Furthermore, affected households often do not 
employ coping strategies to mitigate the deterioration of their food security, food spending 
and nutrition. Safety-net systems also remain weak.31 
</p>
<p>14. The right to food is achieved when &#8220;every man, woman and child &#8230; has physical 
and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement&#8221;.32 It also 
encompasses &#8220;the right to have regular, permanent and unrestricted access, either directly 
or by means of financial purchases, to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and 
sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer 
belongs, and which ensures a physical and mental, individual and collective, fulfilling and 
dignified life free of fear&#8221;.33 For the urban poor, tenuous food security and poor quality of 
food threatens this right. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to work 
</b></p>
<p>15. Unemployment and underemployment are typically higher for the urban poor, and 
the majority of them work in the informal sector. Many urban poor therefore face 
unemployment, underemployment, low wages, a lack of social insurance, unsafe working 
conditions and very little protection against unemployment. A 2007 World Bank study 
found that unemployment among poor men in Dhaka was twice that of non-poor men. 
These figures were even higher for women, with 25 per cent of poor women facing 
unemployment compared with 12 per cent of non-poor women.34 The urban poor also have 
disproportionately low skill levels; 70 per cent of poor urban adults in the workforce, 
against 50 per cent in the overall urban workforce are classified as low-skilled.35 As low-
skilled labourers, many of the urban poor must work in unstable jobs for low wages. These 
temporary, informal jobs can vary from one season to the next, and pay tends to fluctuate 
accordingly.  
</p>
<p>16. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights specifies the basic right of everyone to 
work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to 
protection against unemployment. It also articulates that &#8220;everyone, without any 
discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work&#8221;, and that &#8220;everyone who works

<p>  
 29 Studies conducted in Cameroon and the United Republic of Tanzania show notable differences in the 
</p>
<p>food consumption patterns between urban and rural populations, particularly in the higher amount of 
starch, sugar, fat and salt of urban residents compared with the high-fibre and micronutrient-rich diets 
of rural residents. See Gina Kennedy, &#8220;Food security in the context of urban sub-Saharan Africa&#8221;, 
submitted for the Food Africa Internet Forum (2003).

<p>has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an 
existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of 
social protection&#8221;. The conditions of the urban poor are rarely sufficient to meet this quality 
of life. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>17. The right to work is closely tied to the right to education, yet enrolment among the 
urban poor is decreasing in many places.36 Limited access to quality education not only 
means that the urban poor cannot gain the necessary skills to secure more stable, higher-
paying employment but also accounts for differences in wages.37 These patterns can also be 
generational; parents who are low-skilled and poorly educated are less able to provide their 
children with opportunities to secure a poverty-free adulthood.38  
</p>
<p>18. Urban poor families&#8223; limited access to quality education is owed to several common 
factors. First, despite free schooling, indirect costs such as uniforms, textbooks and supplies 
often make it prohibitive for households with very limited economic means. Second, the 
transition between primary and secondary school is tenuous, as many children leave school 
to find work in order to supplement household income, illustrating the difficult economic 
decisions that poor urban families must make.39 Third, urban poor communities may simply 
not have access to enough school facilities. One study in the Kibera slum of Nairobi 
revealed that, while there were 14 free primary public schools within walking distance, the 
facilities could only accommodate 20,000 of the more than 100,000 school-aged children in 
the area.40 Fourth, even if they are available, there are often dangers associated with 
travelling to and from schools, especially in poor urban areas, or at the schools themselves, 
including sexual abuse and mistreatment.41 Finally, the quality of education available to 
poor, urban communities is usually far inferior; in some cases, the poor quality of school 
facilities and teaching is a major factor in family decisions to remove their children from 
school.42 These challenges also disproportionately affect girls. 
</p>
<p>19. Education is both a human right and an indispensable means of realizing other 
human rights. It is an &#8220;empowerment right&#8221; and &#8220;the primary vehicle by which 
economically and socially marginalized adults and children can lift themselves out of 
poverty and obtain the means to participate fully in their communities&#8221;.43 For many of the 
urban poor, however, unequal access to quality education challenges this right and, by 
extension, their ability secure a poverty-free life for themselves and following generations.

<p><b> D. Right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>20. Urban population growth patterns indicate that the poor are concentrated in 
undesirable areas, leaving them vulnerable to heightened risk of disease, disaster and 
insecurity. The urban poor &#8220;face many of the same challenges in daily life as the rural poor, 
with the added burden of overcrowded and often unsanitary living conditions&#8221;.44 Around 
one third of the urban population in developing countries &#8211; nearly 1 billion people &#8211; live in 
slums. In Africa,<b> </b>the proportion of urban-dwellers living in slums<b> </b>is<b> </b>some 71 per cent and 
59 per cent in South Asia.45<b> </b>The number of slum dwellers worldwide will increase to 2 
billion in the next 30 years if no firm or concrete action is taken to arrest the situation.46 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>21. Given that the urban poor very rarely own tenure over their land or housing, they 
often face the constant threat of eviction, are vulnerable to mistreatment owing to the 
informality of renting agreements, have greater difficulty in obtaining access to credit, and 
cannot use their homes for income-generating activities.47 Much of this predicament is due 
to too few pro-poor policies with regard to urbanization as a permanent pattern that requires 
acceptance and incorporation into city development strategies. There is a reluctance to 
integrate poor communities into the larger city, particularly in formalizing informal 
settlements, providing basic infrastructure or improving land tenure laws. 
</p>
<p>22. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &#8220;everyone has the right to a 
standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, 
including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services&#8221;. The right 
to adequate housing includes security of tenure, accessibility to services and infrastructure, 
habitability, affordability, inclusive location, and cultural adequacy.48 For the urban poor, 
securing adequate housing that meets these criteria in order to achieve such a standard of 
living is a challenge.49 
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>23. The urban poor suffer from health risks that are sometimes worse than those of their 
rural counterparts.50 Poor urban settlements often form in city centres near environmentally 
unsafe areas, such as waste dumps or industrial sites,51 where inadequate water and 
sanitation infrastructure combined with highly concentrated living conditions make them 
particularly vulnerable to negative health outcomes (including infectious, respiratory and 
diarrheal diseases). HIV/AIDS prevalence rates are also very high in urban areas, exceeding 
50 per cent in some cities. Despite better access to health care in urban areas, morbidity and 
mortality rates can even be higher for those living in slums than that of rural residents.52

<p>24. Urban poverty is intertwined with the problem of environmental degradation, where 
poor air and water quality are particularly hazardous and pervasive. The urban poor are 
often exposed to high degrees of outdoor air pollution from traffic and industry. Airborne 
particulates and pollutants have been linked to respiratory illness, particularly in cities in 
Latin America and Asia.53 Indoor air pollution caused by the intensive use of solid fuels, 
cooking stoves and open fires among the urban poor, combined with inadequate ventilation 
in poorly constructed shelters, are also believed to substantially raise the incidence of acute 
respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders among the urban poor.54 
Poor families in cities are more likely to rely on these forms of fuel for their lighting and 
cooking needs than those with higher incomes. 
</p>
<p>25. Settlements of the urban poor often lack access to water and sanitation 
infrastructure. These communities exist off the grid and rely on private, small-scale 
distributors of water. As a result, most urban slum dwellers pay several times more than 
their higher income counterparts, not just in absolute terms but also as a share of household 
expenditure. In Nairobi, residents of informal settlements pay five to seven more times per 
unit than the official tariff levied on households with a connection to the water network.55 
In Argentina, poor urban households spend 16 per cent of all expenditure on utilities, 
compared with only 11 per cent of the wealthiest 25 per cent.56 For residents of Kibera in 
Kenya, waiting times for access to communal taps exceed one hour on average, and are 
much longer during the dry seasons.57 According to a study conducted in 47 different 
countries, average water prices ranged from 1.5 to 12 times higher than in the formal 
network.58 Furthermore, these sources are often not monitored for quality. 
</p>
<p>26. Even when urban-dwellers have access to adequate sanitation facilities, most of 
these facilities are shared, increasing the chance of a rapid spread of diseases. For example, 
a 2012 UNICEF study found that 52 per cent of urban-dwellers in Accra shared a public 
facility, 12 per cent shared facilities with five or more other households and 11 per cent 
used a facility shared by up to five households. In fact, only 11 per cent of the population 
had access to a private, improved sanitation facility.59 
</p>
<p>27. Children are particularly vulnerable to an increased risk of illness, undernutrition 
and health due to inadequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation services. Children 
who live in poor urban settings face significant health risks even where services are nearby. 
In many countries, children living in urban poverty fare similar or worse health risks as 
children living in rural poverty in terms of height-for-weight and under-5 mortality.60 
</p>
<p>28. The painful irony is that, while urban areas may enjoy better access to health 
services compared to rural areas, such services are prohibitively expensive for the urban 
poor. For much of the developing world, health services in urban areas are largely fee-for-
service, making reliable access cost-prohibitive for the urban poor. However, even when 
subsidies are implemented to remove the cost barrier, often the system is inaccessible to the

<p>urban poor who face difficulty navigating the processes. Furthermore, the spatial and social 
marginalization of the urban poor affects their health-seeking behaviour such that many 
health-care providers have come to expect urban poor users to seek treatment only when 
conditions become severe, to fail to follow prescriptions in order to save costs on 
medicines, and to sometimes display limited will to engage in robust health-seeking 
behaviour.61  
</p>
<p>29. Beyond these physical health indicators, there is also growing evidence that mental 
illness, particularly depression and anxiety, is more prevalent among the urban poor than 
their higher income counterparts. Current hypotheses draw connections between mental 
illness and the stress of survival in resource-constrained, often violent, and marginalized 
contexts.62 
</p>
<p>30. Health is a human right63 defined by the World Health Organization as &#8220;a state of 
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or 
infirmity&#8221;. It is &#8220;the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the 
fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political 
belief, economic or social condition&#8221;. The human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the 
right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to 
life and human dignity.64 These rights of the urban poor are challenged by environmental 
hazards and inadequate access to water, sanitation and health services. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Right to security, inclusion, non-discrimination and political 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation  
</b></p>
<p>31. The urban poor suffer from economic, social and political exclusion. The resulting 
stigma and discrimination is a feature of daily life for many slum dwellers.65 Children are 
especially aware of their harsh, often dilapidated surroundings and experience them as 
shameful reflections of their own self-worth.66 Research shows that this stigma manifests 
itself in job interviews and employment opportunities that discriminate against the poor 
because of where they live. A study conducted in France, for example, found that job 
applicants from low-income addresses were less likely to be selected for interviews than 
candidates from higher-income areas.67 Similarly, a study in Rio de Janeiro revealed that 
living in a slum was a greater barrier to employment than gender or ethnicity.68 Such 
conditions can also lead to social unrest. 
</p>
<p>32. The urban poor have been generally excluded from the processes by which decisions 
affecting them are made. Since the urban poor are particularly disadvantaged with regard to 
health and opportunities for education, work and political participation, their exclusion

<p>hampers their ability to influence policies that could improve their lives, hold Government 
officials accountable and contribute their valuable knowledge to development efforts.69 
This exclusion is even greater for non-citizens and migrant and undocumented workers, 
who also have access to very few legal rights and services. 
</p>
<p>33. Several factors conspire to marginalize political voice and civic participation among 
the urban poor. Firstly, the lack of responsiveness of Governments to their needs, as 
reflected by gaps in basic services, undermine the contract with the Government and 
reinforce the idea that the urban poor are not full citizens of the cities they inhabit.70 
Secondly, there is a demonstrated reluctance to incorporate the needs of poor urban citizens 
into larger city policies, sometimes from a limited understanding of the extent of urban 
poverty, other times from a misunderstanding of how to address it.71 Finally, though some 
cities have adopted ways to incorporate the political voice of poor urban-dwellers into 
decision-making, they are still the exception and not the rule in a context where votes alone 
are not enough to ensure sustained and structural change for the urban poor.72  
</p>
<p>34. Political marginalization also means that the poor often face greater insecurity and 
violence, as policing and the rule of law often do not extend into settlements where the poor 
are concentrated;73 violence and criminality in poor urban communities therefore tend to be 
higher. Here, too, the effects of globalization disproportionately affects the urban poor, as 
international networks of drugs and other illicit economies are thought to flourish where 
governance is weak.74  
</p>
<p>35. The right to political participation is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights: &#8220;everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, 
directly or through freely chosen representatives&#8221; and &#8220;the will of the people shall be the 
basis of the authority of government.&#8221; For poor city-dwellers, the right to political 
participation is closely related to urban governance practices. The Habitat Agenda defines 
governance as &#8220;the mechanisms, processes and institutions through which citizens and 
</p>
<p>groups articulate their interests, exercise their legal rights, meet their obligations and 
mediate their differences&#8221; and good urban governance as &#8220;characterized by the principles of 
sustainability, subsidiarity, equity, efficiency, transparency and accountability, civic 
engagement and citizenship, and security&#8221;.75 These characteristics do not apply to the 
political reality of most poor urban communities, who have yet to realize their rights fully 
or to enjoy a relationship with decision makers that is accountable, transparent or inclusive.

not affect structural changes for the urban poor.

<p><b> IV. Situation of more vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>36. Women and girls face stark challenges, including marginalization due to a gender 
gap in education, employment, security, health and political participation. Overall school 
enrolment rates in poor urban areas have actually decreased, with unequal rates of 
educational attainment between girls and boys.76 Social norms that disadvantage girls, such 
as expectations regarding their domestic role in the home, early marriage and limits on their 
independent movement, all act as barriers to their education, especially when household 
income is limited.77  
</p>
<p>37. Globally, in 2010, 56.3 per cent of young males participated in the labour force, 
compared to 40.8 per cent of young females. Young women face greater challenges in 
accessing jobs, including higher unemployment rates compared to young men. When 
employed, young women are also more likely to be in unstable, part-time and lower-paid 
jobs.78 The conditions of the urban poor also add a distinctive gendered dimension by 
disproportionately increasing the unpaid care work burden of women. As the primary duty-
bearers of care and reproductive activities, women are especially affected by limited access 
to basic services, essential infrastructure, water, sanitation, inadequate shelter and restricted 
mobility. These restrictions all contribute to increasing the burdens related to unpaid care 
work such as cleaning, cooking and looking after children, the elderly and the sick, thus 
deepening a gender-based disadvantage. Unfortunately, this issue of women&#8223;s &#8220;time 
poverty&#8221; has not been adequately addressed by policymakers.79  
</p>
<p>38. Women in poor urban communities are also more likely to be exposed to gender-
based violence. In some countries, poor urban women are more likely to experience 
intimate-partner violence than rural or higher-income urban women.80 This has also been 
closely linked to a higher incidence of mental illness, as women who experience intimate-
partner violence are significantly more likely to report thoughts of suicide.81 This is 
consistent with some indicators that show a higher prevalence of poor mental health among 
poor urban women.  
</p>
<p>39. Furthermore, women living in slums consistently have much lower access to 
prenatal and antenatal care than those in other urban areas with higher incomes.82 
Furthermore, women and girls in urban poor populations are subject to a higher prevalence 
of HIV/AIDS than those in rural and other urban areas, which is perhaps linked to the 
findings that suggest that, for women in the urban poor population, forced or traded sex is

<p>often more prevalent than for their higher-income or rural counterparts.83 There are some 
indications that for some socioeconomic groups, such as adolescents and women, poverty 
may be linked to HIV prevalence, owing to higher rates of early sexual initiation and 
reports of forced or traded sex.84  
</p>
<p>40. The effects of urban poverty on women are often compounded by the fact that, in 
many contexts, women already face social and political marginalization. For instance, while 
insecurity of land tenure and inadequate shelter is a challenge for both men and women 
living in urban poverty, women are particularly disadvantaged because they are often 
denied rights to property owing to cultural norms and discriminatory legal mechanisms.85  
</p>
<p><b> B. Children and youth 
</b></p>
<p>41. Slum settlements are hazardous environments that expose children to elements that 
may affect their health. For instance, poor urban children often suffer a disproportionately 
high incidence of diarrhoeal and respiratory disease than children living in rural or higher-
income urban areas, and studies indicate startlingly higher &#8211; sometimes up to three times 
higher &#8211; child mortality rates in slums than in other parts of the same city.86 Poor urban 
communities also often lack facilities or safe recreational spaces for children.87 In addition, 
inequalities between poor and higher income urban areas affect children from the outset. 
Limited access to quality education can entrench generational poverty by hampering 
children&#8223;s ability to acquire skills and to secure higher-paying jobs as adults.88  
</p>
<p>42. Urban unaccompanied minors, such as orphans, runaways or &#8220;street children&#8221;, are 
affected even more acutely. Many of these children are pushed into the streets by the 
household&#8223;s need for more income, while others leave homes to escape abuse or in the hope 
of finding better income opportunities.89 Life on the street leaves them without a social 
safety net, rendering them particularly susceptible to physical and sexual abuse at the hands 
of police, exploitation by organized begging or waste-picking rackets, and exposed to harsh 
conditions without access to reliable shelter.90  
</p>
<p>43. Youths are also nearly three times as likely as adults to be unemployed. The recent 
financial crises led to a 4 million increase in the number of unemployed youth since 2007. 
In 2011, 74.8 million youths were unemployed, and an additional 6.4 million young people 
have given up hope of finding a job and have dropped out of the labour market altogether.91 
Youth also represent 23.5 per cent of the total working poor, compared with just 18.6 per

<p>cent of non-poor workers.92 Young people are increasingly moving to cities for greater job 
opportunities, not only separating themselves from their families and social support 
networks,93 but also making them susceptible to discrimination by native urban populations, 
who tend to view these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; as obvious deviants. This, in turn, becomes a main 
</p>
<p>source of juvenile criminal behaviour.94 
</p>
<p>44. Urbanization and rising urban poverty contribute to juvenile involvement in criminal 
behaviour because the basic features of the urban environment foster the development of 
such forms of behaviour.95 High (and rising) youth unemployment, the unavailability of 
housing and support services, overcrowding, the disintegration of the family (often a result 
or side effect of poverty), ineffective educational systems and general socioeconomic 
instability can all contribute to juvenile delinquency in the forms of increased crime, 
violence and drug and alcohol abuse among youth. Research indicates a universal increase 
in juvenile crime, especially among the urban poor. Street children can later become young 
offenders, having already experienced violence in their immediate social environment. 
Furthermore, cities in developed and middle-income countries are facing crises related to 
drug abuse, particularly among youth, threatening the gains against poverty that had 
previously spurred the countries&#8223; growth. In Rio de Janeiro, for example, a recent analysis 
</p>
<p>of crime reports found that 57 per cent of drug users are under the age of 24. Increased drug 
abuse also leads to increased violent crime.96 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other minority groups  
</b></p>
<p>45. The hazards of urban poverty are particularly challenging for a number of other 
groups, such as persons with disabilities.97 Households with disabled members are more 
likely to experience poverty due to numerous factors, such as the extra financial burden of 
catering to the special needs of disabled family members and the relationship between low 
employment and education rates for those living with a disability.98 Employment is 
particularly difficult for persons with disabilities, and the stigma sometimes associated with 
disabilities results in their relegation to the margins of society. Thus, there appears to be 
significant links between disability and extreme poverty.99  
</p>
<p>46. The elderly living in urban poverty are similarly vulnerable and subject to social 
exclusion. In regions where the State is responsible for their welfare100 or for those without

<p>  
 92 In the Middle East and North Africa region, the recent Arab Spring uprisings is one of the 
</p>
<p>contributing factors to the disturbingly high levels of youth employment. The total unemployment 
rate in 2010 was 25.5 per cent in the Middle East and 23.8 per cent in North Africa, with female 
youth unemployment at 39.4 per cent in the Middle East and 34.1 percent in North Africa. See <i>World

<p>the social protection of a family, the elderly poor are a particularly marginalized and 
vulnerable group.101  
</p>
<p>47. Groups that are victims of additional stigma or marginalization, such as ethnic or 
religious minorities, migrants, non-citizens and disadvantaged castes, are also vulnerable to 
the hazards of urban poverty. Combined with constrained access to education, employment 
and health care, as well as limited or discriminatory legal policies for foreign migrants and 
refugees, the marginalization due to their minority status can make survival strategies for 
these groups much more complex.102  
</p>
<p>48. In post-conflict and post-disaster situations, poor urban communities are particularly 
vulnerable on three fronts. First, communities of urban poor form in marginalized areas that 
often are more vulnerable to disaster and without adequate planning and infrastructure to 
decrease their vulnerability to events such as flood, earthquakes, fires and storms. Second, 
very few services are available for poor urban communities to strengthen their resilience to 
such shocks.103 Safety nets typically available to higher-income families, such as insurance 
or savings, are not usually available much of the urban poor. Third, even when recovery 
efforts are under way, resources and attention are<b> </b>frequently focused on other parts of the 
city and diverted from the communities that may need them the most.104  
</p>
<p><b> V. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>49. Many efforts have made to further the rights of the urban poor, but they often have 
mixed results. Food aid, for example, was criticized for its high shipping, storage and 
distribution costs. Cash transfers, on the other hand, were cost-efficient, incentivized 
agricultural production and market activity, and allowed recipients to meet both food and 
non-food needs. However, it became evident in some cases that, while food transfers are 
usually controlled by women and therefore benefit children directly, cash was more likely 
to be controlled by men and often diverted to various uses that did not necessarily benefit 
women and children. Furthermore, cash transfers were extremely vulnerable to the volatile 
prices or inflation of the commodities they were intended to purchase, and in some contexts 
could even exacerbate inflation. Governments, multilateral organizations and donors have 
therefore sought to respond to these issues through various approaches, such as adopting 
cash transfers for social protection interventions or providing a combination of cash 
transfers and food aid.105 This dilemma represents one of many that surround the challenge 
of promoting the human rights of the urban poor, and therefore the spectrum of efforts and 
partnerships have greatly varied. This chapter provides a very small sample of efforts that 
have been made by various actors at the national, regional and international levels.

<p><b> A. National and city governments

<p>50. Anti-poverty efforts made by the Government of China serve as a useful example of 
a long-term, phased and integrated approach.106 Beginning with its rural-oriented 
development strategy in 1984, it has undergone four phases. Since 2000, the second phase 
established and improved urban and rural social security systems, and began making 
investments in human capital. Phase three, beginning in 2006, was characterized by the 
consolidation and enhancement of human capital investments. The most recent phase, 
beginning in 2011, is an integrated strategy that combines three components: investment in 
infrastructure; social security interventions; and measures to empower poor communities 
through human capital investments.

<p>51. Brazil pioneered the concept of participatory budgeting in the city of Porto Alegre in 
1989.107 The initiative was designed to enhance accountability and transparency, and allow 
citizens greater influence on how municipal budgets were spent. The model allows citizen 
representatives of neighbourhood associations from throughout the city, including the 
favelas, to participate in meetings where they influence how available investment funds 
(usually 15 per cent of the overall budget) will be spent. Since its establishment, most 
figures cite impressive improvements in water and sanitation indicators. For instance, in the 
first 10 years since the introduction of participatory budgeting, the share of households in 
the city with water connections increased from 75 to 98 per cent, and sewage coverage rose 
from 46 to 98 per cent.108 The Porto Alegre model has since been replicated throughout 
Brazil, the rest of Latin America and elsewhere. While the model has its own limitations,109 
its innovation and effectiveness is clear when combined with a strong commitment to 
transparency and improved urban governance, as well as investments in educating the urban 
poor participants. 
</p>
<p>52. In Thailand, the national Government enhanced urban governance by nurturing and 
collaborating with community-based networks or federations. For example, it merged two 
offices (the Urban Community Development Office and the Rural Development Office) to 
form a single body to target the poor urban communities were being left out of the 
economic growth of previous decades. The Urban Community Development Office had 
been providing low-interest loans for community-based savings and credit groups who 
demonstrated sufficient capacity to manage the funds, which were used for a variety of 
activities, from income-generation to housing improvement and relocation. The real 
innovation of the Community Organizations Development Institute110 was in how the 
programme was scaled up. It linked individual savings groups into larger networks or 
federations of slum dwellers, who managed and on-lent the funds to their member 
organizations. These networks were particularly effective because they (a) decentralized 
decision-making processes, making them closer and more responsive to communities and 
the needs they identified for themselves; (b) created a means for poor urban communities 
and municipal authorities to engage with each other constructively thanks to the ability of 
the networks to negotiate, advocate or influence urban policies, and collaborate with city-

<p>53. Under the Mexican <i>Oportunidades</i> conditional cash transfer programme, direct cash 
payments are provided to eligible poor and vulnerable households who send their children 
to schools and clinics. Eligible households also receive grants to improve food consumption 
and nutritional supplements for young children and pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. 
Evidence suggests that the programme has had positive effects on child growth in both rural 
and urban sectors, and that the nutritional effect of the programme is the result of the 
nutritional supplements. Currently, <i>Oportunidades</i> reaches over 5.8 million people or 20 
per cent of the total population. Research indicates that consumption, mostly food intake, 
has increased by 22 per cent, and the proportion of malnourished children decreased by 
17.2 per cent.111 
</p>
<p>54. In Cambodia, the national Government collaborated with the World Food 
Programme and local NGOs to implement its Food for Assets programme, which helps 
poor, food-insecure households to cope with potential disaster by providing off-season 
labour opportunities to develop or rehabilitate community assets in return for much-needed 
food. The programme provides labour opportunities to poor and food-insecure families who 
receive food as payment. It also builds or rehabilitates infrastructure, as well as improves 
access to schools and other basic services. Similar programmes are implemented by many 
other Governments in collaboration with the World Food Programme.

<p><b> B. Civil society and private sector 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Orangi Pilot Project of the Research and Training Institute112 in Pakistan, which 
organizes community-initiated and community-implemented sewage construction in the 
poor urban settlements of Karachi, is a useful model of partnership between civil society 
and Government. The Institute is a community-based organization that organizes 
committees of poor urban residents to oversee, finance and construct basic, cost-effective 
underground sewage systems in otherwise underserved Orangi Town. It provides technical 
guidance and one eighteenth of overall financing, while the committees fund the rest. State 
agencies support the initiative by providing funding for larger infrastructural investments, 
such as treatment plants. The results show improved health indicators, particularly infant 
mortality rates, an effective, low-cost sewage system and a community that reports 
significant decreases in the perception of social marginalization and stigmatization. 
</p>
<p>56. The Luanda Urban Poverty Project113 in Angola takes an integrated approach to 
alleviating urban poverty through community participation and partnerships to improve 
urban governance. Started in 1999 as a coalition of three NGOs (Care International, Save 
the Children UK and Development Workshop), the project partners Government agencies 
and community-based organizations in various municipalities, and is funded by the British-
based Department for International Development. The Project has won recognition for its 
approach facilitating the ability of poor urban communities to self-manage such basic 
services as water and sanitation, handle waste and engage with municipal planning and 
advocate for pro-poor policies at the national level. At the same time, the project helps local 
governments dialogue with and respond to poor urban communities by incorporating the

<p>needs they identify. The key components of the project are community-coordinated and 
managed water and sanitation services, waste management and childcare; livelihood 
training, facilitating engagement in the municipal planning process, and access to credit and 
savings schemes. 
</p>
<p>57. The South African Homeless Peoples&#8223; Federation114 illustrates how community-
generated associations can drive self-built housing improvements, particularly by bringing 
together a network of autonomous savings and credit groups from across South Africa. It 
was created to address a void in housing improvement options for the urban poor, who are 
largely unable to meet the requirements to qualify for the national housing subsidy. The 
Federation requires that members commit to a savings and credit group. It assists them by 
providing bridge-financing to secure land tenure and build homes; facilitating exchanges 
between member neighbourhoods and cities to increase knowledge, skills and practices to 
address common needs within poor urban communities; mapping and surveying settlements 
to identify needs and collect data for negotiations with municipal authorities; and 
constructing demonstration homes.  
</p>
<p>58. The Manila Water Company, Inc.,115 is a compelling example of a public-private 
partnership that has been largely successful in providing improved access to water for the 
urban poor in Manila. In 1997, the Company won a Government concession to serve the 
east service zone of Manila, encompassing a population in which the urban poor make up 
40 per cent of inhabitants. By approaching them as a viable customer base and revenue 
source, the Company&#8223;s customer-centred culture and model of community engagement was 
successful in extending the water infrastructure to informal settlements, reducing illegal 
tapping and maintaining a profitable enterprise. It provides a useful illustration of how 
market forces might be harnessed to improve water access to the urban poor when 
combined with a pro-poor approach and anchored by a strong public partner. 
</p>
<p>59. Cooperatives exist in cities across Latin America, Asia and Africa that organize 
poor, urban informal workers who make a living by sorting and collecting waste. The case 
of CEMPRE (Compromisso Empresarial para Reciclagem) in Brazil shows how 
cooperatives can partner the private sector to improve job creation and waste management 
among the urban poor. CEMPRE116 is a non-profit association created in 1992, financially 
supported by private firms operating in Brazil, that helps waste pickers form cooperatives 
in order to secure better prices for the wastes they sell to industrial recyclers and waste 
processers. These cooperatives have been shown to be effective at securing better working 
conditions, higher pay and opportunities for members to gain further education, collect 
savings and more.117

<p>with individual Governments to build comprehensive poverty alleviation strategies through 
the decent work country programmes. ILO works with each country to integrate decent 
work as a key component of their development strategies, and provides expertise, capacity 
and technical assistance to help each Government implement them.118  
</p>
<p>61. ILO also works to strengthen regional institutions, such as the African Union and 
regional economic communities, in their efforts to eradicate poverty. By facilitating 
strategic exchanges and coordinated approaches across countries, this regional cooperation 
provides a means of embedding employment into each Government&#8223;s national development

<p>62. The United Nations Development Programme, in partnership with the Economic 
Commission for Africa, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, provides 
technical support to 35 African countries that have embarked on the process of preparing 
and implementing national strategies and plans of action plans based on the Millennium 
Development Goals.120 This initiative showcases a model of international support and 
coordination that equips individual country Governments to undertake strategies best suited 
to the particular poverty challenges they face.  
</p>
<p>63. Cities Alliance121 is a global coalition founded in 1999 by the World Bank and UN-
Habitat, whose activities are run and implemented by member cities. It is made up of city 
authorities from around the world, national Governments, development agencies, NGOs 
and multilateral institutions dedicated to addressing urban poverty. It provides cities and 
Governments with technical assistance in three basic areas: slum upgrading programmes, 
city development strategies, and national policies on urban development and local 
government. Its support for cities or national Governments rests on four basic criteria: they 
must be committed to improving their cities and local governance for all its residents; 
adopting a long-term and inclusive approach; implementing reforms fully to achieve 
delivery at scale; and empowering local government by decentralizing resources.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> In order to address the challenges that urban poverty poses to a growing 
population on a global scale, the following measures should be taken to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Recognize the indivisibility of the human rights of the urban poor, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the need for targeted, rights-based and inclusive efforts at <i>all</i> levels to promote the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of the urban poor.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Promote rights-based and participative development policies and good 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance. Development policies that fully consider the human rights, dignity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedoms of the poor should be implemented. This includes meeting the most basic 
</b></p>
<p><b>and minimum needs, such as access to quality public services, required for the urban 
</b></p>
<p><b>poor to live with dignity and freedom. Central to this effort is the enhanced political 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of the urban poor themselves. Aside from fulfilling an integral human 
</b></p>
<p><b>right, promoting good governance that engages affected communities in the

<p><b>policymaking process has been shown to enhance development efforts. Local 
</b></p>
<p><b>knowledge of needs and constraints are invaluable to the policymaking process. Often 
</b></p>
<p><b>innovations grown within poor urban communities to fill the service void are viable 
</b></p>
<p><b>options that can be scaled up. Meanwhile, meaningful buy-in from traditionally 
</b></p>
<p><b>excluded poor urban communities may enhance the sustainability of initiatives in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>long run, as some of the examples in the previous chapter demonstrate; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Promote the establishment of social safety nets. Given the fragile 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic resilience of poor urban communities where employment is unstable or 
</b></p>
<p><b>uncertain, and where the bulk of incomes go towards immediate survival, social safety 
</b></p>
<p><b>nets should be established to make households better equipped to recover from 
</b></p>
<p><b>shocks. Initiatives that help the urban poor cope with unemployment, casual or 
</b></p>
<p><b>informal employment, uncertain daily wages and disaster should be established;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Empower the urban poor by investing in human capital. Given the links 
</b></p>
<p><b>between low wages, limited access to quality education and low skills, measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhance the human capital of the urban poor should be taken. Quality education and 
</b></p>
<p><b>vocational training to boost access to higher wages and stable employment could have 
</b></p>
<p><b>a significant impact on long-term poverty alleviation among the urban poor; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Apply an integrated approach. Understanding that the hazards of urban 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty are multidimensional and require interventions that span urban planning, 
</b></p>
<p><b>public health, education, food security and more, it is important to avoid a fragmented 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach.
</b>122
</p>
<p><b> Instead, an integrated approach should be applied to ensure that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>urban poor have access to basic public services at a minimum. This may take the form 
</b></p>
<p><b>of several measures implemented in tandem, such as infrastructure investments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve access to water and sanitation, enhanced vocational training and microcredit 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes. Efforts to increase access to information and communication 
</b></p>
<p><b>technologies also need to be a priority, as well as measures to ensure the inclusion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly vulnerable or marginalized groups including women and youth; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Strengthen international cooperation. A long-term approach may be 
</b></p>
<p><b>better suited to the systemic impact and multisectoral dimensions that are required to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address urban poverty. Thus, there is an urgent need to coordinate international 
</b></p>
<p><b>development efforts in order to direct rights-based foreign investment to where it can 
</b></p>
<p><b>have a greater impact and avoid waste. International South-South cooperation may 
</b></p>
<p><b>also yield benefits as developing countries facing similar urbanization challenges share 
</b></p>
<p><b>lessons and successful strategies;
</b>123 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Incorporate particular regard for vulnerable groups. All these measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should integrate a gender perspective into governance processes including 
</b></p>
<p><b>policymaking, public administration and service delivery, particularly issues gender-
</b></p>
<p><b>specific issues including gender-based violence, the unpaid care work burden for 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and discrimination. The needs of children, older persons and disabled persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>also require special attention and mainstreaming, as well as multiple discriminations 
</b></p>
<p><b>based on castes, ethnicities, religion and so on through integrated programming. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Emphasize the critical roles of each actor </b>&#8211;<b> whether international, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional, State, civil society or private sector </b>&#8211;<b> in promoting the dignity and human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of the urban poor, especially the marginalized and vulnerable groups. For 
</b></p>
<p><b>example, the international development community can mobilize its knowledge,

<p><b>experience and sometimes resources to address the challenges of juvenile delinquency, 
</b></p>
<p><b>but the State plays the most critical role in implementing policies and systems that 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide security for youth and children in urban areas. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> As the global urban population continues to grow at a rapid pace, the need to 
focus attention on ensuring their full enjoyment of basic human rights must become a 
</b></p>
<p><b>priority for the future at the local, national, regional and international levels. An 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach to alleviating poverty for urban populations that integrates infrastructural 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, social safety nets and investments in empowering and educating poor 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities will prove essential. Equally crucial will be a human rights approach to 
</b></p>
<p><b>development that effectively addresses the ways urban poverty threatens rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>health, water, shelter, food, education and work. Lastly, improving political 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation for the marginalized urban poor is the linchpin to strategies aimed at 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing the challenges of growing urban poverty.
