a constructive role in such conflicts and confrontations between the Government and civil 
society. With an appropriate mandate and working methods, national institutions can be a 
facilitator and mediator in such processes because they are not part of the Government or 
civil society. </footnote>3-10179

<p>  B. Country visits ..................................................................................................  6&#8211;<footnote name="8">8. In a similar vein, some national institutions have engaged actively with the 
authorities when reported violations against defenders occur. The Afghanistan Independent 
Human Rights Commission noted that it intervenes directly with the police and security 
officials once complaints are received of threats or intimidation of defenders by State or 
non-State actors. The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines is mandated to

<p>  C. Cooperation with the United Nations system and intergovernmental  
   organizations ...................................................................................................  9&#8211;<footnote name="1">07. The State Human Rights Commission in Campeche in Mexico reported that it had 
intervened in several such conflicts to mediate between the parties, notably in relation to 
land rights. The Institution of the Human Rights Defender in Armenia helped to diffuse 
tension between protesters and the Government in a dispute over environmental issues, 
resulting in a peaceful solution.

<p> III. National human rights institutions ..........................................................................  23&#8211;<footnote name="83">. The Special Rapporteur believes that members and staff of national institutions 
should be aware of the risks that their work could entail and should be properly equipped 
and trained to face such risks.  In addition, specific provisions and resources should be 
made available in order to provide them with adequate protection if needed. </footnote> 6 
</p>
<p>  A. Introduction and methodology ........................................................................  23&#8211;<footnote name="2">6. When national institutions are able to operate independently and efficiently, they are 
also more capable of offering adequate protection to individuals and organizations that may 
be targeted due to their human rights work.  The protection of human rights defenders was 
identified by the national institutions survey conducted by OHCHR in 2009 as &#8220;one of the

</p>
<p>  C. National human rights institutions as human rights defenders .......................  34&#8211;<footnote name="8">7. National human rights institutions usually have a mandate to provide 
recommendations to various parts of the Government on what actions should be taken in a 
given case without these recommendations carrying any legal obligation. The national 
institutions in Mexico and El Salvador both noted that they used such a mechanism to issue 
recommendations with precautionary measures to be taken by the Government in cases 
involving human rights defenders. In Mexico, such recommendations are made public, and 
the national commission has published a guide on how to implement precautionary 
measures awarded to human rights defenders. The National Human Rights Commission of 
India is using a similar mechanism to alert the relevant authorities about reported violations 
against defenders. The Indian commission has established a focal point for defenders which 
has a hotline and is accessible online.  
</footnote>3 8 
</p>
<p> IV. The role of national human rights institutions in the protection of human rights  
defenders  ................................................................................................................  84&#8211;<footnote name="11">. On 8-9 March 2012, the Special Rapporteur took part in the intermechanisms 
meeting, which was also attended by representatives of the African Commission on Human 
and People's Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Council of 
Europe and the European Commission. The event took place in Geneva and was hosted by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). 
</footnote>4 15 
</p>
<p>  A. Formal complaints mechanisms and protection programmes .........................  85&#8211;<footnote name="9">4. In other cases, national institutions engage actively with Government authorities to 
create awareness about defenders and the importance of their work. The National Human 
Rights Commission of India has organized workshops, trainings and seminars with State 
officials to sensitize them in this regard. </footnote>0 15 
</p>
<p>  B. Advocacy in favour of a conducive work environment for defenders ............  91&#8211;<footnote name="9">3. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission works with advocacy 
committees made up of NGOs in Afghanistan to advocate for increased respect for human 
rights, including the protection of human rights defenders.  
</footnote>4 16 
</p>
<p>  C. Interaction with international and regional mechanisms ................................  95&#8211;<footnote name="9">2. Some national institutions have entrusted their focal points for human rights 
defenders to monitor the legal framework affecting their activities. The human rights 
defenders desk within the Uganda Human Rights Commission reviews draft legislation 
relevant to defenders on a regular basis, informing the Commission&#8217;s inputs to the 
Government in this context. 
</footnote>7 17 
</p>
<p>  D. Public support in cases of violations against human rights defenders ............  98&#8211;<footnote name="10">6. The Special Rapporteur receives information every year about disputes between 
human rights defenders and Government authorities or other parts of society. Typically, 
conflicts involve local governance issues, including land and environmental rights, as well 
as labour conditions and workers&#8217; rights. 
</footnote>2 17 
</p>
<p>  E. Visits to prisons and detention centres and provision of legal assistance .......  103&#8211;<footnote name="10">1. A less immediate measure applied by several national institutions is reporting on the 
situation of human rights defenders as part of their annual report. The national institutions 
in India and Uganda reported that this is done on a systematic basis, and the Special 
Rapporteur considers this a good practice in terms of creating public awareness around the 
situation of defenders and the challenges they face in their work. </footnote>5 18 
</p>
<p>  F. Conflict mediation ..........................................................................................  106&#8211;<footnote name="10">0. A great number of national institutions have established forums to facilitate dialogue 
and cooperation with civil society, for example through advisory councils and working 
groups on various themes. The Office of the Ombudsman in El Salvador reports that such 
coordination has led to joint action on various human rights issues in the country, including 
joint public statements. The Special Rapporteur observes that such joint actions should also 
be taken in response to violations perpetrated against human rights defenders. 
</footnote>8 18 
</p>
<p>  G. Capacity strengthening for human rights defenders........................................  109&#8211;<footnote name="1">8. On 13 and 14 April 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in a regional 
consultation in Cairo, Egypt, with human rights defenders from the Middle East and North 
Africa organized by the International Service for Human Rights and the Cairo Institute for 
Human Rights Studies  
</footnote>14 19 
</p>
<p> V.  Conclusions and recommendations .........................................................................  115&#8211;<footnote name="1">7. From 23 to 25 March 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Movies that 
Matter Festival, an initiative of Amnesty International where human rights take centre stage 
through a wide-ranging programme of films, held in The Hague, Netherlands.  
</footnote>23 19 
</p>
<p>  A. Conclusions ....................................................................................................  115&#8211;<footnote name="1">6. The Special Rapporteur continued the fruitful cooperation of the mandate holder 
with civil society at national, regional and international levels. The Special Rapporteur 
regrets that, due to time constraints, she was unable to participate in all the conferences and 
seminars to which she was invited. On occasions where the Special Rapporteur could not be 
present herself, she endeavoured, to the extent possible, to have an OHCHR staff member 
participate.  
</footnote>18 19 
</p>
<p>  B. Recommendations ...........................................................................................  119&#8211;<footnote name="1">0. Following the publication of her online commentary to the Declaration on the Right 
and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Declaration on human 
rights defenders) in July 2011, the Special Rapporteur applauds the fact that during 2012 
unofficial translations were made by the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network into 
Arabic and by the OHCHR offices in Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico into Spanish. The 
Special Rapporteur is deeply grateful to the organizations concerned for their work in this 
regard, which will facilitate the dissemination of the commentary and the Declaration. Both 
unofficial translations and the original publication are available in the section on the work 
of the Special Rapporteur at the website of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).<footnote name="2">5. With this report, the Special Rapporteur intends to highlight the vital role played by 
national institutions in the promotion and protection of human rights and provide 
recommendations, in particular to States and national institutions, with a view to ensuring 
that these institutions operate in an environment that is conducive for them to carry out their 
activities.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the fifth submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
Rapporteur, and the thirteenth thematic report submitted by the mandate holder on human 
rights defenders since 2000. The report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolutions 7/8 and 16/5.  
</p>
<p>2. Since the inception of the mandate, the key role played by national human rights 
institutions in the promotion and protection of human rights has continuously been 
emphasized.  As independent public bodies, national institutions can play an important part 
in advising Governments on national developments in the light of their human rights 
obligations as well as mainstreaming international human rights principles and standards in 
public law and policymaking. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that national 
institutions can be considered as human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>3. In addition, the interaction between such institutions and individuals and 
associations acting in defence of human rights has always been considered essential by the 
mandate holder.  National institutions can cooperate with defenders to assess the human 
rights situation on the ground and ensure accountability for human rights violations.  As 
emphasized by the Special Rapporteur in her 2010 report to the Human Rights Council, 
national institutions, especially those mandated to receive complaints and follow individual 
cases, can be powerful allies of human rights defenders and contribute significantly to their 
protection if needed.<footnote name="1">A/HRC/13/22, para. 108. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>4. After providing an overview of her activities during the reporting period, the Special 
Rapporteur briefly outlines her approach to national human rights institutions and the 
methodology used in the current report. She then focuses on the vital role played by 
national institutions in the promotion and protection of human rights. She goes on to 
provide observations on the current mechanisms in place within these institutions to protect 
human rights defenders. In the last section, the Special Rapporteur provides her conclusions 
and recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities during the reporting period 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Communications transmitted to States 
</b></p>
<p>5. Between 1 December 2011 and 30 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur sent 252 
communications. Communications were sent to 83 States, and, at the time of writing, 104 
responses had been received, which indicates only a 41 per cent response rate. In addition, 
the Special Rapporteur received 40 responses to communications sent prior to the current 
reporting period. Observations on communications sent during the period and on the 
corresponding responses by Governments are included in addendum 4 to the present report 
(A/HRC/22/47/Add.4).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>6. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur visited Honduras from 7 to 14 
February 2012; Tunisia from 27 September to 5 October 2012; and Ireland from 19 to 23 
</p>

<p>November 2012. Separate reports on these visits have been submitted to the 22nd session of 
the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>  Pending requests

Nam (2012) and Zimbabwe (2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2011). The Special Rapporteur 
regrets that some of these requests are long-standing, and hopes that States will give due 
attention to all her requests in a timely manner.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Governments of Mongolia and Turkey for having 
accepted her requests to visit in 2013. The modalities and dates of these visits are currently 
being negotiated.  Concerning her request to visit Turkey, the Special Rapporteur hopes that 
sufficient time will be given to her in order to assess the situation of defenders in a 
thorough and impartial manner. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with the United Nations system and intergovernmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur has continued to place particular emphasis on cooperation 
with all bodies of the United Nations and other regional intergovernmental human rights 
organizations. 
</p>

<p>12. On 26 June 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the annual full-day 
discussion on women&#8217;s human rights at the twentieth session of the Human Rights Council, 
in a panel discussion concerning women human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>13. From 27 September to 5 October 2012, the Special Rapporteur conducted a joint 
country visit to Tunisia with the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders in Africa, of 
the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, resulting in a joint statement at 
</p>
<p>the end of the visit.3 The observations and recommendations of the United Nations Special 
Rapporteur are presented to the Human Rights Council as an annex to the current report 
(A/HRC/22/47/Add.<footnote name="2">4. Interaction between national institutions and individuals and associations working 
for the defence and promotion of human rights is essential.  National institutions can work 
in tandem with defenders to assess the human rights situation on the ground and ensure 
accountability for human rights violations, hence becoming an essential actor in the fight 
against impunity. These institutions can also play a vital role in ensuring adequate 
protection for defenders when needed.   
</footnote>). 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur was scheduled to present her fifth report to the General 
Assembly (A/67/292) on 29 October 2012.  Due to Hurricane Sandy, the Special 
Rapporteur regretfully had to cancel her participation at the General Assembly, and the 
Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights kindly read out her statement on 2 
November 2012. The report focused on the use of legislation to regulate the activities on 
human rights defenders, including the most common restrictions faced by human rights 
defenders in the context of different sorts of legislation. The report provided 
recommendations to States to ensure legislation respects the rights of defenders, as well as 
guidance on procedural and other safeguards to be followed in the implementation of 
legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Invitations by Governments 
</b></p>
<p>15. From 6 to 8 June 2012, the Special Rapporteur, together with other independent 
experts, participated in a seminar entitled &#8220;Human Rights Defenders and Peaceful Protests&#8221; 
organized by the Governments of Norway and Switzerland in cooperation with the 
International Service for Human Rights, which was held in Oslo, Norway. The Special 
Rapporteurs present issued a joint statement on human rights defenders and peaceful 
protests following the meeting.4 
</p>
<p><b> E. Cooperation with non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>

<p>19. On 19 April 2012, an OHCHR staff member participated in the conference entitled 
&#8220;The Internationalization of the Protection of Human Rights and Human Rights Defenders&#8221; 
</p>
<p>organized by Lawyers Without Borders in London, United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur was the keynote speaker at a regional conference organized 
by the OHCHR Regional Office for the Middle East in Beirut, Lebanon, on 22 and 23 May 
2012 to promote enhanced respect for fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>21. On 18 June 2012, the Special Rapporteur hosted a round table in Geneva in 
collaboration with Protection International on national mechanisms and public policies for 
the protection of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>22. On 24 and 25 October 2012, an OHCHR staff member participated in a conference 
in London, United Kingdom, organized by Peace Brigades International entitled &#8220;Women 
Human Rights Defenders: Empowering and Protecting the Change-makers&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> III. National human rights institutions</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>23. As independent public bodies, ideally established by the Constitution and an act of 
Parliament, national institutions are in a unique position to guide Governments regarding 
their human rights obligations and ensure international human rights principles and 
standards are incorporated into the law and mainstreamed and implemented in public 
policymaking.  The Special Rapporteur believes that national institutions which operate in 
compliance with the Paris Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions,<footnote name="5">A/RES/48/134, annex. 
 6 E/CN.4/2006/95, paras. 76-77. </footnote> and 
their members and staff, can be considered as human rights defenders, as they strive to 
promote and protect human rights.  In a number of countries, they face significant 
challenges and are exposed to attacks and threats,6 as well as intimidation, harassment, 
arrest and detention in connection with their human rights activities.  On a number of 
occasions, the Special Rapporteur and her predecessor have expressed concerns about the 
challenges faced by members and staff of national institutions both through 
communications sent to Governments and in recommendations issued after country visits. 
</p>

<p>weaker areas of engagement for national human rights institutions&#8221;. According to the 
survey, only about 62 per cent of respondents had activities specifically designed for 
defenders.  The importance of strengthening the capacity of national institutions in this area 
has already been highlighted.<footnote name="7">5. Some of them have quasi-judicial powers to investigate any individual complaint 
and provide effective protection and remedies to victims.  Some institutions have the power 
to issue interim protective measures for human rights defenders (Mexico). </footnote>  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur intends to assess existing initiatives in this respect and 
provide recommendations to States and national institutions on how to protect defenders 
more effectively. To this end, the Special Rapporteur sent questionnaires to States, national 
institutions and human rights defenders. She is very grateful for the large number of 
responses received and would like to thank all stakeholders for their time and interest.  
Responses to the questionnaires can be consulted in their entirety as received on the website 
of the mandate.<footnote name="8">6. The Special Rapporteur has on previous occasions provided observations and 
guidelines on national protection mechanisms and other formal protection programmes (see 
A/HRC/13/22, paras. 70-83). Several national institutions reported that they are involved in 
such mechanisms. In Mexico, both the National Human Rights Commission and some 
institutions at state level are involved in protection programmes of this sort. At state level, 
the most developed appears to be the Human Rights Commission of the Federal District 
(Mexico City), which has had a unit dedicated to human rights defenders since 2007.  
</footnote> Examples highlighted in chapters III and IV are largely taken from the 
responses to the questionnaire and referenced specifically only when they are documented 
elsewhere. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The Paris Principles and beyond 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Paris Principles (1991) are a set of minimum standards that national institutions, 
regardless of their structure and mandate, should respect.  They are now broadly accepted 
as benchmarks for the accreditation of national institutions and a litmus test of an 
institution&#8217;s legitimacy.<footnote name="9">9. Examples reported to the Special Rapporteur include the Institution of the Human 
Rights Defender of Armenia, which issued statements on the occasion of attacks against a 
human rights defender in April 2012 and called for prompt and impartial investigation of 
the case by the Government. 
</footnote>   
</p>
<p>29. The network of national institutions was formally established in 1993 as the 
International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights (ICC).  ICC, through its Bureau, coordinates the activities of 
the national institutions, accredits its members and assists them in various ways, including 
by recommending the provision of technical assistance.  
</p>
<p>30. ICC has four Regional Coordinating Committees representing and supporting 
national institutions at the regional level. They are responsible for nominating members to 
the Bureau as well as to the positions of Chairperson and Secretary of ICC. A 
representative of each regional network, known as Regional Coordinator, acts as the 
regional focal point on the Bureau and works closely with the Chairperson in the 
implementation of decisions.  
</p>
<p>31. The Paris Principles require that national institutions work in the promotion and 
protection of human rights, including by receiving and investigating complaints, mediating 
in conflicts, and raising awareness about human rights.  The Paris Principles establish six 
main criteria for fully functioning national institutions, that is, broad mandate and 
competence; autonomy from Government in their functioning and methods of operation;  
independence, which should be enshrined by law or in the Constitution; pluralism through 
membership or cooperation; adequate financial, material and human resources; and 
adequate powers of investigation.  
</p>
<p>32. The Paris Principles also acknowledge the importance of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) in &#8220;expanding the work of the national institution&#8221; and encourage 
national institutions to establish relations with civil society.  This interaction can assist

<p>national institutions in protecting their independence and pluralism, thereby enhancing their 
effectiveness and reinforcing their legitimacy.10  
</p>
<p>33. In addition to the Paris Principles, the ICC Sub-Committee on Accreditation has 
adopted general observations,11 which provide further guidance on how to interpret and 
implement the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National human rights institutions as human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur considers that national institutions which operate in 
compliance with the Paris Principles and their members and staff, can be considered as 
human rights defenders.   She is aware that they face important challenges and are exposed 
to attacks, threats, intimidation and harassment in connection to their human rights 
activities.   
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur and her predecessor have expressed concerns about the 
challenges faced by members and staff of national institutions on a number of occasions. In 
connection with the country visit to Guatemala in 2008, the issue of members and staff of 
national institutions often being the victims of threats or attacks was raised in the report.12   
</p>
<p>36. Furthermore, the mandate has sent a number of communications to Governments on 
reported attacks against staff of national institutions while conducting an inquiry 
(Philippines, 2008);13 threats to the life of a chairperson of an institution for reporting on 
abuses by security forces (Kenya, 2008);14 alleged acts of intimidation, harassment and 
reprisals against the head of a national institution who cooperated with the former mandate 
holder during a country visit (Indonesia, 2007),15 a reported case of harassment of the 
Chairperson of an institution for his engagement with ICC (Malawi, 2012),16 and the 
reported undue interference of the Government in the extension of the mandate of the head 
of a national institution (France, 2009).17   
</p>
<p>37. The responses received to the questionnaire sent by the Special Rapporteur indicate 
that national institutions face considerable challenges and constraints when discharging 
their functions to promote and protect human rights, including when interacting with human 
rights defenders, which could seriously undermine their independence, efficiency and 
legitimacy. Despite their institutional and thematic diversity, reported challenges relate 
inter alia to the mandates of the institutions and their implementation; to composition, 
selection and appointment of members and staff; to conditions of tenure; and to the 
availability of resources. The responses have also served to identify examples of good 
practice. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Mandate and competence 
</b></p>
<p>38. As stated in the Paris Principles, mandates entrusted to national institutions should 
be broad, set forth in a constitutional or legislative text specifying its composition and

<p>sphere of competence. The mandate should be clearly stated and include the promotion and 
protection of human rights, which is the case for many national institutions, such as 
Afghanistan, Canada, Nicaragua, Nigeria, South Africa and Uruguay, among others.   
</p>
<p>39. However, there are instances where the mandate of national institutions is reportedly 
established by a royal decree (Morocco), a presidential decree (Algeria, Kazakhstan) or an 
executive order (Philippines).  
</p>
<p>40. Moreover, limitations to the mandate or sphere of competence of national 
institutions have been reported in some cases which include restrictions to their jurisdiction, 
such as limitations on the type of issue they can handle. Other restrictions concern the 
branches of the State or the type of actors they can monitor, notably military and private 
actors in some cases exempted from the oversight of national institutions.  
</p>
<p>41. Several national institutions are not empowered to investigate complaints against the 
Head of State and Parliament (Hungary, Kazakhstan, Philippines). The national institution 
of the Philippines is limited to consideration of violations of civil and political rights, 
although the institution has managed to work on economic, social and cultural rights under 
its Omnibus Rules of Procedure.  It is also reported that the national institution in India 
cannot deal directly with members of the armed forces and has to seek reports from the 
Ministry/ Departments with competence over them.  
</p>
<p>42.  As established by the Paris Principles, the mandate of national institutions should 
include preparing and submitting reports to relevant international bodies, including the 
Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council and the Treaty Bodies, as well as 
interacting with regional and international human rights mechanisms, including with the 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council. This is the case for the mandate of the 
national institution in Canada and, while not as specific, that in Afghanistan.   
</p>
<p>43. The mandate of national institutions should also be clear enough to avoid any 
overlap or confusion with the mandate and work of other branches of the State or human 
rights-related bodies, such as thematic human rights commissions (India, Indonesia) or 
human rights institutions at the constituent unit level18 in federal States (Canada, Mexico, 
South Africa).  As stated by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation in its general 
observations, national institutions should cooperate with other statutory bodies, coordinate 
their work and share information with them.   
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur would like to highlight the fact that several national 
institutions reported facing important challenges when trying to ensure adequate 
implementation of and follow-up to their recommendations. In the absence of necessary 
provisions in the statutory framework obliging the Government and other public bodies to 
formally respond to their recommendations, implementation of such appears to be a 
problem (South Africa). This is likely to be the case with most institutions which are 
provided with a limited consultative or advisory type of mandate (Germany, Kazakhstan), 
which could undermine their impact and effectiveness.   
</p>
<p>45. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the credibility and legitimacy of national 
institutions is certainly strengthened if their mandate originates from a legislative act of 
Parliament, is clear and broad, including interaction with regional and United Nations 
human rights mechanisms and establishing coordination mechanisms with other relevant 
human rights bodies. The mandates of national institutions should state their jurisdiction, 
and they should be accountable to Parliament through the submission of a periodic report 
</p>
<p>  
 18 This refers to the states, provinces or cantons within federal systems.  For more details, refer to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;National human rights institutions in federal States.  A study for the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights&#8221; (September 2011). </p>


<p>on activities which should be discussed by the legislature, made public and disseminated by 
all necessary means. Appropriate provisions should be made in order to allow effective 
implementation and follow-up to the recommendations made by national institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Autonomy from Government and independence 
</b></p>
<p>46. National institutions should be able to work independently, without interference of 
any sort from the authorities or other branches of the State.  In this connection, the Paris 
Principles and the general observations of the Sub-Committee on Accreditation provide 
substantive guidance on how to strengthen the organizational and operational structure of 
institutions with the aim of ensuring their autonomy and independence.   
</p>
<p>47. The criteria and processes for nomination, appointment and security of tenure of the 
members of the governing bodies of these institutions should be established and controlled 
by Parliament. They should ensure an open and transparent process for nomination and 
appointment. The Sub-Committee on Accreditation has indicated that the participation of 
members of Government in national institutions should be limited to an advisory capacity 
and that no secondments of civil servants should be allowed. Tenure should be secure and 
dismissal only possible in exceptional and clearly defined circumstances.   
</p>
<p>48. The participation of civil society, including defenders, and other relevant 
stakeholders in the nomination and appointment process is also considered essential in 
order to ensure independence and autonomy.  This is the case in various countries and 
national institutions, which positively affects the degree of pluralism of the institutions and 
enhances their credibility.  In this connection, through the responses to her questionnaire, 
the Special Rapporteur has identified various examples of good practices in relation to the 
criteria and process of nomination and appointment of members of governing bodies of 
national institutions.   
</p>
<p>49. For example, the position of Commissioner of the national institution in Canada is 
widely advertised when vacant, and anyone can apply. In Uruguay, the law establishes that 
the members of the national institution can be nominated by NGOs, which is also widely 
the case in practice. In New Zealand, the criteria for appointment of Commissioners are 
clearly established in the regulatory framework and groups and individuals can nominate 
candidates. In South Africa, an ad-hoc Parliamentary Committee is set up to interview 
potential Commissioners following a nationwide public announcement of the vacancies.  
Interviews take place in public and civil society organizations are allowed to attend.   
</p>
<p>50. In the development of the law establishing the Irish Human Rights and Equality 
Commission, which was yet to be adopted at the time this report was finalized, it was 
emphasized that its independence would be strengthened if it was empowered to recruit its 
own staff and that there should be no civil service secondment at senior level to the body.19 
</p>
<p>51. On the other hand, it has also been reported that the selection process for members 
of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines is not defined in its regulatory 
framework.  This lack of procedure reportedly allows for the President to be the only 
authority entitled to nominate and appoint its members.  The Commission is advocating for 
the adoption of the &#8220;Commission on Human Rights Charter&#8221; precisely to strengthen its 
</p>
<p>organizational, operational and fiscal structure, including the procedure for selection and 
appointment of its members.  
</p>
<p>  
 19 Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, &#8220;Report on hearings in relation to the 
</p>
<p>Scheme of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill&#8221; (July 2012).  </p>


<p>52. In India, the Chairperson and members of the national institution are appointed by 
the President on the recommendations of a Committee formed by the Prime Minister as a 
Chair and members of the ruling party as well as the opposition parties.  It is reported that 
consultations are carried out by the members of the Committee in order to ensure consensus 
in the nominations. After her visit to India, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the 
functioning of the national commission be strengthened by, inter alia, broadening the 
selection criteria for the appointment of the Chair and diversifying the composition of the 
Commission, including regarding gender.20  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that, as underlined by the Sub-
Committee on Accreditation, the selection of staff working for national institutions should 
be carried out by the national institution itself.   
</p>
<p>54. The Sub-Committee on Accreditation has strongly recommended that provision be 
included in legislation to protect members and staff of national institutions from legal 
liability for official actions.  The Special Rapporteur believes that privileges and 
immunities for members and the staff of national institutions discharging their functions in 
good faith are an important safeguard, allowing them to carry out their activities without 
undue interference.   
</p>
<p>55. It has been reported that members and staff of the Uganda Human Rights 
Commission enjoy immunity from civil proceedings for any act done in good faith in the 
performance of their duties.  In some cases, members of the governing body enjoy 
immunities but provisions regarding staff are unclear (Togo, Jordan). In Panama, a decision 
of the Supreme Court in 1998 declared the immunities of the head of office 
unconstitutional.  In Egypt, the legislative framework that established the National Council 
for Human Rights (Law No. 94, 2003) does not provide immunities for its staff members, 
including the President and Vice-President. The institution in Egypt has proposed 
amendments to the existing legislation to address this shortcoming.   
</p>
<p>56. An illustration of the serious challenges that the staff working for a national 
institutions face is the reported case of the arbitrary detention of three staff working for the 
national institution in El Salvador while verifying the deportation of a non-national in 2005.   
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that national institutions with a broad and 
clear mandate are able to work independently and more effectively, leading to a higher 
degree of legitimacy among their constituencies.  She also considers that all members and 
staff of national institutions should enjoy immunity from civil and criminal proceedings 
while discharging their functions in good faith to avoid undue liabilities and restrictions in 
the conduct of their legitimate human rights work. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Adequate resources 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Paris Principles also indicate that national institutions should have adequate 
infrastructure and funding in order for them to have their own staff and premises and be 
financially independent from the Government.  The source and nature of funding must be 
clearly stated and secured in the regulatory framework. The institution should be able to 
manage its funding independently. The Sub-Committee on Accreditation provides 
additional details on what adequate funding should include, as a minimum.21    
</p>
<p>  
 20 A/HRC/19/55/Add.1, para. 149. 
 21 <i>National Human Rights Institutions</i> (see note 7 above), annex IV. </p>


<p>59. The Special Rapporteur and her predecessor have raised the issue of lack of financial 
and human resources in several reports following fact-finding visits (Armenia, Honduras, 
Ireland, Togo and the Democratic Republic of Congo).22  
</p>
<p>60. It is reported that some national institutions have discretion to propose their own 
budgets to legislators (Uruguay).  In the case of the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights, 
the draft budget is made public when submitted to Parliament for approval.   
</p>
<p>61. However, responses to the questionnaire sent by the Special Rapporteur indicate that 
there are instances where the financial autonomy of national institutions has been 
challenged and/or revoked (Panama and the Philippines) by the Supreme Court. This has 
had an important impact on the independence and capacity of the institutions. 
</p>
<p>62. It has been widely reported that national institutions face financial constraints of 
various sorts. In some countries, there are limitations to the type of expense to be covered 
under public budgets, such as in Jordan, where the budget allocated is only meant to cover 
operational costs and not activities. This severely undermines the capacity of national 
institutions to interact with defenders, amongst other things.   
</p>
<p>63. In other countries, national institutions claim to be financially ill-resourced in 
general which, in some instances, amounts to lack of basic office equipment (Burkina Faso) 
or means that they are not able to be fully operational in the regions, thereby restricting 
opportunities for interaction with grass-roots organizations (South Africa). An extreme 
situation would be the case of the national institution in El Salvador which, 20 years after 
its establishment, does not have premises of its own.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is conscious of the fact that the financial crisis in 2008 and 
the economic recession that followed have led to drastic cuts in public expenditure affecting 
the public sector in general, including national institutions. Nevertheless, she strongly 
recommends that national institutions be adequately resourced and be able to propose and 
manage their own budgets independently. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Composition and pluralism 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Paris Principles establish that the composition of a national institution and the 
appointment of its members should ensure a pluralistic representation of the actors involved 
in the promotion and protection of human rights. NGOs working on human rights issues are 
acknowledged specifically in this context. The Sub-Committee on Accreditation 
emphasizes the importance for national institutions of keeping regular contact with civil 
society and acknowledges that pluralism can be achieved in various ways.   
</p>
<p>66. National institutions should therefore be inclusive and accessible to the different 
constituencies.  This could be reflected at the level of the composition of their membership 
and staff, but also in the ways they interact with the main stakeholders, including defenders 
and activists.  Interaction with civil society will reinforce the credibility and legitimacy of 
the institution and can certainly strengthen the design and implementation of its activities.   
</p>
<p>67. As mentioned, members of the national institution in Uruguay are usually nominated 
by NGOs, and all five current members come from the NGO sector.  In New Zealand, civil 
society is part of the interview panels for the selection of members of the national 
institution.   
</p>
<p>  
 22 In alphabetical order: Armenia (A/HRC/16/44/Add.2); Honduras (A/HRC/22/47/Add.1); Ireland 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/22/47/Add.3); Togo (A/HRC/10/12/Add.2); Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(A/HRC/13/22/Add.2). </p>


<p>68. The national institution in India is composed of members who have occupied high-
level seats in the judiciary, which is reported to ensure their credibility and also serve as a 
protective mechanism. Similarly, the Executive Secretary of the Governing Council of the 
Nigerian Human Rights Commission is to be a retired judge or a lawyer with relevant 
experience, although other members of the Council can include representatives from human 
rights organizations, journalists, trade unions and the Bar Association. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that the composition of the governing body of a national institution 
should be as diverse as possible, including representatives from civil society and people 
with relevant human rights experience. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur has stated on various occasions that standard operating 
procedures to ensure interaction with civil society in the work of national institutions are 
important and can endorse the legitimacy of the work of defenders (Indonesia, 2007).  In 
this connection, she has recommended the establishment of a focal point on human rights 
defenders and systematic consultation with civil society (Armenia, 2010).   
</p>
<p>70. In the responses to her questionnaire, it has been reported that some national 
institutions have a dedicated focal point or desk for human rights defenders (India, 
Philippines and Uganda).  Others report having a service dealing specifically with external 
stakeholders, including human rights defenders (New Zealand).  Some institutions are 
mandated to establish relations with civil society working in relevant areas (Afghanistan 
and Mexico) and do so by establishing agreements and memoranda of understanding with 
NGOs for promotion, protection and capacity-building activities.   
</p>
<p>71. Some national institutions have reported that they have regular contact and meetings 
with defenders and civil society networks and organize different types of events and 
activities in coordination with them (Jordan, Sri Lanka).  In certain countries, national 
institutions establish advisory groups which include defenders in their composition 
(Norway), in some cases with thematic focus (Serbia, Ukraine).  Other institutions report 
that they encourage civil society to establish advocacy committees to increase synergies 
with the institution (Afghanistan). 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that regulatory frameworks for national 
institutions should mandate the establishment of a permanent, dedicated focal point for 
human rights defenders.  Ideally, they should also encourage the collection of disaggregated 
data on violations against them and the establishment of a protection programme taking into 
account their specific profile and risks. In addition, she considers that the existence of 
regional or local offices of the institution established in the regions, either permanent 
(South Africa, Uganda) or itinerant (New Zealand), certainly makes the institution more 
accessible to local, grass-roots organizations and defenders working in remote areas. The 
Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of such local offices being responsive to 
complaints received. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Adequate powers of investigation  
</b></p>
<p>73. The Paris Principles contain additional guidance for national institutions with a 
mandate to hear and consider individual complaints and petitions.   
</p>
<p>74. From the responses to the questionnaire, the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note 
that most national institutions are entrusted by law to receive individual complaints on 
alleged violations of human rights.  Most commonly, national institutions can receive 
individual complaints and are able to conduct an enquiry and then refer the matter to the 
specialized body or to the courts to obtain a binding decision (El Salvador, India).    
</p>

<p>76. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that national institutions should be mandated 
to receive and consider individual complaints, including visiting detention centres.  In 
addition, institutions should have a specific protection programme to address the situation 
and allegations of violations against human rights defenders. Further observations in this 
regard are provided in Chapter IV. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Protection of national institutions against attacks, harassment, threats and 
</b></p>
<p><b>intimidation 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur is aware that members and staff of national institutions face 
different levels of harassment and intimidation by State and non-State actors due to their 
human rights-related work.  As stated above, she has been apprised of cases in various 
instances and has acted upon them.  Moreover, responses to the questionnaire also contain 
information that confirms this trend, which is a source of great concern to the Special 
Rapporteur.   
</p>
<p>78. It is reported that members and staff working for national institutions have faced 
attacks, including armed attacks, while conducting investigations (the Philippines), 
including by members of the police (Panama).  In other instances, they have been attacked 
and threatened by private individuals who come to enquire about their services (Canada, 
South Africa). Members and staff of institutions have also been harassed and intimidated by 
members of the Government or other branches of the State. In one instance, a 
Commissioner was summoned by the Supreme Court and in another instance suspended by 
the Attorney General&#8217;s Office in connection with their work (Afghanistan).   
</p>
<p>79. There are also instances of reported retaliation against staff working for national 
institutions in the form of administrative and legal actions against them, such as an 
inspection by tax authorities or retention of salaries, or legal action on the part of private 
businesses immediately after an enquiry (Hungary).   
</p>
<p>80. National institutions report that they use the existing channels to raise situations of 
threats, harassment and intimidation towards their staff, including the corresponding 
complaint with the police or relevant authority.  Some indicate that they resort to the 
highest levels of Government to try to dilute tensions.   
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur welcomes steps taken by the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, which conducted a Threat and Risk Assessment in 2008 and has reportedly 
implemented various measures to guarantee the security of its staff, including access 
control through card-activated locks to all its offices; live monitoring; full-time security 
guards; panic buttons connected to the police; and self-protection and risk awareness 
training for staff.   
</p>
<p>82. In addition, the legal framework of the Canadian Commission includes a provision 
to consider it a discriminatory practice on the part of a person against whom a complaint 
has been filed, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation 
against the individual who filed the complaint or against the alleged victim.  Under the 
regulatory act, any person who threatens, intimidates or discriminates against an individual 
who has made a complaint is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a 
fine not exceeding $50,000.  
</p>

<p><b> IV. The role of national human rights institutions in the 
protection of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>84. National human rights institutions can potentially play a substantive role in 
protecting human rights defenders. The Special Rapporteur has recommended on numerous 
occasions that such institutions establish a focal point for human rights defenders with the 
responsibility of ensuring their protection.23 Protection constitutes a wide range of possible 
measures and interventions, including formal complaints mechanisms and protection 
programmes; advocacy in favour of a conducive work environment for defenders; public 
support when violations against defenders are perpetrated; visits to defenders in detention 
or prison and provision of legal aid in this context; mediation when conflicts occur between 
defenders and other parts of society; and strengthening of the capacity of defenders to 
ensure their own security. The Special Rapporteur has noted a number of commendable 
initiatives taken by national institutions which are detailed below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Formal complaints mechanisms and protection programmes 
</b></p>
<p>85. The most common measure by national institutions to ensure protection of human 
rights defenders appears to be complaints mechanisms. Most national institutions are 
mandated to receive complaints from individuals whose rights have been violated, with 
some also allowed to receive petitions from representatives of victims and associations. The 
majority of the institutions which responded to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire 
indicated that defenders could present complaints to them using the same channels as other 
individuals.  
</p>

<p>perform a number of services which are available to defenders and other individuals, 
including legal assistance, witness protection, financial assistance and medical assistance to 
victims of violations. The Philippines Commission noted that it is working on consolidating 
its services available to defenders, which include a focal point for cases pertaining to them. 
Submissions from NGOs confirmed that such consolidation is needed. 
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur notes that in a number of Member States where national 
institutions have resources dedicated specifically to the protection of human rights 
defenders, she has received information indicating a lack of effectiveness, responsiveness 
and transparency in the proceedings. Human rights defenders have in many cases reported 
that once a complaint is lodged with the institution, it is difficult to find out what action has 
been taken, if any. National institutions should ensure transparency in complaints handling, 
especially in urgent cases. The example referred to above of the recommendations of the 
institution being made public is commendable, although this needs to be assessed according 
to the situation in order to ensure the security of the defender(s) affected is not 
compromised. It is also important that national institutions clearly communicate to human 
rights defenders what sort of protection they are able to provide them in order to manage 
expectations and ensure defenders can do a proper security assessment in relation to their 
own situation.  
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about accounts of a lack of responsiveness and 
effectiveness among national institutions in their response to violations reported by human 
rights defenders, as this discourages defenders from filing cases under the mechanisms that 
were designed to protect them. She reiterates the importance of institutions working closely 
with civil society in the development of protection policies (A/HRC/13/22, para. 113(a)). 
Comprehensive policies and guidelines on protection of human rights defenders should be 
developed and disseminated by national human rights institutions. Furthermore, resources 
dedicated to the protection of defenders need to be sufficient, and national institutions 
should reflect this in their proposed budgets to Governments. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Advocacy in favour of a conducive work environment for defenders 
</b></p>
<p>91. As provided for in the Paris Principles, a key function of national institutions should 
be their ability to pronounce opinions and recommendations on the domestic legal 
framework in an effort to bring this into compliance with the country&#8217;s international human 
</p>
<p>rights obligations. In several Member States, national institutions have fulfilled this 
function in a proactive manner. For example, in Serbia, the Protector of Citizens drafted on 
its own initiative a law to ensure whistle-blowers are protected from retaliation when 
submitting complaints to public authorities. 
</p>

<p><b> C. Interaction with international and regional mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>95. The advocacy activities of national institutions are not limited to the national level. 
These institutions have also participated actively in international forums such as the Human 
Rights Council, treaty bodies and the Universal Periodic Review. The Special Rapporteur 
notes with appreciation that, for example, in the preparation of submission to the Universal 
Periodic Review, many national institutions have consulted and cooperated closely with 
human rights defenders. Among recent examples, the National Human Rights Commission 
of India closely consulted civil society in the preparation of its report for the review of 
India in 2012 (A/HRC/WG.6/13/IND/1, also confirmed by reports from civil society), and 
the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice in Ghana (see 
A/HRC/WG.6/14/GHA/3) prepared a joint submission with a prominent network of human 
rights organizations for the review of the country in the same year. The Special Rapporteur 
believes such cooperation strengthens the visibility and credibility of human rights 
defenders, thereby contributing to their protection.  
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur has found few examples of national institutions including 
information on the situation of human rights defenders in their reports under the Universal 
Periodic Review. She recommends institutions strengthen this aspect in their reports. 
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur also observes that few national institutions provide 
information to her mandate or regional mechanisms authorized to monitor the situation of 
human rights defenders, even though a number of cases raised in their annual reports relate 
to defenders. The Special Rapporteur recommends national institutions make use of such 
international mechanisms when they deem it appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Public support in cases of violations against human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>98. When violations are perpetrated against defenders, in the form of threats, 
harassment, attacks and others, it is commonplace for human rights associations to make 
public statements condemning such acts. The Paris Principles stipulate that national human 
rights institutions should be in a position to address public opinion directly or through the 
press in order to convey to the public its opinions and recommendations (para. 3(c)). In the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this should include denouncing violations suffered by 
</p>
<p>individuals and associations acting to defend human rights as a result of their work, as well 
as voicing public support for this. 
</p>

<p>102. The Special Rapporteur has received disconcerting information that upon receipt of 
complaints, notably in relation to peaceful protests by human rights defenders, certain 
national institutions have deemed such complaints inadmissible on grounds that the 
activities undertaken by defenders were unlawful. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress 
that international standards should be the guiding principles for national institutions. In this 
connection, as long as activities are conducted peacefully and in defence of human rights, 
national institutions should intervene on behalf of defenders. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Visits to prisons and detention centres and provision of legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>103. Numerous national institutions are mandated to conduct visits to prisons and 
detention centres. The Special Rapporteur considers as good practice the ability of such 
institutions to conduct visits without prior authorization. Notably, in cases where human 
rights defenders are detained or imprisoned, national institutions should be able to access 
them without restrictions. Information sharing is important in this context between 
defenders and national institutions. Defenders should notify national institutions if they 
believe they are persecuted and face charges as a result of their peaceful activities in 
defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>104. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission reported that in addition 
to visiting human rights defenders in detention, the institution is in a position to provide 
them with free legal assistance through cooperation with the Afghanistan Bar Association. 
The Special Rapporteur finds this initiative highly commendable and recommends its 
replication in other countries. 
</p>
<p>105. The Institution of the Human Rights Defender in Armenia has entered into formal 
cooperation with NGOs specialized in monitoring of prisons and detention centres. Besides 
strengthening cooperation between the national institution and civil society in this field, the 
NGOs concerned are granted access to prisons, detention centres and other relevant 
institutions. The Special Rapporteur notes that this is a useful way of enhancing 
cooperation with regard to monitoring of prisons and places of detention, including in cases 
where human rights defenders are detained. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Conflict mediation 
</b></p>

<p><b> G. Capacity strengthening for human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>109. The Special Rapporteur has argued on previous occasions (A/HRC/13/22, paras. 67 
and 68) that one of the most important efforts to protect human rights defenders is measures 
taken by defenders themselves. This includes individual security measures related to their 
work and personal life, as well as organizing themselves in networks with other defenders. 
</p>
<p>110. Several national human rights institutions reported that they are engaged in activities 
aimed at strengthening the capacity of human rights defenders to protect themselves and 
otherwise make their work more effective. In Mexico, both the National Human Rights 
Commission and the Human Rights Commission of the Federal District (Mexico City) have 
developed publications which provide guidelines on protection of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>111. In other countries, national institutions are working directly with defenders by 
providing them with technical assistance. The Uganda Human Rights Commission has 
contributed to strengthening the advocacy skills of defenders, and through strategic 
partnerships the institution has secured the participation of defenders and their 
organizations at events and training sessions organized by the commission. The Uganda 
Human Rights Commission also participates in events organized by civil society to 
strengthen links with defenders. The National Human Rights Commission in Togo is also 
engaged in activities organized by NGOs, and the institution has NGOs participate in its 
own activities. 
</p>
<p>112. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission has included the 
strengthening of civil society in its strategic plan. It has identified the capacity of civil 
society to advocate for increased protection of human rights as one of the key elements of 
its interventions in this area and is working actively with NGOs to this end. 
</p>
<p>113. Similarly, the Protector of Citizens in Serbia noted that the institution has a long-
standing tradition of working closely with human rights defenders in advocating for 
legislative changes, organizing campaigns and conferences, and conducting investigations. 
The Protector of Citizens has established permanent advisory councils on several thematic 
issues comprised of human rights defenders, among others. 
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur notes that defenders working in rural areas are marginalized, 
with few means to protect themselves in cases of violation. Certain national institutions 
work to increase awareness of human rights in rural areas, which contributes to a more 
conducive environment for defenders. This is for example the case with the New Zealand 
Human Rights Commission, which has a project designed to build human rights knowledge 
and expertise in regional communities and works in partnership with organizations from 
marginalized groups to promote awareness of the rights of such groups.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>115.<b> As independent public bodies, national human rights institutions are in a 
unique position to hold Governments accountable to their human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international standards and principles in this regard, thereby becoming a vital 
</b></p>
<p><b>actor in the fight against impunity for human rights violations.   
</b></p>
<p>116.<b> As established by the Paris Principles, national human rights institutions 
should have broad and solid mandates and be properly equipped to be able to operate 
</b></p>
<p><b>independently. Credible national institutions are autonomous from the influence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government and ensure pluralism in their composition and activities, particularly </b></p>


<p><b>through effective interaction with civil society organizations working on human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues.  Members and staff of these institutions can be considered as human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders and, as such, should be supported by public authorities and protected if 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed.   
</b></p>
<p>117.<b> National human rights institutions can potentially play a significant role in the 
protection of human rights defenders. Such a role is ensured by national institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>having a robust mandate with competence to receive complaints from individuals and 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations working to defend human rights, investigate such complaints and provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>a wide range of protection measures.  
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> The most common measure applied by national institutions to protect human 
rights defenders appears to be formal complaints mechanisms. Several institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>have established focal points and units dedicated specifically to human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders in recent years. This is highly commendable, but there is a need to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that such entities are adequately resourced and have the capacity to act promptly 
</b></p>
<p><b>when violations against defenders are reported. Their effectiveness and transparency 
</b></p>
<p><b>are crucial in order to ensure such mechanisms are credible in the eyes of those they 
</b></p>
<p><b>are designed to protect. To ensure this, relevant authorities must be responsive to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations issued by the national human rights institution. As these rarely 
</b></p>
<p><b>carry legal responsibility due to the advisory function of the national institution, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments should find ways to implement the recommendations effectively and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promptly. In this connection, it is of great importance that Government officials are 
</b></p>
<p><b>sensitized to the important work of defenders and familiar with the Declaration on 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> To Member States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Should follow the Paris Principles and the advice provided by the Sub- 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee on Accreditation and ICC when it comes to establishing, mandating and 
</b></p>
<p><b>supporting the work on national institutions in order to ensure that institutions are 
</b></p>
<p><b>strong, independent and effective partners in the promotion and protection of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) National human rights institutions should be accountable to Parliament

</b></p>
<p><b>widely disseminated and made easily available to the public; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Appropriate follow-up mechanisms to recommendations issued by 
</b></p>
<p><b>national institutions should be established.  In this connection, it is advisable that 
</b></p>
<p><b>annual reports of national institutions be presented and discussed in Parliament and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that adequate follow-up be entrusted to the corresponding parliamentary committees 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that an interministerial task force be appointed to mainstream their 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations and monitor their implementation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Members and staff working for national institutions should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>considered, in law and in practice, as human rights defenders and, as such, be publicly 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognized and supported by the Government and public authorities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Governments and other branches of the State should refrain from 
</b></p>
<p><b>unduly interfering with the independence and autonomy of national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions. Any instance of intimidation, stigmatization, harassment or attack against

<p><b>members or staff of national institutions should be promptly investigated, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators brought to justice and remedy provided to victims;   </b></p>


<p><b>(f) Effective protection measures or programmes should be in place to 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantee the security of members and staff of national institutions. Both staff and 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>faith; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) National institutions should be given the highest profile possible, beyond

</b></p>
<p><b>mandated to cooperate with them and implement their recommendations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) There should not be any limitations to the jurisdiction of national 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions and they should be able to investigate all allegations of violations by all 
</b></p>
<p><b>branches of the State and all types of actors, including armed forces and private 
</b></p>
<p><b>businesses; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) National human rights institutions should be provided with adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources, financial, material and human, as well as with the necessary autonomy to 
</b></p>
<p><b>propose and manage their own budgets and recruit their own staff; 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>and provide remedy to victims; 
</b></p>
<p>120.<b> To national human rights institutions:

</b></p>
<p><b>the national level, including by making it available and by translating it into local 
</b></p>
<p><b>languages;

<p><b>(b) Should make every effort to sensitize Government officials and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>branches of the State about the provisions of the Declaration on human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders to raise awareness of the important role played by human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b>in society and the protection they are entitled to under international law, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening their capacity to deal effectively with defenders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Should raise awareness among their own members and staff about the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on human rights defenders and about their role as defenders, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>the risks associated to this role as well as basic self-protection measures;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Any instance of intimidation, stigmatization, harassment or attack 
</b></p>
<p><b>against members or staff of the institution should be immediately reported, 
</b></p>
<p><b>documented and processed, including by taking the necessary protection measures at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the institutional level; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Should coordinate actions with other existing national institutions whose 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandates are related to human rights, including thematic commissions or institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the constituent unit level in federal States, in order to create synergies and avoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>unnecessary duplication;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Should interact with defenders and civil society in a regular manner and 
</b></p>
<p><b>include them in the planning and implementation of their activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Should establish a focal point or an entity dedicated to human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders with specific attention to groups of defenders at particular risk such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>women defenders and those working for w</b>omen&#8217;s rights and gender issues; thos<b>e 
</b></p>
<p><b>working on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders working on environmental and land issues; journalists; and lawyers. This

<p><b>violations and to offer necessary protection; </b></p>


<p><b>(h) Should work closely with human rights defenders when setting up, 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing and evaluating programmes and policies aimed at ensuring their 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>adequately resourced and have adequate capacity to respond to and investigate 
</b></p>
<p><b>complaints received in a prompt and impartial manner; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Should ensure that the mechanisms available for protecting human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders are widely known to them and easily accessible through telephone, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Internet, social media and publications. It should be possible to present complaints by 
</b></p>
<p><b>various means, including on the website of the institution, through a hotline and 
</b></p>
<p><b>through text messaging; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Annual reports on activities should be widely disseminated and include a

</b></p>
<p><b>context, relevant references to the regulatory frameworks, main challenges and 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities, and groups most at risk;

<p><b>(l) Should strengthen their interaction with regional and United Nations 
</b></p>

<p><b>protection when needed, and periodically providing reports and/or participating in 
</b></p>
<p><b>their sessions;  
</b></p>
<p>121.<b> To ICC and the regional networks:  
</b></p>
