<p><b>  Report of the United Nations Development Fund for Women 
on the activities of the United Nations Trust Fund in 
Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence 
against Women is a leading multilateral grant-making mechanism supporting 
national and local efforts of Governments and non-governmental organizations to 
end violence against women and girls. Established in 1996 by the General Assembly 
in its resolution 50/166, the United Nations Trust Fund is administered by the 
United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) on behalf of the United 
Nations system. By the end of 2009, it had supported 304 initiatives in 121 
countries and territories with more than $50 million. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission on the Status 
of Women and the thirteenth session of the Human Rights Council describes the 
progress and the achievements of the Fund in 2009, as well as highlights of 
UNIFEM programming with regard to ending violence against women and girls. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>3. The international community is witnessing a historic opportunity to intensify 
progress towards ending violence against women and girls. The issue is now 
prominent on international agendas promoting peace and security, poverty reduction 
and development and human rights. An increasing number of Governments have 
adopted relevant laws, policies and action plans, which have been reinforced at the 
international level by General Assembly and Security Council resolutions1 calling 
for intensified action and recommending multisectoral and sustained approaches to 
ending violence against women and girls. These General Assembly resolutions 
explicitly refer to the importance of continuing to enhance the effectiveness of the 
United Nations Trust Fund as a system-wide funding mechanism and of mobilizing 
greater resources to address the global pandemic of violence against women and 
girls. United Nations reform and the emphasis on &#8220;delivering as one&#8221; are 
galvanizing an increasing number of agencies, funds and programmes to intensify 
their contributions to eliminating violence against women and girls, further 
bolstered by the launch of the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE to End Violence against 
Women campaign.2 
</p>
<p>4. In this context, the United Nations Trust Fund is uniquely positioned to make a 
significant contribution to supporting countries in translating commitments into real 
change in the lives of women and girls on the ground, in line with the Secretary-
General&#8217;s campaign call for action with regard to five national-level outcomes: the 
enforcement of national laws, the implementation of multisectoral action plans,

<p>support for data-collection systems, social mobilization and prevention strategies, 
and addressing sexual violence in conflict situations.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities of the United Nations Trust Fund in Support of 
Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>5. Since its inception, the United Nations Trust Fund has been a key global 
mechanism for catalysing change by supporting innovative strategies for ending 
violence against women and girls. In line with the strategy of the Fund for 2005-
2008, the overall emphasis of its grant-making is on supporting the implementation 
at the global, regional, national and local levels of laws, policies and action plans 
agreed upon by countries to address violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>6. Paragraphs 7 to 35 below summarize progress made in implementing the 
United Nations Trust Fund&#8217;s strategy for 2005-2008, under which the Fund 
continued to operate in 2009 while an external evaluation covering the same period 
was conducted. The present report is set out in accordance with the strategy&#8217;s five 
pillars: impact, involvement, efficiency, knowledge management and capacity 
development, and resource mobilization. Highlights from the external evaluation are 
also presented. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Enhancing impact: supporting the implementation of laws, policies and 
action plans 
</b> 
</p>
<p>7. In order to address the serious gaps in moving from commitment to action to 
end violence against women and girls, the grant-making of the United Nations Trust 
Fund has strategically focused on supporting the implementation of laws, policies 
and action plans. Grantees work to develop the capacity of relevant stakeholders to 
enforce laws and implement policies and to improve service quality for survivors. 
Strategic partnerships broaden and sustain their efforts. Programmes supported 
typically work across sectors, especially those of health, justice, security and 
education, and involve both governmental and non-governmental stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>8. In 2009, the United Nations Trust Fund had a portfolio of 81 active grants, 
covering 76 countries and territories, with a total value of nearly $30 million. These 
included two- to three-year grants approved since 2006 that were still being 
implemented. The region of Latin America and the Caribbean had the largest 
portfolio (24 per cent), followed closely by Africa, and Asia and the Pacific (23 per 
cent each). Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, and Arab States had the smallest portfolios (15 and 8 per cent, respectively), 
and cross-regional programmes accounted for 7 per cent. Paragraphs (a) to (f) below 
present highlights of achievements related to selected grants, based on reports 
received in 2009: 
</p>
<p> (a) <b>Prevention strategies</b>: United Nations Trust Fund grantees use 
prevention to stop violence from occurring altogether. Grantees in Brazil, 
Cambodia, Chile, Egypt, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Rwanda, the Syrian Arab Republic 
and Yemen have used prevention strategies that target the roots of violence by 
empowering women to claim their rights and by enlisting men and boys in efforts to 
change gender norms and make violence unacceptable. In India, the international 
human rights organization Breakthrough used mass media to raise awareness, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/71 
E/CN.6/2010/8 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>09-65802 <b>4 
 
</b></p>
<p>change attitudes and practices and call for concrete action, with a targeted focus on 
engaging men and boys. A pro bono agreement with advertising giant Ogilvy and 
Mather produced the &#8220;Bell Bajao&#8221; (&#8220;Ring the Bell&#8221;) campaign, which won a gold 
Abby Award at GOAFEST for &#8220;best integrated campaign&#8221; in April 2009. In 
addition, Breakthrough, through a partnership with the Ministry of Women and 
Child Development facilitated by UNIFEM, was able to secure the resources to 
purchase broadcast time on national television stations. This allowed the &#8220;Bell 
Bajao&#8221; campaign, in just four months&#8217; time, to reach more than 124 million people 
in India with messages on women&#8217;s legal rights. The non-governmental organization 
Gender and Development for Cambodia worked with communities to establish local 
women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s groups to educate their peers on how to stop violence and seek 
legal protection. In only one year, the groups have organized hundreds of village 
meetings involving more than 3,000 people and have reached out to another 6,000 
women and men through door-to-door campaigns. Women&#8217;s community groups have 
resolved or referred for prosecution cases involving violence against women. Men&#8217;s 
community groups have counselled perpetrators to encourage alternative forms of 
behaviour. Other leading examples of ways to engage men in transformative change 
to bring about gender equality and an end to violence against women include the 
recently funded cross-regional initiative of the grantee Instituto Promundo. Working 
in Brazil, Chile, India and Rwanda, it has embarked on a pioneering multi-country 
attempt to systematically evaluate the most effective approaches to involving men 
and boys in the prevention of violence. Oxfam Great Britain has partnered with 
women&#8217;s organizations in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and 
Yemen to carry out a catalytic regional initiative across the Arab States to devise 
methodologies for involving men and boys in prevention activities. After only one 
year of implementation, prominent elected officials and public figures have joined 
forces to demand the adoption of a law criminalizing intrafamily violence in 
Lebanon. In addition, a subregional White Ribbon campaign linked to the Secretary-
General&#8217;s recently launched Network of Men Leaders is being organized; 
</p>
<p> (b) <b>Securing strategic policy and budgetary commitments for 
implementation</b>: United Nations Trust Fund grants in such countries as Bulgaria 
and Rwanda have successfully generated new policy and budgetary commitments, 
which are critical steps under the Fund&#8217;s strategy of strengthening frameworks for 
the implementation of laws and the provision of services. For example, when the 
official process of amending the Bulgarian law on domestic violence began in 2008, 
the Bulgarian Gender Research Foundation made the case that State responsibility 
needs to include regular budgetary allocations, especially at the local level, where 
most services are provided. Draft revisions of the law now provide for yearly 
allocations for protection and support services. In Rwanda, a grant to the 
governmental administration of Ngoma district resulted in the development by local 
leaders of a three-year strategic plan that integrates all local action to end violence 
against women. The issue is now on the agenda at monthly district security 
meetings, and local vigilance committees in 473 villages routinely monitor 
individual cases and report on them to the police; 
</p>
<p> (c) <b>Improving legal enforcement and the rule of law</b>: the United Nations 
Trust Fund has invested in capacity development and the dissemination of 
information, which are crucial steps in improving legal enforcement and the rule of 
law in Bhutan, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone and Venezuela (Bolivarian 
Republic of). In Bhutan, a grant enabled the National Commission for Women and </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2010/8
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5 </b>09-65802 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Children to broker collaboration with the Royal Bhutan Police and the Royal Court 
of Justice. That partnership resulted in the adoption of in camera trials to protect 
survivors from public exposure, and in the creation of a complaints and response 
mechanism that prompts rapid responses to cases of violence. In Simbu province in 
Papua New Guinea, the non-governmental organization Kup Women for Peace 
worked directly with the police to resolve cases of violence against women, sorcery 
killings and land disputes, using a combination of references to customary and 
international human rights norms. In Sierra Leone, the International Rescue 
Committee assisted the Government in developing a three-year implementation plan 
to strengthen collaboration for the implementation of new national laws against 
violence. It has since created practical tools for service providers in tracking cases 
and collecting data; organized training for 96 police, inspectors general and judges; 
and held town meetings to engage informal justice systems. After the Venezuelan 
non-governmental organization Asociaci&#243;n Venezolana para una Educaci&#243;n Sexual 
Alternativa trained nearly 200 justice and law enforcement officials and university 
students on how to implement the national law against violence, the municipal 
police academy in Sucre incorporated the training into its professional development 
programme, which is required for all inspectors, sub-inspectors, agents and 
detectives; 
</p>
<p> (d) <b>Expanding survivor access to support services</b>: United Nations Trust 
Fund grants have made substantial, rapid improvements in a variety of social, legal 
and health services for survivors. Grantees in the Russian Federation and Ukraine, 
for example, expanded women&#8217;s access to comprehensive, integrated and high-
quality services. In Ukraine, the non-governmental organization Rozrada 
contributed to the national action plan for the implementation of the domestic 
violence law, through training programmes in four pilot regions that have increased 
the capacity of 2,000 central and local service providers to detect abuse and provide 
psychological support to survivors. An independent evaluation found that the project 
had helped to bring about a fivefold increase in the number of perpetrators 
summoned by the police in the Kiev region, and concluded that the quality of the 
services provided in the four regions was much improved. In Saint Petersburg, 
Russian Federation, the non-governmental organization Doctors to Children is 
developing and institutionalizing an inter-agency service protocol. Through the 
Centre for Social Assistance to Families and Children, women can already gain 
access to a combination of psychological counselling, assistance in registering for 
social benefits, peer support groups on empowerment and childcare services; 
</p>
<p> (e) <b>Responding to the needs of excluded groups of women</b>: the emphasis 
of the United Nations Trust Fund on breaking barriers of exclusion assisted grantees 
in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Ecuador and Egypt in expanding services for 
groups of women who would otherwise remain neglected. In Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of) and Ecuador, Family Care International partnered with two organizations 
for indigenous peoples to hold community group discussions in order to amplify the 
voices of indigenous women in expressing their cultural perspectives regarding laws 
against domestic violence. As a result, 1,750 indigenous women and 250 men made 
recommendations that have contributed to a new model of appropriate services to 
prevent and respond to violence against indigenous women. In Egypt, the Al-Shehab 
Foundation for Comprehensive Development engaged women and men living in a 
slum outside Cairo to define the services that they needed on the basis of local 
perceptions and patterns of violence. Al-Shehab used that information to develop its </p>

</b></p>
<p>One-Stop Centre, a facility located in the slum providing legal, medical and 
psychosocial aid to survivors and as a preventive measure; 
</p>
<p> (f) <b>Addressing the intersection between violence against women and 
HIV and AIDS</b>: The United Nations Trust Fund has backed a number of pioneering 
initiatives that address the intersection between the twin pandemics of violence 
against women and HIV and AIDS in such countries as Botswana, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and Nepal. Aligning service provision with the specific needs 
generated by that intersection is one important strategy being employed in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the non-governmental organization 
R&#233;seau national des ONG pour le D&#233;veloppement de la Femme equipped 300 civil 
society leaders in 6 cities to use a module for paralegal services. As a result, 1,500 
women survivors of sexual violence, a quarter of whom are HIV-positive, have 
initiated judicial cases. In partnership with Johnson and Johnson, the United Nations 
Trust Fund has been providing ongoing support to a learning cohort of seven 
grantees focused on generating knowledge about how to address the intersection 
between violence against women and HIV and AIDS. The objective is to develop 
effective approaches to addressing the &#8220;twin pandemics&#8221; that can be replicated and 
scaled up. A grant to the Women&#8217;s Affairs Department of Botswana increased the 
capacity of local authorities and service providers to prevent domestic violence and 
to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS. In two pilot communities, district gender 
committees have been formed to advise local development committees on these 
issues. By involving influential local figures, the gender committees ensure that 
communities will take messages on behaviour change seriously. In one case, a 
traditional chief has already modelled change by inviting women for the first time to 
participate in customary gatherings. In Nepal, Equal Access enhanced the 
understanding of issues that remain mostly shrouded in silence, as a step towards 
mobilizing new action to address them. The non-governmental organization trained 
12 community radio reporters belonging to vulnerable groups to produce broadcasts 
that have aired more than 500 times on the main national radio stations, potentially 
reaching 90 per cent of the Nepalese population. In order to build on new levels of 
understanding resulting from the broadcasts, community legal literacy sessions have 
reached more than 800 women and men. Another 800 women have been trained as 
peer educators, in order to mobilize women and men to take action in their 
localities, such as holding public discussions on violence and HIV, and campaigning 
against violence. Listeners&#8217; groups meet regularly to talk about the radio broadcasts. 
Many report that they now understand why violence can lead to HIV and vice versa, 
and why it is important to stand up for one&#8217;s rights. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Grant-making cycle 2009 
</b> 
</p>
<p>9. United Nations Trust Fund grants are awarded annually through an open, 
competitive and transparent process that ensures high-quality programming and 
rigour in the selection of grantees. The calls for proposals invite holistic initiatives 
that focus on reaching particularly excluded or disadvantaged groups through 
approaches tailored to diverse needs. Priority is placed on applications that highlight 
multisectoral approaches and collaboration among various stakeholders; evidence of 
what works, to optimize the use of resources; and investment in systematic and 
comprehensive documentation and evaluation aimed at generating and sharing 
knowledge. Through its grant-making process, the United Nations Trust Fund 
channels global expertise and resources to the local level, where they are needed </p>

</b></p>
<p>most. It also underscores the potential for the scaling-up of successful initiatives, 
while emphasizing the development of national capacities to foster sustainability.  
</p>
<p>10. <b>Analysis of applications</b>: in 2009, a total of 1,643 concept notes were 
received, requesting a total of $857 million. This compares with a total of 1,068 
concept notes received in 2008, requesting a total of $525 million, which reflects 
increases of 53 per cent in the number of applications and 63 per cent in the funds 
requested in just one year. In 2009, the highest number of concept notes and the 
greatest amount of funds requested came from Africa (35 per cent), followed by 
Latin America and the Caribbean (25 per cent) and Asia and the Pacific (24 per 
cent). Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
Arab States, and cross-regional programmes represented 6 per cent each in terms of 
funds requested. In all regions, most concept notes came from women&#8217;s 
organizations and other non-governmental organizations (85 per cent), followed by 
governmental organizations (5 per cent) and United Nations country teams (3 per 
cent).  
</p>
<p>11. <b>Grants awarded</b>: the United Nations Trust Fund awarded $10.5 million for 13 
initiatives in 18 countries and territories. Africa was awarded the greatest amount of 
funds (48 per cent), followed by Asia and the Pacific and Latin America and the 
Caribbean (20 per cent each) and Central and Eastern Europe and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (12 per cent). For the first time, organizations 
in Gambia and Lesotho received funding. The majority of new grantees included 
women&#8217;s organizations and other non-governmental organizations (71 per cent), 
followed by United Nations country teams (19 per cent) and governmental 
organizations (10 per cent). By noting that governmental organizations constitute a 
minority in terms of both grantees and applicants, the United Nations Trust Fund 
focuses on encouraging applications from governmental organizations or 
partnerships between non-governmental and governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>12. <b>Highlights of new grants</b>: new grantees will support the implementation of 
laws and policies through better coordination of services to protect women and girls 
from violence in Thailand and through the expansion of integrated services in 
Albania. In Sierra Leone, a grantee will carry out recommendations of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission to assist more than 650 survivors of sexual violence, 
through reparations. In Cameroon, Lesotho, Namibia and Nigeria, a grantee will 
pilot a model of working in the area of sexual and reproductive health services to 
analyse the impacts of violence against women and girls and to increase support for 
survivors. A grantee working in the Gambia, Guinea, Mali and Senegal will scale up 
leading approaches to ending female genital mutilation/cutting, bringing about a 
shift from a health-based to a human-rights-based approach. In Uganda and six other 
locations in East and Southern Africa, a grantee will build on the award-winning 
SASA! (Start, Awareness, Support and Action) programme to address the 
intersection between violence against women and HIV and AIDS.  
</p>
<p>13. New grantees will also work with girls and young people. A grantee in Zambia 
will seek justice for sexually abused girls through improved laws and enforcement. 
In Cambodia, youth groups will mobilize around the issue of stopping domestic 
violence. A grantee in Bolivia will strengthen networks against sexual and 
intrafamily violence in order to prevent violence against girls and adolescents in the 
municipality of El Alto. Other grantees will reach out to excluded groups, including 
women at risk owing to the global financial crisis in Cambodia, women of the Roma </p>

<p>minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and indigenous women&#8217;s groups in Guatemala 
and Mexico. A summary of new grantees can be found at the United Nations Trust 
Fund website.3 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Deepening involvement 
</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Violence against women cuts across all sectors, population groups and public 
and private spaces, requiring the engagement of multiple stakeholders. Securing the 
involvement of traditional and new actors to end it is thus a hallmark of the United 
Nations Trust Fund&#8217;s strategy, centred on mobilizing broad-based partnerships and 
garnering support from an ever-growing range of actors. This includes States 
Members of the United Nations, donors, non-governmental organizations and 
United Nations sister agencies, among others, in addition to the central roles that 
grantees themselves play at the country and regional levels by mobilizing new and 
influential constituencies, as described earlier.  
</p>
<p>15. Since its establishment, the United Nations Trust Fund, as a United Nations 
system-wide mechanism, has been based on United Nations partnerships, working to 
increase ownership of the United Nations Trust Fund across the United Nations 
system. United Nations sister agencies are members of the Inter-Agency Programme 
Appraisal Committee, which advises and participates regularly in decision-making 
on policy and grant-making issues. In 2009, Inter-Agency Programme Appraisal 
Committee members at the global and subregional levels included 19 United 
Nations agencies, representatives of other inter-agency mechanisms and leading 
international civil society organizations, notably Amnesty International, the Centre 
for Women&#8217;s Global Leadership and Human Rights Watch.  
</p>
<p>16. In 2009, participating United Nations agencies at the global and subregional 
levels included the Division for the Advancement of Women, the Economic 
Commission for Africa, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific, the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Joint United Nations Programme 
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Human Settlements 
Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), UNIFEM, the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and the World Bank. In addition, United Nations Action 
against Sexual Violence in Conflict provided lead technical advice on applications 
coming from conflict and post-conflict settings, and, for the first time, the 
secretariat of the Millennium Development Goals Achievement Fund participated, 
which is especially relevant in the light of the fact that United Nations country 
teams have been eligible since 2008 to apply to the United Nations Trust Fund.  
</p>
<p>17. In 2009, a total of 18 meetings of the Inter-Agency Programme Appraisal 
Committee were convened at the global and subregional levels in 15 countries. As a 
testament to the growing engagement, and in keeping with trends in recent years,

<p>United Nations resident coordinators from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru once again 
participated in the Inter-Agency Programme Appraisal Committee for that 
subregion, joined this year by United Nations resident coordinators from Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of) and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). Also reflective of 
the important and potential role that United Nations agencies can play in enhancing 
the impact and sustainability of United Nations Trust Fund grantees are the efforts 
made in India by UNICEF, which is supporting the continuation of a district-based 
programme by a former grantee, focusing on violence against women and children.  
</p>
<p>18. The private sector has an important role to play in ending violence against 
women and girls. In 2009, Avon Products Incorporated and Johnson and Johnson 
were lead private-sector partners of the United Nations Trust Fund. Since 2005, 
Johnson and Johnson has supported the Fund&#8217;s special window on links between 
violence against women and HIV and AIDS. The non-profit organization Zonta 
International has also made contributions, together with the National Committees 
for UNIFEM in Austria, Japan and New Zealand.  
</p>
<p>19. In 2009, UNIFEM brokered a new Commitment to Action of the Clinton 
Global Initiative, featuring the global drive of the United Nations Trust Fund to 
raise $100 million annually by 2015, as called for in the Framework for Action of 
the Secretary-General&#8217;s campaign. The United Nations Trust Fund also initiated 
outreach to select major foundations.  
</p>
<p>20. In 2009, the United Nations Trust Fund also made important progress in 
recruiting and partnering with leading research and expert institutions devoted to 
ending violence against women and girls. Collaboration was established with those 
institutions on training and technical assistance for grantees in the areas of 
evidence-based programming, monitoring and evaluation (see paragraphs 28 and 
29 below).  
</p>
<p>21. UNIFEM Goodwill Ambassador Nicole Kidman consistently highlights the 
urgent need to take action to end violence against women and girls, and to raise 
additional critical resources for the United Nations Trust Fund. For example, 
Ms. Kidman and the United Nations Trust Fund grantee Breakthrough testified before 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the United States House of Representatives. In 
addition, the UNIFEM global call for action &#8220;Say NO &#8212; UNiTE to End Violence 
against Women&#8221;4 is encouraging donations to the United Nations Trust Fund. 
Through its online platform, &#8220;Say NO&#8221; also provides an opportunity to showcase 
action by United Nations Trust Fund grantees to end violence against women.

<p>22. The United Nations Trust Fund promotes efficiency at various levels of its 
operations and grant-making. For example, it provides an efficient mechanism for 
improving the coherence of programme strategies and approaches aimed at ending 
violence against women and girls, for pooling and tracking global resources and for 
strengthening monitoring and accountability. All of those functions are in 
accordance with the principles of alignment, harmonization, managing for results and 
mutual accountability, set out in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

</b></p>
<p>23. The United Nations Trust Fund grant appraisal process actively engages 
United Nations agencies at the global and subregional levels. In particular, the 
subregional inter-agency Programme Appraisal Committees make it possible to 
establish links with existing United Nations efforts and national priorities. This 
decentralized and broadly participatory structure ensures that funding allocations 
conform closely to the capacities and needs of diverse countries and regions, 
thereby promoting the overall relevance of the United Nations Trust Fund to 
national priorities and contexts.  
</p>
<p>24. Since 2008, as the resource base has increased, a shift to larger and longer-
term grants has allowed for larger-scale interventions that can achieve higher-level 
results, as well as better sustainability efforts. In 2009, the United Nations Trust 
Fund has once again been able to offer grants of up to $1 million for two- to three-
year initiatives. This has led to the more efficient use of resources in the 
administration of the Fund, with the time and labour required to review, approve, 
monitor and support grantees being more cost-effective in relation to the results and 
impacts that they can produce. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Generating knowledge and developing capacities 
</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Some of the most serious constraints in addressing violence against women 
and girls arise from limited capacities to design, implement and expand 
programmes, and from a lack of knowledge about what works most effectively. 
Closing capacity and knowledge gaps is therefore integral to the fulfilment of the 
mandate of the United Nations Trust Fund, as described in its Monitoring, 
Evaluation and Knowledge Management Framework 2008-2011.5  
</p>
<p>26. In response to those constraints, the United Nations Trust Fund 2009 call for 
proposals continued to emphasize the need for systematic monitoring and 
evaluation, and recommended that applicants dedicate 10 per cent of the grants 
requested to evaluation and an additional 3 to 5 per cent to monitoring. Shortlisted 
concept notes and full-fledged proposals were given thorough feedback in order to 
encourage applicants to strive for higher-level impacts by rooting programmes in 
solid evidence and linking them to the achievement of targeted results, guided by 
monitoring, evaluation, documentation and knowledge-sharing plans. 
</p>
<p>27. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that, in 2009, the United Nations Trust Fund 
made significant progress in establishing a new grantee reporting system designed 
to capture results, learning and knowledge, and analyse trends, across the entire 
grant-making portfolio. The comprehensive database reporting system, which will 
be tied to a results-based framework for the United Nations Trust Fund under its 
forthcoming new strategy, will be launched in 2010. It is expected to greatly 
facilitate robust reporting on and dissemination of emerging practices and 
knowledge to policymakers and practitioners. Case studies of grantees&#8217; promising 
and good practices are also under development, and evaluation reports, training 
manuals and other tools produced by grantees are being compiled in order to enrich 
the database for global knowledge-sharing. Moreover, the United Nations Trust 
Fund was able to increase the degree and the quality of its grantee monitoring. This 
included select monitoring visits carried out in 2009 by the United Nations Trust

<p>Fund secretariat to nine grantees in six countries6 in Africa and Asia, in addition to 
regular monitoring by United Nations Trust Fund focal points at subregional offices 
of UNIFEM.  
</p>
<p>28. Also in 2009, the United Nations Trust Fund partnered with MEASURE 
Evaluation, a partnership of experienced organizations supported by the United 
States Agency for International Development. MEASURE Evaluation has developed 
a leading global monitoring and evaluation tool, comprising indicators on violence 
against women, that is systematically shared with all new grantees in an effort to 
harmonize indicator selection. Select programmes implemented by United Nations 
country teams will serve as pilots for assessing how the indicators developed by 
MEASURE Evaluation can be used to systematically track and inform policy 
decisions.  
</p>
<p>29. Another key aspect of the United Nations Trust Fund&#8217;s achievements in 2009 
with regard to capacity development and knowledge generation concerned the 
institutionalization of training and related support for grantees in the areas of 
evidence-based programme design, monitoring and evaluation. Through a public bid 
won by the International Centre for Research on Women, a curriculum was piloted 
and two training workshops were held, in Ethiopia in October and in India in 
December. Two other regional workshops, one in Spanish and one in French, are 
planned to be held in the first quarter of 2010 in Nicaragua and Senegal, 
respectively. After this process of validation and testing, the capacity development 
programme will be offered annually, and all new grantees will be invited to 
participate in the training at the early stages of project design.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Mobilizing resources 
</b> 
</p>
<p>30. The ability of the United Nations Trust Fund to pursue a strategic vision and 
ambitious plans in support of the country-level implementation of commitments to 
ending violence against women and girls relies on its capacity to mobilize adequate 
resources. As a result of the appeals made by the General Assembly in its 
resolutions 61/143, 62/133, 63/155 and 64/137 for the provision of increased 
resources to the United Nations Trust Fund, the outreach efforts of the Fund have 
been enhanced. 
</p>
<p>31. In 2009, the United Nations Trust Fund benefited from the continued support 
of the Government of Spain as the leading contributor, and from the continued 
contributions of the Governments of Austria, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, the 
Republic of Korea and Trinidad and Tobago. The Government of Kazakhstan 
contributed for the first time. The Governments of Denmark, Finland, Ireland, 
Liechtenstein, Spain and the United States of America generously increased their 
contributions. Private-sector and other resources were also available thanks to the 
ongoing support of Avon, Johnson and Johnson and Zonta International, and to 
contributions from the National Committees for UNIFEM in Austria, Japan, New 
Zealand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
Contributions received in the fourth quarter of 2009 after the grant-making cycle 
had ended will be awarded in the first quarter of 2010. 
</p>
<p>32. In 2009, the United Nations Trust Fund advanced a new fund-raising strategy, 
guided by the drive to reach the target of $100 million annually by 2015, a

<p>benchmark set in the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE to End Violence against Women 
campaign, and launching an urgent web-based Alert that was widely disseminated in 
order to draw attention to the need to end violence against women and girls in the 
context of the global financial crisis, with an appeal for individual online donations 
made possible through a site hosted by the United Nations Foundation. The 
outstanding quality of a number of proposals that had gone unfunded prompted the 
United Nations Trust Fund to seek support from leading foundations and other 
United Nations sister agencies. In that regard, a positive response was received from 
the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, who urged field 
offices to consider providing support. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The way forward 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p><b>  United Nations Trust Fund external evaluation  
</b> 
</p>
<p>33. As the United Nations Trust Fund approached the completion of its 2005-2008 
strategy, an independent external evaluation was commissioned through a public 
competitive bid won by Universalia Management Group, which initiated the process 
late in 2008 and completed its task in November 2009. A range of key stakeholders 
were involved in the process, including United Nations sister agencies and Member 
States. In October 2009, a briefing on the evaluation findings, organized by 
UNIFEM, was open to all delegations of United Nations Member States.  
</p>
<p>34. The external evaluation assessed the performance of the United Nations Trust 
Fund in terms of the pillars of the 2005-2008 strategy (impact, involvement, 
efficiency, knowledge management and capacity development, and resource 
mobilization) and identified strengths, weaknesses, challenges and current trends. 
The external evaluation reached the positive overall conclusion that the United 
Nations Trust Fund has been a relevant mechanism for promoting the enforcement 
of laws and the implementation of policies to end violence against women and girls. 
During the period under review, the United Nations Trust Fund was shown to have 
been effective in responding to the needs of women who were affected by or 
survivors of violence, in increasing the capacity of duty bearers and in raising 
awareness among citizens about the gravity of violence against women and girls. 
With regard to efficiency, the United Nations Trust Fund was shown to be operating 
with lean management and very low overhead costs. The evaluation also validated 
the measures introduced within the United Nations Trust Fund by UNIFEM in 2008 
to bolster its processes and quality assurance standards, affirming that those 
modifications were indicative of the way forward and encouraging their 
continuation.  
</p>
<p>35. While the results achieved were found to be commensurate with the resources 
invested, the existing staffing structure and the components related to monitoring 
and knowledge-sharing were identified as key challenges that need to be addressed 
if the potential, opportunities and ambitions of the United Nations Trust Fund are to 
be fully realized. Accordingly, the systems of the United Nations Trust Fund for 
monitoring and evaluation and its support for grantees were assessed as weak during 
the period 2005-2008, a trend that was reversed in 2009. The evaluation noted that 
the Fund had not devoted adequate attention or resources to the management and 
dissemination of the knowledge generated. In addition, the external evaluation 
found that grantees were often not able to sustain programmes beyond the </p>

</b> 
</p>
<p><b>13 </b>09-65802

</b></p>
<p>completion of grants, owing to their limited resources. However, it recognized that 
since 2008, the calls for proposals have placed emphasis on demonstrating explicit 
capacity development and sustainability plans, as well as synergies and coordination 
with existing initiatives. Finally, the external evaluation found that, while grantees 
had achieved numerous short-term results, there was less evidence of long-term 
results. The United Nations Trust Fund Strategy 2010-2015 will build on the 
findings and recommendations resulting from this comprehensive evaluation. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> V. Report on UNIFEM Programming and the Strategy 
2008-2013 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>36. Beyond managing the United Nations Trust Fund, UNIFEM has a leading 
mandate within the United Nations system on ending violence against women, 
which is a flagship issue of the organization and one of four priorities set out in its 
corporate Strategy 2008-2013.  
</p>
<p>37. Guided by the Strategy, entitled &#8220;A Life Free of Violence: Unleashing the 
Power of Women&#8217;s Empowerment and Gender Equality&#8221;, UNIFEM advocacy, 
programming, partnerships, outreach and inter-agency collaboration continued to 
expand at the global, regional and country levels. Highlights are provided below.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Furthering policies, laws and their implementation  
</b> 
</p>
<p>38. In several countries, UNIFEM supported the advancement of normative policy 
and legal frameworks, as well as their implementation, enforcement and monitoring. 
This included UNIFEM technical support provided to the Directorate of Gender 
Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda for the establishment of a national task force on 
violence against women; assistance provided in Guatemala to the Women&#8217;s 
Commission of the National Congress, in partnership with UNFPA, OHCHR and 
UNDP, to advance legislation on violence against women, including femicide; and 
support provided in India to the Lawyers Collective and the National Commission 
for Women, in their efforts to monitor progress in the enforcement of the 2005 
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. In Pakistan, UNIFEM supported 
a multi-stakeholder alliance aimed at the development of a draft action plan on 
violence against women and the review of draft bills on domestic violence at the 
request of Parliament, in order to identify gaps and propose recommendations based 
on the concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>39. In Indonesia, UNIFEM technical and financial assistance contributed to the 
development of a draft local district law on the protection of migrant workers, with 
provisions to protect women against sexual harassment and abuse, and of a national 
domestic violence law being considered for adoption. In Egypt, UNIFEM supported 
the first sexual harassment conference with young people. In Cameroon and 
Burundi, support was provided to strengthen penal codes related to sexual violence. 
In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, UNIFEM supported the development of a 
guide and training for justice-sector public servants and the police on the 
implementation of the Organic Law on the Right of Women to a Life Free of 
Violence.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/71 
E/CN.6/2010/8 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>09-65802 <b>14 
 
</b></p>
<p>40. Integrating responses to violence against women within national and regional 
development and funding frameworks is an especially strategic and emerging area 
that UNIFEM promotes. In this regard, it has supported technical inputs to 
strengthen commitments to addressing violence against women set out in the Cape 
Verde National Development Plan and in Egypt&#8217;s National Socio-Economic 
Development Plan. Moreover, UNIFEM technical contributions and the Fund&#8217;s 
long-standing partnership with the secretariat of the Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM) facilitated the inclusion of gender-responsive targets and indicators on 
reducing violence against women in the Community&#8217;s work programme for 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>41. Securing resources for the implementation of laws and policies is a critical and 
often neglected area of work to end violence against women. In the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela, building on the successes of previous gender-responsive 
budgeting efforts, UNIFEM, UNDP and UNFPA, in collaboration, contributed to the 
issuance of guidelines by the National Budget Office instructing all municipalities 
and regions to allocate funds for the operation of local units charged with 
monitoring the enforcement of laws concerning gender equality and violence against 
women. In Burundi, advocacy on gender-responsive budgeting directed at the 
Ministry of Finance contributed to the inclusion in the 2009 national budget of a 
specific line concerning violence against women. 
</p>
<p>42. At the regional level, UNIFEM and partners contributed to the development of 
the first African Union Gender Policy and 10-year Action Plan that provides, inter 
alia, a framework for addressing violence against women. UNIFEM also provided 
technical support to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) 
summit on gender, peace and security in order to create a platform for policy 
dialogue and to identify practical actions to enhance transborder cooperation in 
addressing human trafficking and other issues affecting women and children. In the 
Caribbean, UNIFEM convened a regional advisory group on gender and 
development, with participation from the United Nations system, donors, 
CARICOM and regional non-governmental organizations, which led to the 
endorsement of a regional Special Rapporteur on gender-based violence as well as a 
joint programme concerning indigenous women. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Improving access for survivors and developing the capacities of key policy and 
service delivery institutions 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>43. Two mainstays of UNIFEM programming are the expansion of women&#8217;s 
access to services and justice and the provision of support to Governments and other 
key actors in order to strengthen know-how and capacities for effective responses to 
violence against women.  
</p>
<p>44. Strengthening front-line responders in order to ensure police protection and 
high-quality responses for survivors is a priority in UNIFEM-supported 
programmes. In Rwanda, UNIFEM assisted in the formulation of the national police 
policy on gender-based and sexual violence and, with UNFPA and UNICEF, 
supported the establishment by the National Police Health Services of a One-Stop 
Centre for violence survivors at the Kacyriu Police Hospital, in Kigali. In Dar es 
Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania, UNIFEM funded the Tanzania Female Police 
Network in order to establish a victim support unit for violence survivors. In the 
Caribbean, UNIFEM contributed to the commitment undertaken by six national </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2010/8

</p>
<p><b>15 </b>09-65802 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s machineries, in agreement with ministries of national security, to enhance 
State responsibility for responding to sexual violence, including capacity 
development in the area of policing and prosecutorial action, and work with the 
Association of Caribbean Commissioners of Police.  
</p>
<p>45. Ensuring women&#8217;s access to justice is a key aspect of UNIFEM efforts to end 
impunity for gender-based violence in many countries. In Sierra Leone, UNIFEM 
continues to back survivors&#8217; demands for justice in the wake of the civil war, 
strengthening their advocacy skills, supporting them in presenting their testimonies 
and providing technical assistance to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 
order to ensure attention to gender crimes and protection for women survivors. In 
Kenya, the Women Judges Association was supported in training more than 30 High 
Court judges and magistrates in the Jurisprudence of Equality Programme, while in 
Georgia, training on the anti-domestic violence law was provided for judges and 
attorneys. In the Caribbean, UNIFEM has been working on perpetrator programmes, 
supporting the Grenada Legal Aid and Counselling Clinic and the Saint Lucia 
Family Court in implementing a 16-week court-based batterer intervention 
programme. In Jamaica, training was provided for probation officers of the 
Department of Correctional Services working with perpetrators to develop 
accountability-based interventions. In Tajikistan, UNIFEM conducted a session on 
women&#8217;s human rights as part of an annual &#8220;human rights school&#8221; for student-
lawyers, who will work in rural areas to provide legal services. In the Sudan and the 
United Republic of Tanzania, UNIFEM funded summits held by faith-based 
organizations that brought together religious leaders to discuss violence against 
women, HIV and AIDS and access to justice. In Afghanistan, through the UNIFEM-
administered multi-donor Special Fund for the Elimination of Violence against 
Women, funded by Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 26 organizations in 20 provinces were 
supported in the implementation of projects in the areas of access to justice, 
protection measures, lobbying, legal aid (including the training of 125 paralegals), 
research and advocacy, awareness-raising and learning networks. Similarly, the 
UNIFEM multi-donor, Pacific regional facility fund, supported by the Australian 
Agency for International Developments, the Australian National Committee, the 
British High Commission in Suva and the New Zealand National Committee has 
supported organizations with small grants and capacity development in order to 
increase women&#8217;s access to justice, including through technical support workshops, 
self-learning toolkits and other types of support for organizational development.  
</p>
<p>46. UNIFEM&#8217;s non-governmental organization implementing partners in eight 
states of India assist survivors in dealing with legal processes, the prosecution of 
perpetrators and access to shelters providing legal information and non-formal 
education. In the Syrian Arab Republic, UNIFEM supported the National 
Association for Women&#8217;s Role in Development in operating a shelter for survivors 
of violence and their children, by providing legal and health counselling and 
information about employment opportunities. In Burundi, UNIFEM provided 
technical and financial support to four organizations providing psychosocial and 
legal assistance to survivors. In Villa El Salvador, Peru, building the capacities of 
grass-roots women&#8217;s organizations contributed to increased knowledge about the 
intersection between violence against women and HIV and AIDS.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Expanding data collection, analysis and tracking systems 
</b> 
</p>
<p>47. The development of effective policies, legislation, services and systems to 
track progress depends on reliable data analysis and information. UNIFEM, in 
cooperation with Governments, civil society, United Nations sister agencies and 
other partners, works to strengthen qualitative and quantitative data collection and 
analysis. Examples include UNIFEM support for the establishment of data systems 
in Ngoma district in Rwanda, and UNIFEM efforts in Barbados, on domestic 
violence; and in Algeria, where a unified information system involves the ministries 
for Family, Health, and Development and Solidarity, in collaboration with the 
Gendarmerie Nationale, other police forces and shelters for women survivors of 
violence. In Georgia, UNIFEM and UNICEF carried out a post-conflict rapid 
assessment of internally displaced women and children, including victims of rape, 
sexual harassment and domestic violence. In the Occupied Palestinian Territory, a 
local partner was supported in conducting research on forced prostitution and human 
trafficking in order to raise awareness, improve survivor services and identify 
appropriate policy measures. UNIFEM and UNFPA, together with Statistics Sierra 
Leone, commissioned national research to support the tracking and reporting of 
cases of violence and to popularize the gender laws. In Asia, with the support of the 
Canadian International Development Agency, UNIFEM published a regional 
analysis of domestic violence legislation drawing on a meeting held by the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations on international standards and good 
practice.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Addressing sexual violence as a tactic of warfare  
</b> 
</p>
<p>48. UNIFEM plays a key advocacy role in promoting the implementation of 
Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), in partnership with 
various stakeholders, and continues to serve as the secretariat for United Nations 
Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, a coalition of 12 United Nations 
organizations. Ongoing work with UNFPA and the Office of the Special Adviser on 
Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI) is supporting the generation of 
global and nationally relevant indicators for the implementation of those resolutions. 
With UNDP, the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations (DPKO) and OCHA, UNIFEM, on behalf of United Nations Action and 
in partnership with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, organized a colloquium 
entitled &#8220;Conflict-Related Sexual Violence and Peace Negotiations: Implementing 
Security Council Resolution 1820&#8221; for mediators, subject experts and women&#8217;s 
rights advocates, aimed at ensuring that conflict-related sexual violence is addressed 
in mediation processes. Many of the recommendations emerging from the 
colloquium were reflected in Security Council resolution 1888 (2009), in which the 
Council mandates peacekeeping missions to protect women and girls from sexual 
violence in armed conflict. The Fund&#8217;s analytical inventory of responses made by 
peacekeeping personnel to war-related violence against women has been taken up by 
DPKO for incorporation into the guidance to be provided for United Nations 
commanders on the prevention of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence.  
</p>
<p>49. At the national level, UNIFEM works to advance the implementation of these 
resolutions by, among other things, supporting the development of national action 
plans. For example, in Nepal, UNIFEM and UNFPA supported the Ministry of Peace 
and Reconstruction and the National Women&#8217;s Commission in developing action 
plans and training on the implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2010/8
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>17 </b>09-65802 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(2008). In Liberia, UNIFEM supported a national women&#8217;s conference, which 
provided a basis for the drafting of the Liberia National Action Plan for the 
implementation of resolution 1325 (2000); and in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Fund organized 
a consultation workshop that resulted in a national implementation plan on the 
resolution. In Afghanistan, UNIFEM coordinated training for women members of 
Parliament on resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), and consultations with the 
Ministry of the Interior, in partnership with UNDP, resulted in the Ministry&#8217;s 
commitment to establishing a civilian oversight body for the implementation of 
resolution 1325 (2000). 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Awareness-raising, communications and partnering with the media 
</b> 
</p>
<p>50. Combined with other strategies, partnering with the media is essential for 
catalysing policy attention, changing societal norms and improving public attitudes 
and understanding with regard to this issue, as well as empowering women and the 
public at large concerning their rights and access to services. This involves building 
the skills and developing the capacities of media professionals. In 2009 in Iraq, 
UNIFEM supported the training of journalists in order to encourage media coverage 
of violence against women and other violations of their human rights, including to 
raise awareness about the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 
1820 (2008). Awareness-raising efforts were also supported in Haiti, where 
UNIFEM, UNFPA and UNICEF assisted the Ministry for the Status of Women and 
Women&#8217;s Rights in launching an awareness-raising campaign on gender-based 
violence, through a network of national community radio stations, television 
broadcasters and schools. In the Andean region, UNIFEM and the Latin American 
Association for Radio Education held a contest challenging radio networks to create 
programmes about ending violence against indigenous women. In Bolivia, Peru and 
Ecuador, UNIFEM is supporting the broadcast of a documentary that highlights 
good practices in the areas of indigenous women&#8217;s rights and ancestral justice.  
</p>
<p>51. In October 2009 in the United States, UNIFEM deployed its Goodwill 
Ambassador, Nicole Kidman, to testify before the Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations at a hearing on violence against women, which garnered media attention 
in the context of the pending International Violence against Women Act. Every year, 
throughout the world, UNIFEM sponsors wide-ranging activities in support of 
International Women&#8217;s Day and the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence 
campaign, which also engage the mass media, including through high-level events 
and the creative use of the arts by various civil society and youth organizations that 
partner with the United Nations system in the commemorations.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Forging partnerships, expanding outreach and inter-agency collaboration 
</b> 
</p>
<p>52. At the global and regional levels, UNIFEM forges and sustains multiple 
partnerships with networks and organizations that are vital allies in expanding the 
reach and coverage of anti-violence efforts, including to draw attention to strategic 
but neglected groups, working with men and young people and involving new and 
non-traditional partners.  
</p>
<p>53. In Brazil in March 2009, UNIFEM, together with other United Nations 
agencies and donors, sponsored the first-ever Global Symposium on Engaging Men 
and Boys in Gender Equality, organized by Promundo, Instituto Papai, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/71 
E/CN.6/2010/8 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>09-65802 <b>18 
 
</b></p>
<p>MenEngage Alliance, Save the Children, UNFPA and the White Ribbon Campaign. 
UNIFEM also joined the newly formed Advisory Committee of the international 
MenEngage Alliance in an effort to continue to deepen collaboration regarding 
masculinities and working with men and boys to prevent violence against women. 
Collaboration also continued with the Inter-Parliamentary Union at both the global 
and regional levels within the framework of its new workplan on violence against 
women. In addition to the Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action that 
UNIFEM brokered for the United Nations Trust Fund, as described earlier, 
UNIFEM, together with UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO and private-sector 
supporters, joined in another announcement of the Initiative, led by a corporate 
leader, on mobilizing resources for the roll-out of national surveys conducted by the 
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on sexual violence against girls in 
various countries.  
</p>
<p>54. UNIFEM continues to play a key role in inter-agency initiatives, including in 
United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, as a founding and active 
member; the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Sub-Working Group on Gender and 
Humanitarian Response; the Task Force on Violence against Women, established 
within the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality (including as an 
implementing partner of the United Nations country team pilot programmes); the 
Inter-Agency Task Force on Adolescent Girls, with a focus on drawing attention to 
gender-based violence against members of that age group; and the Inter-Agency 
Working Group of the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE campaign and the High-Level
