<p><b>  The situation of indigenous peoples in the Republic of the Congo</b>&#8727;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
examines the situation of marginalized indigenous peoples in the Republic of the Congo, on 
the basis of information gathered during his visit to the country from 2-12 November 2010 
and subsequent independent research. The focus of the report is an examination of the 
situation of those groups in Congo that have previously been known as Pygmies and that 
are generally regarded by governmental and non-governmental actors as the country&#8217;s 
indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur discusses the extreme social and economic 
disadvantages of these peoples and their discrimination and marginalization in comparison 
to the rest of Congolese society, especially in labour relations, housing, education, access to 
health services, lack of civil status, participation in public life, as well access to land and 
natural resources. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur identifies recent initiatives undertaken to advance the rights 
of marginalized indigenous peoples, and comments on the new Law on the Promotion and 
Protection of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, recently promulgated by the President.  He 
considers the new law a good practice on the African continent, viewing it as roughly in 
line with international standards. The Special Rapporteur also reviews other initiatives 
taken by the Government, as well as by NGOs and international organizations present in 
Congo. He presents and analyses some of the challenges that will need to be overcome for 
an effective implementation of the new law and other initiatives, recalling the need for

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, James Anaya, visited 
the Republic of the Congo from 2 to 12 November 2010, following an invitation from the 
Government with the support of the indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations of the country. Prior 
to, during and following the visit, the Special Rapporteur engaged in an exchange of 
information with the Government, indigenous peoples and others, as well as carried out 
independent research. This report examines the human rights situation of indigenous 
peoples in Congo in light of international standards, in order to assist the Government of 
Congo, indigenous communities, United Nations agencies and other actors in ongoing 
efforts to implement those standards.   
</p>
<p>2. During his visit to the Republic of the Congo, the Special Rapporteur met and 
consulted with Government officials, members of the Senate and the National Assembly, 
indigenous peoples and their organizations, representatives of United Nations specialized 
agencies, and members of civil society.   
</p>
<p>3. In Brazzaville, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister of Civil Service and 
State Reformation; the Minister of Planning, Economy, Land Reform and Integration; the 
Secretary-General of the President&#8217;s Cabinet; the National Commission on Human Rights, 
the President of the National Assembly; the President of the Senate; the Director of the 
Cabinet of the Minister for Social Affairs, Humanitarian Action and Solidarity; the Minister 
of Justice and Human Rights; the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education in Charge 
of Literacy; the Director of the Cabinet of the Minister of Sustainable Development, 
Forestry Economy and Environment; the Minister for Promotion of Women and the 
Integration of Women in Development; and the Minister of Interior and Decentralization.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of a number of indigenous and 
civil society organizations in Brazzaville, including the National Network of Indigenous 
Peoples of Congo (<i>R&#233;seau National des Peuples Autochtones du Congo</i> - RENAPAC), 
some of its constituent organizations, and the non-governmental organization, Congolese 
Human Rights Observatory (<i>Observatoire Congolais de Droits de l'Homme</i> - OCDH). 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur conducted visits to the departments of Likouala and 
L&#233;koumou where he consulted with indigenous communities, local authorities and 
representatives of indigenous and non-governmental organizations. Additionally, he held 
consultations with the United Nations Resident Coordinator and representatives of United 
Nations agencies with offices in the Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge the support of the Government of 
the Republic of the Congo for its assistance and cooperation in preparing and coordinating 
his visit. He is especially grateful for the assistance provided by the Director General of the 
Department of Human Rights and Fundamental Liberties of the Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights and his staff. He would also like to thank the various agencies of the United 
Nations in Brazzaville, particularly UNICEF and UNDP, for their instrumental help in all 
phases of the visit.  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> II. Indigenous peoples of Congo and their situation of extreme 
disadvantage 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Groups identified as &#8220;indigenous&#8221; (<i>autochtone</i>) in Congo 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Government of the Republic of the Congo and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) regard as the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples (<i>peuples autochtones</i>) those diverse 
ethnically and culturally distinct groups that throughout the Congo Basin in Africa have 
been known collectively as Pygmies. In the the Republic of the Congo, these groups 
include the Baaka (northern Likouala and Sangha departments); Mbendjele (southern 
Likouala and Sangha departments); Mikaya (Sangha Department); Gyeli (north-western 
West Cuvette Department); Luma (Sangha, Cuvette and Likouala departments); Twa 
(Plateaux department to border with Democratic Republic of Congo) and Babongo 
(L&#233;koumou, Niari, and Kouilou departments). The total population of these indigenous 
peoples in Congo is unclear and, as there is no reliable census data, estimates of their 
contribution to the country&#8217;s total population vary widely from 1.4 per cent to 10 per cent.  
</p>
<p>8. The groups identified as indigenous peoples are distinct from the majority Bantu 
ethnic groups, which are estimated to constitute between 90 and 97 per cent of the 
country&#8217;s population. The four largest Bantu ethnic groups are the Kongo or Bacongo (48 
per cent), Sangha (20 per cent), Teke or Bateke (17 per cent) and M&#8217;Bochi (12 per cent). It 
is estimated that Bantu groups began to migrate into the area now known as the Republic of 
the Congo sometime after A.D. 1400. Since independence from France in 1960, the Bantu 
have enjoyed effective political and economic control over Congo. 
</p>
<p>9. Although they speak different languages and inhabit different regions of Congo, the 
groups that have been known as Pygmies share a number of defining features. Unlike the 
Bantu, who have long been largely sedentary and village-based, until recently, the groups 
known as Pygmies maintained a semi-nomadic way of life, and some still do, their 
subsistence based on hunting and gathering forest products. They have been characterized 
by their mobility over vast territories, moving to access resources according to their needs. 
They traditionally do not amass material assets or consolidate exclusive control over large 
areas of land. Their social structure is typically egalitarian, without a highly defined 
leadership hierarchy.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Discrimination and marginalization 
</b></p>
<p>10. An overarching defining feature of these groups is their exclusion and 
marginalization from mainstream social and economic patterns and political power. All of 
these groups find themselves in non-dominant positions in Congolese society, and have 
suffered and continue to suffer threats to their distinct identities and basic human rights in 
ways not experienced by the Bantu majority.  
</p>
<p>11. While the term Pygmy continues to be used in other States of Central Africa, in the 
Republic of the Congo, the term carries negative connotations due to its association with an 
assumption of inferior status and its connection to marginalization, exclusion and 
oppression. For this reason, the Government has a policy against calling people Pygmies, 
and now officially designates such groups as simply indigenous peoples or populations 
(<i>populations autochtones</i>).  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur observes that the Government and others aptly identify these 
groups as indigenous peoples or populations deserving of special attention. Notably, with 
the urging of representatives of these groups, NGOs and eventually the Government, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>Senate and National Assembly of Congo adopted in December 2010, and the President of 
the Republic of the Congo promulgated in February 2011, Law No. 5-2011 on the 
Promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous populations,1 which is discussed 
further in section III below. Article 1 of the law specifies that it addresses the concerns of 
&#8220;indigenous populations&#8230; who are distinguished from other groups of the national 
population by their cultural identity, their way of life and their extreme vulnerability.&#8221; The 
same article prohibits the use of the term &#8220;pygmy&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. The groups addressed in this law are undoubtedly indigenous peoples within the 
scope of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, given their particular characteristics, including 
their distinct cultural and ethnic identities, historical connections to the territories in which 
they live, and their non-dominant positions following a history of subjugation. They face 
human rights problems that are similar to those faced by indigenous peoples throughout the 
world, and that are matters of special concern to the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>14. Therefore, throughout this report the Special Rapporteur follows the policy and 
practice adopted by the  Congolese Government of using the term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; to 
refer to those groups that had previously been designated as Pygmies. By doing so, it is not 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s intention to suggest that the majority Bantu groups are not also, in 
a literal sense, indigenous to Congo or the African continent. Rather, he considers that the 
use of the term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; aptly lends itself to focusing attention on the concerns 
of the particularly vulnerable groups in the country, concerns that are related to their 
distinct identity and non-dominant positions in society.    
</p>
<p>15. As with indigenous peoples elsewhere in the world, the vulnerable situation of 
indigenous peoples in Congo is inextricably linked to historical and ongoing patterns of 
discrimination. These peoples have long been treated as a sub-class, their nomadic hunter-
gatherer ways seen as uncivilized, and their cultural habits deemed inferior. For centuries 
such discrimination has been reinforced by stereotypes and myths about the so-called 
Pygmies, which has entrenched discriminatory attitudes and led to social relationships that 
perpetrate exclusion and acute marginalization of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>16. In the area of labour relations, inequitable social arrangements between the Bantu 
majority and the indigenous peoples manifest themselves as relationships of domination 
and exploitation, in many instances amounting to forms of serfdom or involuntary 
servitude. Bantu &#8220;masters&#8221; may control a number of indigenous people, with the so-called 
masters seeing themselves as &#8220;owning&#8221; the members of particular indigenous families from 
birth, and consequently having the right to the labour and loyalty of those indigenous 
people. This practice has been documented by a number of international organizations, 
including the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights (ACHPR),2 UNICEF,3

<p>the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,4 and acknowledged as a 
significant problem by the Congolese Government itself.5 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur was informed by a number of Government officials that this 
practice is not tolerated, and has been combated. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur 
heard reports of ongoing domination of indigenous people by Bantu individuals, and 
directly heard a Bantu village chief refer to the indigenous people working for him as &#8220;my 
pygmies&#8221;. Several indigenous people report that they are forced to carry out backbreaking 
agricultural work for their Bantu masters, and that the going wage for a day&#8217;s such work 
was a meagre 500 CFA (less than US$1). 
</p>
<p>18. Many indigenous people explained that working in the fields of a Bantu precludes 
them gathering the resources necessary to feed and sustain themselves and their families. 
Furthermore, because of their superior hunting skills, indigenous people are expected to 
hunt for their Bantu masters as part of their work commitments. Because indigenous people 
often do not have the necessary tools or weapons for hunting, they must borrow those of the 
Bantus. Indigenous persons also reported that if they do capture game, they are expected to 
hand it over to the Bantu master, and are given the less desirable animal parts as 
compensation. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur learned that Bantu masters often exploit their positions of 
power with violence. Indigenous persons reported that if they refuse to participate in work 
ordered by their masters or are unable to repay debts or return from hunting empty handed, 
they are violently beaten. It was also reported that if Bantu masters are displeased with the 
results of a hunt or agricultural work done, they might, simply at whim, confiscate the 
possessions of the indigenous servants, such as their cooking implements or mosquito nets, 
then require that the possessions be repurchased through additional work. Furthermore, 
because of their extreme poverty, indigenous persons sometimes &#8220;borrow&#8221; food, clothes or 
other material items from Bantus, which leads to a form of debt servitude, in which 
indigenous workers are bound perpetually to work for their employer in an ultimately futile 
attempt to repay their debts.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Poverty 
</b></p>
<p>20. Indigenous peoples typically live in relatively small settlements or <i>campements</i> 
(camps), made up of rudimentary, mostly single-room wood-plank shelters that are highly 
vulnerable to the frequent torrential rains and other natural elements. Having been 
encouraged by the Government and development aid workers to abandon their semi-
nomadic way of life, indigenous peoples now mostly live in camps in fixed locations, often 
on the periphery of Bantu villages. Although chronic underdevelopment and poverty is 
pervasive throughout the country, the Special Rapporteur observed markedly worse 
conditions among the indigenous communities. Community members expressed their 
frustration about being deprived of basic necessities, such as housing, and limited access to 
social services, including education and health care. The Special Rapporteur perceives that 
discrimination also contributes significantly to limiting indigenous opportunities for social 
development.

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b> E. Education 
</b></p>
<p>21. Levels of indigenous school enrolment are low and indigenous children rarely 
complete primary school. A study funded by UNICEF found that 65 per cent of indigenous 
teenagers aged 12-15 years did not have access to education, compared to 39 per cent of the 
general population.6 The African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights noted in 2007 
that only 2.9 per cent of school children were indigenous, much lower than the estimated 10 
per cent of the school-age population that is indigenous.7 
</p>
<p>22. Remote settlements, exclusion and conditions of extreme poverty impede indigenous 
children&#8217;s access to education. Schools are sometimes located far from indigenous villages, 
requiring indigenous students to travel long distances to get to school. Even though primary 
education is officially free,8 due to the lack of sufficient teachers in remote areas, 
indigenous families are often expected to contribute to teachers&#8217; wages, and often cannot 
afford to buy basic supplies such as pens, books, chalk, slates, or even adequate clothing to 
enable their children to attend schools. In addition, enrolment fees are often required for 
post-primary education, which constitutes a severe block to indigenous access to higher 
levels of education. There are also reports of outright discrimination in schools against 
indigenous children by other students and teachers. 
</p>
<p>23. Other important factors that impede indigenous education are the school curriculum 
and calendar. The Special Rapporteur learned that indigenous children rarely have access to 
education in their own language or about their own culture. Also, schools rarely adapt to the 
seasonal patterns of hunting and gathering of indigenous peoples. For example, during the 
important periods of honey or caterpillar gathering, on which many indigenous people rely 
for their survival, indigenous children are unable to accompany their families into the 
forests for weeks at a time without missing school and falling behind in school work. 
Furthermore, given that indigenous families often depend on each family member to gather 
food for their survival, sending children to school often means a choice between education 
and subsistence. 
</p>
<p>24. However, the Special Rapporteur did learn about programs that adapt education to 
the needs of indigenous communities, including certain church schools or privately initiated 
programmes like the ORA9 schools, a joint initiative of UNICEF and local organizations. 
Taking the indigenous calendar into account in designing curriculum, ORA schools use a 
non-formal teaching method based on the ways of life of indigenous peoples. Both 
indigenous languages and French are used in the three-year integration phase, which 
prepares indigenous students for integration into mainstream schools. Eighteen pilot ORA 
schools have been set up in the departments of Likouala and Sangha, through which 1,600 
indigenous students have gained access to basic education. The Government informed the 
Special Rapporteur about the incorporation of a line item in the 2011 budget to evaluate the 
ORA system with a view to its inclusion in the national educational system.   
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur also learned about an education program in Sibiti that trains 
indigenous youth in basic engineering skills, which according to reports, is adapted to the

<p>needs of the local people in several respects, including providing training in indigenous 
languages.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Health services 
</b></p>
<p>26. Indigenous people expressed frustration at their poor health conditions and limited 
access to health services. The Special Rapporteur heard repeatedly from community 
members that they are often only welcomed at hospitals if they show that they have 
financial means. Even where free medical services are provided (children are entitled to 
free medical services under the new child protection law), payment for prescription drugs 
and obstetric services is almost always required. This reality is compounded by the absence 
of a public health infrastructure in indigenous villages; indigenous people must seek 
treatment at health facilities located in Bantu villages with Bantu personnel, where they are 
often subjected to discrimination or unequal treatment by health-care professionals or other 
patients. 
</p>
<p>27. The lack of financial resources to access government health services heightens 
reliance on traditional remedies to address illness. Indigenous knowledge of traditional 
medicine and therapeutic plants is renowned and has been the source of trade with Bantu 
villagers. However, traditional medicine appears to be powerless against certain modern 
illness to which indigenous peoples are now exposed. Reports indicate, for example, that 
yaws, hernias and appendicitis have become fatal conditions for these populations, also, 
maternal and infant death rates remain very high. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Civil status 
</b></p>
<p>28. Access to all social services, which is often contingent on civil status &#8211; as is the case 
with primary school enrolment &#8211;, is difficult due to the low birth registration rate among 
indigenous people. Since birth registrations are ordinarily conducted in the main population 
centres of each department, which are often long distances from indigenous communities, 
many indigenous children do not have a birth or civil status certificate. Discrimination also 
plays a role in this lack of documentation, as, according to reports, indigenous peoples are 
often asked to pay for certification, despite it being officially free of charge. The Special 
Rapporteur notes the initiative of the Ministry of the Interior to address this issue through 
the adoption of a special procedure to register indigenous babies and ensure that they are 
given birth certificates. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Participation 
</b></p>
<p>29. Indigenous people in Congo are limited in their ability to advocate for improvement 
to their conditions due to their lack of opportunities to participate in decision-making about 
matters affecting them, from the most basic village level to the national level.   
</p>
<p>30. The Republic of the Congo has no indigenous representative in national decision-
making bodies, including parliament, nor are there indigenous members of departmental or 
district level administrative bodies. Indeed, not one single indigenous person is among the 
deputies and senators who constitute the National Assembly. Likewise, there are no 
mechanisms to facilitate or ensure indigenous political representation.10  
</p>

</i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>31. At the village level, Bantu chiefs invariably have had de jure and de facto authority 
over the villages in which indigenous people live alongside the Bantu majority, and also 
over the indigenous camps in proximity to Bantu villages. The authority of the Bantu 
village chiefs is, in practice, superior to that of any indigenous authority, due to the status of 
indigenous settlements under Congolese law, according to which the village is the lowest 
administrative entity in the country.11 A village is recognized by order of the prefect (<i>arr&#234;t&#233; 
pr&#233;fectoral</i>), who is the head of the department in which the village is located.12 The prefect 
(<i>pr&#233;fet</i>) designates the village chief and defines his functions. Under this system, 
indigenous communities typically have not attained village status, and thus have only been 
recognized as camps attached to neighbouring villages with a Bantu majority. This situation 
has prevented indigenous peoples from appointing their own chiefs or participating in 
administrative decisions at the national level.  However it should be noted that article 12 of 
the newly adopted Law No. 5-2011 on indigenous peoples provides for recognition of 
&#8220;indigenous villages within the process of creating local administrative entities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>32. Marginalization from decision-making is further reflected in the State&#8217;s justice 
sector, which has developed without formal recognition of the indigenous justice systems. 
Although many indigenous communities maintained their own customary law systems and 
ways of resolving conflicts, these were not formally recognized by the State or incorporated 
into the administration of justice, until the adoption of the new law on indigenous peoples, 
which recognizes indigenous customary law (art. 11).  
</p>
<p><b> I. Land and resource rights 
</b></p>
<p>33. Finally, the Special Rapporteur observes that indigenous peoples rarely hold any 
formal title or guaranteed rights to the lands and natural resources that they have 
traditionally used or occupied. The Congolese land administration law instructs the relevant 
authority to use its legal and financial means to eradicate &#8220;unproductive&#8221; lands and 
considers any lands that are not &#8220;visibly&#8221; occupied and used as vacant and under State 
ownership. Such &#8220;vacant&#8221; lands can be allocated following a vacant land survey.13 These 
provisions pose potential problems for indigenous peoples who use and access their lands 
according to traditional practices, yet may still find their lands designated as vacant or 
unproductive.  
</p>
<p>34. The Land Law recognizes some collective and customary property rights, insofar as 
they are not incompatible with registered title deeds, and provides for title to lands 
recognized as customarily owned or occupied to be delivered to persons acting on behalf of 
their communities.14 However, determination of customary rights falls to an &#8220;ad hoc organ 
established at the local level and registered with the tax authority&#8221;;15 there does not appear 
to be a provision in the Land Law to involve affected indigenous peoples in the process of 
determining collective and customary property rights. Apart from the Land Law, the 
Government reports that it is developing special procedures to consider applications by 
indigenous peoples or persons of their customary land rights, on the basis of provisions of

</b></p>
<p>the newly enacted law on indigenous peoples and two pre-existing decrees that provide a 
basis for all Congolese to claim their customary land rights.16 
</p>
<p>35. The existence of large-scale forestry in many places has contributed to deforestation, 
and depleted the natural resources on which indigenous peoples depend. The Forestry Code 
distinguishes between State and private forests, but makes no references to rights based on 
customary practices.17 However, like the Land Law, the Forestry Code provides for some 
form of collective private ownership, albeit in limited form. Forests belonging to 
communities (<i>communes</i>) and other local collectives (<i>collectivit&#233;s locales</i>) must be so 
classified by Government decree, planted by the community on land belonging to the 
community or transferred from the State to the collective.18  
</p>
<p>36. Regarding the procedure for classifying forests for particular uses or protection, the 
Forestry Code provides for some level of local participation. While the final decision about 
forest classification is handed down through a decree of the Council of Ministers, any 
reclassification of forest lands requires that the Minister hold a hearing with the regional or 
local administrative authority and representatives of local communities before developing a 
draft demarcation and usage plan. Within 60 days of the draft, the Minister must convene 
another meeting with a range of stakeholders, including representatives of each village 
concerned. While it is possible that indigenous peoples were intended to benefit from these 
broad consultation provisions, given that indigenous peoples are often not represented at the 
village or regional level, they risk exclusion from this process.19  
</p>
<p>37. With regard to protected forests, article 40 of the Forestry Code provides for certain 
use rights over a limited number of non-marketable forest products. For example, the law 
states that local populations can use forest products for the maintenance of their homes, 
furniture, household utensils and tools, as well as for cultural, food or medicinal purposes. 
It also allows local populations to hunt, reap and gather the product, and establish crops or 
hives/apiaries and graze their livestock or harvest forage. However, the same article enables 
the Minister of Forests to regulate the exercise of these rights. Moreover, these rights are 
limited to personal use and the products cannot be sold. Any business based on forest 
products requires a special permit20 that indigenous people cannot readily obtain, in 
practice, which constrains their ability to pursue economic activities such as harvesting 
honey, edible caterpillars and raffia.  
</p>
<p>38. Hunting is governed by the laws on conservation and exploitation of wild fauna, 
protected animals and hunting seasons.21 These laws fail to accommodate indigenous 
peoples&#8217; traditional subsistence hunting patterns and needs, and prevent them from carrying 
out certain rituals involving species that are banned from being hunted.

<p><b> III. Major initiatives to advance the rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>39. The conditions described above stand in stark contrast to the guarantees of 
equality,22 civil and political rights,23 fair labour conditions,24 access to education25 and 
health services26 for all citizens that are enshrined in the Constitution and laws of the 
Republic of the Congo. Additionally, the Republic of the Congo is a party to a number of 
United Nations human rights treaties as well as to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples Rights. However, these broadly applicable guarantees under domestic and 
international laws have not been adequately implemented, especially in respect of 
indigenous peoples, and they have quite clearly not proven sufficient to address the 
particular vulnerabilities of indigenous peoples or protect their specific rights. In what can 
be seen as acknowledgment of the need to focus special attention on indigenous issues, in 
2007 the Republic of the Congo voted in favour of the adoption of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.   
</p>
<p><b>  A. Indigenous Rights Law 
</b></p>
<p>40. In line with its endorsement of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
the Republic of the Congo has put in place a series of initiatives, the primary one being its 
new Law No. 5-2011 on the Promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples 
(&#8220;Indigenous Rights Law&#8221;). The Indigenous Rights Law was passed by both the Senate and 
the National Assembly in December 2010, and promulgated by the President on 25 
February 2011. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to the adoption of the necessary 
implementing decree (<i>d&#233;cret d&#8217;application</i>) as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>41. This law, the development of which commenced in 2006, advances a wide range of 
protections for the rights of indigenous peoples, which, to a large extent, are consistent with 
those contained in the United Nations Declaration. By all accounts, the law was developed 
in a participatory manner, including consultations with indigenous peoples themselves, 
Congolese and international NGOs, United Nations agencies and relevant Congolese public 
institutions. It is the first of its kind on the African continent, and it constitutes an important 
</p>
<p>  
 22 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on racial or ethnic lines (art. 8), criminalizes 
</p>
<p>incitement to ethnic hatred (art. 11), and places on individuals the duty to promote mutual tolerance 
(art. 44). The Charter of National Unity of the Republic of the Congo stipulates that institutional 
arrangements must be made to fight against the hegemony of one ethnic community over another (art. 
4(5)), and that the State must assure the protection and defence of ethnic minorities (art. 4(6)). 
</p>
<p> 23 Through the doctrine of <i>jus sanguinis</i>, all indigenous Congolese are citizens of Congo, and thus equal 
before the law (art. 8). All citizens have the right to file a legal complaint before the appropriate organ 
of the State (art. 40), and the Electoral Law guarantees the right of all Congolese to participate in 
elections or to stand for office. &#160;
</p>
<p> 24 The Labor Code (Law No. 45 of 15 March 1975) forbids, in an &#8220;absolute manner,&#8221; forced or 
obligatory work (art. 4), recognizes the principle of equal salary for equal work (art. 80), and 
guarantees the regular payment of salary (art. 88) in legal currency (art. 87). It imposes both a fine 
and imprisonment for violations of the equal salary provision (art. 255.2). &#160;
</p>
<p> 25 The Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Liberties of the Republic of the Congo guarantee the 
right to education for all Congolese children (art. 23). Law No. 4-2010 of 14 June 2010 on Protection 
of the child identifies indigenous children as vulnerable, and notes that they have the right to 
education and social integration (art. 44).&#160;
</p>
<p> 26 The Constitution protects the right to health of every citizen, including vulnerable persons. The 
Charter of Rights and Liberties calls on the State &#8220;to create the proper conditions to ensure every 
citizen access to medical services and medical help in case of illness&#8221; (art. 32(d)). Similarly, Law No. 
009-88 of 23 May 1998 prohibits discrimination in the provision of health services (art. 5). &#160;</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>good practice in the region for the recognition and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>42. The law specifically targets the disadvantaged conditions of indigenous peoples, and 
promotes their collective and individual rights. In brief, it prohibits discrimination against 
indigenous persons (art. 2) and guarantees them a range of civil and political rights, 
including equal access to justice (art. 10). It also affirms, as already noted (paras. 31 and 
32), the right of indigenous peoples to recourse to their own customs for the resolution of 
conflicts (art. 11) and provides for recognition of indigenous villages as administrative 
entities (art. 12). 
</p>
<p>43. A wide range of economic, social and cultural rights specific to indigenous peoples 
are guaranteed. Title Six of the law addresses labour rights and provides for a framework 
for the protection of the right to work and a number of positive measures to ensure the 
enjoyment of those rights. Article 27 forbids any form of discrimination against indigenous 
people, in respect of access to employment, labour conditions, training opportunities, 
remuneration or social security. The forced labour or enslavement of indigenous peoples is 
expressly forbidden, and punitive measures are imposed for those found in breach of this 
prohibition (art. 29). 
</p>
<p>44. Title Three of the law recognizes the right of indigenous peoples to maintain their 
own culture (arts. 13 and 14), guarantees their intellectual property rights in respect of 
traditional knowledge, including the right to benefit from the use thereof (art. 15), and 
provides protection for cultural and spiritual objects and sacred sites (art. 16). Indigenous 
traditional pharmacopoeias are also protected (art. 24), and any attempt to limit the ability 
of indigenous peoples to practice their traditional medicine is forbidden, with punitive 
measures established for breach of this prohibition (art. 25).  
</p>
<p>45. Title Four of the law addresses education and guarantees discrimination-free access 
to education (art. 17). The State commits to implementing educational programs that are 
appropriate to the specific needs and lifestyles of indigenous peoples (art. 19).  
Furthermore, article 18 forbids any form of instruction or information that disparages the 
cultural identities, traditions, history or aspirations of indigenous people. Article 21 makes 
clear that the State must take special measures to ensure that indigenous children benefit 
from financial assistance at all levels within the educational system. 
</p>
<p>46. Also guaranteed is access on a non-discriminatory basis to health care and all other 
social services (art. 22). The law stipulates that the centres delivering these services must be 
adapted to indigenous peoples&#8217; needs in the areas in which they live (art. 23.1); it provides 
for the participation of indigenous health-care workers in integrated primary health-care 
services, and the organization by the State of vaccination programmes and reproductive 
health-awareness campaigns (art. 23.2). The law further provides for the specific health 
needs of indigenous women and children to be taken into account (art. 23.3). 
</p>
<p>47. Importantly, the law also provides protection for the rights of indigenous peoples to 
lands and resources. Specifically, it states that indigenous peoples, collectively and 
individually, have a right to own, possess, access and use the lands and natural resources 
that they have traditionally used or occupied for their subsistence, pharmacopeia and work 
(art. 31). The State is obliged to facilitate delimitation of these lands on the basis of 
indigenous customary rights, and has a duty to ensure legal recognition of the title 
according to customary rights, even in cases where indigenous peoples do not previously 
possess any kind of formal title (art. 32).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>48. Furthermore, the law provides for consultations regarding measures that affect 
indigenous lands or resources or that entail the creation of protected areas that affect 
indigenous peoples&#8217; ways of life (art. 39)27. This provision complements article 3 of the 
law, which prescribes consultation with indigenous people before &#8220;consideration, 
formulation or implementation of any legislative, administrative or development 
programmes or projects that may affect them directly or indirectly.&#8221; Article 3 also outlines 
the basic characteristics of the required consultations in terms that generally comport with 
international standards, and further provides for the procedures for consultation and 
participation of indigenous peoples to be established by a Council of Ministers decree. 
Article 3.6 specifically states that the consultations must be carried out in good faith, 
without pressure or threat, and with a view to obtaining the free, prior and informed consent 
of the concerned indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National Action Plan 
</b></p>
<p>49. A second significant initiative regarding the rights of indigenous peoples is the 
National Action Plan on the Improvement of the Quality of Life of Indigenous Peoples, 
2009-2013. Developed jointly by the Ministry of Health, Social Affairs and Family, 
UNICEF and RENAPAC, the plan sets out significant outcomes (<i>effets</i>), as well as specific 
ways in which these outcomes can be realized, for the target period 2009-2013.  
</p>
<p>50. The plan also establishes significant targets and goals that would directly improve 
the lives of indigenous peoples. Priority area 1 encompasses education, including 
improving access of school-age indigenous children to good-quality primary education. The 
goals of the second area, which focuses on health, include improved access for indigenous 
persons to good-quality health and nutrition services, preventive HIV/AIDS care, potable 
water, and sanitation and hygiene services. The third thematic area, which deals with 
citizenship and legal protection, seeks to ensure that all indigenous infants and their parents 
acquire civil identity documents and that laws are reinforced to protect indigenous peoples 
and reduce discrimination and impunity. The fourth priority area, concerning cultural 
identity and access to lands and resources, targets negative national attitudes towards the 
cultures of indigenous peoples and aims to increase their participation in conservation and 
sustainable development activities, as well as improve their access to revenue-generating 
programmes designed to reduce extreme poverty. The final two thematic areas are 
dedicated to building the capacity of indigenous advocacy organizations.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur applauds these ambitious targets, and notes that the 
Indigenous Rights Law and the National Action Plan have the potential to be mutually 
reinforcing expressions of the Government&#8217;s strategic priorities for its relationship with and 
support of the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
 27 The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that a provision contained in article 39 of the version of 
</p>
<p>the law that was adopted by parliament was omitted in the final version of the law that was 
promulgated by the President of the Republic.  The omitted phrase, which addressed the situation of 
already established protected areas, stated as follows: &#8220;In the case where protected areas are created 
on lands occupied or traditionally utilized by indigenous peoples, the State has the obligation to 
consult them and take measures to guarantee their access to those areas for traditional activities or 
subsistence needs, and include them in the management of the resources.&#8221;   The Special Rapporteur 
hopes that the law, as it now stands, will be interpreted as implying this guarantee.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Inter-ministerial committee 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur has learned that an inter-ministerial committee is to be 
established with responsibility for coordinating the implementation of the Indigenous 
Rights Law and other initiatives relevant to indigenous peoples, including the National 
Action Plan. The new law itself provides for the creation of the committee, and stipulates 
that it should be an &#8220;inter-ministerial committee to follow up and evaluate the promotion 
and protection of indigenous peoples, with the participation of their representatives and 
civil society&#8221; (art. 45). With the Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Justice as its 
focal point, the committee will serve as a permanent mechanism at the national level to 
assist the various ministries and relevant Government bodies to coordinate efforts and 
implement programmes concerning indigenous peoples. To ensure its operation, the inter-
ministerial committee will have both permanent staff allocated to it and rotating temporary 
staff from the various ministries. 
</p>
<p><b> D. National Human Rights Commission  
</b></p>
<p>53. The National Human Rights Commission, a relatively new body instituted in 2003 
following the adoption of the new Constitution, is an independent State institution that 
operates autonomously. Its general objectives are to contribute to the promotion and 
consolidation of the rule of law in Congo; contribute to the widespread acceptance and 
understanding of human rights; assist with conceptualizing and realizing educational 
campaigns that promote the protection of vulnerable peoples, including indigenous peoples; 
promote and assist the Government of Congo with the signing and ratification of 
international human rights instruments; and strengthen relationships with the relevant 
agencies of the United Nations and with foreign diplomats.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Other 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to learn of other initiatives that indicate an overall 
strengthening of indigenous rights within the Republic of the Congo. First, the Government 
has helped establish the International forum on indigenous peoples of Central Africa 
(<i>Forum international sur les populations autochtones d&#8217;Afrique centrale </i>- FIPAC), an 
inter-governmental initiative that allows States, civil society and indigenous peoples from 
Central Africa, the private sector, international NGOs and agencies of the United Nations to 
come together to discuss indigenous issues. 
</p>
<p>55. One key aim of the forum is to strengthen the Network of indigenous peoples of 
Central Africa (RENAPAC). The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that, while it is important 
to strengthen national and international networks in order to encourage shared learning and 
experience, it is essential that indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations at the local level are not 
excluded from such initiatives in favour of nationalized representation that may not 
necessarily or fully represent local indigenous peoples&#8217; interests.   
</p>
<p>56. The Republic of the Congo has also been actively involved in negotiations regarding 
a pilot project of UN-REDD (United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries), the 
multifaceted international program to combat climate change, which has important 
implications for conserving traditional indigenous lands, territories and resources.28 
However, the Special Rapporteur heard concerns about the inadequate consultation and 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>participation of local communities, indigenous peoples and civil society in the development 
of the Congo Readiness Preparation Plan (RPP), the document that establishes the 
implementation strategy of the REDD project. Further concerns with the plan include a lack 
of specific provisions concerning the rights of indigenous peoples under the plan, which 
may lead to inadequate benefit-sharing of REDD revenues. The Government of Congo 
insists that civil society organizations have taken an active part in the implementation of the 
REDD process.   
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Implementation challenges 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the Government of Congo has manifested a 
commitment to advance the rights of indigenous peoples in light of relevant international 
standards by adopting important legislative, policy and administrative measures. In 
particular, the development of both the law on indigenous peoples and the National Action 
Plan are significant landmarks in this regard. 
</p>
<p>58. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that a great deal remains to be done 
to advance implementation of these initiatives, beginning with ensuring that all relevant 
Government officials and agencies are aware of the implications of these initiatives for their 
respective portfolios. With regard to the National Action Plan, despite its stated timeframe 
of 2009 to 2013, the Special Rapporteur observed during his visit in late 2010 &#8211; the plan&#8217;s 
second year of operation &#8211; that a number of high-level Government officials of ministries 
directly related to the development, success and implementation of the plan were not aware 
of its existence. Also, the Special Rapporteur did not hear of any specific activities directly 
focused on implementing any aspect of the plan, and very few, if any, ministries had 
specific budgets allocated to initiatives that would be essential to turn the plan into action.  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur also observes that UNICEF is the only United Nations 
agency that has been involved in supporting the National Action Plan. Given the broad 
goals of the plan, particularly in relation to education and health care, it is important that all  
United Nations agencies with a presence in Congo engage directly with the National Action 
Plan in connection with their relevant development and human rights promotion activities. 
</p>
<p>60. In a similar vein, although the Indigenous Rights Law had not yet been adopted at 
the time of his visit, consideration of the law in the National Assembly was in its final 
stages, and the Special Rapporteur observed that few, if any, Government ministries or 
departments had started contemplating specific initiatives or reforms directly in response to 
the requirements of the law.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the challenge of implementation is 
considerable; the goals of the initiatives are significant, and the disadvantage of indigenous 
peoples with regard to the full spectrum of their rights is severe. For this very reason, the 
Special Rapporteur urges that concerted effort be made at every level of Government, in 
conjunction with the support of the international community, to ensure that these initiatives 
are realized. He further emphasizes that this concerted effort should be realized with full 
appreciation of indigenous cultural patterns and their own aspirations for the future. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that many Government officials have 
voiced their broad commitment to quashing discriminatory attitudes against indigenous 
peoples. In this context, however, the Special Rapporteur repeatedly heard the term 
&#8220;emancipation&#8221; lauded as the goal for the indigenous peoples of Congo. While 
emancipation may be an appropriate goal regarding the rights of indigenous peoples to be 
free from conditions of forced labour or to enjoy a life free from discrimination, the term 
also seemed to be used by Government officials in a way that advocated for indigenous 
peoples to abandon their traditional ways of life, including moving away from their hunter-</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>gather lifestyles and becoming integrated into the dominant social, economic and cultural 
patterns. Used in this sense, emancipation appeared to strongly suggest assimilation and 
loss of robust distinct indigenous identity.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Indigenous Rights Law explicitly prohibits 
forced assimilation of indigenous peoples (art. 14), as do contemporary international 
standards. Hence, any initiative to address the situation of indigenous peoples must not 
have as its goal, in principle or practice, assimilation in the sense of incorporation into the 
broader society with significant loss of identity. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that 
the efforts to overcome discrimination and improve the conditions of indigenous peoples 
must promote the overarching right of indigenous peoples to self-determination, which 
means advancing for indigenous peoples every opportunity to participate as full members 
of society, as well as the ability to maintain the integrity of their distinctive cultures and 
develop according to their own priorities.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of the Republic of the 
Congo for its commitment to reverse the disadvantaged conditions of indigenous 
peoples - those groups that have been known as Pygmies &#8211; and to advance their rights.  
This commitment is reflected in a number of initiatives, especially the National Action 
Plan and the new Law on the Promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The following conclusions and recommendations are aimed at strengthening, 
and meeting the significant challenge of implementing, the initiatives being taken to 
advance the rights of indigenous peoples in Congo, within the framework of 
international standards. The recommendations are directed primarily to the 
Government, but are also addressed in some respects to other actors, including the 
United Nations system and indigenous peoples themselves.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Combating discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Rapporteur perceives the social inequities faced by the indigenous 
people in Congo be rooted in historical patterns of social, economic, cultural and 
political discrimination. These patterns continue, thereby impeding indigenous 
peoples&#8217; effective control over all aspects of their lives, limiting their ability to enjoy 
basic human rights, and contributing to undermining their cultural identities.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur observes that the master-slave relationships that 
persist in present day Congo (paras. 16-19) reflect the structural inequities that result 
from deeply engrained discriminatory attitudes about indigenous peoples. These 
attitudes appear to have been internalized by both indigenous and non-indigenous 
segments of society to a significant extent, leading to acquiescence to these destructive 
power dynamics between the stronger and weaker elements of society.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the important steps taken in both the 
Indigenous Rights Law and the National Action Plan to redress the situation of 
discrimination. Still, given the profound systemic and entrenched discrimination 
against indigenous peoples, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need for broad 
societal engagement in order to erase discriminatory attitudes and foster a sense of 
understanding and respect among all Congolese citizens. The Special Rapporteur 
considers that overcoming this challenge will require a coordinated and concerted </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>effort, backed by significant resources and a broad range of actors from within the 
Government, civil society, United Nations agencies and other development partners.   
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>This targeted action should be part of a comprehensive national campaign 
focused on educating both indigenous peoples and Bantus about their rights and 
obligations towards one another. Such a campaign should have as a primary aim the 
sensitization of Congolese society as a whole. In practice, this will require a broad 
educational and media strategy, backed by international partners, that promotes the 
culture and identity of the indigenous peoples of Congo as dynamic contemporary 
elements of Congolese society.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Another aspect of such a campaign should be integrating, on a widespread 
basis, a tolerance and anti-discrimination programme into the national curriculum of 
the public school system. This would require additional educational workshops on 
tolerance, cooperation and anti-discrimination for adults and other members of 
society outside the educational system. The National Human Rights Commission can 
play a key role in disseminating such a programme, and must be provided with 
adequate financial resources to this end. United Nations agencies, in particular 
UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP and others should help facilitate this campaign, providing 
resources, funds and technical support to execute it. Civil society also has a role to 
play by assisting in developing workshops and helping to execute the media strategy 
with parallel advocacy strategies.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Development with due regard to culture and identity 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>As acknowledged by the Government, clear steps must be taken to redress the 
chronic poor living conditions of indigenous peoples and enhance development 
opportunities for them.  On the one hand, this will require enhanced and specifically 
dedicated funding, with specific budget lines devoted to the programme objectives 
outlined in the National Action Plan and the Indigenous Rights Law, as well as 
building the capacity of responsible Government agencies to diligently, and in 
coordinated fashion, progress towards these objectives.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Additionally, development initiatives must be designed in a culturally 
appropriate way, with the goal of not only advancing indigenous peoples&#8217; social and 
economic well-being, but also increasing their self-determination and ability to 
maintain their distinct cultural identities, languages and connections with their 
traditional lands. It is essential, as part of this process, to include indigenous peoples 
themselves in the design and delivery of culturally appropriate projects, especially in 
areas of poverty reduction, health and education.

<p>73. <b>Poverty reduction and income-generating programmes in Congo have often 
been premised on assisting and encouraging indigenous peoples to adopt sedentary, 
agro-pastoral lifestyles. This approach is necessarily disruptive of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
traditional hunter-gatherer subsistence way of life, and in tension with related 
cultural patterns which they may aspire to continue. Any efforts to combat poverty 
and develop income-generating projects in indigenous communities need to involve 
indigenous peoples themselves in the development and design of culturally 
appropriate projects. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Inadequate cultural adaptation in the delivery of health services appears to 
create a barrier to the effective enjoyment of the right to health for indigenous peoples 
that goes beyond proximity to a health clinic. More needs to be done to generate 
trained indigenous health-care workers, to establish specific methods of incorporating 
traditional medicine in the delivery of health services, and to increase participation of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5

<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous communities in designing health services that respond to their unique 
needs. The World Health Organization (WHO) should play a key role in advancing 
this agenda.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>While the Government has taken important steps to improve indigenous health, 
it should strengthen efforts to ensure that indigenous peoples have equal access to 
primary health care and that the basic health needs of indigenous communities are 
met, especially in remote areas. Further efforts should be made by the Ministry of 
Health, in consultation with UNICEF and WHO, to improve the delivery of health 
services to indigenous peoples in a culturally appropriate manner, with attention to 
the special health needs of indigenous women and children. Every effort should be 
made to enhance indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in the formation of health policy 
and delivery of services. The Government should ensure and strengthen support for 
health-care initiatives by indigenous communities and organizations as a matter of 
priority. All medical professionals should be provided with comprehensive, culturally 
appropriate medical training, and health services in the language of the community 
should always be available. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>With regard to education, the Special Rapporteur notes the positive impact that 
the ORA schools (para. 24) have had in providing indigenous students better access to 
education in certain places, and he encourages building on the ORA model. At the 
same time, the Special Rapporteur notes that the final goal of the ORA programme is 
the integration, after a three-year transition period, of indigenous students into the 
regular national school system. The Special Rapporteur thus observes that while the 
ORA schools are an important first initiative, similar initiatives that apply after the 
three-year transition period are required. Further, measures should be taken to 
increase involvement of indigenous communities in educational programming, and to 
incorporate indigenous methods of teaching, cross-cultural curricula, bilingual 
instruction, and due regard for the indigenous calendar of subsistence activities and 
other cultural patterns. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Given the multifaceted needs of indigenous peoples with regard to 
development, and acknowledging the goal of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples to mainstream the rights of these peoples in United 
Nations programming, the Special Rapporteur observes that the United Nations 
country team in Congo should consider employing an indigenous peoples&#8217; rights focal 
point in order to better incorporate the specific needs of indigenous people into its 
general programming. This should be done with priority given to including indigenous 
staff in the United Nations country team. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Rights over lands and resources 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>As with indigenous peoples elsewhere, secure rights to traditional territories 
are crucial to the cultural and physical survival of indigenous peoples in Congo. The 
new Indigenous Rights Law affirms indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to lands and natural 
resources on the basis of traditional patterns of use and occupancy (art. 31), and 
provides for demarcation and specific recognition of the lands that belong to 
indigenous peoples according to customary tenure (art. 32). The Special Rapporteur 
emphasizes that the necessary task of implementing these provisions of the law and 
relevant international standards, will require a significant, coordinated effort. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>79. <b>The land and resource rights provisions of the Indigenous Rights Law go well 
beyond what is provided in the previously existing laws &#8211; in particular the land and 
forestry codes</b>29<b> &#8211; which together have comprehensively defined property or use rights 
in land and natural resources.   
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Government will need to develop and fully implement a new procedure for 
demarcating and registering lands in accordance with indigenous peoples&#8217; customary 
rights and tenure, and new mechanisms for identifying and securing specific rights in 
natural resources. These measures, which should be developed in consultation with 
indigenous peoples, will require substantial funding, technical expertise and dedicated 
personnel.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Republic of the Congo should look to other countries that have long-
standing work on indigenous land rights regimes, and experience in developing laws 
on indigenous land tenure. The United Nations agencies should provide technical 
assistance to facilitate this undertaking.   
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Additionally, the Government will need to ensure that all administrative 
practices and the application of all laws related to lands and natural resources align 
with the Indigenous Rights Law, interpreted in light of international standards 
concerning indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to lands, territories and resources. To this end, 
the Government should establish a mechanism to undertake a comprehensive review 
at the national level of all such laws and relevant institutions and procedures.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Enhancing participation in decision making 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Essential to implementing all aspects of the initiatives being taken to advance 
the rights of indigenous peoples in Congo is enhancing indigenous participation in 
decision-making. This requires, in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, building greater opportunities for indigenous 
peoples to participate in decision-making processes of State institutions at all levels, as 
well as recognition, strengthening and accommodation of indigenous peoples own 
decision-making institutions and authority. Indigenous participation in various 
dimensions is instrumental to the right of self-determination and the empowerment of 
indigenous peoples to control their own destinies under conditions of equality. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Indigenous Rights Law mandates the Government to establish by decree a 
procedure for consulting indigenous peoples regarding development projects or other 
measures that affect them (art. 3). Such a decree should itself be developed in 
consultation with indigenous peoples, which will require a coordinated effort with 
indigenous leaders, as well as among interested Government actors.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to proceed with urgency to 
develop and adopt the consultation procedure required by the Indigenous Rights Law, 
in cooperation with indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives. Given the complexities 
involved, the Government will have to secure adequate technical expertise to ensure 
effectiveness of the procedure, and its concordance with international standards.  
Care will have to be taken especially to ensure that the consultation procedure is 
devised to have as its objective &#8211; in accordance with article 3.6 of the Indigenous 
Rights Law and article 19 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples &#8211; the 
obtainment of free, prior and informed consent. 
</b></p>
<p>  
 29 Forestry Code (Law No. 16-2000 of 20 November 2006); Land Law (Law No 10-2004 of 26 March 
</p>
<p>2004). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Advancing indigenous participation in decision-making also requires dedicated 
effort to confronting and overcoming barriers to indigenous peoples and individuals 
being part of the State&#8217;s political processes and governing institutions. Measures 
should be taken to ensure full and adequate opportunities for indigenous participation 
in legislative processes and Government institutions at all levels. There is no one way 
to facilitate increased indigenous participation in these arenas, but all efforts to 
develop programmes appropriate to the Congolese context should be done in 
consultation with indigenous peoples themselves. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Similarly, concerted and targeted attention is required for the development of 
means to recognize, strengthen and accommodate indigenous peoples&#8217; own decision-
making authority over their internal affairs and their customary dispute resolution 
institutions, in accordance with article 11 of the Indigenous Rights Law and 
international standards.  Specific steps will have to be taken to overcome the history 
of persistent disregard for indigenous authorities and customary law by the dominant 
legal structures and social forces, including steps to ensure that the legal system of 
Congo accommodates indigenous autonomy over internal decision-making and 
acknowledges indigenous traditional dispute resolution as a legitimate form of justice. 
Again, it is essential to ensure that indigenous peoples are fully consulted and invited 
to participate in determining the specific relevant arrangements.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Given that exclusion often stems from discriminatory attitudes directed 
towards indigenous peoples, any programme aimed at strengthening indigenous 
decision-making institutions and increasing their participation in all spheres of social, 
economic and political life will also necessarily need to form an integrated part of the 
national campaign to combat discrimination. The national sensitization campaign will 
in turn need to ensure that dominant ethnic groups who currently control decision-
making processes understand, accept and welcome the rights of indigenous peoples to 
participate in, and have control over, decision-making processes.    
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Education plays a key role in empowering indigenous peoples to take control of 
decisions affecting their lives. Thus, emphasis must be placed on developing culturally 
appropriate educational programmes that encourage indigenous peoples in their 
educational pursuits, and give them the necessary skills to become leaders of their own 
communities, effectively engage in consultation procedures and participate in State 
legislative and administrative processes at all levels.  </b></p>
<p>90. <b>Indigenous peoples themselves should endeavour to strengthen their capacities 
to control and manage their own affairs and to participate effectively in all decisions 
affecting them, in a spirit of cooperation and partnership with government authorities 
and NGOs with which they chose to work.    
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur observes that the final two focus areas of the National 
Action Plan are geared towards building the capacities of indigenous organizations, 
and in particular building the capacity of RENAPAC, the national network of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the 
role that such networks can play in strengthening local indigenous organizations, he 
cautions against Government or international support for RENAPAC that might 
simply empower individual leaders of the network, without any or adequate direct 
benefit flowing to indigenous peoples&#8217; communities and organizations at the local 
level. Moreover, it is important that the network be representative of a broad range of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations throughout the Congo, and that RENAPAC and its 
leadership remain accountable to that network.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Thus, the relevant focus areas of the National Action Plan must be engaged  
with a view to ensuring the broader goals of strengthening all indigenous peoples&#8217; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>organizations within the Republic of the Congo, and ensuring the representative and 
democratic nature of RENAPAC. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  International Cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Government should build on its international commitment to advance the 
rights of indigenous peoples and cooperate with international actors in this regard. In 
particular, the Government should ratify International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries, and seek the technical advisory assistance of the ILO in the development 
and execution of its programmes on indigenous peoples.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the United Nations country team to follow up on 
the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report, in full 
cooperation with the Government agencies concerned, and with the active 
involvement of the indigenous peoples of Congo. Further, the United Nations country 
team should ensure that awareness about indigenous peoples and their rights is 
integrated into all planning processes with regard to programmes and initiatives 
developed by the United Nations system in Congo. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>International agencies and donors should collaborate with indigenous peoples 
to design and implement specific programs that include, but are not limited to, 
projects and training programmes with a human rights-based approach to 
development for indigenous peoples.
