<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of the United States of America was held at the 11th meeting, on 11 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The delegation of the United States was headed by the United States 
</p>
<p>Ambassador to the Human Rights Council, Keith Harper, and the Acting Legal Adviser, 
</p>
<p>Department of State, Mary McLeod. At its 17th meeting, held on 15 May 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group adopted the report on the United States. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the United States: Botswana, the Netherlands 
</p>
<p>and Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of the United States: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/USA/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/USA/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/USA/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Azerbaijan, Belgium, China, Cuba, the 
</p>
<p>Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, 
</p>
<p>Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
</p>
<p>transmitted to the United States through the troika. These questions are available on the 
</p>
<p>extranet of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The co-head of the United States delegation, Keith Harper, noted the importance of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review mechanism and expressed pride in the record of the United 
</p>
<p>States and its acknowledgement of its imperfections. He welcomed civil society&#8217;s presence 
</p>
<p>and engagement. 
</p>
<p>6. He highlighted the announcement of support of the United States for the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as further explained in its 
</p>
<p>statement of support and its enactment of laws to empower tribal governments to provide 
</p>
<p>for public safety and to protect Native American women against domestic violence and 
</p>
<p>sexual assault.  
</p>
<p>7. The other co-head of the United States delegation, Mary McLeod, noted that the 
</p>
<p>United States had carefully considered the recommendations accepted from fellow States 
</p>
<p>Members of the United Nations during its first universal periodic review and had taken 
</p>
<p>many steps to implement them.  
</p>
<p>8. Ms. McLeod provided an outline of the democratic system in the United States, 
</p>
<p>which allows for scrutiny, advocacy and debate to fuel progress and reform. She outlined 
</p>
<p>federal efforts to end violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
</p>
<p>transgender individuals, to prosecute crimes motivated by bias, to prohibit discrimination in </p>


<p>federal employment and the military and to support efforts to ban the use of conversion 
</p>
<p>therapy for minors. Progress had also been made at the state level. 
</p>
<p>9. She noted that, although there were many successes to report, there remained much 
</p>
<p>work to be done, including in the light of the public release of the executive summary of the 
</p>
<p>Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on the former Central Intelligence Agency 
</p>
<p>detention and interrogation programme. 
</p>
<p>10. She noted that, as President Obama had acknowledged, the United States had 
</p>
<p>crossed a line and not lived up to its own values, and that it had taken responsibility for 
</p>
<p>that. She added that the United States had since taken steps to clarify that the legal 
</p>
<p>prohibition on torture applies everywhere and in all circumstances and to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>United States never resorts to use of those harsh interrogation techniques again. 
</p>
<p>11. James Cadogan of the United States Department of Justice provided an overview of 
</p>
<p>efforts to combat discrimination in the United States through laws like the Civil Rights Act 
</p>
<p>of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
</p>
<p>12. He noted that the recent tragic police-involved shootings or deaths of young African 
</p>
<p>American men had renewed a longstanding and critical debate about the even-handed 
</p>
<p>administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>13. The Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 400 law enforcement officials 
</p>
<p>for excessive use of force in the past six years and has opened more than 20 investigations 
</p>
<p>into discriminatory policing practices in various cities and states. A presidential task force 
</p>
<p>has also been convened on the issue. 
</p>
<p>14. Work continues to combat discrimination in other areas, including in protecting an 
</p>
<p>equal right to vote. The Department of Justice has recently brought challenges to racially 
</p>
<p>discriminatory voting laws in North Carolina and Texas. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>15. During the interactive dialogue, 117 delegations made statements. The 
</p>
<p>recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>

</p>
<p>17. Kenya was concerned with weak human rights monitoring mechanisms and digital 
</p>
<p>data protection.

</p>
<p>against Women had been designated as a priority for ratification. 
</p>
<p>19. Lebanon commended the commitment of the United States to the principles of 
</p>
<p>human rights established in constitutional law.

<p>&#8220;Generation Indigenous&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>43. The Philippines appreciated the increasing number of criminal convictions of human 
</p>

</p>
<p>juvenile offenders. 
</p>

</p>
<p>49. The Russian Federation regretted that the United States had paid insufficient 
</p>
<p>attention to the recommendations made during the first review cycle. 
</p>
<p>50. Rwanda welcomed the increasing number of states that had abolished the death 
</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Government.  
</p>
<p>56. Slovenia noted challenges, particularly non-discrimination, the prohibition of torture 
</p>
<p>and mass surveillance. 
</p>
<p>57. The United States noted its view that torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment and punishment are absolutely prohibited at all times and in all places under both 
</p>
<p>international law and United States domestic law.  
</p>
<p>58. President Obama issued an executive order ending the Central Intelligence Agency&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>detention and interrogation programme and directing humane treatment of individuals 
</p>
<p>detained in armed conflict. The United States has investigated allegations of torture or 
</p>
<p>mistreatment since 11 September 2001. 
</p>
<p>59. In combating terrorism, the United States remains firmly committed to upholding its 
</p>
<p>international obligations.  
</p>
<p>60. The United States is party to a number of human rights treaties and continues to 
</p>
<p>explore whether and how to ratify additional treaties, including the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>61. While it is not at this time considering becoming a party to the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, the United States does engage with States parties on issues of 
</p>
<p>concern, consistent with the requirements of United States law. 
</p>
<p>62. United States intelligence activities are authorized pursuant to a framework based on 
</p>
<p>the rule of law, whereby statutes and other authorities established through democratic 
</p>
<p>institutions govern its activities. United States intelligence collection programmes and 
</p>
<p>activities are subject to stringent and multilayered oversight mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>63. Although the United States has federal laws and laws in the majority of states 
</p>
<p>authorizing the death penalty for the most serious crimes that are within constitutional </p>


<p>limits and consistent with its international obligations, defendants eligible for the death 
</p>
<p>penalty receive heightened procedural safeguards over and above those enjoyed by all 
</p>
<p>criminal defendants. 
</p>
<p>64. The recent trend in the United States is away from the use of capital punishment. No 
</p>
<p>defendant found by a court to have significant intellectual and adaptive disabilities may be 
</p>
<p>subject to capital punishment, either at the state or federal levels.  
</p>
<p>65. The United States seeks to prevent excessive uses of force and racial profiling in law 
</p>
<p>enforcement by participating in the training of federal, state and local law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers across the country. 
</p>
<p>66. In December, the United States announced an updated policy applicable to all law 
</p>
<p>enforcement activity under federal supervision, instructing that officers may not consider 
</p>
<p>race or a number of other factors to any degree when making routine or spontaneous law 
</p>
<p>enforcement decisions, unless those characteristics apply to a suspect&#8217;s description. 
</p>
<p>67. The United States makes strong efforts to combat racial discrimination in education, 
</p>
<p>strongly supporting diversity at all levels.  
</p>
<p>68. The United States seeks to address hate crimes, including through the Shepard-Byrd 
</p>
<p>Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which greatly expanded the Federal Government&#8217;s ability to 
</p>
<p>prosecute bias-motivated violence.  
</p>
<p>69. There has been a trend away from corporal punishment in United States schools and 
</p>
<p>parenting programmes, and home visitation providers stress positive discipline with 
</p>
<p>parents, guiding them away from physical or violent punishment.  
</p>
<p>70. The United States has a strong commitment to preventing domestic violence, dating 
</p>
<p>violence, sexual assault and stalking; assisting those who are survivors; and holding 
</p>
<p>accountable those who commit such crimes. The Violence Against Women Act is designed 
</p>
<p>to increase the availability of services for victims of violence and improve the criminal 
</p>
<p>justice response. 
</p>
<p>71. South Africa encouraged the United States to implement the recommendations made 
</p>
<p>during the first review cycle. 
</p>
<p>72. Spain welcomed efforts to close the Guantanamo military prison and welcomed the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Affordable Medical Care&#8221; Act. 
</p>
<p>73. The Sudan urged the Government to eliminate all forms of discrimination in all 
</p>
<p>areas. 
</p>
<p>74. Sweden made a statement. 
</p>
<p>75. Switzerland noted the Senate report on methods of interrogation in the context of the 
</p>
<p>fight against terrorism. 
</p>
<p>76. Thailand expressed concern at racial profiling by local law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>immigration authorities.  
</p>
<p>77. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia welcomed initiatives to promote 
</p>
<p>human rights at international forums. 
</p>
<p>78. Timor-Leste commended the Government for its support for the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>79. Togo welcomed the law on access to health care and efforts to guarantee equal 
</p>
<p>opportunities in education. 
</p>
<p>80. Trinidad and Tobago noted the need to rid the society of racial discrimination. </p>


<p>81. Tunisia noticed the efforts made in combating racism and hate crimes. 
</p>
<p>82. Turkey expressed concerns about poor protection services for sexually exploited 
</p>
<p>children.  
</p>
<p>83. Ukraine noted the commitment to improving implementation of human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations and adherence to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>84. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland urged closing the 
</p>
<p>Guantanamo Bay detention facility.  
</p>
<p>85. Uruguay praised efforts to combat discrimination and a decline in the application of 
</p>
<p>the death penalty in states.  
</p>
<p>86. Brazil referred to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, immigration and 
</p>
<p>border security and interferences to privacy. 
</p>
<p>87. Viet Nam highlighted the need to ratify the remaining core international human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties.  
</p>
<p>88. Albania commended measures to counter intolerance, violence and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>89. Algeria commended efforts undertaken to eliminate racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>90. Angola noted executive actions to improve the regulation of immigration. 
</p>
<p>91. Argentina expressed concern that the application of the death penalty was 
</p>
<p>characterized by discrimination and arbitrariness.  
</p>
<p>92. Armenia appreciated the commitment of the United States to prevention of the crime 
</p>
<p>of genocide. 
</p>
<p>93. Australia welcomed the efforts of the United States to better protect the rights of 
</p>
<p>Native Americans.  
</p>
<p>94. Austria expressed concern that individuals continued to serve life sentences without 
</p>
<p>parole for crimes committed when they were under 18 years of age.  
</p>
<p>95. Azerbaijan noted the concerns expressed by treaty bodies about torture and ill-
</p>
<p>treatment in detention.  
</p>
<p>96. Bangladesh noted concerns about racial profiling against religious minorities.  
</p>
<p>97. Belgium noted reports on health hazards for children working in farms.  
</p>
<p>98. Benin noted the progress made in wages equality. 
</p>
<p>99. Bosnia and Herzegovina noted steps concerning indigenous peoples and asked for 
</p>
<p>the closure of the Guantanamo facility.  
</p>
<p>100. Botswana noted violence against women and encouraged addressing racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination. 
</p>
<p>101. The Bolivian Republic of Venezuela made a statement. 
</p>
<p>102. Bulgaria noted efforts against racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>103. Burkina Faso urged for improvement concerning the rights of women, children and 
</p>
<p>migrants. 
</p>
<p>104. Cabo Verde noted the lack of progress regarding the ratification of treaties. 
</p>
<p>105. Canada commended prosecution against forced labour and human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>106. The United States said that it is committed to the effective implementation of its 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations and welcomes input on ways to improve. Although it does not </p>


<p>have a single national human rights institution, it has multiple complementary protections 
</p>
<p>and mechanisms to reinforce respect for human rights, including through independent 
</p>
<p>judiciaries at the federal and state levels and numerous state and local human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions.  
</p>
<p>107. Recently, the Federal Government has increased engagement with state, local, tribal 
</p>
<p>and territorial governments on United States human rights obligations. For example, the 
</p>
<p>state of Illinois and the Federal Government have worked together to protect Illinois 
</p>
<p>residents from discrimination by mortgage lenders and other forms of financial 
</p>
<p>exploitation.  
</p>
<p>108. Additionally, states and cities of the United States often lead efforts to enforce anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination laws and implement important reforms. The city of Chicago&#8217;s significant 
</p>
<p>steps to respond to and prevent incidents of police misconduct include creating a 
</p>
<p>reparations fund and formally apologizing to the victims of certain police violence. Chicago 
</p>
<p>aims to improve relations among police and residents through training and a renewed 
</p>
<p>commitment to community policing.  
</p>
<p>109. The United States has successfully challenged initiatives by states to criminalize 
</p>
<p>mere undocumented presence in the country. 
</p>
<p>110. Non-citizens facing removal from the United States are afforded significant 
</p>
<p>procedural protections and those detained can challenge immigration detention in court.  
</p>
<p>111. The United States is committed to accountability for Homeland Security personnel 
</p>
<p>involved in any wrongdoing or misconduct, including excessive use of force.  
</p>
<p>112. For individuals detained pending removal proceedings and during the period 
</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to remove them, the United States ensures that they are treated 
</p>
<p>humanely and in a manner consistent with the United States Constitution, federal laws and 
</p>
<p>policies and applicable international obligations.  
</p>
<p>113. It has established detailed immigration detention standards and remains committed 
</p>
<p>to preventing abuses regarding detention conditions and bringing to justice those who 
</p>
<p>commit them. More people than ever before are enrolled in alternatives to detention 
</p>
<p>programmes.  
</p>
<p>114. The United States works aggressively to prevent and address human trafficking, 
</p>
<p>through wide-ranging efforts, including those related to training and victims&#8217; services.  
</p>
<p>115. United States federal law prohibits all forms of housing-related discrimination on the 
</p>
<p>basis of race, colour, religion, national origin, sex, disability or number of children.  
</p>
<p>116. The Government of the United States helps communities pursue alternatives to arrest 
</p>
<p>and prosecution of individuals for various behaviours associated with homelessness by 
</p>
<p>focusing on providing technical assistance and financial resources to help communities 
</p>
<p>provide housing first.  
</p>
<p>117. In addressing homelessness, the United States has made it a priority first to meet the 
</p>
<p>housing needs of families and individuals, and then provide other social support and 
</p>
<p>assistance, setting an ambitious agenda to reduce all forms of homelessness within the 
</p>
<p>decade and to reduce homelessness among military veterans by the end of 2015. 
</p>
<p>118. Chad noted concern related to recent events targeting the black community. 
</p>
<p>119. Chile valued measures implementing human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>120. China highlighted the deep-rooted human rights problems of the United States. 
</p>
