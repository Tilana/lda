ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
Enterra Energy Trust
Enterra  Energy  Trust  (the  "Trust"  and,  together  with  its  direct  and  indirect  subsidiaries  and

received  two  Trust  Units  or  two  Exchangeable  Shares  of  Enterra  Acquisition  Corp.,  in
accordance with the elections made by such holders, and Old Enterra became a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  the  Trust.  Old  Enterra  was  subsequently  amalgamated  with  Enterra  Acquisition

DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE TRUST
General
The  principal  undertaking  of  the  Trust  is  to  issue  Trust  Units  and  to  acquire  and  hold  debt

Trust primarily through (i) payments of interest and principal in respect of the Enterra Debt, and
(ii) dividends declared on the common shares of Enterra and/or redemptions of preferred shares
of Enterra, which amounts are transferred from EEC Trust to the Trust as payments of interest or

monthly basis.  See "Distributions".
Under the terms of the Trust Indenture, the Trust was created for the purposes of:
·

·
investing in the CT Units;
·
acquiring, holding, transferring and disposing of, investing in and otherwise dealing with assets,

·
repurchasing or redeeming Trust Units or other securities of the Trust, subject to the provisions of
the Trust Indenture and applicable law; and
·
engaging in all activities incidental or ancillary to any of the foregoing.
Strategy
Our  business  strategy  is  to  grow  our  reserves  and  distributions  by  acquiring  properties  which
provide additional production and potential for development upside. We are focused on per Unit
growth. We will finance acquisitions with both debt and equity, the optimal mix being one which
minimizes Unitholders’ dilution while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our ability to replace
and grow our reserves over time is the key success factor in our business strategy.
We  intend  to  distribute  approximately  80%  of  our  available  cash  flow  to  our  Unitholders.  See
"Distributions".  Future growth will be financed with a combination of additional Trust Units and
bank debt. The level of distribution to Unitholders will fluctuate depending on a number of factors,
including future commodity prices and operating results. The portion of cash not distributed to
Unitholders will be used for maintenance of capital or reduction of bank debt.
Risk Management and Marketing
We  are  exposed  to  all  of  the  normal  risks  inherent  within  the  oil  and  gas  sector,  including
commodity price risk, foreign-currency rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. We manage our
operations in a manner intended to minimize our exposure to such risks.
Credit Risk
Credit  risk  is  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  non-performance  of  contractual  obligations  by  a
customer  or  joint  venture  partner.  A  substantial  portion  of  our  accounts  receivable  are  with
customers in the energy industry and are subject to normal industry credit risk. We assess the
financial strength of our customers and joint venture partners through regular credit reviews in
order to minimize the risk of non-payment.
Foreign Exchange Risk
We are exposed to market risk from changes in the exchange rate between U.S. and Canadian
dollars.  The  price  we  receive  for  oil  and  natural  gas  production  is  based  on  a  benchmark
expressed in U.S. dollars, which is the standard for the oil and natural gas industry worldwide.
Our monthly distributions are also based on a value expressed in U.S. dollars. However, we pay
our operating expenses, drilling expenses and general overhead expenses in Canadian dollars.
Changes  to  the  exchange  rate  between  U.S.  and  Canadian  dollars  can  adversely  affect  us.
When the value of the U.S. dollar increases, we receive higher revenue and when the value of
the U.S. dollar declines, we receive lower revenue on the same amount of production sold at the
same prices. A change of $0.01 in the U.S. to CDN dollar would impact Enterra’s earnings by
approximately $193,000 and its cash flow by approximately $394,000.
Commodity Price Risk
Our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon
the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas. These commodity prices are subject to wide
fluctuations  and  market  uncertainties  due  to  a  variety  of  factors  that  are  beyond  our  control.
Factors influencing oil and natural gas prices include the level of global demand for crude oil, the
foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the establishment of and compliance with production quotas
by oil exporting countries, weather conditions which determine the demand for natural gas, the
price  and  availability  of  alternative  fuels  and  overall  economic  conditions.  It  is  impossible  to
predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty. Sustained weakness in oil
and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and
may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically.
Any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations,
can  have  an  adverse  affect  on  our  ability  to  obtain  capital  for  our  development  activities.
Similarly, any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on our
financial condition, results of operations and capital resources. If the WTI oil price were to change
by US$1.00 per bbl, the impact on Enterra’s earnings would be approximately $869,000 and the
impact on Enterra’s cash flow would be approximately $1,774,000. If natural gas prices were to
change by US$0.50 per mcf, the impact on Enterra’s earnings would be approximately $873,000
and the impact on Enterra’s cash flow would be approximately $1,781,000.
We  periodically  use  hedges  with  respect  to  a  portion  of  our  oil  and  natural  gas  production  to
mitigate our exposure to price changes. While the use of these derivative arrangements limits the
downside risk of price declines, such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from
price increases.
Enterra had several costless collars and forward contracts in place during the year in order to
minimize the volatility in crude oil pricing. Below is a summary of our hedging operations:

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk exists principally with respect to our indebtedness that bears interest at floating
rates.  At  December  31,  2003,  we  had  $34  million  of  indebtedness  bearing  interest  at  floating
rates. If interest rates were to change by one full percentage point, the net impact on Enterra’s
earnings would be approximately $244,000 and the net impact on Enterra’s cash flow would be
approximately $337,000.

Revenue Sources
For the year ended December 31, 2003, approximately 23% of the revenue from our properties
before hedging and royalties was derived from natural gas and approximately 76% was derived
from crude oil and natural gas liquids.
Competition
The petroleum industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other participants in
the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties, and the recruitment of employees. Any of our
competitors  can  make  acquisitions  and  bid  on  provincial  leases  in  Alberta.  Such  competitors
include oil companies and other income trusts, many of whom have greater financial resources,
staff and facilities than ours.  Our ability to increase reserves in the future will depend not only on
our ability to develop existing properties, but also on our ability to select and acquire suitable
additional producing properties or prospects for drilling. We also compete with numerous other
competitors  in  the  marketing  of  oil.  Competitive  factors  in  the  distribution  and  marketing  of  oil
include price and methods and reliability of delivery.
Seasonal Factors
The exploration for and development of oil and natural gas reserves is dependent on access to
areas where production is to be conducted.  Seasonal weather variations, including freeze up
and break up, affect access to our properties in certain circumstances.
Employees
At December 31, 2003, we had approximately 30 employees and consultants working both in the
Calgary head office and in field operations.
STATEMENT OF RESERVES DATA AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION
Notes and Definitions
The  determination  of  oil  and  gas  reserves  involves  the  preparation  of  estimates  that  have  an
inherent degree of associated uncertainty.  Categories of proved, probable and possible reserves
have been established to reflect the level of these uncertainties and to provide an indication of
the probability of recovery.
The estimation and classification of reserves requires the application of professional judgment
combined with geological and engineering knowledge to assess whether or not specific reserves
classification criteria have been satisfied.  Knowledge of concepts including uncertainty and risk,
probability and statistics, and deterministic and probabilistic estimation methods is required to
properly use and apply reserves definitions.
"Reserves"  are  estimated  remaining  quantities  of  oil  and  natural  gas  and  related  substances
anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations, from a given date forward, based on (a)
analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical, and engineering data;  (b) the use of established
technology;  and  (c)  specified  economic  conditions,  which  are  generally  accepted  as  being
reasonable and shall be disclosed. Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty
associated with the estimates.
"Proved" reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be
recoverable.  It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated
proved reserves.
"Developed Producing"  reserves  are  those  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  from
completion intervals open at the time of the estimate.  These reserves may be currently producing
or,  if  shut-in,  they  must  have  previously  been  on  production,  and  the  date  of  resumption  of
production must be known with reasonable certainty.
"Developed  Non-Producing"  reserves  are  those  reserves  that  either  have  not  been  on
production, or have previously been on production, but are shut-in, and the date of resumption of
production is unknown.
"Undeveloped" reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from know accumulations
where a significant expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to
render  them  capable  of  production.    They  must  fully  meet  the  requirements  of  the  reserves
classification (proved, probable, possible) to which they are assigned.  In multi-well pools, it may
be  appropriate  to  allocate  total  pool  reserves  between  the  developed  and  undeveloped
categories or to sub-divide the developed reserves for the pool between developed producing
and developed non-producing.  This allocation should be based on the estimator's assessment
as to the reserves that will be recovered from specific wells, facilities and completion intervals in
the pool and their respective development and production status.
"Probable"  reserves  are  those  additional  reserves  that  are  less  certain  to  be  recovered  than
proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater
or less than the sum of the estimated proved + probable reserves.
The following terms, used in the preparation of the McDaniel and Associates Report (as defined
herein) and this document, have  the following meanings:
"associated gas" means the gas cap overlying a crude oil accumulation in a reservoir.
"constant prices and costs" means prices and costs used in an estimate that are:
(a)
the Trust's prices and costs as at the effective date of the estimation, held constant throughout the
estimated lives of the properties to which the estimate applies;
(b)
if, and only to the extent that, there are fixed or presently determinable future prices or costs to
which the Trust is legally bound by a contractual or other obligation to supply a physical product,
including those for an extension period of a contract that is likely to be extended, those prices or
costs rather than the prices and costs referred to in paragraph (a).
For the purpose of paragraph (a), the reporting issuer's prices will be the posted price for oil and
the spot price for gas, after historical adjustments for transportation, gravity and other factors.
"crude oil" or "oil" means a mixture that consists mainly of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons,
which may contain sulphur and other non-hydrocarbon compounds, that is recoverable at a well
from  an  underground  reservoir  and  that  is  liquid  at  the  conditions  under  which  its  volume  is
measured or estimated. It does not include solution gas or natural gas liquids.
"development costs" means costs incurred to obtain access to reserves and to provide facilities
for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas from the reserves. More specifically,
development costs, including applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and
other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to:
(a)
gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the
purpose  of  determining  specific  development  drilling  sites,  clearing  ground,  draining,  road
building,  and  relocating  public  roads,  gas  lines  and  power  lines,  to  the  extent  necessary  in
developing the reserves;
(b)
drill and equip development wells, development type stratigraphic test wells and service wells,
including  the  costs  of  platforms  and  of  well  equipment  such  as  casing,  tubing,  pumping
equipment and the wellhead assembly;
(c)
acquire, construct and install production facilities such as flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters,
manifolds, measuring devices and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing
plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems; and
(d)
provide improved recovery systems.
"development well" means a well drilled inside the established limits of an oil or gas reservoir,
or in close proximity to the edge of the reservoir, to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to
be productive.
"exploration costs" means costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and
in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects that may contain oil and gas
reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory type stratigraphic test wells.
Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred
to  in  part  as  "prospecting  costs")  and  after  acquiring  the  property.  Exploration  costs,  which
include  applicable  operating  costs  of  support  equipment  and  facilities  and  other  costs  of
exploration activities, are:
(a)
costs  of  topographical,  geochemical,  geological  and  geophysical  studies,  rights  of  access  to
properties to conduct those studies, and salaries and other expenses of geologists, geophysical
crews and others conducting those studies (collectively sometimes referred to as "geological and
geophysical costs");
(b)
costs  of  carrying  and  retaining  unproved  properties,  such  as  delay  rentals,  taxes  (other  than
income and capital taxes) on properties, legal costs for title defence, and the maintenance of land
and lease records;
(c)
dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions;
(d)
costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells; and
(e)
costs of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic test wells.
"exploratory well" means a well that is not a development well, a service well or a stratigraphic
test well.
"field" means an area consisting of a single reservoir or  multiple  reservoirs all  grouped  on  or
related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There
may be two or more reservoirs in a field that are separated vertically by intervening impervious
strata or laterally by local geologic barriers, or both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in
overlapping  or  adjacent  fields  may  be  treated  as  a  single  or  common  operational  field.  The
geological  terms  "structural  feature"  and  "stratigraphic  condition"  are  intended  to  denote
localized geological features, in contrast to broader terms such as "basin", "trend", "province",
"play" or "area of interest".
"future prices and costs" means future prices and costs that are:
(a)
generally accepted as being a reasonable outlook of the future;
(b)
if, and only to the extent that, there are fixed or presently determinable future prices or costs to
which the Trust issuer is legally bound by a contractual or other obligation to supply a physical
product, including those for an extension period of a contract that is likely to be extended, those
prices or costs rather than the prices and costs referred to in paragraph (a).
"future income tax expenses" means future income tax expenses estimated (generally, year-
by-year):
(a)
making appropriate allocations of estimated unclaimed costs and losses carried forward for tax
purposes, between oil and gas activities and other business activities;
(b)
without deducting estimated future costs (for example, Crown royalties) that are not deductible in
computing taxable income;
(c)
taking into account estimated tax credits and allowances (for example, royalty tax credits); and
(d)
applying to the future pre-tax net cash flows relating to the reporting issuer's oil and gas activities
the  appropriate  year-end  statutory  tax  rates,  taking  into  account  future  tax  rates  already
legislated.
"future  net  revenue"  means  the  estimated  net  amount  to  be  received  with  respect  to  the
development  and  production of  reserves  (including  synthetic oil,  coal  bed  methane  and  other
non-conventional  reserves)  estimated  using  constant  prices  and  costs  or  forecast  prices  and
costs.
"gross" means:
(a)
in relation to the Trust's interest in production or reserves, its "company gross reserves", which
are  it's  working  interest  (operating  or  non-operating)  share  before  deduction  of  royalties  and
without including any royalty interests of the Trust;
(b)
in relation to wells, the total number of wells in which the Trust has an interest; and
(c)
in relation to properties, the total area of properties in which the Trust has an interest.
"natural  gas"  means  the  lighter  hydrocarbons  and  associated  non-hydrocarbon  substances
occurring  naturally  in  an  underground  reservoir,  which  under  atmospheric  conditions  are
essentially  gases  but  which  may  contain  natural  gas  liquids.  Natural  can  exist  in  a  reservoir
either  dissolved  in  crude  oil  (solution  gas)  or  in  a  gaseous  phase  (associated  gas  or
non-associated  gas).  Non-hydrocarbon  substances  may  include  hydrogen  sulphide,  carbon
dioxide and nitrogen.
"natural gas liquids" means those hydrocarbon components that can be recovered from natural
gas as liquids including, but not limited to, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes plus, condensate
and small quantities of non-hydrocarbons.
"net" means
(a)
in relation to the Trust's interest in production or reserves its working interest (operating or non-
operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus the its royalty interests in production
or reserves;
(b)
in relation to the Trust's interest in wells, the number of wells obtained by aggregating the Trust's
working interest in each of its gross wells; and
(c)
in relation to the Trust's interest in a property, the total area in which the Trust has an interest
multiplied by the working interest owned by the Trust.
"non-associated gas" means an accumulation of natural gas in a reservoir where there is no
crude oil.
"operating costs" or "production costs" means costs incurred to operate and maintain wells
and related equipment and facilities, including applicable operating costs of support equipment
and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment
and facilities.
"production"  means  recovering,  gathering,  treating,  field  or  plant  processing  (for  example,
processing gas to extract natural gas liquids) and field storage of oil and gas.
"property" includes:
(a)
fee ownership or a lease, concession, agreement, permit, license or other interest representing
the right to extract oil or gas subject to such terms as may be imposed by the conveyance of that
interest;
(b)
royalty interests, production payments payable in oil or gas, and other non-operating interests in
properties operated by others; and
(c)
an agreement with a foreign government or authority under which a reporting issuer participates
in the operation of properties or otherwise serves as "producer" of the underlying reserves  (in
contrast to being an independent purchaser, broker, dealer or importer).
A property does not include supply agreements, or contracts that represent a right to purchase,
rather than extract, oil or gas.
"property acquisition costs" means costs incurred to acquire a property (directly by purchase or
lease,  or  indirectly  by  acquiring  another  corporate  entity  with  an  interest  in  the  property),
including:
(a)
costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease a property;
(b)
the portion of the costs applicable to hydrocarbons when land including rights to hydrocarbons is
purchased in fee;
(c)
brokers' fees, recording and registration fees, legal costs and other costs incurred in acquiring
properties.
"proved  property"  means  a  property  or  part  of  a  property  to  which  reserves  have  been
specifically attributed.
"reservoir"  means  a  porous  and  permeable  underground  formation  containing  a  natural
accumulation of producible oil or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and
is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
"service well" means a well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an
existing  field.    Wells  in  this  class  are  drilled  for  the  following  specific  purposes:  gas  injection
(natural gas, propane, butane or flue gas), water injection, steam injection, air injection, salt-water
disposal, water supply for injection, observation, or injection for combustion.
"solution gas" means natural gas dissolved in crude oil.
"stratigraphic  test  well"  means  a  drilling  effort,  geologically  directed,  to  obtain  information
pertaining to a specific geologic condition. Ordinarily, such wells are drilled without the intention
of being completed for hydrocarbon production.  They include wells for the purpose of core tests
and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic test wells are
classified as (a) "exploratory type" if not drilled into a proved property; or (b) "development type",
if  drilled  into  a  proved property.    Development  type  stratigraphic  wells  are  also  referred  to  as
"evaluation wells".
"support  equipment  and  facilities"  means  equipment  and  facilities  used  in  oil  and  gas
activities, including seismic equipment, drilling equipment, construction and grading equipment,
vehicles, repair shops, warehouses, supply points, camps, and division, district or field offices.
"Trust" or "the Trust" means Enterra Energy Trust.
"unproved property" means a property or part of a property to which no reserves have  been
specifically attributed.
"well  abandonment  costs"  means  costs  of  abandoning  a  well  (net  of  salvage  value)  and  of
disconnecting  the  well  from  the  surface  gathering  system.  They  do  not  include  costs  of
abandoning the gathering system or reclaiming the wellsite.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Net Present Value of Future Net Revenue
In  accordance  with  National  Instrument  51-101  – Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Oil  and  Gas
Activities,  McDaniel    prepared  the  McDaniel  Report  dated  February  27,  2004.    The  McDaniel
Report evaluated, as at December 31, 2003, the Trust's oil, NGL and natural gas reserves.  The
tables below are a summary of the oil, NGL and natural gas reserves of the Trust and the net
present value of future net revenue attributable to such reserves as evaluated in the McDaniel
Report based on constant and forecast price and cost assumptions.  The tables summarize the
data contained in the McDaniel Report and as a result may contain slightly different numbers
than such report due to rounding.  Also due to rounding, certain columns may not add exactly.
 The net present value of future net revenue attributable to the Trust's reserves is stated
without  provision  for  interest  costs  and  general  and  administrative  costs,  but  after
providing  for  estimated  royalties,  production  costs,  development  costs,  other  income,
future  capital  expenditures,  and  well  abandonment  costs  for  only  those  wells  assigned
reserves by McDaniel. It should not be assumed that the undiscounted or discounted net
present  value  of  future  net  revenue  attributable  to  the  Trust's  reserves  estimated  by
McDaniel  represent  the  fair  market  value  of  those  reserves.  Other  assumptions  and
qualifications  relating  to  costs,  prices  for  future  production  and  other  matters  are
summarized herein. The recovery and reserve estimates of the Trust's oil, NGL and natural
gas  reserves  provided  herein  are  estimates  only  and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the
estimated reserves will be recovered.  Actual reserves may be greater than or less than the
estimates provided herein.
The  McDaniel  Report  is  based  on  certain  factual  data  supplied  by  the  Trust  and  McDaniel’s
opinion of reasonable practice in the industry.  The extent and character of ownership and all
factual  data  pertaining  to  the  Trust's  petroleum  properties  and  contracts  (except  for  certain
information residing in the public domain) were supplied by the Trust to McDaniel and accepted
without  any  further  investigation.    McDaniel  accepted  this  data  as  presented  and  neither  title
searches nor field inspections were conducted.

Undeveloped Reserves
The following discussion generally describes the basis on which the Trust attributes Proved and
Probable Undeveloped Reserves and its plans for developing those Undeveloped Reserves.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Proved  undeveloped  reserves  are  generally  those  reserves  related  to  wells  that  have  been
tested and not yet tied-in, wells drilled near the end of the fiscal year or wells further away from
the  Trust's  gathering  systems.    In  addition,  such  reserves  may  relate  to  planned  infill  drilling
locations.    The  majority  of  these  reserves  are  planned  to  be  on  stream  within  a  two  year
timeframe.
Probable Undeveloped Reserves
Probable undeveloped reserves are generally those reserves tested or indicated by analogy to
be productive, infill drilling locations and lands contiguous to production.  The majority of these
reserves are planned to be on stream within a two year timeframe.
Significant Factors or Uncertainties Affecting Reserves Data
The process of estimating reserves is complex.  It requires significant judgments and decisions
based on available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic data.  These estimates
may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production
performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and
costs  change.    The  reserve  estimates  contained  herein  are  based  on  current  production
forecasts, prices and economic conditions. The Trust's reserves are evaluated by McDaniel, an
independent engineering firm.
As circumstances change and additional data become available, reserve estimates also change.
Estimates made are reviewed and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by the new
information.  Revisions are often required due to changes in well performance, prices, economic
conditions and governmental restrictions.
Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates are accurate, reserve
estimation  is  an  inferential  science.    As  a  result,  the  subjective  decisions,  new  geological  or
production information and a changing environment may impact these estimates.  Revisions to
reserve  estimates  can  arise  from  changes  in  year-end  oil  and  gas  prices,  and  reservoir
performance.  Such revisions can be either positive or negative.
Future Development Costs
The table below sets out the development costs deducted in the estimation of future net revenue
attributable  to  proved  reserves  (using  both  constant  prices  and  costs  and  forecast  prices  and
costs) and proved plus probable reserves (using forecast prices and costs only).

The  Trust  estimates  that  its  internally  generated  cash  flow  will  be  sufficient  to  fund  the  future
development costs disclosed above.  The Trust typically has available three sources of funding
to finance its capital expenditure program; internally generated cash flow from operations, debt
financing  when  appropriate  and  new  equity  issues,  if  available  on  favourable  terms.    Debt
financing  is  available  to  the  Trust  at  0.25%  above  prime  rate,  which  is  currently  3.75%  per
annum.
The Trust expects to fund its total 2004 capital program with internally generated cash flow and,
although quarterly fluctuations in funding levels are expected, the objective is to remain at the
current net debt level throughout the 2004 financial year.  The Trust's objective is to maintain its
debt to cash flow ratio at less than 2 times estimated future cash flows.
Oil and Gas Properties
Enterra's core areas included the Peace River Arch area of Alberta, Central Alberta and East
Central Alberta.  Enterra also has a large inventory of prospects, the development of which could
significantly increase the size of Enterra’s existing production and reserve base.
Peace River Arch of Alberta
Clair
The Clair property is located 13 km north of the city of Grande Prairie, Alberta.  Enterra’s assets
include a 100% working interest in 3,840 acres of land, 20 producing oil wells and an oil treating
facility.  Gas is conserved and processed at the Encana Sexsmith gas plant.
Production  is  primarily  from  the  Doe  Creek  (Dunvegan)  formation  with  a  small  amount  of  gas
production from the Charlie Lake and Halfway.  Production is light, 44 degree API gravity crude
and solution gas is produced from the Doe Creek oil pool.  At December 31, 2003 there were 20
oil wells producing a combined 2,175 bbl/d of oil and 2.1 mmcf/d of solution gas.  One dually
completed Charlie Lake and Halfway gas well also produces combined daily gas of 400 mcf/d.
Enterra has a 100% working interest in this well.  To date, Enterra has drilled or recompleted 29
wells for oil and seven wells for water injection.  There are no further drilling plans for the pool.
 Enterra has received waterflood approval  in June 2003 (with two recent amendment approvals)
and  is  in  the  final  stages  of  achieving  100%  voidage  replacement  pending  minor  waterflood
modifications.  Nine wells shut-in in 2003 due to excessive gas production will be reactivated
once pressure support from the waterflood is received at the wells.
Total  proved  reserves  assigned  to  the  Doe  Creek  ‘A’  (Dunvegan)  pool  are  1,997  mbbl  of  oil,
1,236  mmcf  of  gas  and  38  mbbl  of  natural  gas  liquids.    Total  proved  and  probable  reserves
assigned to the Doe Creek ‘A’ (Dunvegan) pool are 2,998 mbbl of oil, 1,633 mmcf of gas and 51
mbbl of natural gas liquids.  The probable reserves category contains the incremental reserves
and net present value of the waterflood.  McDaniel and Associates have stated that the additional
reserves associated with the waterflood would be moved into the proven category in a staged
approach.  Critical stages include the achievement of 100% voidage replacement and continued
performance.  Total proved reserves assigned to the 13-07-073-5W6 Charlie Lake / Halfway gas
well are 256 mmcf of gas and 8 mbbl of natural gas liquids.  Total proved and probable reserves
assigned to the Charlie Lake / Halfway gas well are 368 mmcf of gas and 11 mbbl of natural gas
liquids.
Enterra also owns and operates a central oil treating facility at Clair which was connected into
the Pembina Peace Pipeline system in September 2003.
Gordondale
The  Gordondale  property  is  located  75  km  northwest  of  the  city  of  Grande  Prairie,  Alberta.
 Enterra’s assets included an average working interest of 79% in 6,240 gross acres of land as
well  as  two  flowing  gas  wells,  one  gas  well  awaiting  tie  in  and  one  oil  well.    Production  is
currently from the Upper Kiskatinaw and Halfway zones.  Enterra’s share of production for the
property was 300 mcf/d of gas, 8 bbl/d of oil and 4 bbl/d of natural gas liquids.  The property was
sold in December 2003.
McDaniel and Associates had assigned Company’s share of total proved reserves to Gordondale
of  164  mmcf  of  gas,  2  mbbl  of  oil,  and  2  mbbl  of  natural  liquids.    Total  proved  and  probable
reserves were 217 mmcf of gas, 3 mbbl of oil, and 3 mbbl of natural gas liquids.
Rolla
The Rolla property is located 70 km north of the city of Grande Prairie, Alberta.  Enterra’s assets
include a 50% working interest in 1,920 acres of land, 3 operated producing gas wells and a
12.5% working interest in two field compressors.  Enterra’s share of current gas production is
approximately  800  mcf/d  from  three  50%  working  interest  Dunvegan  gas  wells.    This  gas  is
processed at the Duke Midstream, Gordondale East gas plant.
Total  proved  reserves  assigned  to  the  Dunvegan  are  512  mmcf  of  gas,  and  total  proved  and
probable reserves assigned to the Dunvegan are 725 mmcf of gas.  All of the proved reserves are
in the proved producing category.  The Dunvegan sand development in the Rolla area is part of a
large Delta complex from the northwest.
Hines Creek
The Hines Creek property is located 150 km north of the city of Grande Prairie, Alberta.  Enterra’s
assets include a 50% working interest in 5,760 acres of land, one producing gas well and one
shut-in  gas  well  currently  awaiting  a  fracture  stimulation.    Enterra’s  share  of  current  gas
production is approximately 850 mcf/d from the 50% working interest well, and expects Enterra’s
share of production from the 50% working interest shut-in well to be in excess of 200 mcf/d.
Total  proved  reserves  assigned  to  the  Hines  Creek  property  are  728  mmcf  of  gas,  and  total
proved and probable reserves are 882 mmcf of gas.  All of the proved reserves are in the proved
producing category.
East Central Alberta
Sounding Lake
The  Sounding  Lake  package  is  located  10  km  southwest  of  the  town  of  Provost,  Alberta.
 Enterra’s assets include an average working interest of 58.7% in 5,496 gross acres of land as
well as 56 producing oil wells and 2 producing gas wells.  Production is obtained primarily from
the Dina, Cummings and Belly River formations.  The three main oil pools are Sounding Lake
West, Sounding Lake East, and Sounding Lake North.  Enterra’s share of current production for
the entire area is 520 bbl/d of oil and 1,700 mcf/d of gas.  Enterra has and continues to upgrade
pump sizes to maximize oil production and upgrade oil batteries to handle higher volumes of total
fluid  and  injection  water.    Enterra  has  also  tied-in  the  flared  solution  gas  from  two  of  its  key
facilities in the area.
Enterra was assigned proved reserves at Sounding Lake of 741 mbbl of oil and 1,451 mmcf of
natural gas.  Total proved and probable reserves are 926 mbbl oil and 1,870 mmcf natural gas
based on improved performance from the existing wells.
Central Alberta
Sylvan Lake
The Sylvan Lake property is located 40 km west of the town of Red Deer, Alberta.  Enterra’s
assets include an average working interest of 74.8% in 4,320 gross acres of land as well as 24
producing oil wells and 1 producing gas well.  Enterra completed the development of 40-acre
spacing wells in the Pekisko G pool, increasing the number of producing wells from five to 24
wells.  The property currently produces 1,225 bbl/d (gross), 1,100 bbl/day (net) of 14 degree API
oil from 24 wells with 850 mcf/d (net) of associated gas plus an additional 30 mcf/d (net) of non-
associated gas.  Production is flowlined into a central treating facility constructed in September
2003 which is owned and operated by Enterra Energy.  Non-associated gas is conserved and
flowlined to the Husky Sylvan Lake gas plant.  Clean oil is trucked from the facility to sales.
McDaniel and Associates has assigned total proved reserves of 1,814 mbbl of oil, 1,014 mmcf of
solution gas, and 32 mmcf of non-associated gas to this property.  Total proved and probable
reserves are 2,404 mbbl of oil, 1,344 mmcf of solution gas, and 40 mmcf of non-associated gas.
 Probable reserves were assigned based on an assumption that the wells will achieve a slightly
higher oil recovery than estimated.  Based on the success of the 2003 drilling program, Enterra
plans to drill seven wells with further downspacing in the centre of the pool as well as initiate a
waterflood feasibility study for the pool.  The reservoir has net pays up to 40 m (130 ft).  Enterra
owns a 3-D seismic program that covers the Sylvan Lake Pekisko G pool.
Kaybob
This  property  is  located  50  kilometers  north  of  Edson,  Alberta  and  is  pipeline  connected  to  a
major gas and oil processing facility in the area.  There is one well with a working interest of
100% on production in this property.  With the construction of a pipeline tie-in in September 2003
and the addition of a gas-lift system in November 2003, the well was returned to production.  The
well is producing 130 bbl/d light crude oil with 110 mcf/d of associated gas.
McDaniel and Associates have assigned total proved reserves of 391 mbbl of oil, 230 mmcf of
gas, and 8 mbbl of natural gas liquids to this property.  Total proved and probable reserves are
548 mbbl of oil, 323 mmcf of gas, and 11 mbbl of natural gas liquids.  Enterra acquired its interest
in the Kaybob South Nisku C Pool in the year 2000.  Enterra owns a 90% working interest in 320
acres of land, subject to a 7.5% NCORR on 100% of production.  Enterra has a licensed copy of
a 7 square mile 3-D program over the well and adjacent lands.

Additional Information Concerning Abandonment and Reclamation Costs
The  Trust  estimates  well  abandonment  costs  stereotypically  area  by  area.    Such  costs  are
included in the McDaniel Report as deductions in arriving at future net revenue.  The expected
total abandonment costs included in the McDaniel Report for 85.5 net wells under the proved
reserves category is $5.1 million undiscounted  ($1.5 million discounted at 10%), of which a total
of $60,400 is estimated to be incurred in 2004, 2005 and 2006.
Tax Horizon
The  Trust  was  not  required  to  pay  income  taxes  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2003.
 Based on a strategy of re-investing fully all internally generated cash flow in an exploration and
development  program  and  based  on  the  commodity  prices  used  in  the  McDaniel  Report,  the
Trust estimates that it will not be required to pay income taxes until after 2007.

Material Change to Reserve Information Since December 31, 2003
On  January  31,  2004,  the  Trust  acquired  several  properties  in  East  Central  Alberta  for  $20
million.    These  properties  currently  produce  approximately  1,800  boe/day,  consisting  of  1,600
bbl/day of oil and 1,200 mcf/day of gas, along with approximately  22,166 acres of undeveloped
land.    This  acquisition  added  approximately  2,078.2  mbbls  of  oil,  28.6  mbbls  of  NGL’s  and
1,622.0 mmcf of gas to our proved reserves and 800.5 mbbls of oil, 25.9 mbbls of NGL’s and
1,051.0  mmcf  of  gas  to  our  probable  reserves.    For  further  details  of  this  acquisition,  see
Appendix "A" hereto.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RESPECTING THE TRUST
Trust Units
An unlimited number of Trust Units may be created and issued pursuant to the Trust Indenture.
Each Trust Unit entitles the holder thereof to one vote at any meeting of the holders of Trust Units
and represents an equal fractional undivided beneficial interest in any distribution from the Trust
(whether of net income, net realized capital gains or other amounts) and in any net assets of the
Trust  in  the  event  of  termination  or  winding  up  of  the  Trust.  All  Trust  Units  rank  among
themselves equally and rateably without discrimination, preference or priority. Each Trust Unit is
transferable, is not subject to any conversion or pre-emptive rights and entitles the holder thereof
to require the Trust to redeem any or all of the Trust Units held by such holder (see "Redemption
Right").    In  addition,  in  certain  circumstances  Unitholders  will  have  the  right  to  instruct  the
trustees of EEC Trust with respect to the voting of common shares of Enterra held by EEC Trust
at  meetings  of  holders  of  common  shares  of  Enterra.  See  "Meetings  of  Unitholders"  and
"Exercise of Voting Rights".
The price per Trust Unit is a function of anticipated distributable income generated by the Trust
and the ability of the Trust to effect long term growth in the value of the Trust's assets. The market
price of the Trust Units is sensitive to a variety of market conditions including, but not limited to,
interest rates, commodity prices and our ability to acquire additional assets. Changes in market
conditions may adversely affect the trading price of the Trust Units.
The Trust Units do not represent a traditional investment and should not be viewed by investors
as "shares" in either Enterra or the Trust. As holders of Trust Units, Unitholders will not have the
statutory  rights  normally  associated  with  ownership  of  shares  of  a  corporation  including,  for
example, the right to bring "oppression" or "derivative" actions.
The  Trust  Units  are  not  "deposits"  within  the  meaning  of  the  Canada  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation  Act  (Canada)  and  are  not  insured  under  the  provisions  of  that  Act  or  any  other
legislation. Furthermore, the Trust is not a trust company and, accordingly, is not registered under
any trust and loan company legislation as it does not carry on or intend to carry on the business
of a trust company.
As  of  April  19,  2004,  there  were  21,156,489  Trust  Units  outstanding,  868,868  Trust  Units
reserved  for  issuance  on  the  exchange  of  Exchangeable  Shares  and  920,000  Trust  Units
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Trust Unit option plan of the Trust.
Income Streams
A portion of the cash flows generated by the assets held, directly or indirectly, by the Trust is
distributed to holders of Trust Units. The Trustee may, in respect of any period, declare payable
to the Unitholders all or any part of the net income of the Trust, less all expenses and liabilities of
the Trust due and accrued and which are chargeable to the net income of the Trust.  The Trust's
primary sources of cash flow are payments of interest and principal from Enterra and EEC Trust
in respect of the Series A Notes and the CT Note.
The Series A Notes
The  Series  A  Notes  were  created  and  issued  by  Enterra  to  the  Trust  pursuant  to  the
Arrangement.  The principal amount of the Series A Notes issued pursuant to the Arrangement
was $125,000,000.  The Series A Notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 14% per
annum, which is payable for each month during the term on the 15th day of the month following
such  month.    For  a  detailed  description  of  the  Series  A  Notes,  see  "Additional  Information
Respecting Enterra – Series A Notes".
The CT Note
The CT Note is a subordinated, demand participating promissory note.  The CT Note was issued
by  EEC  Trust  to  the  Trust  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  with  a  principal  amount  of
$117,742,660.90.    The  principal  amount  of  the  CT  Note  was  adjusted  to  $126,093,310.61  on
December 25, 2003, based upon the market price of the Trust Units at such date.  Redemptions
and returns of capital on shares of Enterra held by EEC Trust may be made from time to time and
applied as prepayments of the principal amount of the CT Note.  The CT Note will bear interest at
a rate that is re-set from time to time so as to approximate the return on the shares of Enterra held
by EEC Trust.
Distributions to Unitholders
The Trustee may declare payable to the Unitholders all or any part of the net income of the Trust,
less all expenses and liabilities of the Trust due and accrued and which are chargeable to the net
income of the Trust.  We currently anticipate that 80% of the cash flow generated by our oil and
gas  assets  will  be  distributed  to  our  Unitholders.    As  of  March,  2004,  the  monthly  distribution
payable to Unitholders has been set at US$0.11.  See "Distributions".  However, the availability
of cash flows for the payment of distributions will at all times be dependant upon a number of
factors, including resource prices, production rates and reserve growth, and we cannot assure
that cash flows will be available for distribution to Unitholders in the amounts anticipated or at all.
 See "Risk Factors".
Special Voting Rights
The Trust Indenture allows for the creation and issuance of an unlimited number of special voting
rights ("Special Voting Rights") which will enable the Trust to provide voting rights to holders of
Exchangeable Shares and, in the future, to holders of other exchangeable shares that may be
issued by Enterra or other subsidiaries of the Trust in connection with other exchangeable share
transactions.
Holders of Special Voting Rights are not entitled to any distributions of any nature whatsoever
from the Trust.  Each holder shall be entitled to attend at meetings of Unitholders and, subject to
the terms of the instrument creating the Special Voting Rights, is entitled to that number of votes
equal to the number of votes attached to the Trust Units for which the securities relating to such
Special Voting Rights held by such holder are exchangeable, exercisable or convertible. Holders
of  Special  Voting  Rights  are  also  entitled  to  receive  all  notices,  communications  or  other
documentation required to be given or otherwise sent to holders of Trust Units. Except for the
right  to  attend  and  vote  at  meetings  of  Unitholders  and  receive  notices,  communications  and
other  documentation  sent  to  Unitholders,  the  Special  Voting  Rights  do  not  confer  upon  the
holders thereof any other rights.
Under the terms of the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement, the Trust has issued one Special
Voting Right to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee for the benefit of every person
who received Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Arrangement.
Unitholder Limited Liability
The Trust Indenture provides that no Unitholder, in its capacity as such, shall incur or be subject
to any liability in contract or in tort in connection with the Trust or its obligations or affairs and, in
the event that a court determines that Unitholders are subject to any such liabilities, the liabilities
will be enforceable only against, and will be satisfied only out of the Trust's assets. Pursuant to
the Trust Indenture, the Trust will indemnify and hold harmless each Unitholder from any costs,
damages, liabilities, expenses, charges or losses suffered by a Unitholder from or arising as a
result of such Unitholder not having such limited liability.
The Trust Indenture provides that all contracts signed by or on behalf of the Trust must contain a
provision  to  the  effect  that  such  obligation  will  not  be  binding  upon  Unitholders  personally.
Notwithstanding the terms of the Trust Indenture, Unitholders may not be protected from liabilities
of the Trust to the same extent a shareholder is protected from the liabilities of a corporation.
Personal liability may also arise in respect of claims against the Trust (to the extent that claims
are not satisfied by the Trust) that do not arise under contracts, including claims in tort, claims for
taxes  and  possibly  certain  other  statutory  liabilities.  The  possibility  of  any  personal  liability  to
Unitholders of this nature arising is considered unlikely in view of the fact that the sole activity of
the  Trust  is  to  hold  securities,  and  all  of  the  business  operations  are  carried  on  by  Enterra,
directly or indirectly.
The  activities  of  the  Trust,  EEC  Trust,  Enterra  and  the  Partnership  are  conducted,  upon  the
advice of counsel, in such a way and in such jurisdictions as to avoid as far as possible any
material  risk  of  liability  to  the  Unitholders  for  claims  against  the  Trust  including  by  obtaining
appropriate insurance, where available, for the operations of Enterra and having contracts signed
by  or  on  behalf  of  the  Trust  include  a  provision  that  such  obligations  are  not  binding  upon
Unitholders personally.
Issuance of Trust Units
The  Trust  Indenture  provides  that  Trust  Units,  including  rights,  warrants  (including  so  called
"special warrants" which may be exercisable for no additional consideration) and other securities
to purchase, to convert into or to exchange into Trust Units, may be created, issued, sold and
delivered on such terms and conditions and at such times as the Enterra Board may determine,
including,  without  limitation,  installment  or  subscription  receipts.    The  Trust  Indenture  also
provides that Enterra may authorize the creation and issuance of debentures, notes and other
evidences  of  indebtedness  of  the  Trust  which  debentures,  notes  or  other  evidences  of
indebtedness may be created and issued from time to time on such terms and conditions to such
persons and for such consideration as Enterra may determine.
Redemption Right
Trust Units are redeemable at any time on demand by the holders thereof upon delivery to the
transfer  agent  of  the  Trust  of  the  certificate  or  certificates  representing  such  Trust  Units,
accompanied  by  a  duly  completed  and  properly  executed  notice  requiring  redemption.  Upon
receipt of the notice to redeem Trust Units by the transfer agent, the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to receive a price per Trust Unit (the "Market Redemption Price") equal to the lesser of: (i)
90% of the "market price" of the Trust Units on the principal market on which the Trust Units are
quoted for trading during the 10 trading day period commencing immediately after the date on
which the Trust Units are tendered to the Trust for redemption; and (ii) the closing market price on
the principal market on which the Trust Units are quoted for trading on the date that the Trust
Units are so tendered for redemption. Where more than one market exists for the Trust Units, the
principal market shall mean the market on which the Trust Units experience the greatest volume
of trading activity on the date or for the period in question, as applicable.
For the purposes of this calculation, "market price" is an amount equal to the simple average of
the closing price of the Trust Units for each of the trading days on which there was a closing
price; provided that, if the applicable exchange or market does not provide a closing price but
only  provides  the  highest  and  lowest  prices  of  the  Trust  Units  traded  on  a  particular  day,  the
market price shall be an amount equal to the simple average of the average of the highest and
lowest prices for each of the trading days on which there was a trade; and provided further that if
there was trading on the applicable exchange or market for fewer than five of the 10 trading days,
the market price shall be the simple average of the following prices established for each of the 10
trading days: the average of the last bid and last ask prices for each day on which there was no
trading; the closing price of the Trust Units for each day that there was trading if the exchange or
market provides a closing price; and the average of the highest and lowest prices of the Trust
Units  for  each  day  that  there  was  trading,  if  the  market  provides  only  the  highest  and  lowest
prices of Trust Units traded on a particular day. The closing market price is: an amount equal to
the  closing  price  of  the  Trust  Units  if  there  was  a  trade  on  the  date;  an  amount  equal  to  the
average of the highest and lowest prices of the Trust Units if there was trading and the exchange
or other market provides only the highest and lowest prices of Trust Units traded on a particular
day; and the average of the last bid and last ask prices if there was no trading on the date.
The  aggregate  Market  Redemption  Price  payable  by  the  Trust  in  respect  of  any  Trust  Units
surrendered  for  redemption  during  any  calendar  month  shall  be  satisfied  by  way  of  a  cash
payment on the last day of the following month. The entitlement of Unitholders to receive cash
upon the redemption of their Trust Units is subject to the limitation that the total amount payable
by the Trust in respect of such Trust Units and all other Trust Units tendered for redemption in the
same  calendar  month  and  in  any  preceding  calendar  month  during  the  same  year  shall  not
exceed  $100,000;  provided  that  Enterra  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  waive  such  limitation  in
respect of any calendar month. If this limitation is not so waived, the Market Redemption Price
payable by the Trust in respect of Trust Units tendered for redemption in such calendar month
shall be paid on the last day of the following month as follows: (i) firstly, by the Trust distributing
Series  A  Notes  having  an  aggregate  principal  amount  equal  to  the  aggregate  Market
Redemption Price of the Trust Units tendered for redemption, and (ii) secondly, to the extent that
the Trust does not hold Series A Notes having a sufficient principal amount outstanding to effect
such payment, by the Trust issuing its own promissory notes to the Unitholders who exercised
the right of redemption having an aggregate principal amount equal to any such shortfall (herein
referred to as "Redemption Notes"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the distribution of any Series
A Notes and the issuance of any Redemption Notes shall be conditional upon the receipt of all
necessary  regulatory  approvals  and  the  making  of  all  necessary  governmental  registrations,
declarations  and  filings,  including,  without  limitation,  any  required  registration  of  the  Series  A
Notes or Redemption Notes, as applicable, to be distributed or issued in respect of the payment
of the Market Redemption Price, and any required qualification of the Trust Indenture relating to
such Series A Notes or Redemption Notes, as the case may be, under the securities laws of the
United States.
If at the time Trust Units are tendered for redemption by a Unitholder, (i) the outstanding Trust
Units are not listed for trading on the TSX or Nasdaq and are not traded or quoted on any other
stock exchange or market which Enterra considers, in its sole discretion, provides representative
fair  market  value  price  for  the  Trust  Units,  or  (ii)  trading  of  the  outstanding  Trust  Units  is
suspended or halted on any stock exchange on which the Trust Units are listed for trading or, if
not so listed, on any market on which the Trust Units are quoted for trading, on the date such
Trust Units are tendered for redemption or for more than five trading days during the 10 trading
day  period,  commencing  immediately  after  the  date  such  Trust  Units  were  tendered  for
redemption then such Unitholder shall, instead of the Market Redemption Price, be entitled to
receive a price per Trust Unit (the "Appraised Redemption Price") equal to 90% of the fair market
value thereof as determined by Enterra as at the date on which such Trust Units were tendered
for redemption. The aggregate Appraised Redemption Price payable by the Trust in respect of
Trust Units tendered for redemption in any calendar month shall be paid on the last day of the
third  following  month  by,  at  the  option  of  the  Trust:  (i)  a  cash  payment;  or  (ii)  a  distribution  of
Series A Notes and/or Redemption Notes as described above.
It is anticipated that this redemption right will not be the primary mechanism for holders of Trust
Units  to  dispose  of  their  Trust  Units.  Series  A  Notes  or  Redemption  Notes  which  may  be
distributed  in  specie  to  Unitholders  in  connection  with  a  redemption  will  not  be  listed  on  any
stock exchange and no market is expected to develop in such Series A Notes or Redemption
Notes. Series A Notes or Redemption Notes may not be qualified investments for trusts governed
by  registered  retirement  savings  plans,  registered  retirement  income  funds,  deferred  profit
sharing plans and registered education savings plans.
Meetings of Unitholders
The Trust Indenture provides that meetings of Unitholders must be called and held for, among
other matters, the election or removal of the Trustee, the appointment or removal of the auditors of
the  Trust,  the  approval  of  amendments  to  the  Trust  Indenture  (except  as  described  under
"Amendments  to  the  Trust  Indenture"),  the  sale  of  the  property  of  the  Trust  as  an  entirety  or
substantially as an entirety, and the commencement of winding up the affairs of the Trust.
A meeting of Unitholders may be convened at any time and for any purpose by the Trustee and
must be convened, except in certain circumstances, if requisitioned in writing by (i) Enterra or (ii)
the holders of Trust Units and Special Voting Rights holding in aggregate not less than 5% of the
votes entitled to be voted at a meeting of Unitholders. A requisition must, among other things,
state in reasonable detail the business purpose for which the meeting is to be called.
Unitholders may attend and vote at all meetings of Unitholders either in person or by proxy and a
proxyholder need not be a Unitholder. Two persons present in person or represented by proxy
and representing in the aggregate at least 5% of the votes attaching to all outstanding Trust Units
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all such meetings. For the purposes of
determining such quorum, the holders of any issued Special Voting Rights who are present at the
meeting shall be regarded as representing outstanding Trust Units equivalent in number to the
votes attaching to such Special Voting Rights.
The  Trust  Indenture  contains  provisions  as  to  the  notice  required  and  other  procedures  with
respect to the calling and holding of meetings of Unitholders in accordance with the requirements
of applicable laws.
Voting of EEC Trust Units
There will be a meeting of the holders of EEC Trust Units immediately following each meeting of
Unitholders for the purpose of directing the Trustee as to the manner in which the Trustee shall
vote the EEC Trust Units held by the Trust in respect of those matters voted on at such meeting of
Unitholders. Any resolution passed by Unitholders pertaining to the manner in which EEC Trust
Units held by the Trust are to be voted by the Trustee in respect of a particular matter which is to
be put forth to the holders of EEC Trust Units for vote at a contemplated meeting (including by
written resolution) of holders of EEC Trust Units, shall be deemed to be a direction to the Trustee
in respect of the EEC Trust Units held by the Trust to, as applicable, either vote such EEC Trust
Units in favour of or in opposition to, or to vote or withhold from voting, in respect of such matter in
equal proportions to the votes cast by Unitholders in respect of the matter, and the Trustee is
obligated  to  vote,  in  respect  of  such  matter  if  put  forth  to  the  holders  of  EEC  Trust  Units  at  a
meeting of such holders, the EEC Trust Units held by the Trust in accordance with such direction.
Exercise of Voting Rights
The Trustee is prohibited from authorizing or approving:
(a)
any  sale,  lease  or  other  disposition  of,  or  any  interest  in,  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Trust, except in conjunction with an internal reorganization of
the direct or indirect assets of the Trust, as a result of which the Trust has substantially the same
interest, whether direct or indirect, in the assets as the interest, whether direct or indirect, that it
had prior to the reorganization;
(b)
any merger, amalgamation, arrangement, reorganization, recapitalization, business combination
or similar transaction involving the Trust and any other corporation, except in conjunction with an
internal reorganization as referred to in paragraph (a) above; or
(c)

except in conjunction with an internal reorganization as referred to in paragraph (a) above;
without the prior approval of the Unitholders by Special Resolution at a meeting of Unitholders
called for that purpose.
In addition, the Trustee is prohibited from authorizing EEC Trust to vote any shares of Enterra in
respect of:
(d)
any  sale,  lease  or  other  disposition  of,  or  any  interest  in,  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets
owned, directly or indirectly, by Enterra, the Trust or the Partnership, except in conjunction with
an internal reorganization of the direct or indirect assets of Enterra, EEC Trust or the Partnership,
as the case may be, as a result of which EEC Trust has substantially the same interest, whether
direct or indirect, in the assets as the interest, whether direct or indirect, that it had prior to the
reorganization;
(e)
any merger, amalgamation, arrangement, reorganization, recapitalization, business combination
or similar transaction involving Enterra, EEC Trust or the Partnership and any other corporation,
except in conjunction with an internal reorganization as referred to in paragraph (a) above;
(f)
the winding up, liquidation or dissolution of Enterra, EEC Trust or the Partnership prior to the end
of the term of EEC Trust, except in conjunction with an internal reorganization as referred to in
paragraph (a) above;
(g)
any  amendment  to  the  articles  of  Enterra  to  increase  or  decrease  the  minimum  or  maximum
number of directors;
(h)
any  material  amendments  to  the  articles  of  Enterra  to  change  the  authorized  share  capital  or
amend the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to any class of Enterra's shares
in a manner which may be prejudicial to EEC Trust; or
(i)
any  material  amendment  to  the  CT  Indenture  or  the  Partnership  Agreement  which  may  be
prejudicial to EEC Trust;
without the prior approval of the Unitholders by Special Resolution at a meeting of Unitholders
called for that purpose.
Finally, the Trustee is prohibited from authorizing EEC Trust to vote any shares of Enterra with
respect  to  any  matter  which  under  applicable  law  (including  policies  of  Canadian  securities
commissions) or applicable stock exchange rules would require the approval of the holders of
shares of Enterra by ordinary resolution or special resolution, without the prior approval of the
Unitholders by ordinary resolution or special resolution, as the case may be.
Trustee
Olympia Trust Company is the initial trustee of the Trust. The Trustee is responsible for, among
other  things,  accepting  subscriptions  for  Trust  Units  and  issuing  Trust  Units  pursuant  thereto,
maintaining the books and records of the Trust and providing timely reports to holders of Trust
Units. The Trust Indenture provides that the Trustee shall exercise its powers and carry out its
functions thereunder as Trustee honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of the Trust and
the Unitholders and, in connection therewith, shall exercise that degree of care, diligence and
skill that a reasonably prudent trustee would exercise in comparable circumstances.
The initial term of the Trustee's appointment is until the third annual meeting of Unitholders. The
Unitholders shall, at the third annual meeting of Unitholders, re-appoint, or appoint a successor to
the Trustee for an additional three year term, and thereafter, the Unitholders shall reappoint or
appoint a successor to the Trustee at the annual meeting of Unitholders three years following the
reappointment or appointment of the successor to the Trustee. The Trustee may also be removed
by Special Resolution of the Unitholders. Such resignation or removal becomes effective upon
the acceptance or appointment of a successor trustee.
Delegation of Authority, Administration and Trust Governance
The Enterra Board has generally been delegated the significant management decisions of the
Trust.  In  particular,  pursuant  to  the  Trust  Indenture,  the  Trustee  has  delegated  to  Enterra
responsibility for any and all matters relating to the following: (i) an offering of securities of the
Trust;  (ii)  ensuring  compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  including  in  relation  to  an  offering  of
securities  of  the  Trust;  (iii)  all  matters  relating  to  the  content  of  any  offering  documents,  the
accuracy  of  the  disclosure  contained  therein  and  the  certification  thereof;  (iv)  all  matters
concerning the terms of, and amendment from time to time of the material contracts of the Trust;
(v) all matters concerning any underwriting or agency agreement providing for the sale of Trust
Units or rights to Trust Units; (vi) all matters relating to the redemption of Trust Units; and (vii) all
matters  relating  to  the  voting  rights  on  any  instruments  held  by  the  Trust,  other  than  the  EEC
Trust Units.
In  addition,  pursuant  to  an  administration  agreement  dated  November  25,  2003  between  the
Trust  and  Enterra  (the  "Administration  Agreement"),  Enterra  has  been  appointed 
the
administrator  of  the  Trust  and  is  responsible  for  the  administration  and  management  of  all
general and administrative affairs of the Trust.  Enterra is not entitled to the payment of a fee for
the services provided to the Trust pursuant to the Administration Agreement.
Liability of The Trustee
The  Trustee,  its  directors,  officers,  employees,  shareholders  and  agents  are  not  liable  to  any
Unitholder  or  any  other  person,  in  tort,  contract  or  otherwise,  in  connection  with  any  matter
pertaining to the Trust or the property of the Trust, arising from the exercise by the Trustee of any
powers, authorities or discretion conferred under the Trust Indenture, including, without limitation,
any action taken or not taken in good faith in reliance on any documents that are, prima facie,
properly executed, any depreciation of, or loss to, the property of the Trust incurred by reason of
the  sale  of  any  asset,  any  inaccuracy  in  any  evaluation  provided  by  any  other  appropriately
qualified person, any reliance on any such evaluation, any action or failure to act of Enterra, or
any  other  person  to  whom  the  Trustee  has,  with  the  consent  of  Enterra,  delegated  any  of  its
duties hereunder, or any other action or failure to act (including failure to compel in any way any
former trustee to redress any breach of trust or any failure by Enterra to perform its duties under or
delegated to it under the Trust Indenture or any other contract), unless such liabilities arise out of
the  gross  negligence,  wilful  default  or  fraud  of  the  Trustee  or  any  of  its  directors,  officers,
employees or shareholders. If the Trustee has retained an appropriate expert, adviser or legal
counsel  with  respect  to  any  matter  connected  with  its  duties  under  the  Trust  Indenture,  the
Trustee may act or refuse to act based on the advice of such expert, adviser or legal counsel, and
the Trustee shall not be liable for and shall be fully protected from any loss or liability occasioned
by any action or refusal to act based on the advice of any such expert, adviser or legal counsel. In
the exercise of the powers, authorities or discretion conferred upon the Trustee under the Trust
Indenture, the Trustee is and shall be conclusively deemed to be acting as Trustee of the assets
of the Trust and shall not be subject to any personal liability for any debts, liabilities, obligations,
claims, demands, judgments, costs, charges or expenses against or with respect to the Trust or
the  property  of  the  Trust.  In  addition,  the  Trust  Indenture  contains  other  customary  provisions
limiting the liability of the Trustee.
Amendments to The Trust Indenture
The Trust Indenture may be amended or altered from time to time by Special Resolution of the
Unitholders. The Trustee may, without the approval of any of the Unitholders, amend the Trust
Indenture for the purpose of:
(a)
ensuring  the  Trust's  continuing  compliance  with  applicable  laws  or  requirements  of  any
governmental agency or authority;
(b)
ensuring that the Trust will satisfy the provisions of each of subsections 108(2) and 132(6) and
paragraph 132(8)(a) of the Tax Act as from time to time amended or replaced;
(c)
providing for and ensuring (i) the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit in
respect of the Trust for United States federal income tax purposes; (ii) the filing of income tax
returns  necessary  or  desirable  for  the  purposes  of  United  States  federal  income  tax;  or  (iii)
compliance by the Trust with any other applicable provisions of United States federal income tax
law;
(d)
ensuring that such additional protection is provided for the interests of Unitholders as the Trustee
may consider expedient;
(e)
removing or curing any conflicts or inconsistencies between the provisions of the Trust Indenture
or any supplemental indenture and any other agreement of the Trust or any offering document
pursuant to which securities of the Trust are issued with respect to the Trust, or any applicable
law or regulation of any jurisdiction, provided that in the opinion of the Trustee the rights of the
Trustee and of the Unitholders are not prejudiced thereby;
(f)
curing,  correcting  or  rectifying  any  ambiguities,  defective  or  inconsistent  provisions,  errors,
mistakes or omissions, provided that in the opinion of the Trustee the rights of the Trustee and of
the Unitholders are not prejudiced thereby; and
(g)
changing  the  situs  of  or  the  laws  governing  the  Trust  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Trustee,  is
desirable in order to provide Unitholders with the benefit of any legislation limiting their liability.
Takeover Bid
The Trust Indenture contains provisions to the effect that if a takeover bid is made for the Trust
Units and not less than 90% of the Trust Units (other than Trust Units held at the date of the
takeover bid by or on behalf of the offeror or associates or affiliates of the offeror) are taken up
and  paid  for  by  the  offeror,  the  offeror  will  be  entitled  to  acquire  the  Trust  Units  held  by
Unitholders who did not accept the take-over bid on the terms offered by the offeror.  In the event
of a take-over bid for Trust Units, any holder of a security exchangeable directly indirectly into
Trust Units may, unless prohibited by the terms and conditions of such exchangeable security,
convert,  exercise  or  exchange  such  exchangeable  security  for  the  purpose  of  tendering  Trust
Units  to  the  take-over  bid,  unless  an  identical  offer  is  made  by  the  offeror  to  purchase  such
exchangeable security.
Termination of the Trust
Unitholders  may  vote  to  terminate  the  Trust  at  any  meeting  of  Unitholders  duly  called  for  that
purpose,  subject  to  the  following:  (a)  a  vote  may  only  be  held  if  requested  in  writing  by  the
holders of not less than 20% of the outstanding Trust Units; (b) a quorum of 50% of the issued
and outstanding Trust Units must be present in person or by proxy; and (c) the termination must
be approved by Special Resolution of Unitholders.
Unless  the  Trust  is  earlier  terminated  or  extended  by  vote  of  the  Unitholders,  the  Trust  shall
continue in full force and effect for a period which shall end twenty-one years after the date of
death of the last surviving issue of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. In the event that the Trust is
wound  up,  the  Trustee  will  sell  and  convert  into  money  the  property  of  the  Trust  in  one
transaction or in a series of transactions at public or private sale and do all other acts appropriate
to liquidate the property of the Trust in accordance with any applicable laws or requirements of
any  governmental  agency  or  authority,  and  shall  in  all  respects  act  in  accordance  with  the
directions, if any, of the Unitholders in respect of termination authorized pursuant to the Special
Resolution  of  the  Unitholders  authorizing  the  termination  of  the  Trust.  After  paying,  retiring  or
discharging or making provision for the payment, retirement or discharge of all known liabilities
and obligations of the Trust and providing for indemnity against any other outstanding liabilities
and obligations, the Trustee shall distribute the remaining part of the proceeds of the sale of the
assets together with any cash forming part of the property of the Trust among the Unitholders in
accordance with their pro rata interests.
Reporting to Unitholders
The financial statements of the Trust are audited annually by an independent recognized firm of
chartered accountants. The audited financial statements of the Trust, together with the report of
such  chartered  accountants,  will  be  mailed  by  the  Trustee  to  Unitholders  and  the  unaudited
interim  financial  statements  of  the  Trust  will  be  mailed  to  Unitholders  within  the  periods
prescribed  by  securities  legislation.  The  year  end  of  the  Trust  is  December  31.  The  Trust  is
subject to the continuous disclosure obligations under all applicable securities legislation.

directors or officers of corporations which are in competition to the interests of Enterra and the
Trust.    No  assurances  can  be  given  that  opportunities  identified  by  such  board  members  or

Description of Share Capital
Enterra is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares, an unlimited number of
thirty  separate  classes  of  preferred  shares  and  an  unlimited  number  of  exchangeable  shares,
issuable  in  series,  of  which  an  unlimited  number  of  Series  A  Exchangeable  Shares  (the
"Exchangeable Shares") are authorized.  EEC Trust is the sole holder of all of  the issued and
outstanding common shares and preferred shares of Enterra.
Common Shares
Each  common  share  entitles  its  holder  to  receive  notice  of  and  to  attend  all  meetings  of  the
shareholders of Enterra and to one vote at such meetings.  The holders of common shares will
be,  at  the  discretion  of  the  Enterra  Board  and  subject  to  applicable  legal  restrictions  and  to
certain preferences of holders of Exchangeable Shares and preferred shares, entitled to receive
any  dividends  declared  by  the  Enterra  Board  on  the  common  shares  to  the  exclusion  of  the
holders of Exchangeable Shares, subject to the proviso that no dividends shall be paid on the
common shares unless all declared dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares and any
other shares having priority over the common shares with respect to the payment of dividends
have been paid in full.  The holders of common shares will be entitled to share equally in any
distribution of the assets of Enterra upon the liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or winding up of
Enterra or other distribution of its assets among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs.  Such participation is subject to the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching
to the Exchangeable Shares and any other shares having priority over the common shares.  As of
December 31, 2003, two common shares were issued and outstanding and held by EEC Trust.
Preferred Shares
Enterra has created and authorized for issuance thirty classes of preferred shares.  The preferred
shares can be redeemed at any time by Enterra or at the request of the holder.  Preferred shares
of each class will rank prior to the common shares and to the Exchangeable Shares with respect
to the payment of dividends, if any, that have been declared and the distribution of assets in the
event  of  the  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up  of  Enterra.    As  of  December  31,  2003,  an
aggregate of 116,968,687 preferred shares(Classes 1 through 30) were outstanding and held by
EEC Trust.
Exchangeable Shares
The following is a summary description of the material provisions of the Exchangeable Shares
and the related ancillary and indirect rights of holders of Exchangeable Shares under the terms of
the  Voting  and  Exchange  Trust  Agreement  and  the  Support  Agreement.    This  summary  is
qualified  in  its  entirety  by  reference  to  the  full  text  of  (i)  the  Exchangeable  Share  Provisions,
(ii) the Support Agreement, and (iii) the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.
Each Exchangeable Share has economic rights (including the right to have the Exchange Ratio
adjusted to account for Distributions paid to Unitholders) and voting attributes (through the benefit
of  the  Special  Voting  Right  granted  to  the  Voting  and  Exchange  Trust  Agreement  Trustee)
equivalent to those of the Trust Units into which they are exchangeable from time to time.  In
addition, holders of Exchangeable Shares have the right to receive Trust Units at any time in
exchange for their Exchangeable Shares, on the basis of the Exchange Ratio in effect at the time
of the exchange.  Fractional Trust Units will not be delivered on any exchange of Exchangeable
Shares.    In  the  event  that  the  Exchange  Ratio  in  effect  at  the  time  of  an  exchange  would
otherwise entitle a holder of Exchangeable Shares to a fractional Trust Unit, the number of Trust
Units to be delivered will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Trust Units.  Holders
of Exchangeable Shares do not receive cash Distributions from the Trust or Enterra.  Rather, the
Exchange Ratio is adjusted to account for Distributions paid to Unitholders.  As of December 31,
2003, 1,995,596 Exchangeable Shares were outstanding.
Ranking
The Exchangeable Shares rank rateably with shares of any other series of exchangeable shares
of  Enterra  and  prior  to  the  common  shares  and  any  other  shares  ranking  junior  to  the
Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends, if any, that have been declared
and the distribution of assets in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Enterra.
Dividends
Holders of Exchangeable Shares are entitled to receive cash dividends if, as and when declared
by the Enterra Board.  Enterra anticipates that it may from time to time declare dividends on the
Exchangeable  Shares  up  to  but  not  exceeding  any  cash  Distributions  on  the  Trust  Units  into
which such Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable.  In the event that any such dividends are
paid, the Exchange Ratio will be correspondingly reduced to reflect such dividends.
Certain Restrictions
Enterra will not, without obtaining the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as set
forth below under the subheading "Amendment and Approval":
(a)
pay any dividend on the common shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable
Shares, other than stock dividends payable in common shares or any other shares ranking junior
to the Exchangeable Shares;
(b)
redeem, purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of the common shares or any other
shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares;
(c)
redeem or purchase any other shares of Enterra ranking equally with the Exchangeable Shares
with respect to the payment of dividends or on any liquidation distribution; or
(d)
amend the articles or by laws of Enterra in any manner that would affect the rights or privileges of
the holders of Exchangeable Shares.
The  restrictions  in  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  above  shall  not  apply  if  all  declared  dividends  on  the
outstanding Exchangeable Shares shall have been paid in full.
Liquidation or Insolvency of Enterra
In  the  event  of  the  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up  of  Enterra  or  any  other  proposed
distribution  of  the  assets  of  Enterra  among  its  shareholders  for  the  purpose  of  winding  up  its
affairs, a holder of Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive from Enterra, in respect of
each such Exchangeable Share, that number of Trust Units equal to the Exchange Ratio as at
the effective date of such event.
Upon the occurrence of such an event, the Trust and Exchangeco will each have the overriding
right to purchase all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding (other
than Exchangeable Shares held by the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust) at a purchase price
per Exchangeable Share to be satisfied by the issuance or delivery, as the case may be, of that
number of Trust Units equal to the Exchange Ratio at such time and, upon the exercise of this
right,  the  holders  thereof  will  be  obligated  to  sell  such  Exchangeable  Shares  to  the  Trust  or
Exchangeco, as applicable.  This right may be exercised by either the Trust or Exchangeco.
Upon the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee
on behalf of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will have the right to require the Trust or
Exchangeco to purchase any or all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding and held by
such  holders  at  a  purchase  price  per  Exchangeable  Share  to  be  satisfied  by  the  issuance  or
delivery, as the case may be, of that number of Trust Units equal to the Exchange Ratio at such
time,  as  described  under  the  subheading  "Voting  and  Exchange  Trust  Agreement  -  Optional
Exchange Right".
Automatic Exchange Right on Liquidation of the Trust
The Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement provides that in the event of a Trust liquidation event,
as described below, the Trust or Exchangeco will be deemed to have purchased all outstanding
Exchangeable Shares and each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be deemed to have sold
their Exchangeable Shares immediately prior to such Trust liquidation event at a purchase price
per Exchangeable Share to be satisfied by the issuance or delivery, as the case may be, of that
number of Trust Units equal to the Exchange Ratio at such time.  "Trust liquidation event" means:
(a)
any  determination  by  the  Trust  to  institute  voluntary  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up
proceedings in respect of the Trust or to effect any other distribution of assets of the Trust among
the Unitholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs; or
(b)
the earlier of, the Trust’s receiving notice of and the Trust’s otherwise becoming aware of, any
threatened or instituted claim, suit, petition or other proceedings with respect to the involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust or to effect any other distribution of assets of the
Trust  among  the  Unitholders  for  the  purpose  of  winding  up  its  affairs  in  each  case  where  the
Trust  has  failed  to  contest  in  good  faith  such  proceeding  within  30  days  of  becoming  aware
thereof.
Retraction of Exchangeable Shares by Holders and Retraction Call Right
Subject to the Retraction Call Right of the Trust and Exchangeco described below, a holder of
Exchangeable Shares will be entitled at any time to require Enterra to redeem any or all of the
Exchangeable  Shares  held  by  such  holder  for  a  retraction  price  (the  "Retraction  Price")  per
Exchangeable  Share  equal  to  the  value  of  that  number  of  Trust  Units  equal  to  the  Exchange
Ratio as at the date of redemption (the "Retraction Date"), to be satisfied by the delivery of such
number  of  Trust  Units.    Fractional  Trust  Units  will  not  be  delivered.    Any  amount  payable  on
account of the Retraction Price that includes a fractional Trust Unit will be rounded down to the
nearest  whole  number  of  Trust  Units.    Holders  of  the  Exchangeable  Shares  may  request
redemption  by  presenting  to  Enterra  or  the  transfer  agent  for  the  Exchangeable  Shares  a
certificate or certificates representing the number of Exchangeable Shares the holder desires to
have redeemed, together with a duly executed retraction request and such other documents as
may be reasonably required to effect the redemption of the Exchangeable Shares.  Subject to
extension  as  described  below,  the  redemption  will  become  effective  on  the  Retraction  Date,
which will be seven business days after the date on which Enterra or the transfer agent receives
the retraction notice.  Unless otherwise requested by the holder and agreed to by Enterra, the
Retraction Date will not occur on such seventh business day if such day would occur between
any  Distribution  Record  Date  and  the  Distribution  Payment  Date  that  corresponds  to  such
Distribution Record Date.  In this case, the Retraction Date will instead occur on such Distribution
Payment Date.  The reason for this is to ensure that the Exchange Ratio used in connection with
such redemption is increased to account for the Distribution.
When a holder requests Enterra to redeem the Exchangeable Shares, the Trust and Exchangeco
will have an overriding right (the "Retraction Call Right") to purchase on the Retraction Date all
but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares that the holder has requested Enterra to redeem
at a purchase price per Exchangeable Share equal to the Retraction Price, to be satisfied by the
delivery of that number of Trust Units equal to the Exchange Ratio at such time.  At the time of a
Retraction  Request  by  a  holder  of  Exchangeable  Shares,  Enterra  will  immediately  notify  the
Trust and Exchangeco.  The Trust or Exchangeco must then advise Enterra within two business
days as to whether the Retraction Call Right will be exercised.  A holder may revoke his or her
Retraction  Request  at  any  time  prior  to  the  close  of  business  on  the  last  business  day
immediately preceding the Retraction Date, in which case the holder’s Exchangeable Shares will
neither be purchased by the Trust or Exchangeco nor be redeemed by Enterra.  If the holder does
not  revoke  his  or  her  Retraction  Request,  the  Exchangeable  Shares  that  the  holder  has
requested  Enterra  to  redeem  will  on  the  Retraction  Date  be  purchased  by  the  Trust  or
Exchangeco or redeemed by Enterra, as the case may be, in each case at a purchase price per
Exchangeable  Share  equal  to  the  Retraction  Price.    In  addition,  a  holder  of  Exchangeable
Shares may elect to instruct the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee to exercise the
optional exchange right (the "Optional Exchange Right") to require the Trust or Exchangeco to
acquire  such  holder’s  Exchangeable  Shares  in  circumstances  where  neither  the  Trust  nor
Exchangeco have exercised the Retraction Call Right.  See "Exchangeable Shares - Voting and
Exchange Trust Agreement - Optional Exchange Right".
The Retraction Call Right may be exercised by either the Trust or Exchangeco.  If, as a result of
solvency  provisions  of  applicable  law,  Enterra  is  not  permitted  to  redeem  all  Exchangeable
Shares tendered by a retracting holder, Enterra will redeem only those Exchangeable Shares
tendered by the holder as would not be contrary to such provisions of applicable law.  The holder
of any Exchangeable Shares not redeemed by Enterra will be deemed to have required the Trust
to  purchase  such  unretracted  Exchangeable  Shares  in  exchange  for  Trust  Units  on  the
Retraction  Date  pursuant  to  the  Optional  Exchange  Right.    See  "Voting  and  Exchange  Trust
Agreement - Optional Exchange Right".
Redemption of Exchangeable Shares
Subject to applicable law and the Redemption Call Right of the Trust and Exchangeco, Enterra:
(a)
will,  on  November  25,  2006  subject  to  extension  of  such  date  by  the  Enterra  Board  (the
"Automatic  Redemption  Date"),  redeem  all  but  not  less  than  all  of  the  then  outstanding
Exchangeable Shares for a redemption price per Exchangeable Share equal to the value of that
number of Trust Units equal to the Exchange Ratio as at that Redemption Date (as that term is
defined below) (the "Redemption Price"), to be satisfied by the delivery of such number of Trust
Units; and
(b)
may, at any time when the aggregate number of issued and outstanding Exchangeable Shares is
less than 1,000,000 (other than Exchangeable Shares held by the Trust and its subsidiaries and
as such shares may be adjusted from time to time) (the "De Minimus Redemption Date" and,
collectively with the Automatic Redemption Date, a "Redemption Date"), redeem all but not less
than  all  of  the  then  outstanding  Exchangeable  Shares  for  the  Redemption  Price  per
Exchangeable Share (unless contested in good faith by the Trust), to be satisfied by the delivery
of such number of Trust Units.
Enterra will, at least 45 days prior to any Redemption Date, provide the registered holders of the
Exchangeable  Shares  with  written  notice  of  the  prospective  redemption  of  the  Exchangeable
Shares by Enterra.
The Trust and Exchangeco will have the right (the "Redemption Call Right"), notwithstanding a
proposed  redemption  of  the  Exchangeable  Shares  by  Enterra  on  the  applicable  Redemption
Date, pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase on any Redemption Date all
but  not  less  than  all  of  the  Exchangeable  Shares  then  outstanding  (other  than  Exchangeable
Shares  held  by  the  Trust  or  its  subsidiaries)  in  exchange  for  the  Redemption  Price  per
Exchangeable Share and, upon the exercise of the Redemption Call Right, the holders of all of
the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares will be obliged to sell all such shares to the Trust or
Exchangeco, as applicable.  If either the Trust or Exchangeco exercises the Redemption Call
Right, then Enterra’s right to redeem the Exchangeable Shares on the applicable Redemption
Date  will  terminate.    The  Redemption  Call  Right  may  be  exercised  by  either  the  Trust  or
Exchangeco.
Voting Rights
Except as required by applicable law, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares are not entitled as
such to receive notice of or attend any meeting of the shareholders of Enterra or to vote at any
such meeting.  Holders of Exchangeable Shares will have the notice and voting rights respecting
meetings  of  the  Trust  that  are  provided  in  the  Voting  and  Exchange  Trust  Agreement.    See
"Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement - Voting Rights".
Amendment and Approval
The rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the Exchangeable Shares may be
changed only with the approval of the holders thereof.  Any such approval or any other approval
or consent to be given by the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be sufficiently given if
given  in  accordance  with  applicable  law  and  subject  to  a  minimum  requirement  that  such
approval or consent be evidenced by a resolution passed by not less than two thirds of the votes
cast thereon (other than shares beneficially owned by the Trust, or any of its subsidiaries and
other affiliates) at a meeting of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares duly called and held at
which  holders  of  at  least  10%  of  the  then  outstanding  Exchangeable  Shares  are  present  in
person or represented by proxy.  In the event that no such quorum is present at such meeting
within one half hour after the time appointed therefor, then the meeting will be adjourned to such
place and time (not less than ten days later) as may be determined at the original meeting and
the holders of Exchangeable Shares present in person or represented by proxy at the adjourned
meeting will constitute a quorum thereat and may transact the business for which the meeting
was originally called.  At the adjourned meeting, a resolution passed by the affirmative vote of not
less than two thirds of the votes cast thereon (other than shares beneficially owned by the Trust
or any of its subsidiaries and other affiliates) will constitute the approval or consent of the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares.
Actions  by  the  Trust  under  the  Support  Agreement  and  the  Voting  and  Exchange  Trust
Agreement
Under the Exchangeable Share Provisions, Enterra has agreed to take all such actions and do
all such things as are necessary or advisable to perform and comply with its obligations under,
and to ensure the performance and compliance by the Trust and Exchangeco with its obligations
under, the Support Agreement and the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.
Non Resident and Tax Exempt Holders
Exchangeable Shares will not be issued to persons who are Non-Residents or who are exempt
from tax under Part I of the Tax Act.
Voting And Exchange Trust Agreement
Voting Rights
In accordance with the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement, the Trust issued a Special Voting
Right  to  Olympia  Trust  Company,  the  Voting  and  Exchange  Trust  Agreement  Trustee,  for  the
benefit of the holders (other than the Trust and Exchangeco) of the Exchangeable Shares.  The
Special Voting Right carries a number of votes, exercisable at any meeting at which Unitholders
are  entitled  to  vote,  equal  to  the  number  of  Trust  Units  (rounded  down  to  the  nearest  whole
number) into which the outstanding Exchangeable Shares are then exchangeable multiplied by
the number of votes to which the holder of one Trust Unit is then entitled.  With respect to any
written consent sought from the Unitholders, each vote attached to the Special Voting Right is
exercisable in the same manner as set forth above.
Each holder of an Exchangeable Share on the record date for any meeting at which Unitholders
are entitled to vote will be entitled to instruct the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee
to  exercise  that  number  of  votes  attached  to  the  Special  Voting  Right  which  relate  to  the
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder.  The Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee
will  exercise  each  vote  attached  to  the  Special  Voting  Right  only  as  directed  by  the  relevant
holder and, in the absence of instructions from a holder as to voting, will not exercise such votes.
The Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee will send to the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares the notice of each meeting at which the Unitholders are entitled to vote, together with the
related meeting materials and a statement as to the manner in which the holder may instruct the
Voting  and  Exchange  Trust  Agreement  Trustee  to  exercise  the  votes  attaching  to  the  Special
Voting Right, at the same time as the Trust sends such notice and materials to the Unitholders.
 The Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee will also send to the holders copies of all
information statements, interim and annual financial statements, reports and other materials sent
by the Trust to the Unitholders at the same time as such materials are sent to the Unitholders.  To
the extent such materials are provided to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee by
the Trust, the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee will also send to the holders all
materials sent by third parties to Unitholders, including dissident proxy circulars and tender and
exchange offer circulars, as soon as possible after such materials are first sent to Unitholders.
All rights of a holder of Exchangeable Shares to exercise votes attached to the Special Voting
Right will cease upon the exchange of all such holder’s Exchangeable Shares for Trust Units.
  With  the  exception  of  administrative  changes  for  the  purpose  of  adding  covenants  for  the
protection of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, making necessary amendments or curing
ambiguities or clerical errors (in each case provided that the board of directors of Exchangeco
and Enterra are of the opinion that such amendments are not prejudicial to the interests of the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares), the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement may not be
amended without the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares.
Optional Exchange Right
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of:
(a)
an Insolvency Event; or
(b)
circumstances in which the Trust or Exchangeco may exercise a certain call rights held by them,
but elect not to exercise such call rights;
a  holder  of  Exchangeable  Shares  will  be  entitled  to  instruct  the  Voting  and  Exchange  Trust
Agreement  Trustee  to  exercise  the  Optional  Exchange  Right  with  respect  to  any  or  all  of  the
Exchangeable  Shares  held  by  such  holder,  thereby  requiring  the  Trust  or  Exchangeco  to
purchase such Exchangeable Shares from the holder.  Immediately upon the occurrence of (i) an
Insolvency  Event,  (ii)  any  event  which  will,  with  the  passage  of  time  or  the  giving  of  notice,
become an Insolvency Event, or (iii) the election by the Trust and Exchangeco not to exercise a
call  right  which  is  then  exercisable  by  the  Trust  and  Exchangeco,  Enterra,  the  Trust  or
Exchangeco will give notice thereof to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee.  As
soon as practicable thereafter, the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement Trustee will then notify
each  affected  holder  of  Exchangeable  Shares  (who  has  not  already  provided  instructions
respecting the exercise of the Optional Exchange Right) of such event or potential event and will
advise such holder of its rights with respect to the Optional Exchange Right.
The  purchase  price  payable  by  the  Trust  or  Exchangeco  for  each  Exchangeable  Share  to  be
purchased under the Optional Exchange Right will be satisfied by the issuance of that number of
Trust Units equal to the Exchange Ratio as at the day of closing of the purchase and sale of such
Exchangeable Share under the Optional Exchange Right (the "Exchange Price").
If,  as  a  result  of  solvency  provisions  of  applicable  law,  Enterra  is  unable  to  redeem  all  of  a
holder’s Exchangeable Shares which such holder is entitled to have redeemed in accordance
with  the  Exchangeable  Share  Provisions,  the  holder  will  be  deemed  to  have  exercised  the
Optional Exchange Right with respect to the unredeemed Exchangeable Shares and the Trust or
Exchangeco will be required to purchase such shares from the holder in the manner set forth
above.
Support Agreement
The Trust Support Obligation
Under the Support Agreement, the Trust agrees that:
(a)
the Trust will take all actions and do all things necessary to ensure that Enterra is able to pay to
the  holders  of  the  Exchangeable  Shares  the  Liquidation  Amount  in  the  event  of  a  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of Enterra, the Retraction Price in the event of the giving of a Retraction
Request  by  a  holder  of  Exchangeable  Shares,  or  the  Redemption  Price  in  the  event  of  a
redemption of Exchangeable Shares by Enterra; and
(b)
the  Trust  will  not  vote  or  otherwise  take  any  action  or  omit  to  take  any  action  causing  the
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Enterra.
The Support Agreement also provides that the Trust will not issue or distribute to the holders of
all or substantially all of the outstanding Trust Units:
(a)
additional Trust Units or securities convertible into Trust Units;
(b)
rights, options or warrants for the purchase of Trust Units; or
(c)
units or securities of the Trust other than Trust Units, evidences of indebtedness of the Trust or
other assets of the Trust;
unless the same or an equivalent distribution is made to holders of Exchangeable Shares, an
equivalent change is made to the Exchangeable Shares, such issuance or distribution is made in
connection  with  a  distribution  reinvestment  plan  instituted  for  holders  of  Trust  Units  or  a
Unitholder rights protection plan approved for holders of Trust Units by the Enterra Board or the
approval of holders of Exchangeable Shares has been obtained.
In addition, the Trust may not subdivide, reduce, consolidate, reclassify or otherwise change the
terms of the Trust Units unless an equivalent change is made to the Exchangeable Shares or the
approval of the holders of Exchangeable Shares has been obtained.
In the event of any proposed take-over bid, issuer bid or similar transaction affecting the Trust
Units, the Trust will use reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary or desirable to enable
holders of Exchangeable Shares to participate in such transaction to the same extent and on an
economically equivalent basis as the Unitholders.
With  the  exception  of  administrative  changes  for  the  purpose  of  adding  covenants  for  the
protection of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, making certain necessary amendments or
curing  ambiguities  or  clerical  errors  (in  each  case  provided  that  the  Enterra  Board  and  the
Trustee are of the opinion that such amendments are not prejudicial to the interests of the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares), the Support Agreement may not be amended without the approval
of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares.
Under the Support Agreement, the Trust will agree to not exercise any voting rights attached to
the Exchangeable Shares owned by it or any of its respective subsidiaries and other affiliates on
any matter considered at meetings of holders of Exchangeable Shares (including any approval
sought from such holders in respect of matters arising under the Support Agreement).
The Series A Notes
Terms and Issue of Series A Notes
The  principal  amount  of  the  Series  A  Notes  issued  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  was
$125,000,000. The Series A Notes are subordinated to senior indebtedness of Enterra and bear
interest from the date of issue at 14% per annum.  Interest is be payable for each month during
the term on the 15th day of the month following such month.
The maturity date for the Series A Notes ("Maturity Date") November 24, 2024 or such later date
as  may  be  determined  by  the  Enterra  Board,  provided  that  the  Maturity  Date  will  not  extend
beyond November 25, 2033.  Pursuant to the terms of the Note Indenture, Enterra is not required
to make any payment in respect of principal until the Maturity Date and is not permitted to make
payments against the principal amount of the Series A Notes outstanding at any time prior to the
period beginning 180 days prior to the Maturity Date.  In the period commencing 180 days prior to
the Maturity Date and ending on the Maturity Date, Enterra will be entitled to redeem, in whole
but not in part, the Series A Notes, provided that no Series A Notes may be redeemed while any
senior indebtedness of Enterra is outstanding.
Principal and interest on the Series A Notes (and any additional notes issued pursuant to the
Note Indenture) is payable in lawful money of Canada directly to each holder of a Series A Note.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Note Indenture, and subject to certain restrictions set forth therein,
Enterra is entitled to defer the payment of interest on the principal amount of the Series A Notes
for  periods  (each  a  "Deferral  Period")  not  exceeding  27  consecutive  months.    In  certain
circumstances, Enterra has the ability to make payments in respect of interest and/or principal on
the Series A Notes by the issuance of common shares of Enterra (the "Share Payment Election").
Ranking
The Series A Notes are unsecured debt obligations of Enterra and are subordinated to all senior
indebtedness of Enterra.
Events of Default
The Note Indenture provides that any one or more of the following described events which has
occurred and is continuing constitutes an event of default with respect to the Series A Notes:
(a)
failure for 30 days to pay interest on the Series A Notes in cash or pursuant to the Share Payment
Election when due and which failure continues beyond the end of the Deferral Period, if any, in
respect thereof, as last extended;
(b)
failure to pay principal on the Series A Notes in cash or pursuant to the Share Payment Election
when due whether at maturity, upon redemption, by acceleration on default or otherwise;
(c)
acceleration  of  any  senior  indebtedness  of  Enterra  or  any  indebtedness  of  any  material
subsidiary of Enterra exceeding $25 million;
(d)
failure to observe or perform any other covenant contained in the Note Indenture for 60 days after
written notice thereof to Enterra from the Note Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of the outstanding Series A Notes;
(e)
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Enterra, or of a material subsidiary
of Enterra, under a bankruptcy or insolvency law; or
(f)
Enterra or any of its material subsidiaries ceasing to carry on, in the ordinary course, its business
or a material part thereof.
INDUSTRY CONDITIONS
The  oil  and  natural  gas  industry  is  subject  to  extensive  controls  and  regulations  imposed  by
various  levels  of  government.    It  is  not  expected  that  any  of  these  controls  or  regulations  will
affect  our  operations  in  a  manner  materially  different  than  they  would  affect  other  oil  and  gas
companies and trusts of similar size.  All current legislation is a matter of public record, and we
are unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be enacted.
Pricing and Marketing – Natural Gas
In Canada, the price of natural gas sold intraprovincially or to the United States is determined by
negotiation  between  buyers  and  sellers.    Natural  gas  exported  from  Canada  is  subject  to
regulation by the National Energy Board ("NEB") and the government of Canada.  Exporters are
free  to  negotiate  prices  and  other  terms  with  purchasers,  provided  that  the  export  contracts
continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the NEB and the government of Canada.  Natural
gas exports for a term of less than two years requires a general short term export license while
terms greater than two years require a specific license for the particular gas sold (in quantities of
not more than 30,000 cubic metres/d).  Any natural gas export to be made pursuant to a contract
of longer duration (to a maximum of 25 years) or a larger quantity requires an exporter to obtain
an  export  licence  from  the  NEB  and  the  issue  of  such  a  licence  requires  the  approval  of  the
Governor in Council.
The governments of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the volume of
natural gas, which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on
such factors as reserve availability, transportation arrangements and market considerations.
Pricing and Marketing – Oil
In Canada, producers of oil negotiate sales contracts directly with oil purchasers.  Oil prices are
primarily based on worldwide supply and demand.  The specific price paid depends in part on oil
quality,  prices  of  competing  fuels,  distance  to  market,  the  value  of  refined  products  and  the
supply/demand balance.  Oil exports may be made pursuant to export contracts with terms not
exceeding one year in the case of light crude oil, and not exceeding two years in the case of
heavy crude oil, provided that an order approving any such export has been obtained from the
NEB.  Any oil export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration (to a maximum of 25
years) requires an exporter to obtain an export licence from the NEB and the issue of such a
licence requires the approval of the Governor in Council.
The North American Free Trade Agreement
On  January  1,  1994,  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  ("NAFTA")  among  the
governments  of  Canada,  the  U.S.  and  Mexico  became  effective.    The  NAFTA  carries  forward
most of the material energy terms contained in the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.  In the
context of energy resources, Canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to
the  U.S.  or  Mexico  will  be  allowed  provided  that  any  export  restrictions  do  not:  (i)  reduce  the
proportion  of  energy  resource  exported  relative  to  domestic  use  (based  upon  the  proportion
prevailing  in  the  most  recent  36-month  period),  (ii)  impose  an  export  price  higher  than  the
domestic price; and (iii) disrupt normal channels of supply.  All three countries are prohibited from
imposing minimum export or import price requirements.
The  NAFTA  contemplates  the  reduction  of  Mexican  restrictive  trade  practices  in  the  energy
sector  and  prohibits  discriminatory  border  restrictions  and  export  taxes.    The  agreement  also
contemplates  clearer  disciplines  on  regulators  to  ensure  fair  implementation  of  any  regulatory
changes,  and  to  minimize  disruption  of  contractual  arrangements,  which  is  important  for
Canadian natural gas exports.
Royalties and Incentives
In  addition  to  federal  regulation,  each  province  has  legislation  and  regulations,  which  govern
land  tenure,  royalties,  production  rates,  environmental  protection  and  other  matters.    In  all
Canadian  jurisdictions,  producers  of  oil  and  natural  gas  are  required  to  pay  annual  rental
payments in respect of Crown leases and royalties and freehold production taxes in respect of oil
and natural gas produced from Crown and freehold lands, respectively.  The royalty regime is a
significant  factor  in  the  profitability  of  oil  and  natural  gas  production.    Royalties  payable  on
production  from  lands  other  than  Crown  lands  are  determined  by  negotiations  between  the
mineral owner and the lessee.  Crown royalties are determined by governmental regulation and
are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production, and the rate of
royalties  payable  generally  depends  in  part  on  prescribed  reference  prices,  well  productivity,
geographical  location,  field  discovery  date  and  the  type  or  quality  of  the  petroleum  product
produced.
From  time  to  time  the  governments  of  Canada,  Alberta,  British  Columbia  and  Saskatchewan
have  established  incentive  programs  which  have  included  royalty-rate  reductions,  royalty
holidays  and  tax  credits  for  the  purpose  of  encouraging  oil  and  natural  gas  exploration  or
enhanced recovery projects.  These programs reduce the amount of Crown royalties otherwise
payable.
Environmental Regulation
The  oil  and  natural  gas  industry  is  subject  to  environmental  regulation  pursuant  to  local,
provincial  and  federal  legislation.    Environmental  legislation  provides  for  restrictions  and
prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with certain
oil and natural gas industry operations, and can affect the location of wells and facilities and the
extent to which exploration and development is permitted.  In addition, legislation requires that
well and facilities sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities.
 A breach of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or issuance of clean-up orders.
We are committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates,
and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result
of  the  increasingly  stringent  laws  relating  to  the  protection  of  the  environment.    Our  internal
procedures  are  designed  to  ensure  that  the  environmental  aspects  of  new  developments  are
taken  into  account  prior  to  proceeding.    We  believes  that  we  is  in  material  compliance  with
applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Kyoto Protocol
In December of 2002, Canada became a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol.  The implementation of
this plan has not been fully defined by the federal government.  Until an implementation plan is
developed it is impossible to assess the impact on specific industries and individual businesses
within an industry.  It is generally believed that the oil and gas industry, as a major producer of
carbon dioxide (as a necessary by-product and emission of hydrocarbon production), will bear a
disproportionately large share of the anticipated cost of implementation.
RISK FACTORS
Set  out  below  are  certain  risk  factors  that  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  cash  flow,
operating  results,  financial  condition  or  the  business  of  our  operating  subsidiaries.  Investors
should  carefully  consider  these  risk  factors  before  making  investment  decisions  involving  our
Trust Units.
Our results of operations and financial condition are dependent on the prices received for
our oil and natural gas production.
Oil  and  natural  gas  prices  have  fluctuated  widely  during  recent  years  and  are  subject  to
fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply, demand, market uncertainty and
other factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, worldwide
political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand,
government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall
economic  environment.  Any  decline  in  crude  oil  or  natural  gas  prices  may  have  a  material
adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, borrowing ability, reserves and the level of
expenditures for the development of oil and natural gas reserves. Any resulting decline in our
cash flow could reduce distributions.
We use financial derivative instruments and other hedging mechanisms to try to limit a portion of
the adverse effects resulting from changes in natural gas and oil commodity prices. To the extent
we hedge our commodity price exposure, we forego the benefits we would otherwise experience
if commodity prices were to increase. In addition, our commodity hedging activities could expose
us to losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including where the other
party  to  a  hedge  does  not  perform  its  obligations  under  the  hedge  agreement,  the  hedge  is
imperfect  or  our  hedging  policies  and  procedures  are  not  followed.  Furthermore,  we  cannot
guarantee  that  such  hedging  transactions  will  fully  offset  the  risks  of  changes  in  commodities
prices.
In addition, we regularly assess the carrying value of our assets in accordance with Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles under the full cost method. If oil and natural gas prices
become depressed or decline, the carrying value of our assets could be subject to downward
revision.
An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and, therefore, could
reduce distributions to Unitholders as well as affect the market price of the Trust Units.
Higher operating costs for our underlying properties will directly decrease the amount of cash
flow received by the Trust and, therefore, may reduce distributions to our Unitholders. Electricity,
chemicals, supplies, reclamation and abandonment and labour costs are a few of the operating
costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation.
The level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated
due to unforeseen circumstances, many of which are beyond our control. A significant decline in
our  production  could  result  in  materially  lower  revenues  and  cash  flow  and,  therefore,  could
reduce the amount available for distributions to Unitholders.
Distributions may be reduced during periods in which we make capital expenditures or
debt repayments using cash flow, which could also affect the market price of our Trust
Units.
To  the  extent  that  we  use  cash  flow  to  finance  acquisitions,  development  costs  and  other
significant expenditures, the net cash flow that the Trust receives that is available for distribution
to Unitholders will be reduced. Hence, the timing and amount of capital expenditures may affect
the amount of net cash flow received by the Trust and, as a consequence, the amount of cash
available  to  distribute  to  Unitholders.  Therefore,  distributions  may  be  reduced,  or  even
eliminated, at times when significant capital or other expenditures are made.
The board of directors of Enterra has the discretion to determine the extent to which cash flow
from Enterra will be allocated to the payment of debt service charges as well as the repayment of
outstanding debt, including under the credit facility. Funds used for such purposes will not be
payable to the Trust. As a consequence, the amount of funds retained by Enterra to pay debt
service  charges  or  reduce  debt  will  reduce  the  amount  of  cash  available  for  distribution  to
Unitholders during those periods in which funds are so retained.
A decline in our ability to market our oil and natural gas production could have a material
adverse effect on production levels or on the price that we received for our production
which, in turn, could reduce distributions to Unitholders as well as affect the market price
of our Trust Units.
Our  business  depends  in  part  upon  the  availability,  proximity  and  capacity  of  gas  gathering
systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United
States federal and state, regulation of oil and gas production, processing and transportation, tax
and  energy  policies,  general  economic  conditions,  and  changes  in  supply  and  demand  could
adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change
and  inhibit  the  marketing  of  our  production,  overall  production  or  realized  prices  may  decline,
which could reduce distributions to our Unitholders.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our business, and
could affect the market price of our Trust Units as well as distributions to Unitholders.
The price that we receive for a majority of our oil and natural gas is based on United States dollar
denominated benchmarks, and therefore the price that we receive in Canadian dollars is affected
by  the  exchange  rate  between  the  two  currencies.  A  material  increase  in  the  value  of  the
Canadian  dollar  relative  to  the  United  States  dollar  may  negatively  impact  net  production
revenue by decreasing the Canadian dollars received for a given United States dollar price. We
could be subject to unfavourable price changes to the extent that we have engaged, or in the
future engage, in risk management activities related to foreign exchange rates, through entry into
forward foreign exchange contracts or otherwise.
If  we  are  unable  to  acquire  additional  reserves,  the  value  of  our  Trust  Units  and
distributions to Unitholders may decline.
We do not actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves. Instead, we add to our oil and natural
gas reserves primarily through development, exploitation and acquisitions. As a result, future oil
and natural gas reserves are highly dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties
and  acquiring  additional  reserves.  We  also  distribute  the  majority  of  our  net  cash  flow  to
Unitholders  rather  than  reinvesting  it  in  reserve  additions.  Accordingly,  if  external  sources  of
capital,  including  the  issuance  of  additional  Trust  Units,  become  limited  or  unavailable  on
commercially reasonable terms, our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain
or expand our oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired. To the extent that we are required to
use  cash  flow  to  finance  capital  expenditures  or  property  acquisitions,  the  level  of  cash  flow
available for distribution to Unitholders will be reduced. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that
we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms
that meet our investment objectives. Without these reserve additions, our reserves will deplete
and as a consequence, either production from, or the average reserve life of, our properties will
decline. Either decline may result in a reduction in the value of our Trust Units and in a reduction
in cash available for distributions to Unitholders.
Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates, and those variations could be material,
and affect the market price of our Trust Units and distributions to Unitholders.
The reserve and recovery information contained in the independent engineering report prepared
by McDaniel relating to our reserves is only an estimate and the actual production and ultimate
reserves from our properties may be greater or less than the estimates prepared by McDaniel.
The value of our Trust Units depends upon, among other things, the reserves attributable to our
properties. Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to
our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The reserve figures
contained  herein  are  only  estimates.  A  number  of  factors  are  considered  and  a  number  of
assumptions  are  made  when  estimating  reserves.  These  factors  and  assumptions  include,
among others:
·
historical production in the area compared with production rates from similar producing areas;
·
future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;
·
initial production rates;
·
production decline rates;
·
ultimate recovery of reserves;
·
success of future development activities;
·
marketability of production;
·
effects of government regulation; and
·
other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves.
Reserve estimates are based on the relevant factors, assumptions and prices on the date the
relevant evaluations were prepared. Many of these factors are subject to change and are beyond
our control. If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may
vary materially from reserve estimates.
If we expand our operations beyond oil and natural gas production in western Canada, we
may face new challenges and risks.
If we were unsuccessful in managing these challenges and risks, our results of operations and
financial condition could be adversely affected, which could affect the market price of our Trust
Units and distributions to Unitholders.
Our operations and expertise are currently focused on conventional oil and gas production and
development in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. In the future, we may acquire oil and
gas properties outside this geographic area. In addition, the Trust Indenture does not limit the
activities to oil and gas production and development, and we could acquire other energy related
assets, such as oil and natural gas processing plants or pipelines. Expansion of our activities into
new areas may present challenges and risks that we have not faced in the past. If we do not
manage these challenges and risks successfully, our results of operations and financial condition
could be adversely affected.
In determining the purchase price of acquisitions, we rely on both internal and external
assessments relating to estimates of reserves that may prove to be materially inaccurate.
Such reliance could adversely affect the market price of our Trust Units and distributions
to Unitholders.
The  price  we  are  willing  to  pay  for  reserve  acquisitions  is  based  largely  on  estimates  of  the
reserves  to  be  acquired.  Actual  reserves  could  vary  materially  from  these  estimates.
Consequently,  the  reserves  we  acquire  may  be  less  than  expected,  which  could  adversely
impact cash flows and distributions to Unitholders.  An initial assessment of an acquisition may
be based on a report by engineers or firms of engineers that have different evaluation methods
and  approaches  than  those  of  our  engineers,  and  these  initial  assessments  may  differ
significantly from our subsequent assessments.
Some of our properties are not operated by us and, therefore, results of operations may be
adversely  affected  by  the  failure  of  third-party  operators,  which  could  affect  the  market
price of our Trust Units and distributions to Unitholders.
The continuing production from a property, and to some extent the marketing of that production, is
dependent  upon  the  ability  of  the  operators  of  those  properties.  At  December  31,  2003,
approximately 3% of our daily production was from properties operated by third parties. To the
extent  a  third-party  operator  fails  to  perform  its  functions  efficiently  or  becomes  insolvent,  our
revenue  may  be  reduced.  Third  party  operators  also  make  estimates  of  future  capital
expenditures more difficult.
Further,  the  operating  agreements  which  govern  the  properties  not  operated  by  us  typically
require the operator to conduct operations in a good and "workmanlike" manner. These operating
agreements  generally  provide,  however,  that  the  operator  has  no  liability  to  the  other  non-
operating  working  interest  owners,  such  as  Unitholders,  for  losses  sustained  or  liabilities
incurred, except for liabilities that may result from gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
Delays in business operations could adversely affect distributions to Unitholders and the
market price of our Trust Units.
In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of
our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between
any of these parties may also be delayed by:
·
restrictions imposed by lenders;
·
accounting delays;
·
delays in the sale or delivery of products;
·
delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;
·
blowouts or other accidents;
·
adjustments for prior periods;
·
recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; or
·
the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses.
Any of these delays could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to Unitholders in a
given period and expose us to additional third party credit risks.
We may, from time to time, finance a significant portion of our operations through debt.
Our  indebtedness  may  limit  the  timing  or  amount  of  the  distributions  that  are  paid  to
Unitholders, and could affect the market price of our Trust Units.
The  payments  of  interest  and  principal,  and  other  costs,  expenses  and  disbursements  to  our
lenders reduces amounts available for distribution to Unitholders. Variations in interest rates and
scheduled principal repayments could result in significant changes to the amount of the cash flow
required  to  be  applied  to  the  debt  before  payment  of  any  amounts  to  the  Unitholders.  The
agreements governing our credit facility provide that if we are in default under the credit facility,
exceed certain borrowing thresholds or fail to comply with certain covenants, we must repay the
indebtedness at an accelerated rate, and the ability to make distributions to Unitholders may be
restricted.
Our lenders have been provided with a security interest in substantially all of our assets. If we are
unable  to  pay  the  debt  service  charges  or  otherwise  commit  an  event  of  default,  such  as
bankruptcy,  our  lenders  may  foreclose  on  and  sell  the  properties.  The  proceeds  of  any  sale
would be applied to satisfy amounts owed to the creditors. Only after the proceeds of that sale
were  applied  towards  the  debt  would  the  remainder,  if  any,  be  available  for  distribution  to
Unitholders.
Our  current  credit  facility  and  any  replacement  credit  facility  may  not  provide  sufficient
liquidity.
The amounts available under our existing credit facility may not be sufficient for future operations,
or we may not be able to obtain additional financing on economic terms attractive to us, if at all.
Our  current  credit  facility  consists  of  a  revolving  operating  demand  loan.  Repayment  of  all
outstanding  amounts  may  be  demanded  at  any  time.  If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  obtain
alternate  financing.  Any  failure  to  obtain  suitable  replacement  financing  may  have  a  material
adverse effect on our business, and distributions to Unitholders may be materially reduced.
We  have  a  working  capital  deficiency  at  December  31,  2003;  our  credit  facilities  can  be
called  at  any  time.  Any  material  change  in  our  liquidity  could  impair  our  ability  to  pay
dividends and could adversely affect the value of your investment.
Our credit facilities are classified as a short-term liability on our balance sheet as they are on a
demand  basis  and  may  be  called  at  any  time.  Accordingly,  at  December  31,  2003,  we  had  a
working  capital  deficiency  of  $38.2  million,  which  means  our  current  liabilities  exceeded  our
current assets by that amount. Although we are not subject to and do not expect to make principal
repayments under our current banking arrangement, they could be called for repayment at any
time. Other than in the event of a default or a breach of covenants, we do not expect to make any
principal payments in 2004.
Our  assets  are  highly  leveraged.  Any  material  change  in  our  liquidity  could  impair  our
ability to pay dividends and could adversely affect the value of your investment.
We carry a high amount of debt relative to our assets. A decrease in the amount of our production
or the price we receive for it could make it difficult for us to service our debt or may cause the
bank that issued our loan to determine that our assets are insufficient security for our bank debt.
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.
We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access
to  drilling  rigs,  service  rigs  and  other  equipment,  access  to  processing  facilities,  pipeline  and
refining capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations,
many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these
organizations not only explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on
refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these
complementary  activities,  some  of  our  competitors  may  have  greater  and  more  diverse
competitive resources to draw on than we do. Given the highly competitive nature of the oil and
natural  gas  industry,  this  could  adversely  affect  the  market  price  of  our  Trust  Units  and
distributions to Unitholders.
The  industry  in  which  we  operate  exposes  us  to  potential  liabilities  that  may  not  be
covered by insurance.
Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil
and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production
and  transportation  of  oil  and  natural  gas.  These  risks  include  encountering  unexpected
formations  or  pressures,  premature  declines  of  reservoirs,  blow-outs,  equipment  failures  and
other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids,
adverse  weather  conditions,  pollution,  other  environmental  risks,  fires  and  spills.  A  number  of
these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our
property or the property of others. We cannot fully protect against all of these risks, nor are all of
these  risks  insurable.  We  may  become  liable  for  damages  arising  from  these  events  against
which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of high premium
costs or other reasons. Any costs incurred to repair these damages or pay these liabilities would
reduce funds available for distribution to Unitholders.
The operation of oil and natural gas wells could subject us to environmental claims and
liability.
The  oil  and  natural  gas  industry  is  subject  to  extensive  environmental  regulation  pursuant  to
local, provincial and federal legislation. A breach of that legislation may result in the imposition of
fines or the issuance of "clean up" orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry
may  be  changed  to  impose  higher  standards  and  potentially  more  costly  obligations.  For
example,  the  1997  Kyoto  Protocol  to  the  United  Nation's  Framework  Convention  on  Climate
Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol, was ratified by the Canadian government in December,
2002  and  will  require,  among  other  things,  significant  reductions  in  greenhouse  gases.  The
impact  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  on  us  is  uncertain  and  may  result  in  significant  additional  costs
(future) for our operations. Although we record a provision in our financial statements relating to
our  estimated  future  environmental  and  reclamation  obligations,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  we
will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations.
We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not
available  or  because  of  high  premium  costs.  In  particular,  insurance  against  risks  from
environmental pollution occurring over time (as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages) is
not available on economically reasonable terms.
Accordingly,  our  properties  may  be  subject  to  liability  due  to  hazards  that  cannot  be  insured
against,  or  that  have  not  been  insured  against  due  to  prohibitive  premium  costs  or  for  other
reasons. Any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of
business  in  a  specific  period  will  be  funded  out  of  cash  flow  and,  therefore,  will  reduce  the
amounts available for distribution to Unitholders. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of
remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into
interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy.
Lower crude oil and natural gas prices increase the risk of ceiling limitation write-downs.
Any write-downs could materially affect the value of your investment.
We  changed  our  method  of  accounting  for  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  from  the
"successful efforts" method to the "full cost" method in 2001. All costs related to the exploration
for  and  the  development  of  oil  and  gas  reserves  are  capitalized  into  a  single  cost  centre
representing  Enterra’s  activity  which  is  undertaken  exclusively  in  Canada.  Costs  capitalized
include  land  acquisition  costs,  geological  and  geophysical  expenditures,  lease  rentals  on
undeveloped properties and costs of drilling productive and non-productive wells. Proceeds from
the disposal of properties are applied as a reduction of cost without recognition of a gain or loss
except where such disposals would result in a major change in the depletion rate.
Capitalized costs are depleted and depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on the
estimated  gross  proven  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  before  royalties  as  determined  by
independent  engineers.  Units  of  natural  gas  are  converted  into  barrels  of  equivalents  on  a
relative energy content basis. Capitalized costs, net of accumulated depletion and depreciation,
are  limited  to  estimated  future  net  revenues  from  proven  reserves,  based  on  year-end  prices,
undiscounted,  less  estimated  future  abandonment  and  site  restoration  costs,  general  and
administrative expenses, financing costs and income taxes. Estimated future abandonment and
site  restoration  costs  are  provided  for  over  the  life  of  proven  reserves  on  a  unit-of-production
basis.  The  annual  charge  is  included  in  depletion  and  depreciation  expense  and  actual
abandonment and site restoration costs are charged to the provision as incurred. The amounts
recorded  for  depletion  and  depreciation  and  the  provision  for  future  abandonment  and  site
restoration costs are based on estimates of proven reserves and future costs. The recoverable
value of capital assets is based on a number of factors including the estimated proven reserves
and future costs. By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the
impact on financial statements of future periods could be material.
We perform a cost recovery ceiling test which limits net capitalized costs to the undiscounted
estimated  future  net  revenue  from  proven  oil  and  gas  reserves  plus  the  cost  of  unproven
properties less impairment, using year-end prices or average prices in that year, if appropriate. In
addition, the value is further limited by including financing costs, administration expenses, future
abandonment and site restoration costs and income taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, companies using
the  "full  cost"  method  of  accounting  for  oil  and  gas  producing  activities  perform  a  ceiling  test
using discounted estimated future net revenue from proven oil and gas reserves with a discount
factor of 10%. Prices used in the U.S. GAAP ceiling tests performed for this reconciliation were
those in effect at the applicable year-end. Financing and administration costs are excluded from
the  calculation  under  U.S.  GAAP.  At  December  31,  2001  Old  Enterra  realized  a  U.S.  GAAP
ceiling test write-down of Cdn.$17,500,000, after tax. There were no such write-downs required
at December 31, 2002 or 2003.
The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas
properties  increases  when  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  are  low  or  volatile.  We  may
experience additional ceiling test write-downs in the future.
Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves.
Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of
resource assets, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will
not  arise  and  defeat  our  title  to  the  purchased  assets.  If  such  a  defect  were  to  occur,  our
entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized and, as a result,
distributions to Unitholders may be reduced.
Aboriginal Land Claims
The  economic  impact  on  us  of  claims  of  aboriginal  title  is  unknown.  Aboriginal  people  have
claimed aboriginal title and rights to a substantial portion of western Canada. We are unable to
assess the effect, if any, that any such claim would have on our business and operations.
Changes in tax and other laws may adversely affect Unitholders.
Income  tax  laws,  other  laws  or  government  incentive  programs  relating  to  the  oil  and  gas
industry, such as the treatment of mutual fund trusts and resource allowance, may in the future be
changed  or  interpreted  in  a  manner  that  adversely  affects  the  Trust  and  Unitholders.  Tax
authorities having jurisdiction over the Trust or the Unitholders may disagree with the manner in
which we calculate our income for tax purposes or could change their administrative practices to
our detriment or the detriment of Unitholders. The Department of Finance (Canada) has indicated
that it will continue to evaluate the development of the income trust market as part of its ongoing
monitoring  and  assessment  of  Canadian  financial  markets  and  the  Canadian  tax  system.
Accordingly, changes in this area are possible.
Income Tax Matters
On  October  31,  2003,  the  Department  of  Finance  (Canada)  released,  for  public  comment,
proposed  amendments  to  the  Tax  Act  that  relate  to  the  deductibility  of  interest  and  other
expenses  for  income  tax  purposes  for  taxation  years  commencing  after  2004.  In  general,  the
proposed amendments may deny the realization of losses in respect of a business if there is no
reasonable expectation that the business will produce a cumulative profit over the period that the
business  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  carried  on.  If  such  proposed  amendments  were
enacted and successfully invoked by the CCRA against the Trust or a subsidiary entity, it could
materially adversely affect the amount of distributable cash available. However, Enterra believes
that it is reasonable to expect the Trust and each subsidiary entity to produce a cumulative profit
over the expected period that the business will be carried on.
Expenses incurred by Enterra are only deductible to the extent they are reasonable. Although the
Trust is of the view that all expenses to be claimed by the Trust and its subsidiary entities should
be reasonable and deductible, there can be no assurance that CCRA will agree. If CCRA were to
successfully  challenge  the  deductibility  of  such  expenses,  the  return  to  Unitholders  may  be
adversely affected.
The  Trust  Indenture  provides  that  an  amount  equal  to  the  taxable  income  of  the  Trust  will  be
payable each year to Unitholders in order to reduce the Trust’s taxable income to zero. Where in
a particular year, the Trust does not have sufficient available cash to distribute such an amount to
Unitholders,  the  Trust  Indenture  provides  that  additional  Trust  Units  must  be  distributed  to
Unitholders in lieu of cash payments. Unitholders will generally be required to include an amount
equal to the fair market value of those Trust Units in their taxable income, notwithstanding that
they do not directly receive a cash payment.
As  noted  above,  the  Department  of  Finance  (Canada)  has  indicated  that  it  will  continue  to
evaluate  the  development  of  the  income  trust  market  as  part  of  its  ongoing  monitoring  and
assessment of Canadian financial markets and the Canadian tax system. Accordingly, changes
in this area are possible.
There would be material adverse tax consequences if the Trust lost its status as a mutual
fund trust under the Tax Act.
It is intended that the Trust continue to qualify as a mutual fund trust for purposes of the Tax Act.
The  Trust  may  not,  however,  always  be  able  to  satisfy  any  future  requirements  for  the
maintenance of mutual fund trust status. Should the status of the Trust as a mutual fund trust be
lost or successfully challenged by a relevant tax authority, certain adverse consequences may
arise for the Trust and Unitholders. Some of the significant consequences of losing mutual fund
trust status are as follows:
·
The Trust would be taxed on certain types of income distributed to Unitholders. Payment of this
tax may have adverse consequences for some Unitholders, particularly Unitholders that are not
residents of Canada and residents of Canada that are otherwise exempt from Canadian income
tax.
·
The  Trust  would  cease  to  be  eligible  for  the  capital  gains  refund  mechanism  available  under
Canadian tax laws.
·
Trust units held by Unitholders that are not residents of Canada would become taxable Canadian
property.  These  non-resident  holders  would  be  subject  to  Canadian  income  tax  on  any  gains
realized on a disposition of Trust Units held by them.
·
The  Trust  Units  would  not  constitute  qualified  investments  for  Registered  Retirement  Savings
Plans,  or  "RRSPs",  Registered  Retirement  Income  Funds,  or  "RRIFs",  Registered  Education
Savings Plans, or "RESPs", or Deferred Profit Sharing Plans, or "DPSPs". If, at the end of any
month, one of these exempt plans holds Trust Units that are not qualified investments, the plan
must pay a tax equal to 1% of the fair market value of the Trust Units at the time the Trust Units
were acquired by the exempt plan. An RRSP or RRIF holding non-qualified Trust Units would be
subject to taxation on income attributable to the Trust Units. If an RESP holds non-qualified Trust
Units, it may have its registration revoked by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.
In addition, we may take certain measures in the future to the extent we believe them necessary
to ensure that the Trust maintains its status as a mutual fund trust. These measures could be
adverse to certain holders of Trust Units.
Rights as a Unitholder differ from those associated with other types of investments.
The Trust Units do not represent a traditional investment in the oil and natural gas sector and
should not be viewed by investors as shares in the Trust or Enterra. The Trust Units represent an
equal  fractional  beneficial  interest  in  the  Trust  and,  as  such,  the  ownership  of  the  Trust  Units
does  not  provide  Unitholders  with  the  statutory  rights  normally  associated  with  ownership  of
shares  of  a  corporation,  including,  for  example,  the  right  to  bring  "oppression"  or  "derivative"
actions. The unavailability of these statutory rights may also reduce the ability of Unitholders to
seek legal remedies against other parties on our behalf.
The Trust Units are also unlike conventional debt instruments in that there is no principal amount
owing to Unitholders. The Trust Units will have minimal value when reserves from our properties
can no longer be economically produced or marketed. Unitholders will only be able to obtain a
return  of  the  capital  they  invested  during  the  period  when  reserves  may  be  economically
recovered and sold. Accordingly, cash distributions do not represent a "yield" in the traditional
sense  as  they  represent  both  return  of  capital  and  return  on  investment  and  the  distributions
received over the life of the investment may not meet or exceed the initial capital investment.
Changes in market-based factors may adversely affect the trading price of our Trust Units.
The  market  price  of  our  Trust  Units  is  primarily  a  function  of  anticipated  distributions  to
Unitholders  and  the  value  of  our  properties.  The  market  price  of  our  Trust  Units  is  therefore
sensitive to a variety of market based factors, including, but not limited to, interest rates and the
comparability of our Trust Units to other yield oriented securities. Any changes in these market-
based factors may adversely affect the trading price of the Trust Units.
Our operations are entirely independent from the Unitholders and loss of key management
and other personnel could impact our business.
Unitholders are entirely dependent on the management of Enterra with respect to the acquisition
of oil and gas properties and assets, the development and acquisition of additional reserves, the
management and administration of all matters relating to our oil and natural gas properties and
the administration of the Trust. The loss of the services of key individuals who currently comprise
the management team could have a detrimental effect on the Trust. Investors should carefully
consider whether they are willing to rely on the existing management before investing in the Trust
Units.
There may be future dilution.
One  of  our  objectives  is  to  continually  add  to  our  reserves  through  acquisitions  and  through
development. Since we do not reinvest a material portion of our cash flow, our success is, in part,
dependent  on  our  ability  to  raise  capital  from  time  to  time  by  selling  additional  Trust  Units.
Unitholders  will  suffer  dilution  as  a  result  of  these  offerings  if,  for  example,  the  cash  flow,
production  or  reserves  from  the  acquired  assets  do  not  reflect  the  additional  number  of  Trust
Units  issued  to  acquire  those  assets.  Unitholders  may  also  suffer  dilution  in  connection  with
future issuances of Trust Units to effect acquisitions.
There may not always be an active trading market for the Trust Units.
While  there  is  currently  an  active  trading  market  for  our  Trust  Units  in  the  United  States  and
Canada, we cannot guarantee that an active trading market will be sustained.
The limited liability of Unitholders is uncertain.
Due to uncertainties in the law relating to investment trusts, there is a risk that a Unitholder could
be held personally liable for obligations of the Trust in respect of contracts or undertakings which
the Trust enters into and for certain liabilities arising otherwise than out of contracts including
claims  in  tort,  claims  for  taxes  and  possibly  certain  other  statutory  liabilities.  Although  every
written contract or commitment of the Trust must contain an express disavowal of liability of the
Unitholders  and  a  limitation  of  liability  to  Trust  property,  such  protective  provisions  may  not
operate  to  avoid  Unitholder  liability.  Notwithstanding  attempts  to  limit  Unitholder  liability,
Unitholders may not be protected from liabilities of the Trust to the same extent that a shareholder
is  protected  from  the  liabilities  of  a  corporation.  Further,  although  the  Trust  has  agreed  to
indemnify  and  hold  harmless  each  Unitholder  from  any  costs,  damages,  liabilities,  expenses,
charges and losses suffered by the Unitholder resulting from or arising out of that Unitholder not
having limited liability, the Trust cannot guarantee that any assets would be available in these
circumstances to reimburse Unitholders for any such liability.
The redemption rights of Unitholders is limited.
Unitholders  have  a  limited  right  to  require  the  Trust  to  repurchase  their  Trust  Units,  which  is
referred to as a redemption right. It is anticipated that the redemption right will not be the primary
mechanism  for  Unitholders  to  liquidate  their  investment.  The  Trust's  ability  to  pay  cash  in
connection with a redemption is subject to limitations. Any securities which may be distributed in
specie to Unitholders in connection with a redemption may not be listed on any stock exchange
and a market may not develop for such securities. In addition, there may be resale restrictions
imposed by law upon the recipients of the securities pursuant to the redemption right.
Taxation of Enterra
Enterra  is  subject  to  taxation  in  each  taxation  year  on  its  income  for  the  year,  after  deducting
interest paid to the Trust in respect  of  the  Enterra  Debt.  During  the  period  that  Exchangeable
Shares  issued  by  Enterra  are  outstanding,  a  portion  of  the  cash  flow  from  operations  will  be
subject  to  tax  to  the  extent  that  there  are  not  sufficient  resource  pool  deductions,  capital  cost
allowance  or  utilization  of  prior  years  non-capital  losses  to  reduce  taxable  income  to  zero.
Enterra intends to deduct, in computing its income for tax purposes, the full amount available for
deduction in each year associated with its income tax resource pools, undepreciated capital cost
("UCC") and non-capital losses, if any. If there are not sufficient resource pools, UCC and non-
capital losses carried forward to shelter the income of Enterra, then cash taxes would be payable
by  Enterra.  In  addition,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  taxation  authorities  will  not  seek  to
challenge the amount of interest expense relating to the Enterra Debt. If such a challenge were to
succeed against Enterra, it could materially adversely affect the amount of cash flow available for
distribution to Unitholders.
Further, interest on the Enterra Debt accrues at the Trust level for income tax purposes whether
or not actually paid. The Trust Indenture provides that an amount equal to the taxable income of
the Trust will be distributed each year to Unitholders in order to reduce the Trust's taxable income
to zero. Where interest payments on the Enterra Debt are due but not paid in whole or in part, the
Trust Indenture provides that any additional amount necessary to be distributed to Unitholders
may be distributed in the form of Units rather than in cash. Unitholders will be required to include
such additional amount in income even though they do not receive a cash distribution.
We  may  undertake  acquisitions  that  could  limit  our  ability  to  manage  and  maintain  our
business,  result  in  adverse  accounting  treatment  and  are  difficult  to  integrate  into  our
business. Any of these events could result in a material change in our liquidity, impair our
ability to pay dividends and could adversely affect the value of your investment.
A  component  of  future  growth  will  depend  on  the  ability  to  identify,  negotiate,  and  acquire
additional companies and assets that complement or expand existing operations. However we
may  be  unable  to  complete  any  acquisitions,  or  any  acquisitions  we  may  complete  may  not
enhance our business. Any acquisitions could subject us to a number of risks, including:
·
diversion of management's attention;
·
inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business;
·
inability to establish uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;
·
inability to retain the acquired company's customers;
·
exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition; and inability to
integrate the acquired company and its employees into our organization effectively.
DISTRIBUTIONS
Our distributions are highly dependent on commodity prices, primarily the price of crude oil. We
mitigate  this  risk  by  hedging  some  of  our  oil  production.  A  detailed  schedule  of  our  hedging
history and current position is set forth under "Description of the Business of the Trust – Risk
Management and Marketing – Commodity Price Risk".
Although the payout ratio will vary significantly from month to month, our objective is to pay to
Unitholders approximately 80% of the Trust's operating cash flow over the long term.  The payout
ratio for the first three months of 2004 was 82.43%.
We  have  currently  set  the  level  of  monthly  cash  distributions  at  USD  $0.11  per  Trust  Unit.
  However,  the  availability  of  cash  flows  for  the  payment  of  distributions  will  at  all  times  be
dependant  upon  a  number  of  factors,  including  resource  prices,  production  rates  and  reserve
growth, and the Enterra Board cannot assure that cash flows will be available for distribution to
Unitholders in the amounts anticipated or at all. See "Risk Factors".
The following table sets forth the amount of monthly cash distributions paid per Trust Unit by the
Trust since the completion of the Arrangement.

General
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Enterra  has  established  an  Audit  Committee  (the  "Audit  Committee")  comprised  of  three
members:    H.S.  (Scoby)  Hartley,  Norman  Wallace  and  William  Sliney,  each  of  whom  is
considered "independent" and "financially literate" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument
52-110 – Audit Committees.
Mandate of the Audit Committee
The mandate of the Audit Committee is to assist the Enterra Board in its oversight of the integrity
of the financial and related information of the Trust, Enterra and their subsidiaries and related
entities, including the financial statements, internal controls and procedures for financial reporting
and the processes for monitoring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.  In doing
so, the Audit Committee oversees the audit efforts of our external auditors and, in that regard, is
empowered  to  take  such  actions  as  it  may  deem  necessary  to  satisfy  itself  that  our  external
auditors are independent of us.  It is the objective of the Audit Committee to have direct, open and
frank  communications  throughout  the  year  with  management,  other  Committee  chairmen,  the
external auditors, and other key committee advisors or Enterra staff members as applicable.
The  Audit  Committee's  function  is  oversight.    Management  of  Enterra  is  responsible  for  the
preparation,  presentation  and  integrity  of  the  financial  statements  of  the  Trust  and  Enterra.
  Management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  appropriate  accounting  and  financial  reporting
principles  and  policy  and  internal  controls  and  procedures  that  provide  for  compliance  with
accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations.
While the Audit Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth above, it is not the duty
of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine whether the financial statements
of  the  Trust  and  Enterra  are  complete  and  accurate  and  are  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles.    This  is  the  responsibility  of  management  and  the  external
auditors, on whom the members of the Committee are entitled to rely upon in good faith.
The Charter of the Audit Committee is attached hereto as Appendix "B".
Relevant Education and Experience of Audit Committee Members
The following is a brief summary of the education or experience of each member of the Audit
Committee that is relevant to the performance of his responsibilities as a member of the Audit

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES IN EAST CENTRAL
APPENDIX "A" -
ALBERTA
Principal Properties
The  East  Central  Alberta  (“East  Central”)  properties  acquired  by  Enterra  from  NCE  Petrofund
Corp. are included in townships 33 to 46 and ranges 03 to 14W4.  Working interest are high,
ranging  from  48%  to  1005.    Areas  include  Wainwright,  Alliance,  Soapy/Sounding  Lake  and
Monitor/Loyalist.  These properties include infrastructure, year round drilling and shallow, multi-
target oil and gas zones.  Oil is conventionally produced and ranges from medium crude, 22o API
Sparky oil at Wainwright, to light crude, 34o API Viking oil at Alliance.  Additional development
opportunities include both gas and oil targets.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The table below is a summary of the crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves for the East Central
properties and the present value of future net cash flow associated with such reserves (based on
constant  dollar  and  escalating  dollar  price  assumptions)  as  evaluated  in  the  independent
engineering  report  dated  May  4,  2004,  effective  as  of  December  31,  2003,  prepared  by  GLJ
relating to all of the East Central oil and natural gas properties (the "GLJ Report").  The reserves
estimates have been prepared in accordance with the definitions set out in National Instrument
51-101.
All evaluations of future net production revenue set forth in the tables below are stated
prior  to  the  provision  for  income  taxes  and  general  and  administrative  costs,  but  after
overriding  and  lessor  royalties,  Crown  royalties,  freehold  royalties,  mineral  taxes,  direct
lifting costs, normal allocated overhead and future capital investments. It should not be
assumed that the discounted future net production revenue estimated by the GLJ Report
represents the fair market value of the reserves.  Other assumptions relating to the costs,
prices for future production and other matters are included in the GLJ Report.  There is no
assurance that the future price and cost assumptions used in the GLJ Report will prove
accurate and variances could be material.

Notes:
3.
The  crude  oil  reserves  estimates  presented  in  the  GLJ  Report  have  been  based  on  the
definitions and guidelines prepared by the Standing Committee on Reserves Definitions of the
CIM (Petroleum Society) as presented in the COGE Handbook. A summary of those definitions is
presented below.
4.
Reserves  are  estimated  remaining  quantities  of  oil  and  natural  gas  and  related  substances
anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations, from a given date forward, based on:
(i) analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data; (ii) the use of established
technology;  and  (iii)  specified  economic  conditions,  which  are  generally  accepted  as  being
reasonable, and shall be disclosed.
5.
Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates:
(a)
Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be
recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated
proved reserves.
(b)
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved
reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less
than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.
(c)
Other criteria that must also be met for the categorization of reserves are provided in Section 5.5
of the COGE Handbook.
6.
Each of the reserves categories (proved, probable and possible) may be divided into developed
and undeveloped categories:
(a)
Developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and
installed facilities or, if facilities have not been installed, that would involve a low expenditure (for
example, when compared to the cost of drilling a well) to put the reserves on production. The
developed category may be subdivided into producing and nonproducing.
(b)
Developed  producing  reserves  are  those  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  from
completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing
or,  if  shut-in,  they  must  have  previously  been  on  production,  and  the  date  of  resumption  of
production must be known with reasonable certainty.
(c)
Developed non-producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production,
or have previously been on production, but are shut-in, and the date of resumption of production
is unknown.
(d)
Undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations
where  a  significant  expenditure  (for  example,  when  compared  to  the  cost  of  drilling  a  well)  is
required  to  render  them  capable  of  production.  They  must  fully  meet  the  requirements  of  the
reserves classification (proved, probable, possible) to which they are assigned.
(e)
The qualitative certainty levels referred to in the definitions above are applicable to individual
reserves entities (which refers to the lowest level at which reserves calculations are performed)
and to reported reserves (which refers to the highest- level sum of individual entity estimates for
which reserves estimates are presented). Reported reserves should target the following levels of
certainty under a specific set of economic conditions:
(f)
at least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the
estimated proved reserves;
(g)
at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the
sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves; and
(h)
at least a 10 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the
sum of the estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves.
Additional  clarification  of  certainty  levels  associated  with  reserves  estimates  and  the  effect  of
aggregation is provided in Section 5.5.3 of the COGE Handbook.
7.
"Gross  Reserves"  are  the  total  of  the  Trust's  working  and/or  royalty  interest  share  before
deduction of royalties owned by others.
8.
"Net Reserves" are the total of the Trust's working and/or royalty interest share after deducting
the amounts attributable to royalties owned by others.
APPENDIX "B" -
AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
Organization
There shall be a committee of the board of directors to be known as the audit committee. The
audit committee shall be composed of directors who are independent of the management of the
corporation and are free of any relationship that, in the opinion of the board of directors, would
interfere with their exercise of independent judgment as a committee member. For purposes of
serving as a member of the audit committee, directors being considered shall comply with the
Independent Director and Audit Committee requirements pursuant to NASD Market Place Rules.
Examples of such relation-ships include:
•
A director being employed by the corporation or any of its affiliates for the current year or any of
the past five years;
•
A  director  accepting  any  compensation  from  the  corporation  or  any  of  its  affiliates  other  than
compensation for board service or benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan;
•
A director being a member of the immediate family of an individual who is, or has been in any of
the past five years, employed by the corporation or any of its affiliates, or predecessors as an
executive officer;
•
A director being a partner in, or a controlling shareholder or an executive officer of, any for-profit
business  organization  to  which  the  corporation  made,  or  from  which  the  corporation  received,
payments that are or have been significant to the corporation or business organization in any of
the past five years;
•
A director being employed as an executive of another company where any of the corporation’s
executives serves on that company’s compensation committee.
A director who has one or more of these relationships may be appointed to the audit committee, if
the  board,  under  exceptional  and  limited  circumstances,  determines  that  membership  on  the
committee  by  the  individual  is  required  by  the  best  interests  of  the  corporation  and  its
shareholders, and the board discloses, in the next annual proxy statement subsequent to such
determination, the nature of the relationship and the reasons for that determination.
Statement of Policy
The  audit  committee  shall  provide  assistance  to  the  corporate  directors  in  fulfilling  their
responsibility to the shareholders, potential shareholders, and investment community relating to
corporate accounting, reporting practices of the corporation, and the quality and integrity of the
financial reports of the corporation. In so doing, it is the responsibility of the audit committee to
maintain  free  and  open  means  of  communication  between  the  directors,  the  independent
auditors. the internal auditors, and the financial management of the corporation.
Responsibilities
In  carrying  out  its  responsibilities,  the  audit  committee  believes  its  policies  and  procedures
should remain flexible, in order to best react to changing conditions and to ensure to the directors
and shareholders that the corporate accounting and reporting practices of the corporation are in
accordance  with  all  requirements  and  are  of  the  highest  quality.  In  carrying  out  these
responsibilities, the audit committee will:
•
Review  and  recommend  to  the  directors  the  independent  auditors  to  be  selected  to  audit  the
financial statements of the corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries.
•
Meet with the independent auditors and financial management of the corporation to review the
scope of the proposed audit for the current year and the audit procedures to be utilized, and at the
conclusion  thereof  review  such  audit,  including  any  comments  or  recommendations  of  the
independent auditors.
•
Review  with  the  independent  auditors,  the  company’s  internal  auditor,  and  financial  and
accounting personnel, the adequacy and effectiveness of the accounting and financial controls of
the  corporation,  and  elicit  any  recommendations  for  the  improvement  of  such  internal  control
procedures or particular areas where new or more detailed controls or procedures are desirable.
Particular  emphasis  should  be  given  to  the  adequacy  of  such  internal  controls  to  expose  any
payments,  transactions,  or  procedures  that  might  be  deemed  illegal  or  otherwise  improper.
Further, the committee periodically should review company policy statements to determine their
adherence to the code of conduct.
•
Review the internal audit function of the corporation including the independence and authority of
its reporting obligations, the proposed audit plans for the coming year, and the coordination of
such plans with the independent auditors.
•
Receive  prior  to  each  meeting,  a  summary  of  findings  from  completed  internal  audits  and  a
progress report on the proposed internal audit plan, with explanations for any deviations from the
original plan.
•
Review the financial statements contained in the annual report to shareholders with management
and the independent auditors to determine that the independent auditors are satisfied with the
disclosure  and  content  of  the  financial  statements  to  be  presented  to  the  shareholders.  Any
changes in accounting principles should be reviewed.
•
Provide sufficient opportunity for the internal and independent auditors to meet with the members
of  the  audit  committee  without  members  of  management  present.  Among  the  items  to  be
discussed  in  these  meetings  are  the  independent  auditors’  evaluation  of  the  corporation’s
financial, accounting, and auditing personnel, and the cooperation that the independent auditors
received during the course of the audit.
•
Review accounting and financial human resources and succession planning within Enterra.
•
Submit the minutes of all meetings of the audit committee to, or discuss the matters discussed at
each committee meeting with, the board of directors.
•
Investigate any matter brought to its attention within the scope of its duties, with the power to
retain outside counsel for this purpose if, in its judgment, that is appropriate.
