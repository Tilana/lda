</b></p>

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Government of Rwanda would like to thank the Special Rapporteur for his visit 
to Rwanda, in the context of the standing invitation extended by Rwanda to all UN Human 
Rights special procedures. The Government appreciates the interest showed by the Special 
Rapporteur, and the fact that he acknowledges the progress achieved in many areas in the 
promotion and protection of the rights under his mandate and takes note of his 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>2. The Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda provides for the fundamental human 
rights of every Rwandan including the right to freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of 
Association. Such a right is specifically provided for in Article 33 which provides that: 
Freedom of thought, opinion, conscience, religion, worship and public manifestation 
thereof is guaranteed by the State in accordance with conditions determined by Law. 
Additionally Article 35 provides that: Freedom of association is guaranteed and shall not 
require prior authorization. Article 36 further states that: Freedom of peaceful assembly 
without arms is guaranteed if it is not inconsistent with the law. 
</p>
<p>3. These Constitutional provisions guarantee the right of every Rwandan to hold and 
attend peaceful assemblies. The International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and 
the International Convention on Economic Social and Cultural Rights to which Rwanda is a 
State Party also guarantee those rights. Notably, the Constitution is the Supreme law of the 
land and all other national laws are interpreted in conformity with its intent and spirit. 
International Conventions ratified by Rwanda are also directly applicable in Rwanda and 
are enforceable in national courts. They also take precedence over all other national laws 
save for the Constitution. This hierarchy of laws ensures that the fundamental human rights 
of every Rwandan are guaranteed and protected according to internationally agreed upon 
standards.  
</p>
<p>4. The Government would like to clarify a number of inaccuracies and omissions in 
fact and law contained in the report that we believe do not reflect the actual state of the 
promotion and protection of the rights of peacefully Assembly and Association in Rwanda. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Historical and political background 
</b></p>
<p>5. Regarding paragraphs <b>7, 8</b> and <b>9</b>, the Special Rapporteur directly and through citing 
certain reports and publications provides an inaccurate and selective historical and political 
background. The appropriate historical reference is as follows; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; For centuries, Rwanda existed as a centralized monarchy under a succession of Tutsi 
kings from one clan, who ruled through cattle chiefs, land chiefs and military chiefs. 
The king was supreme but the rest of the population, Bahutu, Batutsi and Batwa, 
lived in harmony. In 1899, Rwanda became a German colony and, in 1919, the 
system of indirect rule continued with Rwanda as a mandated territory of the League 
of Nations, under Belgium. From 1959, Batutsi were targeted, causing hundreds of 
thousands of deaths and sending almost two million of them into exile. The First 
Republic, under President Gregoire Kayibanda, and the second, under President 
Juvenal Habyarimana, institutionalized discrimination against Batutsi and subjected 
them to periodic massacres. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Rwandese Alliance for National Unity (RANU) was formed in 1979 by 
Rwandan refugees in exile, to mobilize against divisive politics, repeated massacres, 
statelessness and the lack of peaceful political exchange. In 1987, RANU became 
the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF). On 1 October 1990, the RPF launched an </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>armed liberation struggle that ultimately ousted the dictatorship in 1994 and ended 
the genocide of more than one million Batutsi and massacres of moderate Bahutu 
who opposed the genocide. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; After Kigali fell to RPA (RPF&#8217;s armed wing) on 4 July 1994, RPF formed a 
Government of National Unity headed by President Pasteur Bizimungu, bringing 
parties that did not participate in the genocide together. In 2000, Parliament voted 
out President Pasteur Bizimungu and RPF appointed then Vice-President and 
Minister of Defense, Major General Paul Kagame as the President of the Republic to 
lead the coalition government. In 2003 President Paul Kagame was elected to serve 
a term of seven years. In 2010, President Paul Kagame was re-elected to serve a 
second term. 
</p>
<p>6. Regarding <b>paragraph 11</b>, the Special Rapporteur &#8220;calls on Rwanda&#8217;s authorities to 
take an inclusive and holistic approach on the consequences of the war and genocide on all 
sides&#8221;&#8230; Firstly, the &#8220;war&#8221; and the genocide against the Tutsi are two distinctly parts of 
Rwanda&#8217;s history and must be treated as such. Any attempt to suggest causality is 
historically incorrect and dangerous. As stated above, the &#8220;war&#8221; was a liberation struggle by 
Rwandan refugees in exile against the divisive politics in place in Rwanda in the period 
leading up. The genocide against the Tutsi was a premeditated act that the international 
community was aware of and has recognized in fact. Secondly, the Government has over 
the past twenty years assiduously advanced the unity and reconciliation of all Rwandans 
through an honest examination of all aspects of our history through both traditional 
mechanisms and processes and experiences from other countries including the South 
African TRC. Justice, accountability and reconciliation have always been at the core of that 
process. It is these efforts that have directly contributed to the significant progress the 
Special Rapporteur recognizes in <b>paragraph 10</b>. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework to prevent and punish the crime of 
genocide and its impact on the Exercise of the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association 
</b></p>
<p>7. Regarding <b>paragraphs 12</b> and <b>13</b>, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the 
imperative of ensuring the prevention and non-recurrence of genocide in Rwanda and 
further recognizes the progress the government of Rwanda has made in that regard. The 
Government would like to emphasise that these laws were developed through a broad grass 
roots based national consultative process that fully took into account Rwanda&#8217;s specific 
historical and social context. That process continues today and informs all actions of all 
branches of government. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Regarding <b>paragraphs 17</b> to <b>20</b>, Article 36 of the Rwandan Constitution provides, 
&#8220;that Freedom of peaceful assembly without arms is guaranteed if it is not inconsistent with 
the law. Prior authorization shall only be necessary if the Law so requires and solely in the 
case of assembly in the open air, in a public place or on a public road, to the extent that 
such is necessary in the interests of public safety, public order or public health&#8221;. The 
Government therefore strongly disagrees with the assessments contained in these 
paragraphs. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Practice 
</b></p>
<p>9. Regarding <b>paragraphs 21</b> to <b>25</b>, the Government rejects the subjective assertions 
contained in paragraph 21 which have no basis in fact or practice. The Government is 
firmly committed to upholding the rule of law and all those acting contrary to the law are 
brought before impartial and independent courts and justice is done and seen to be done as 
illustrated in the case the Special Rapporteur refers to in paragraph 24. 
</p>
<p>10. Regarding <b>paragraph 27</b>, the Government would like to inform that Law 09/2000 
has been amended and the Law determining the powers, responsibilities, organization and 
functioning of the Rwanda National Police is now governed by Law N&#176;46/2010. Article 38 
of this Law governs the use of firearms and is in compliance with the Basic Principles. 
</p>
<p>11. Regarding paragraphs <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>, the Government would like to emphasise that 
Organic Law N&#176; 10/2013/OL governs political organizations and politicians. Chapter VII of 
the Organic Law governs the conduct of political organisations and politicians and in 
particular, Article 34 stipulates that no political organizations or politicians shall undermine 
public order or the rights and freedoms of the individual, in particular and of the people in 
general. As stated previously, the Government is committed to upholding the rule of law 
and those acting contrary to the law have been and/or will be brought to account. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges to the exercise of the right to freedom of 
association 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political parties 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal Framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. Regarding <b>paragraphs 33</b> and <b>34</b>, the Government does not share the Special 
Rapporteurs characterization of Organic Law 01/2012/OL and Organic Law N&#176; 
10/2013/OL and the effects he believes it has. The legal and political environment 
enshrined in the two Organic Laws has allowed for eleven political parties to register and 
function and in no way does it hinder the registration of any party fulfilling the legal 
requirements. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Space for opposition political parties 
</b></p>
<p>13. Regarding <b>paragraphs 36</b> to <b>38</b>, the Government would like to point out that 
Organic Law N&#176; 10/2013/OL governing political organsitations and politicians is explicit in 
its provisions and as the Special Rapporteur recognizes provides that political organisations 
shall be formed and allowed to operate freely. The information provided to the Special 
Rapporteur regarding the political order in Rwanda is false and entirely misleading. 
Constructive public criticism and dissent is a feature of the Rwandan political order and 
exercised by all without fear or favour.  The boundary between ordinary dissent and 
genocide ideology is very clear. Genocide ideology in Rwanda is clearly defined by law in 
Rwanda and anyone engaging in it cannot then claim to be exercising there right to dissent.  
</p>
<p>14. Regarding <b>paragraph 41</b>, the Government would like to clarify that Articles 259 
and 260 of Law N&#176; 30/2013 of 24/05/2013 relating to the Code of Criminal Procedure 
provides for the rehabilitation of any person convicted for a felony or misdemeanor and as 
such individuals can hold leadership positions in political organisations. Regarding the 
alleged disappearance of Aimable Sibomana Rusangwa, the Government is not aware of his 
reported disappearance and invites the Special Rapporteur to provide it with any credible 
information he may have in that regard. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>15. Regarding <b>paragraph 42</b>, the Government refutes the Special Rapporteurs 
characterization of peaceful public disagreement in Rwanda. This statement is without 
foundation in fact, practice or law and cannot be considered as reflecting a careful 
assessment of the situation in Rwanda. The successful reconstruction in Rwanda that the 
Special Rapporteur recognizes is a product of many factors including the rights enjoyed by 
individuals to peacefully criticize or disagree. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal Framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. Regarding <b>paragraphs 45</b> and<b> 47</b> and <b>paragraphs 49</b> to <b>52</b>, the Government would 
like to point out that it views the registration requirement as necessary for facilitating 
harmonized interventions between government and NGOs and as necessary to ensuring the 
principles of transparency and accountability. Since the adoption of Law N&#176; 04/2012, the 
number of registered NGOs has continued to grow, procedures have been streamlined and 
over the last two years 597 NGOs have registered with the Rwanda Governance Board 
(RGB). RGB continues to work with NGOs to ensure that they are able to conduct their 
activities freely and in accordance with the law and that registration procedures are 
simplified and efficiently and effectively concluded. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding <b>paragraph 48</b>, the Government would like to clarify that if an NGO 
operates in more than one district, the letter of collaboration is required only for the district 
in which they have their headquarters and that a NGOs legal personality certificate is valid 
in the whole country. 
</p>
<p>18. Regarding <b>paragraphs 56</b> to <b>58</b>, national and international NGOs and private 
companies are distinctly different entities and as such subject to different regulatory 
regimes, processes and treatment under the law around the world, Rwanda is no exception. 
However, as mentioned previously the Government is committed to ensure that NGOs are 
able to conduct their activities freely and in accordance with the law and that registration 
procedures are simplified and efficiently and effectively concluded. 
</p>
<p>19. Regarding <b>paragraph 60</b>, the Government views the Special Rapporteurs 
observation as having no basis in fact, practice or law. The law is applied equally to all 
CSOs.  
</p>
<p>20. Regarding <b>paragraph 61</b>, the Government would like to point out that the Special 
Rapporteurs observation regarding RGB&#8217;s role is misleading. Article 30 of Law 04/2012 
must be read together with article 29 of the same Law and cannot be cited selectively to 
make an assertion. Article 29 of the same law clearly delineates the RGB&#8217;s role.  
</p>
<p>21. Regarding <b>paragraph 62</b>, the Government would like to state that the case referred 
to in this paragraph is currently subject to a judicial process and as such cannot comment on 
it.  
</p>
<p>22. Regarding <b>paragraph 68</b>, the Government views the JADF as being in line with the 
partnership commitments contained in the five principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness, which include mutual accountability. The government is committed to these 
principles and will continue to encourage them in our relations with development partners. 
In that regard, the Government has decided to end the compulsory financial contributions 
by local and international NGOs.  
</p>
<p>23. Regarding <b>paragraph 72</b> and <b>73</b>, the Government would like inform that a judicial 
process is underway in regards to the case referred to.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> VI. United Nations&#8217; assistance activities 
</b></p>
<p>24. Regarding <b>paragraph 80</b>, as mentioned earlier, the Government has indicated the 
flawed nature of the Special Rapporteurs assessment of the RGB.  The Government would 
like to point out that it welcomes the cooperation and assistance of the One-UN Rwanda 
programme through the UNDAP 2013-2018. The technical assistance provided through the 
UNDAP has and continues to positively contribute to the promotion and protection of 
human rights in Rwanda. It has further strengthened the capacity of CSOs and government 
and contributed to stronger partnerships and collaboration.
