Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick” or the “Registrant”).
 
The Registration  Statement  relates  to  the  offer  (the  “Offer”)  by  Barrick  to  purchase (i)  all  outstanding  common

(b) 0.7518 of a Barrick common share and US$0.05 in cash for each Share
 
in each case subject to proration.
 
The Offer is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer and Circular dated November 10, 2005 (the
“Offer  and  Circular”)  and  the  related  Letter  of Transmittal,  copies  of  which  were  filed  as  Exhibits  1.1  and  1.2,
respectively, to the initial Registration Statement.
Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the respective meaning assigned to such terms in the
Offer and Circular.
The preamble  to  the  “SUMMARY  TERM  SHEET”  of  the  Offer  and  Circular  is  hereby  deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following:
 
“The following  are  some  of  the  questions  that  you,  as  a  Shareholder  of  Placer  Dome Inc.,  may  have  and  the
answers to those questions. This summary term sheet is not meant to be a substitute for the information contained
in the Offer and Circular, the Letter of Transmittal and the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. Therefore, we urge you to
carefully read the entire Offer and Circular, the Letter of Transmittal and the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery prior to
making any decision regarding whether or not to tender your Shares. We have included cross-references in this
summary term sheet to other sections of the Offer and Circular where you will find more complete descriptions of
the  topics  mentioned in  this  summary  term  sheet.  Unless  otherwise  defined  herein,  capitalized  terms have  the
meanings assigned to them in the Definitions.”
 
The question “WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?” in the “SUMMARY TERM

PART II
INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED TO BE SENT TO SHAREHOLDERS
Indemnification
 
Under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario), Barrick may indemnify a present or former director or officer or a
person who acts or acted at Barrick’s request as a director or officer of another corporation of which Barrick is or
was  a  shareholder  or  creditor,  and his  or  her  heirs  and  legal  representatives,  against  all  costs,  charges  and
expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment, reasonably incurred by him or her in
respect of any civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of
his or her being or having been a director or officer of Barrick or such other corporation on condition that (i) the
director or officer acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of Barrick and (ii) in the case of a
criminal or administrative action or proceeding that is enforced by a monetary penalty, had reasonable grounds for
believing  that  his  or  her  conduct was  lawful.  Further,  Barrick  may,  with  court  approval,  indemnify  a  person
described above in respect of an action by or on behalf of Barrick to procure a judgment in its favour, to which the
person  is  made  a  party  by  reason  of  being or  having  been  a  director  or  an  officer  of  Barrick,  against  all  costs,
charges and  expenses  reasonably  incurred  by  the  parson  in  connection  with  such  action i f he  or  she  fulfils
conditions (i) and (ii) above. A director is entitled to indemnification from Barrick as a matter of right if he or she was
substantially successful on the merits of his or her defence and fulfils the conditions (i) and (ii) above.
 
In accordance with provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) described above, the by-laws of Barrick
provide that Barrick shall indemnify a director or officer, a former director or officer, or a person who acts or acted at
Barrick’s request as a director or officer of a corporation of which Barrick is or was a shareholder or creditor, and his
or her heirs and legal representatives, against all costs, charges and expenses, including an amount paid to settle
an action or satisfy a judgment, reasonably incurred by him or her in respect of any civil, criminal or administrative
action or proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of being or having been a director or officer of
Barrick or such other corporation if he or she acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of
Barrick and, in the case of a criminal or administrative action or proceeding that is enforced by monetary penalty, he
or she had reasonable grounds for believing that his or her conduct was lawful.
 
Insofar as  indemnification  for  liabilities  arising  under  the  Securities  Act  of  1933 may be  permitted  to  directors,
officers or persons controlling the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Registrant has been informed
that in the opinion of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy
as expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable.
