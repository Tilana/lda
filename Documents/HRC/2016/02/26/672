</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 16/11 of 24 March 2011, 19/10 of 22 
</p>
<p>March 2012 and 25/21 of 28 March 2014 on human rights and the environment, as well as 
</p>
<p>relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolutions 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and 65/281 
</p>
<p>of 17 June 2011, and Human Rights Council resolution 16/21 of 25 March 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the 
</p>
<p>Council, and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
</p>
<p>Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
</p>
<p>duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, and its outcome document, &#8220;The 
</p>
<p>future we want&#8221;, and aiming to contribute to follow-up processes, including the 
</p>
<p>identification and realization of sustainable development goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and 
</p>
<p>Development, 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development, that the right to development must be fulfilled in order to meet the 
</p>
<p>development and environmental needs of present and future generations equitably, and that 
</p>
<p>the human person is the central subject of development and should be the active participant 
</p>
<p>in and beneficiary of the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that sustainable development and the protection of the environment can 
</p>
<p>contribute to human well-being and to the enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i>, conversely, that climate change, unsustainable management and 
</p>
<p>use of natural resources and the unsound management of chemicals and wastes may 
</p>
<p>interfere with the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that 
</p>
<p>environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the 
</p>
<p>effective enjoyment of all human rights, in particular, the right to life, the right to the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to an 
</p>
<p>adequate standard of living and its components, such as the right to food, and the rights to 
</p>
<p>safe drinking water and sanitation, and to adequate housing, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> that, while these implications affect individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities around the world, environmental damage is felt most acutely by those 
</p>
<p>segments of the population already in vulnerable situations, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, 
</p>
<p>including the clarification of important aspects of the human rights obligations relating to 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the progress in 
</p>
<p>compiling good practices, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations 
</p>
<p>conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions, and the undertaking of 
</p>
<p>country missions; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes </i>the work of the Office of the United Nations High

</p>
<p>sustainable environment; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the current mandate holder as a special
