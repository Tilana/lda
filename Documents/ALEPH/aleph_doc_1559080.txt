Item 1. Business 
  
As used in this annual report, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” mean Valmie Resources, Inc. and all dollar amounts refer to U.S. dollars, unless
otherwise indicated. 
  
Overview 
  
We are an exploration stage company that was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on August 26, 2011. We have no
subsidiaries. We are a mineral exploration company exploring for precious metals, or gold and silver targets. Our property, known as the Carico
Lake Valley Property (the “Property”), is located in Lander County, Nevada. We plan to explore the Property in phases. 
  
There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the Property. Extensive exploration will be required before we can
make a final evaluation regarding the economic and legal feasibility of any potential deposit which might be located on the Property. We have
never declared bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings nor have we had any material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or
purchases or sales of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business. 
  
Currently, we have no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. Since our inception, our
efforts have focused primarily on the development and implementation of our business plan. Our website address is www.valmieresources.com.
  
Our Corporate History and Background 
  
On December 3, 2013, the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock approved an amendment to our bylaws (the
“Bylaw Amendment”) and an increase in our authorized capital from 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, to 750,000,000
shares  of  common  stock,  par  value  $0.001  (the  “Authorized  Capital  Increase”).  The  purpose  of  the  Bylaw  Amendment  was  to  update  our 
bylaws and make them more comprehensive, while the purpose of the Authorized Capital Increase was to reorganize our capital structure in
connection with the stock dividend described below. We formally effected the Authorized Capital Increase on December 4, 2013 by filing a
Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State.
Also on December 3, 2013, our sole director approved a stock dividend of 59 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock on each one
(1) issued and outstanding share of our common stock. On December 13, 2013, we received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) to effect the stock dividend by way of a forward split, and on December 17, 2013, our shareholders of record on December
16, 2013 received the dividend. As a result of the stock dividend, our issued and outstanding common stock increased from 4,940,000 shares to
296,400,000 shares. 
  
Regional Geology 
  
The Property is located in central Nevada, approximately 90 km south of the Town of Battle Mountain. Located in Tier 23 North and Range 44
East of the Mount Diablo Base and Meridian, the Property is comprised of two separate claim blocks, the “PRO” claim block which consists of 
24 unpatented claims located in Sections 9, 10 and 16, and the four unpatented “MAG” claims, located in Section 22 of the same township. An 
unpatented claim gives the owner of the claim the legal right to the subsurface minerals contained within the claim area. A patented claim gives
the owner of the claim ownership of the surface as well as the mineral rights. The center of the property is at approximately 39° 52' 15” North, 
117° 01' 30” West. In the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system, this point is at approximately 498200 m east, 4413250 m North, Zone
11 in the UTM grid system, 1983 North American Datum. The total area of the Property is approximately 575 acres or 232 hectares.

Property Geology 
  
The Property is located in an area of low hills between the north-northeast trending Toiyabe and Shoshone Ranges, and consists of variably
altered Valmy Formation sediments and younger volcanic rocks. The Property is surrounded by Quaternary gravels which have been deposited
into a complexly faulted Basin and Range valley formed by down dropped fault blocks. There are outcrops of Valmy Formation arenites on Hill
6019,  where  the  PRO  claims  are  located,  and  immediately  north  and  west  of  the  Property.  Many  of  these  outcrops  show  widespread
silicification  and  have  anomalous  “pathfinder”  element  signatures,  along  with  trace  amounts  of  gold,  as  is  confirmed  by  the  consulting
geologist’s audit sampling. 
  
Hill 6025 directly off the eastern boundary of the four “MAG” claims is similarly held up by silicified and brecciated Tertiary volcanic rocks,
which again show elevated trace element and near-ore-grade gold at surface. The area between the two claim blocks is covered by recent Basin
and Range gravels. 
  
It appears that this area of the Toiyabe Range is characterized by an initial north-northeast trending Basin and Range faulting event and a later 
superimposed North trending extension which has left a complex assemblage of low hills and valley fill. This later faulting has juxtaposed and
raised an older alluvium layer to the west of the Property which is now eroding into the Property. In addition, the sediment load of the Property
has been reduced by the recent development of the Reese River which has captured a large area of eroding bedrock and covering gravels to the
west. In response, the fan deposits of the Property have become slightly incised due to the decreased sediment load compared to that available
in earlier times. During the 1980’s, a limited amount of ground magnetic and VLF-EM surveying over the covered areas was completed. The 
results  of  these  surveys  were  not  available  to  the  consulting  geologist,  but  it  is  reported  verbally  that  they  were  largely  inconclusive.  No
systematic geophysical work has yet been done to ascertain the likely depth to bedrock of covered areas surrounding the Property. 
  
Deposit Type 
  
The goal of exploring the Property is to find a gold deposit of mineable grade and tonnage. The bulk of the surface of the Property is made up
of altered Valmy Formation rocks and inference as to the likely geology of the bedrock may be made from nearby outcrops. Given this inferred
geology, the type of targets most likely to be found on the Property can be assumed and exploration can be targeted to look for these types. The
Ivanhoe (Hollister) deposit in Elko County, Nevada is analogous to the Property. At Ivanhoe, gold/mercury deposits occur in Tertiary volcanic
rocks, associated with hot spring and sinter features. Beneath the volcanics, high grade gold occurs in mineable high angle structures that have
been interpreted as the feeders for the low grade surface deposits. These veins occur in Ordovician sediments similar to the Valmy Formation. 
  
From the bedrock geology exposed on Chem Hill and Hill 6019, it appears that a good deal of the covered ground is probably underlain by the
Valmy  Formation,  mostly  made  up  of  siliceous  quartzites  and  siltstones,  and  by  Tertiary  volcanic  rocks.  The  Valmy  Formation  hosts  gold
deposits  at  the  Marigold  Mine  west  of  Battle  Mountain,  Nevada.  Nearby  outcrops  show  that  the  Valmy  Formation  on  the  property  is
immediately underlain by the Roberts Mountain Thrust (RMT) and then by the carbonate-rich Devonian Hanson Creek Formation, which hosts 
the Jerritt Canyon gold deposits in the Independence Range. Other outcrops show that the Battle Formation, a carbonate-rich part of the Antler 
overlap sequence, overlies the Valmy in places. 
  
Given  the  geology  and  mineralization  exposed  on  the  Property  and  nearby,  it  is  believed  that  the  Property  could  host  either  a  Carlin-type 
deposit or a low-sulfidation epithermal vein-type deposit. 
  
Carlin-type (also known as sediment-hosted disseminated gold) deposits are almost unique to Nevada. Although some broadly similar deposits
are found elsewhere, no other place in the world hosts anywhere near the quantity of gold in this type of deposit as has been found in the Basin
and Range of Nevada. The reasons for this remain unclear, as does some of the chemistry of deposition of these deposits. The basic elements of
the  Carlin-type  model  involve  pervasive  structural  preparation  (or  selective  carbonate  dissolution)  of  a  host  rock  such  that  fluid  flow  is
dispersed over a large volume of rock, a moderate-temperature mineralizing fluid active at moderate depth, and associated alteration consisting
of  silicification  in  the  form  of  jasperoids,  and  widespread  argillization.  There  is  often  an  exposed  late  Mesozoic  intrusion  nearby,  but  it  is
usually difficult to tie the mineralization directly to the igneous activity.

Geochemically, these deposits of gold are accompanied by enrichment in arsenic, antimony, mercury and sometimes thallium in the ore and
surrounding rock. Haloes of these “pathfinder” elements are usually much larger than the gold deposits themselves. Although it has been found
that  the  rocks  which  host  the  highest-grade  deposits  of  micron  gold  mineralization  are  the  carbonaceous  silty  limestones  of  the  Eastern
Assemblage, such as the Silurian-Devonian Roberts Mountain Formation and the Devonian Hanson Creek Formation, it has become clear that
almost any lithology can host economic mineralization in this type of deposit. 
  
In Carlin-type ores, deposition of gold in arsenical pyrite from fluids bearing gold in bisulfide complexes is characteristic as are large volumes
of mineralized rock, the relative absence of gold-bearing quartz veining, and the microscopic dimension of the gold particles. 
  
Carlin-type deposits are often difficult to find due to the alteration style of the ore and surrounding country rocks. Although the silicification
stage often produces jasperoids which are quite resistant in outcrop, this stage of alteration is often barren of gold and is sometimes found a
significant  distance  from  actual  ore.  In  addition,  many  jasperoids  have  been  found  in  Nevada  which  have  outstanding  anomalies  of  trace
elements but which do not seem to be associated with any gold mineralization. Other alteration associated with these gold deposits is almost all
recessive in nature, which means that altered and mineralized areas are often not visible in outcrop as they are easily covered by talus and float
from more resistant, unaltered country rock. Because the total effect of the alteration around a gold deposit is more recessive than resistant,
these deposits are often found in areas covered by gravels or as very small outcrops in otherwise covered areas. Possible Carlin-type targets on 
the CLV Property include disseminated gold in the Valmy Formation such as that found at the Marigold Mine some 60 miles north. 
  
At this mine large tonnages of low-grade mineralization hosted by quartzite and other siliceous sedimentary rocks were found after years of
exploration. Although these deposits average less than one gram of gold per ton, they are being mined at a profit today. In addition there is the
possibility of similar mineralization hosted by the Battle Formation and/or the Hanson Creek Formation. Such a deposit could be of higher
grade, as carbonate-rich host rocks usually have higher grades of ore. Any mineralization found in the Valmy could well point the way to richer
deposits hosted in these more favorable rocks. 
  
In addition to sediment-hosted gold, the geology of the Property is also permissive to host a high-grade low-sulfidation gold deposit. This type
of deposit is often found as a multi-stage quartz-bearing vein fracture filling in siliceous rocks, such as the Valmy Formation. Mineralization of
this type has been found at the Hollister Mine of Great Basin Gold, Inc. in the Ivanhoe district, some 90 miles to the northeast, where a number
of narrow high-grade gold vein deposits have been found hosted in the Valmy Formation. Because epithermal deposits often have very limited
vertical extent, evidence of deeper ore-grade mineralization is often quite subtle at the surface. Some of these deposits found in Nevada carry
over one ounce of gold per ton and they can often be mined at a significant profit. 
  
Mineralization 
  
Mineralization  and  alteration  found  on  the  Property  is  indicative  of  a  possible  “Carlin-type”  deposit,  as  it  has  a  trace  element  signature  of 
elevated arsenic, antimony and mercury, which is characteristic of almost all of the bulk-mineable gold deposits found in Nevada. 
  
The PRO claims cover an area which hosts a number of silicified, brecciated quartzites of the Valmy Formation. This silicification is the result
of hydrothermal fluids passing through the more permeable breccias, which fluids also have left concentrations of trace elements characteristic
of Carlin-type mineralization. The hardness of these silicified rocks makes them resistant to erosion, and these outcrops hold up most of the
hills on the Property. This same silicification makes the altered float more long-lasting than the unaltered rock, which makes it difficult to 
accurately assess the amount of altered rock as it does not easily weather, and so often covers larger areas than unaltered, softer rocks do.
Without detailed work, it is impossible to know the true extent of these silicified bodies underneath the surface.

Likewise, the MAG claims are underlain by silicified rhyolites which are more resistant and so has formed Hill 6025, also known as “Chem 
Hill”. Again, these silicified rocks host an  elevated trace element  signature characteristic of both Carlin-type and  epithermal gold deposits,
consisting of arsenic, antimony, and mercury. 
  
The data collected to date and the geological environment on the Property show that the area in which the Property is located is permissive for
Carlin-type  and  for  epithermal  precious  metals  deposits.  The  presence  of  silicified  outcrops  bearing  significant  concentrations  of  the
“epithermal suite” of trace elements is evidence of a gold mineralizing system which may have deposited greater concentrations of gold than is
presently evident at the surface. It is not uncommon in Nevada for economic deposits to have a muted surface geochemical expression. 
  
The relative proximity of the Gold acres district, the mineralized ICP property just to the south, the silicification, permissive geology, and the
presence of the trace element suite commonly associated with bulk-tonnage gold deposits in Nevada all argue for more complete exploration of
the Property. This exploration should consist of rock and soil sampling over the PRO and MAG claims. It is thought that a CSAMT (controlled
source audio-magneto telluric) survey, possibly in conjunction with a surface magnetic or gravity survey is warranted to better define potential
drill  targets  for  a  possible  second-phase  drill  program.  If  positive  results  from  this  proposed  work  are  received,  it  is  recommended  that  a
second- phase exploration program be conducted, consisting of exploration drilling. 
  
Government Regulations 
  
We are engaged in mineral exploration and are accordingly exposed to environmental risks associated with mineral exploration activity. We are
currently in the initial exploration stages on our property interests. 
  
In general, in Nevada, no government permits are required on mining claims for exploration activities which do not involve the use of powered
equipment. Any disturbance of existing land and vegetation by powered means will generally require a permit which will specify that after
work is completed land be re-contoured to original surface and be seeded with native plant species. On unpatented claims with federally-owned 
surface, a “Notice of Intent” must be filed with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for all activities involving the disturbance of five acres
(two  hectares)  or  less  of  the  surface.  A  Notice  of  Intent  will  include  details  on  the  company  submitting  the  notice,  maps  of  the  proposed
disturbance,  equipment  to  be  utilized,  the  general  schedule  of  operations,  a  calculation  of  the  total  disturbance  anticipated,  and  a  detailed
reclamation  plan  and  budget.  A  bond  in  U.S.  currency  will  be  required  to  ensure  reclamation  and  the  amount  will  be  determined  by  the
calculated acreage being disturbed. The Notice does not have an approval process associated with it but the bond calculation does have to be
approved with a letter from the BLM before work can proceed. While is not necessary to file a Notice of Intent prior to work on land with
privately owned surface, the Property has federally-owned surface rights.
Measurement of land disturbance is cumulative, and once five acres total has been disturbed on one project, a “Plan of Operations” must be 
filed and approved by the BLM before additional work can take place. This too requires a cash bond along with a reclamation plan.
To date, we have not filed a “Notice of Intent” with the BLM and we have not obtained any environmental or exploration permits. 
  
To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing environmental liabilities on the Property. A detailed environmental investigation has not
been conducted.

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  
General 
  
As of March 14, 2014, we had 296,400,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
  
Market Information 
  
There is a limited public market for our common stock. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “VRMI”. 
Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors
that may be unrelated to a company’s operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our
common stock. 
  
OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin
Board  securities  transactions  are  conducted  through  a  telephone  and  computer  network  connecting  dealers  in  stocks.  OTC  Bulletin  Board
issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.
  
Our common stock became eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board on December 6, 2012. The following quotations reflect the high
and low bids for our common stock based on inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission, and may not represent 
actual transactions. The high and low bid quotations of our common stock for the periods indicated below are as follows:

Holders 
  
As  of  March  14,  2014,  there  were  two  holders  of  record  of  our  common  stock,  one  of  which  was  Cede  &  Co.  We  do  not  believe  that  a
significant number of beneficial owners hold their shares of our common stock in street name. 
  
Dividends 
  
On December 3, 2013, our sole director approved a stock dividend of 59 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock on each one (1)
issued  and  outstanding  share  of  our  common  stock.  On  December  13,  2013,  we  received  approval  from  the  Financial  Industry  Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) to effect the stock dividend by way of a forward split, and on December 17, 2013, our shareholders of record on December
16, 2013 received the dividend. As a result of the stock dividend, our issued and outstanding common stock increased from 4,940,000 shares to
296,400,000 shares. 
  
Other than as described above, we have never paid dividends on our common stock.

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans 
  
As of March 14, 2014, we did not have any compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance, and we do not
currently have any such plans. We intend to adopt an equity compensation plan in which our directors, officers, employees and consultants will
be eligible to participate. However, no formal steps have been taken as of the date of this annual report to adopt such a plan. 
  
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
  
We did not issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act during the year ended November 30, 2013. 
  
Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and “Affiliated Purchasers” 
  
We did not purchase any shares of our common stock or other securities during the year ended November 30, 2013. 
  
Item 6. Selected Financial Data 
  
Not required. 
  
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  
The  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  has  been  derived  from  and  should  be  read  in
conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report. 
  
Overview 
  
We were incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on August 26, 2011. We are an exploration stage company and have not yet
generated any revenues. To date, our efforts have focused primarily on the development and implementation of our business plan. 
  
Results of Operations 
  
Revenues 
  
We have not generated any revenues since our inception. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our
ability to generate any revenues during the next 12 months continues to be uncertain. 
  
Expenses 
  
During  the  year  ended  November  30,  2013,  we  incurred  $62,227  in  operating  expenses,  including  $32,866  in  professional  fees,  $8,482  in
general and administrative expenses, $14,473 in transfer agent fees and $6,406 in mining expenses. During the year ended November 30, 2012,
we incurred $76,239 in operating expenses, including $41,736 in professional fees, $10,363 in general and administrative expenses, $22,110 in
transfer  agent  fees  and  $2,030  in  mining  expenses.  The  $20,418  decrease  in  our  operating  expenses  between  the  two  years  was  therefore
attributable to decreases in each of our expense categories. 
  
From our inception on August 26, 2011 to November 30, 2013, we incurred $159,887 in operating expenses, including $74,602 in professional
fees, $21,048 in general and administrative expenses, $36,583 in transfer agent fees and $27,654 in mining expenses.

Net Loss 
  
During the year ended November 30, 2013, we incurred a net loss of $62,227. During the year ended November 30, 2013, we incurred net loss
of $76,239. Our basic and diluted net loss per share during each of those years was $0.00. From our inception on August 26, 2011 to November
30, 2013, we incurred a net loss of $159,887. 
  
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  
As of November 30, 2013, we had no cash and cash equivalents, $5,000 in total assets, $24,144 in total liabilities, a working capital deficit of
$19,144 and an accumulated deficit of $159,887. 
  
During the year ended November 30, 2013, we used $70,326 in net cash on operating activities, our accounts payable and accrued liabilities
decreased by $3,099 and our prepaid expenses increased by $5,000. During the year ended November 30, 2012 we used $36,483 in net cash on
operating activities, our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $19,756 and our prepaid expenses decreased by $20,000. The
majority of our spending on operating activities for the years ended November 30, 2013 and 2012 was therefore attributable to our net loss as
described above and was associated with our carrying out our reporting obligations under applicable securities laws. 
  
We did not incur any expenditures on investing activities during the years ended November 30, 2013 or 2012. 
  
During the year ended November 30, 2013, we received $66,200 in cash from financing activities, substantially all of which was in the form of
proceeds from a related party. During the year ended November 30, 2012, we received $28,174 from financing activities, including $30,600 in
proceeds from a related party as offset by $2,426 in payments we made to a related party. 
  
During the year ended November 30, 2013, our cash decreased by $4,126 due to a combination of our operating and financing activities. 
  
Our plans for the next 12 months are uncertain due to our current financial condition; however, we intend to raise additional funds through
public or private placement offerings. If we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts, we may review other financing
possibilities such as bank loans. At this time we do not have a commitment from any broker-dealer to provide us with financing. There is no 
assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. In the absence of such financing, we
may be forced to cease or significantly curtail our operations. 
  
Going Concern 
  
Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates, among other things, that we will continue to realize
our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business. As at November 30, 2013, we had a working capital deficit of $19,144 and
an accumulated deficit of $159,887. We intend to fund our operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund
our capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
  
Our  ability  to  emerge  from  the  exploration  stage  is  dependent  upon,  among  other  things,  obtaining  additional  financing  to  continue  our
operations, explore and develop our properties and the discovery, development and sale of ore reserves. These factors, among others, raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Significant Accounting Policies 
  
Mineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs 
  
We  have  been  in  the  exploration  stage  since  our  formation  on  August  26,  2011  and  have  not  yet  realized  any  revenue  from  our  planned
operations. We are primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mining properties. Mineral property acquisition and
exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of
establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the
units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserves. 
  
Environmental Expenditures 
  
Our operations have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental regulations,
including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon us vary
greatly and are not predictable. Our policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically
proven and economically feasible measures. 
  
Environmental  expenditures  that  relate  to  ongoing  environmental  and  reclamation  programs  are  charged  against  earnings  as  incurred  or
capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. All of these types of expenditures incurred since inception have been
charged against earnings due to the uncertainty of their future recoverability. Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the
ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation,
net of expected recoveries. 
  
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  
We  do  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  that  have  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have  a  current  or  future  effect  on  our  financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
  
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
William R. Denney, CPA  Valmie Resources, Inc.
Sandra Chen, CPA  89 Ferrand Drive
Toronto, Ontario, Canada M3C 3Z2
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  balance  sheets  of  Valmie  Resources,  Inc.  (an  exploration  stage 
company)  (the  Company)  as  of  November  30,  2013  and  2012,  and  the  related  statements  of  operations, 
changes in stockholders’ equity (deficiency), and cash flows for the years ended November 30, 2013 and 
2012,  and  for  the  period  from  inception  on  August  26,  2011  to  November  30,  2013.  These  financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain 
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  The 
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over 
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting, as a basis 
for  designing  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances  but  not  for  the  purpose  of 
expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting. 
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the  amounts and disclosures in the  financial  statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Valmie Resources, Inc. as of November 30, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and 
its  cash  flows  for  the  years  ended  November  30,  2013  and  2012,  and  for  the  period  from  inception  on 
August 26, 2011 to November 30, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America.
The  accompanying  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  assuming  the  Company  will  continue  as  a 
going concern. As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company has recurring losses and 
has not generated revenues from its planned principal operations. These factors raise substantial doubt that 
the  Company  will  be  able  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any 
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Valmie Resources, Inc.
(An Exploration Stage Company) 
Notes to Financial Statements
November 30, 2013 
(Stated in US Dollars)
1. Organization 
  
Valmie Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 26, 2011, in the State of Nevada, U.S.A.  The accounting and reporting
policies  of  the  Company  conform  to  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (“US  GAAP”),  and  the 
Company’s fiscal year end is November 30. 
  
The Company is an exploration stage company that engages principally in the acquisition, exploration, and development of resource properties.
  
  
Exploration Stage Company 
  
The Company is considered to be in the exploration stage as defined in FASC 915-10-05 “Development Stage Entities”, and interpreted by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for mining companies in Industry Guide 7.  The Company is devoting substantially all of its
efforts to development of business plans and the acquisition of mineral properties.  
  
2. Significant Accounting Policies 
  
Use of Estimates 
  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the
reported  amount  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.   Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.   The  Company’s 
periodic filings with the SEC include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the
financial statements and future operations of the Company. 
  
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with original maturities of less than
three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant
risk of loss in value.  The Company had $0 in cash and cash equivalents at November 30, 2013. 
  
Start-Up Costs 
  
In  accordance  with  FASC  720-15-20  “Start-Up  Costs”,  the  Company  expenses  all  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  the  start-up  and 
organization of the Company. 
  
Mineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs 
  
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation on August 26, 2011 and has not yet realized any revenue from its planned
operations.  It  is  primarily  engaged  in  the  acquisition,  exploration,  and  development  of  mining  properties.  Mineral  property  acquisition  and
exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of
establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the
units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserves.

Notes to Financial Statements
November 30, 2013 
(Stated in US Dollars)
2. Significant Accounting Policies - Continued 
  
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents and
related party payables it will likely incur in the near future.  The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of
high credit worthiness.  At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government
insurance limits.  The Company’s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends
funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited. 
  
Net Income or (Loss) per Share of Common Stock 
  
The Company has adopted FASC Topic No. 260, “Earnings Per Share” (“EPS”), which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the 
face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of
the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. 
  
Foreign Currency Translations 
  
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the US dollar.  All transactions initiated in other currencies are translated into US dollars
using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into  the  US  dollar  at  the  rate  of  exchange  in  effect  at  the  balance  sheet  date.   Unrealized  exchange  gains  and  losses  arising  from  such
transactions  are  deferred  until  realization  and  are  included  as  a  separate  component  of  stockholders’  equity  (deficit)  as  a  component  of
comprehensive income or loss. Upon realization, the amount deferred is recognized in income in the period when it is realized. 
  
No significant realized exchange gain or losses were recorded from inception (August 26, 2011) to November 30, 2013. 
  
Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  
FASC Topic No. 220, “Comprehensive Income”, establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
in a full set of general-purpose financial statements.  From inception (August 26, 2011) to November 30, 2013, the Company had no items of
other comprehensive income. Therefore, net loss equals comprehensive loss from inception (August 26, 2011) to November 30, 2013. 
  
Risks and Uncertainties 
  
The Company operates in the resource exploration industry that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational,
technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource exploration business, including the potential risk of business failure.

2. Significant Accounting Policies - Continued 
  
Environmental Expenditures 
  
The operations of the Company have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental
regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs.  Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect
upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable.  The Company’s policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant
legislation by application of technically proven and economically feasible measures. 
  
Environmental  expenditures  that  relate  to  ongoing  environmental  and  reclamation  programs  are  charged  against  earnings  as  incurred  or
capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits.  All of these types of expenditures incurred since inception have been
charged against earnings due to the uncertainty of their future recoverability.  Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the
ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation,
net of expected recoveries. 
  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  
Recent accounting pronouncements that are listed below did not, and are not currently expected to, have a material effect on the Company’s 
financial statements, but will be implemented in the Company’s future financial reporting when applicable. 
  
FASB Statements 
  
In  June  2009  the  FASB  established  the  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (“ASC”)  as  the  source  of  authoritative  accounting  principles 
recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP.
Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC issued under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of US GAAP for SEC registrants.
Existing US GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the ASC, and accordingly the change did not impact the Company’s financial 
statements. The ASC does change the way the guidance is organized and presented. 
  
Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) through ASU No. 2014-05 which contain technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance
to specialized industries or entities were recently issued. These updates have no current applicability to the Company or their effect on the
financial statements would not have been significant.

3. Capital Stock 
  
Authorized Stock 
  
At inception, the Company authorized 100,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. Each common share entitles the holder
to one vote, in person or proxy, on any matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought. 
  
On December 3, 2013, the holders of a majority of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock approved an increase in its authorized
capital  from  100,000,000  shares  of  common  stock,  par  value  $0.001,  to  750,000,000  shares  of  common  stock,  par  value  $0.001  (the
“Authorized Capital Increase”). The Company formally effected the Authorized Capital Increase on December 4, 2013 by filing a Certificate of
Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State. 
  
On December 3, 2013, the Company’s sole director approved a stock dividend of 59 authorized but unissued shares of its common stock on
each one (1) issued and outstanding share of its common stock held by shareholders of record as of December 16, 2013. The payment date for
the stock dividend was December 17, 2013, as determined by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Upon the payment of the
stock dividend, the Company had 296,400,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which represents an increase of 291,460,000
shares  over  its  prior  total  of  4,940,000  issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock.  The  split  is  reflected  retrospectively  in  the
accompanying financial statements. 
  
Share Issuances 
  
Since its inception (August 26, 2011), the Company has issued shares of its common stock as follows:

4. Provision for Income Taxes 
  
The  Company  recognizes  the  tax  effects  of  transactions  in  the  year  in  which  such  transactions  enter  into  the  determination  of  net  income,
regardless of when reported for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided in the financial statements under FASC 718-740-20 to give effect to 
the resulting temporary differences which may arise from differences in the bases of fixed assets, depreciation methods, allowances, and start-
up costs based on the income taxes expected to be payable in future years. 
  
Exploration  stage  deferred  tax  assets  arising  as  a  result  of  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  have  been  offset  completely  by  a  valuation
allowance due to the uncertainty of their utilization in future periods. Operating loss carryforwards generated during the period from August 26,
2011  (date  of  inception)  through  November  30,  2013  of  $153,841  will  begin  to  expire  in  2031.  Accordingly,  deferred  tax  assets  of
approximately $53,844 were offset by the valuation allowance. 
  
The Company follows the provisions of uncertain tax positions as addressed in FASC 740-10-65-1. The Company recognized approximately no 
increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 
  
The Company has no tax position at November 30, 2013 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty
about the timing of such deductibility. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and
penalties in operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented. The Company had no accruals for
interest and penalties at November 30, 2013. The Company’s utilization of any net operating loss carry forward may be unlikely as a result of
its intended exploration stage activities. The tax years for November 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are still open for examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).

5. Mineral Property Costs 
  
Lander County, Nevada Claims 
  
On September 30, 2011, the Company entered into an option agreement that would provide for the purchase of a 100% interest in the Carico
Lake Valley Property (the “Property”). The Property is located in the State of Nevada. 
  
To complete the option, the agreement requires the Company to make the following payments and incur the following amounts on exploration
and development: 
  
a) $15,000 cash on September 30, 2011 (paid); 
b) an additional $30,000 cash on September 30, 2013 (not paid); 
b) an additional $60,000 cash on September 30, 2013 (not paid); 
c) an additional $120,000 cash on September 30, 2014; and 
d) incur a minimum of $125,000 ($6,248 has been incurred as of November 30, 2013) on exploration and development work by December 31,
2013 and every subsequent year thereafter, through 2014. 
  
The  Company  is  in  default  in  the  option  payments.  The  entity  that  owns  the  Property  has  made  the  payments  due  to  the  Bureau  of  Land
Management, Nevada (“BLM”) and Lander County. The payments ($6,406) are reflected in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the
annual exploration and development work. 
  
The entity that owns the Property has indicated a willingness to work with the Company if the Company reimburses the $6,406 mentioned
above and makes an effort to become current with the option payments of $90,000 that are in default. Otherwise, the owner may terminate the
option and explore other financing arrangements related to the Property. 
  
The Company is responsible for any and all property payments due to any government authority on the Property during the term of the option
agreement (BLM: $3,920 yr., Lander County: $298 yr.). 
  
The Property is subject to a 6% net smelter royalty, for which the Company has the right to purchase 3% for a one time payment of $5,000,000
at any time until the tenth anniversary of the option agreement. 
  
As at November 30, 2013, the Company has incurred the following on the Property:
November 30, 2013     November 30, 2012
Acquisition cost
 
Exploration costs, beginning of period
Exploration costs incurred
Exploration  costs, end of period

6. Due to Related Party 
  
Amount due to related party at November 30, 2013, is non-interest bearing, unsecured and with no fixed terms of repayment. During the year
ended November 30, 2013, the former President of the Company forgave $91,343 of debt due to him. The debt cancellation was recorded as
additional paid-in capital.

7. Going Concern and Liquidity Considerations 
  
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among  other things, the  realization of  assets and satisfaction  of liabilities  in  the normal  course  of business. As at November  30,  2013,  the
Company had a working capital deficiency of $19,144 (2012 – working capital deficiency of $48,260) and an accumulated deficit of $159,887
(2012  –  $97,660).   The  Company  intends  to  fund  operations  through  equity  financing  arrangements,  which  may  be  insufficient  to  fund  its
capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months. 
  
The ability of the Company to emerge from the exploration stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to
continue operations, explore and develop the Property and the discovery, development and sale of ore reserves. 
  
As  discussed  in  note  5,  the  Company  is  in  default  on  its  option  payments  and  annual  exploration  and  development  work.  If  the  option  is
terminated, the Company would have no operating business. 
  
In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. 
  
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
  
8. Subsequent Events 
  
The Company has evaluated subsequent events after November 30, 2013, through the date of this report, and determined there are no additional
items to disclose.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
  
None. 
  
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
  
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  
As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer,
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, management concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the date of filing this report applicable for the period covered by this report. 
  
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  
Our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) is a process that, under 
the  supervision  of  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  was
designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions
of  our  assets;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  our  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with
authorizations  of  our  management;  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  the  unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As of November 30, 2013, under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, we concluded that we
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2013, based on those criteria. 
  
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

been involved in any transactions with us or any of our directors, executive officers, affiliates or associates which are required to be disclosed
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
  
Code of Ethics 
  
We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer
or controller, or persons performing similar functions, because we have not yet finalized the content of such a code. Companies whose equity
securities are listed for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board are not currently required to implement a code of ethics. 
  
Director Nominees 
  
There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. 
  
Audit Committee
On September 30, 2013, we established an audit committee and appointed Khurram Shroff as the sole member of the committee. Mr. Shroff is
not an independent member of the committee pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and National Instrument 52-110 of the Canadian 
Securities  Administrators  (“NI  52-110”),  since  he  is  our  sole  executive  officer.  The  Board  of  Directors  adopted  a  charter  for  the  audit
committee on September 30, 2013, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report. 
  
The audit committee is responsible for reviewing both our interim and annual financial statements. For the purposes of performing their duties,
the members of the audit committee have the right, at all times, to inspect all our books and financial records and discuss with management and
our auditors any accounts, records and matters relating to our financial statements. The audit committee is required to meet periodically with
management and annually with our auditors. 
  
Our Board of Directors has determined that we do not presently need an audit committee financial expert on our Board of Directors carrying out
the duties of the audit committee. Our Board of Directors has determined that the cost of hiring a financial expert to act as one of our directors
and to be a member of the audit committee or otherwise perform audit committee functions outweighs the benefits of having a financial expert
on the Board.

Regulation S-K we have omitted all tables and columns since no compensation has been awarded to, earned by, or paid to these individuals. 
  
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 
  
As of November 30, 2013, we did not have any outstanding equity awards.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 
  
The  following  table  sets  forth  certain  information  regarding  our  common  stock  beneficially  owned  as  of  March  14,  2014  for  (i)  each
stockholder known to be the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, (ii) each of our officers and directors
and  (iii)  our  officers  and  directors  as  a  group.  A  person  is  considered  to  beneficially  own  any  shares  over  which  such  person,  directly  or
indirectly, exercises sole or shared voting or investment power, or over which such person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership at any
time within 60 days through an exercise of stock options or warrants or otherwise. Unless otherwise indicated, voting and investment power
relating to the shares shown in the table for our officers and directors is exercised solely by the beneficial owner thereof. 
  
For the purposes of this table, a person or group of persons is deemed to have “beneficial ownership” of any shares of our common stock that 
such person has the right to acquire within 60 days. For the purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding shares of our common stock
held by each person or group of persons named above, any shares that such person or persons has the right to acquire within 60 days is deemed
to  be  outstanding,  but  is  not  deemed  to  be  outstanding  for  the  purpose  of  computing  the  percentage  ownership  of  any  other  person.  The
inclusion herein of any shares listed as beneficially owned does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership.

(3)
Based on 294,400,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 14, 2014.
 
Khurram Shroff is our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary, Treasurer
and sole director.
 
Mauro Baessato was our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director from our
inception until September 30, 2013.
Changes in Control 
  
As of November 30, 2013, we were not aware of any arrangements, including any pledge by any person of our securities, the operation of
which may at a subsequent date result in a change in our control. 
  
Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 
  
We have not entered into any transactions with our officers, directors, persons nominated for these positions, beneficial owners of 5% or more
of our common stock, or family members of those persons wherein the amount involved in the transaction or a series of similar transactions
exceeded the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our total assets for the last two fiscal years. 
  
Director Independence 
  
Because our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we currently use the definition in NASDAQ Listing Rule
5605(a)(2) for determining director independence, which provides that an “independent director” is a person other than an executive officer or 
employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company’s Board of Directors, would 
interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a
director cannot be considered independent if:
● the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company;
 
● the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period
of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including,
among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);
● a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company;
 
● the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which
the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5%
of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);

● the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three
years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or
● the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company’s outside auditor, or at any time during the past
three years was a partner or employee of the company’s outside auditor, and who worked on the company’s audit.
We have determined that our sole director does not meet this definition of independence due to the fact that he is also our sole executive officer.
  
We do not currently have a separately designated nominating or compensation committee. 
  
NI 52-110 
  
We are a reporting issuer in the Province of British Columbia. NI 52-110 requires us, as a venture issuer, to disclose in our annual report certain
information concerning the constitution of our audit committee and our relationship with our independent auditor. As defined in NI 52-110, 
Khurram Shroff is not an independent director. A description of the education and experience of Mr. Shroff that is relevant to the performance
of his responsibilities as an audit committee member is included in Item 10 of this annual report. 
  
Mr. Shroff is not “financially literate” as defined in NI 52-110. 
  
Since the commencement of our most recently completed financial year, our Board of Directors has not failed to adopt a recommendation of the
audit committee to nominate or compensate an external auditor. 
  
Since the commencement of our most recently completed financial year, we have not relied on the exemptions contained in sections 2.4 or 8 of
NI  52-110.  Section  2.4  (De  Minimis  Non-audit  Services)  provides  an  exemption  from  the  requirement  that  the  audit  committee  must  pre-
approve all non-audit services to be provided by the auditor, where the total amount of fees related to the non-audit services are not expected to 
exceed 5% of the total fees payable to the auditor in the fiscal year in which the non-audit services were provided. Section 8 (Exemptions) 
permits us to apply to a securities regulatory authority for an exemption from the requirements of NI 52-110 in whole or in part. 
  
Our audit committee has adopted specific policies and procedures for the engagement of non-audit services as set out in the audit committee 
charter filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report. 
  
National Instrument 58-101 
  
We are a reporting issuer in the Province of British Columbia. National Instrument 58-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators requires 
us, as a venture issuer, to disclose in our annual report certain information concerning corporate governance disclosure. 
  
Board of Directors 
  
Our Board of Directors currently consists of one director, Khurram Shroff. We have determined that Mr. Shroff is not independent as that term
is defined in NI 52-110 due to the fact that he is our sole executive officer. 
  
Directorships 
  
Our sole director is not currently a director of any other reporting issuer (or the equivalent in a foreign jurisdiction). 
  
Orientation and Continuing Education 
  
We have an informal process to orient and educate new recruits to our Board of Directors regarding their role on the Board and our committees,
as well as the nature and operations of our business. This process provides for an orientation with key members of management, and further
provides access to materials necessary to inform them of the information required to carry out their responsibilities as a member of our Board of
Directors. This information includes our most recent budget approved by the Board of Directors, our most recent annual report, our audited
financial statements and copies of our interim financial statements. 
  
The  Board  does  not  provide  continuing  education  for  our  directors.  Each  director  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the  skills  and  knowledge
necessary to meet their obligations as a director.

Ethical Business Conduct 
  
Our Board of Directors does not take any formal steps to encourage and promote a culture of ethical business conduct as it has found that the
fiduciary duties placed on individual directors by our governing corporate legislation and the common law have been sufficient to ensure that
the Board operates independently of management and in our best interests. 
  
Nomination of Directors 
  
Our  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for  identifying  new  director  nominees.  In  identifying  candidates  for  the  Board,  the  Board  takes  into
account all factors it considers appropriate, which may include strength of character, mature judgment, career specialization, relevant technical
skills, diversity and the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board. As part of the process, our Board of Directors,
together  with  management,  is  responsible  for  conducting  background  searches  and  is  empowered  to  retain  search  firms  to  assist  in  the
nomination process. Once candidates have gone through a screening process and met with the existing directors, they may be formally put
forward as nominees for approval by the Board. 
  
Compensation 
  
Our Board of Directors plans to conduct reviews with regard to directors’ compensation once a year. To make its recommendation on directors’
compensation, the Board will take into account the types of compensation and the amounts paid to directors of comparable publicly traded
companies whose stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. 
  
Assessments 
  
Our  Board  of  Directors  intends  for  individual  director  assessments  to  be  conducted  by  other  directors,  taking  into  account  each  director’s 
contributions at Board meetings, service on committees, experience base, and their general ability to contribute to one or more of our major
needs. However, due to our stage of development and our need to deal with other urgent priorities, the Board has not yet implemented such a
process of assessment.

Audit and Non-Audit Fees 
  
The following table sets forth the fees for professional audit services and the fees billed for other services rendered by our auditors, Anderson
Bradshaw PLLC, in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the years ended November 30, 2013 and 2012 as well as reviews

performance of the audit review of our financial statements. “Tax fees” are fees billed by our auditors for professional services rendered for tax

categories. 
  
Policy on Pre-Approval 
  
Since our inception, our Board of Directors, performing the duties of the audit committee, has reviewed all audit and non-audit related fees at 
least annually. The Board, acting as the audit committee, pre-approved all audit related services for the year ended November 30, 2013.
