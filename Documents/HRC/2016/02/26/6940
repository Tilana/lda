High Commissioner will be doubled by 2010,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation</i> that the unearmarked contributions of donors are on the

<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner in this regard to provide all States with adequate<b>

</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reiterates</i> the need to ensure that all necessary financial, material and personnel

out its mandates efficiently, effectively and expeditiously;  
</p>

appropriate bodies, funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also calls upon</i> the High Commissioner to continue to strengthen the management 
structure of her Office, including human resource management, and to improve the 
responsiveness of her Office in all priority areas, especially economic, social and cultural rights, 
which require particular research and analytical capacity;<b>  
</b></p>
<p> 12.<b> </b><i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to enhance international cooperation for the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of all human rights and to engage in a dialogue with all Governments 
in the implementation of her mandate with a view to securing respect for all human rights; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 13. <i>Declares</i> that advisory services and technical cooperation provided at the request 
of Governments with a view to developing national capacities and national ownership in the field 
of human rights constitute one of the most efficient and effective means of promoting and 
protecting all human rights and democracy;<b>  
</b></p>

United Nations regular budget for advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of 
human rights;

recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit with a view to improving the geographic balance

in consultation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
proposals to address the imbalance in the geographic distribution of the staff in that Office; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Again invites</i> the High Commissioner to submit information pursuant to the 
present resolution in her annual report to the Council;
