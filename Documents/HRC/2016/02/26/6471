<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> <i>also</i> by the rights of all peoples to self-defence and self-determination and the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by the use of force, as enshrined in the Charter of the 
United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Affirming also</i> the applicability of international human rights law to the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the Israeli military attacks and incursions in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied Gaza Strip, constitute grave violations of 
international humanitarian law and of the human rights of the Palestinian people therein and 
undermine international efforts, including the Annapolis Conference and the Paris International 
Donors&#8217; Conference for the Palestinian State, aimed at invigorating the peace process and 
establishing a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State by the end 
of 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that the recent Israeli attacks and incursions in the occupied Gaza Strip 
have led to a considerable loss of life and injuries among Palestinian civilians, including women, 
children and infants,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns </i>the persistent Israeli military attacks and incursions in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied Gaza Strip, which resulted in 
the loss of more than 125 lives and hundreds of injuries among Palestinian civilians, including 
women, children and infants; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses</i> its shock at the Israeli bombardment of Palestinian homes and the killing 
of civilians therein and at the Israeli policy of inflicting collective punishment against the 
civilian population, which constitute a war crime, and calls for bringing the perpetrators to 
justice; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> the immediate cessation of all Israeli military attacks throughout the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory and the firing of crude rockets by Palestinian combatants, which 
resulted in the loss of two civilian lives and some injuries in southern Israel; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also calls for</i> urgent international action to put an immediate end to the grave 
violations committed by the occupying Power, Israel, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including the series of incessant and repeated Israeli military attacks and incursions therein and 
the siege of the occupied Gaza Strip;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 5. <i>Reiterates </i>its calls for immediate protection of the Palestinian people in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory in compliance with international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> all parties concerned to respect the rules of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law and to refrain from violence against civilian populations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the 
Council, at its next session, on the progress made in the implementation of the present resolution.
