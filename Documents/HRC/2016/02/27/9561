<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
visited Ukraine from 22 to 27 October 2006.  His visit focused on the capital city, Kiev, and 
surrounding areas. 
</p>
<p> Ukraine is living through a historical moment of transformation and challenges and finds 
itself at a crossroad, not only politically - deciding which direction to take towards Europe or the 
Russian Federation - but also in terms of how it considers the protection of its future citizens,  
today&#8217;s children. 
</p>
<p> Although Ukraine can register changes and plenty of good news in child protection in the 
last years such as a series of laws and provisions on children&#8217;s rights, a number of national action 
plans and programmes which represent road maps for the implementation of policies on 
children&#8217;s rights, at the same time other problems affecting children are not being adequately 
addressed, notably trafficking, child prostitution and pornography. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the high number of persons leaving the country for 
prospects of a better future abroad, as the statistics on the decline of population have shown.  Social 
exclusion, discrimination and stigmatization combine together to act as contributing factors and 
root causes of vulnerability to trafficking and sexual exploitation.  The following groups are 
exposed to higher risks:  children from dysfunctional and poor families with a low level of 
education, street children, victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence, children in institutions 
or who recently left institutions. 
</p>
<p> Corruption is a problem at all levels of public administration and it undermines the 
enforcement of the law, the delivery of social services and the overall capacity of the State to 
prevent and redress human rights violations.  The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to address the problem firmly.  The Special Rapporteur also noticed the absence of a 
separate juvenile justice system and makes recommendations on the establishment of such a 
system, as well as other mechanisms to better protect children&#8217;s rights and combat trafficking of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the assumption many people continue 
to have that the State has to undertake, control and implement all social policies.  Besides, the 
numerous public actors involved in providing assistance and care to children lead to situations 
where multiplicity of competences and responsibilities jeopardize their ultimate goal because 
of the limitations of their mandates and for fear of intervening in the other spheres of 
competence. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur believes that the role of the State is to open possibilities and 
initiatives and generate policies in order to allow concerned actors such as non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), international organizations and civil society to contribute and become 
involved in the protection of children and minors.  This plurality of actions will not only ensure a  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>better future for the following generations but also strengthen democracy as a whole.  In this 
sense, it is of utmost importance that NGOs and private initiatives for protection of children&#8217;s 
rights be supported and funded by public funds and not get lost in the bureaucracy of the 
State and never reach those who are in need.  The Special Rapporteur has found out that 
private organizations working for the protection of children face enormous difficulties and 
challenges that jeopardize their capacities to reach those who need it, when, on the contrary, 
the State should encourage and support these initiatives since all should be working for the 
same goals. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur conducted a country mission to Ukraine from 22 
to 27 October 2006.  He would like to thank the Government of Ukraine for allowing him to 
undertake a fruitful visit.  The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the United Nations 
Office in Ukraine for its assistance in the organization of the agenda, and would also like to 
thank the Resident Coordinator and the agencies of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), 
especially United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and International Organization for 
Migration (IOM), for their interest in his visit. 
</p>
<p>2. The mission visited the capital city, Kiev, and its surroundings.  The Special Rapporteur 
had over 40 meetings and direct contact with more than 100 persons.  He met representatives of 
the government authorities and the judiciary.  In particular, he was honoured to meet with the 
Minister of Family, Youth and Sports, as well as with the Minister of Justice.  The Special 
Rapporteur also met with the Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Education 
and Science, as well as Labour and Social Policy.  The Special Rapporteur also met with 
representatives of several committees of the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) and judges from the 
Supreme and Constitutional Courts.  He also met with the Deputy Prosecutor-General and 
several police officials working in the fields of trafficking, young offenders and international 
cooperation (Interpol). 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation to the many 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as academics and research institutes he was 
able to meet.  He would like to thank them for their active role in the preparation of his visit and 
useful suggestions to the agenda. 
</p>
<p>4. In addition to meetings with public authorities and civil society, the Special Rapporteur 
visited several orphanages and shelters for children in difficult situations, and a rehabilitation 
facility for victims of trafficking run by IOM and local partners.  He also conducted field visits at 
night-time in places where prostitution takes place and where street children live. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>5. Ukraine is living a historical moment of transformation and challenges.  Fifteen years 
after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its access to independence, many achievements are 
to be acknowledged and much remains to be done in building and sustaining a democratic and 
equitable society.  The &#8220;Orange Revolution&#8221; which brought President Yushchenko to power in 
December 2004 brought along high hopes of structural changes and orientation towards 
European integration. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur hopes that his findings and recommendations will contribute to 
further enhance democratic reforms at a time when the country is undertaking profound 
structural changes. 
</p>
<p>7. Ukraine recently extended a standing invitation to thematic special procedures.  This 
facilitated this visit of the Special Rapporteur, the first visit of a special procedure mechanism 
established by the Commission on Human Rights, now replaced by the Human Rights Council.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur believes that the experience of this first visit will facilitate cross 
references between this report and future visits by Special Procedures assumed by the 
newly-established Human Rights Council and will strengthen the consistency of findings and 
ultimately result in a comprehensive set of recommendations that should be followed up, taking 
into account their interdependence. 
</p>
<p>8. The State party report presented by Ukraine to the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
in consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 12 of the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography,<b>1</b> as well as the Alternative Report prepared by Ukrainian NGOs<b>2</b> informed about 
the terms of reference of the visit. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>9. Ukraine is a party to six of the seven major human rights treaties, including the two 
International Covenants, the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination 
Against Women, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict.  Ukraine 
has accepted the procedures for individual complaints under CAT (Committee against Torture) 
and CERD (Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination).  Ukraine is also party to 
the ILO Conventions No. 138 (1998) and No. 182 (2001), the Convention for the suppression of 
traffic in women and children and the Protocol to amend the Convention for the suppression 
of traffic in women and children, and the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in 
Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others and its Final Protocol.  As well, 
Ukraine in 2000 ratified Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>10. Ukraine did not sign or ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty 
(a draft law for adherence to this Protocol is being prepared), the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, the United Nations Convention against International Organized 
Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime.

</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography prepared by

</p>
<p>11. Everyone is entitled, after exhausting all national remedies of legal protection, to appeal 
for the protection of his rights and freedoms to the international judicial institutions or to the 
appropriate organs of international organizations of which Ukraine is a member or in whose 
work it participates.  Thus, on 11 September 1997 the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Protocols Nos. 1, 2, 4, 7 and 11 to the 
Convention came into force for Ukraine, making it possible for Ukrainian citizens to appeal to 
the Council of Europe and European Court of Human Rights if their justified demand for the 
restoration of their rights and lawful interests has not been satisfied through application to the 
national mechanisms for their protection. 
</p>
<p>12. In terms of bilateral cooperation, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has 
prepared 14 intergovernmental agreements on cooperation against organized crime that regulate, 
inter alia, human trafficking and illegal migration.  These include agreements with the 
Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Israel, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Sweden and Turkey.  
Actions to combat human trafficking are regulated by interdepartmental agreements.  From 1998 
to 2003 such agreements were signed with the Czech Republic, The former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and on 
cooperation against organized crime and especially human trafficking with Greece. 
</p>
<p>13. The protection of children and youth is enshrined in the Constitution of 1996 which is the 
underlying basis assuring the rights of children.  Pursuant to article 52 of the Constitution, 
children have equal rights regardless of their origin and whether or not they were born in 
wedlock.  The Constitution also has provisions recognizing the honour and dignity of human 
beings as the highest social values (art. 3), the protection of motherhood and childhood (art. 51).  
Articles 28 and 52 of the Constitution guarantee the rights of children to be protected against all 
forms of abuse or ill-treatment.  Pursuant to these articles, &#8220;no one should be subjected to 
harassment or cruel, inhuman or disrespectful treatment or punishment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. Ukrainian laws also provide for the protection of children from violence, guaranteeing all 
children the right to freedom, inviolability of their person and protection of their dignity.  The 
State is entrusted by the Ukrainian Child Protection Act with the responsibility for the protection 
of the child from all forms of physical and mental violence, cruel and degrading treatment, 
exploitation, including sexual abuse, including from their parents or persons acting in their stead, 
coercion into prostitution or begging, involvement in gambling, etc.  Protection of children from 
all forms of domestic violence is ensured by the Ukrainian Domestic Violence (Prevention) Act. 
The act is intended to protect the lawful rights and interests of children who have parents and 
live in families and of orphans deprived of parental care and raised in the families of tutors and 
guardians, or in adoptive families or family-type children&#8217;s homes, in all cases where violence is 
enacted against them or where there is a real threat of such violence. 
</p>
<p>15. The Ukrainian Criminal Code mentions the elements indicating the commission of an 
offence in the activities of adults relating to trafficking in children, child prostitution and child 
pornography.  Article 149 defines exploitation of people.  Exploitation in this article covers all 
forms of sexual exploitation in the pornography business, forced labour or the forced provision 
of services, slavery or slavery-like practices, holding persons against their will, luring into debt </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>bondage, the removal of organs, the conduct of experiments on persons without their consent, 
adoption for pecuniary gain, forced pregnancy, involvement in criminal activities, use in armed 
conflicts.  Criminal liability may be incurred regardless of whether the actions were conducted 
with the use of fraud or blackmail or by taking advantage of the vulnerable situation of the 
persons concerned, with the threat or use of force or by abuse of official position, or were 
performed by persons on whom the victim was materially or otherwise dependent. 
</p>
<p>16. Article 303 of the Law on Prostitution or Coercion or Involvement in Prostitution 
prohibits the regular exercise of prostitution, the granting of sexual services, coercion and 
pimping for involvement in prostitution but is rarely applied in practice.  For minors, the age of 
sexual consent is not officially defined, although article 155 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code 
makes it an offence to have sexual relations with a person who has not attained sexual maturity.  
Persons under 14 are to be considered sexually immature, however, for minors aged between 14 
and 17, the question of sexual maturity will have to be decided on the basis of expert appraisal. 
</p>
<p>17. Article 301 of the Criminal Code refers to the &#8220;Importation, Creation, Sale and 
Distribution of Pornographic Items&#8221;.  It covers the importation into Ukraine of productions, 
pictures or any other pornographic item for sale or distribution, as well as the production of such 
materials and their distribution.  It also covers the use of underage persons to make such 
materials (picture-making or movie and video products, and software).  The penalties for 
committing related offences are terms of imprisonment from three to seven years. 
</p>
<p>18. Before 1996, the adoption of children by foreign citizens was not legally allowed in 
Ukraine.  Article 169 of the Criminal Code was elaborated to cover illegal actions regarding 
minors.  This article envisages responsibility for illegal mediation or any other illicit actions with 
regard to the adoption of a child, wardship, or education in families.  
</p>
<p>19. Recent legislative measures include the Ukrainian Protection of Children Act which 
entered into force on 6 June 2001, proclaiming the protection of children in Ukraine as a 
strategic priority of nationwide importance, and determining the underlying principles for the 
State&#8217;s policy in this area.  The Ukrainian Social Work with Children and Young People Act 
entered into force on 1 August 2001, it sets out the organizational and legal framework for social 
work with children and young people.  On 2 February 2005, the Organizational and Legal 
Conditions for the Social Protection of Orphans and Children Deprived of Parental Care 
(Implementation) Act entered into force, setting out the legal, organizational and social 
framework for State support for orphans and abandoned children. 
</p>
<p>20. Judicial proceedings involving minors as well as offences committed by minors are dealt 
with by the general Courts system, as no separate juvenile justice system has been established.  
The Special Rapporteur has been informed that penal responsibility for young offenders has been 
set at 14 years, and from this age a minor can legally be placed in a detention centre (although 
separated from adults until the age of majority at 18).  In order to take account of the child&#8217;s best 
interests, steps are being taken to establish the institution of court-appointed welfare officers and 
to set up juvenile courts for the consideration of cases relating to children&#8217;s rights.  The Supreme 
Court has recommended that the heads of local and appeal courts enlist the participation in such 
cases of judges who have at least three years experience of such work and specialize in the 
consideration of criminal cases of this type. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>IV.  INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, POLICIES 
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</b></p>
<p>21. The main responsibility for protection of children&#8217;s rights lies with the Ukrainian 
Ministry for Family, Youth and Sport which has extensive responsibility for shaping State policy 
with regard to the social and legal protection of children and crime prevention work.  The 
Ministry has the responsibility to ensure the application of the laws relating to protection of the 
rights of children, to coordinate the work of the juvenile affairs services and to develop proposals 
designed to improve the domestic legislation upholding the rights and interests of children and 
young people.  The social services centres under the auspices of this Ministry are in the front line 
of the system of protection of children&#8217;s rights, receiving complaints and reports about violation 
of children&#8217;s rights and providing social, psychological and medical assistance to child victims. 
</p>
<p>22. The Ukrainian Ministry for Family, Youth and Sport also has under its responsibility 
such bodies as the juvenile affairs services, various departments and offices dealing with families 
and young people and the social service centres for families, children and young people.  
Responsibility for coordinating and monitoring efforts to ensure the social protection of children 
from cruel treatment and exploitation rests with the juvenile affairs services run by the local 
authorities.  The juvenile affairs services ensure, amongst others, the following functions:  
keeping a register of children suffering from cruel treatment and of their families; coordinating 
the work of the education, health and internal affairs authorities aimed at preventing and warding 
off cases of cruel treatment of children; assistance to children suffering from cruel treatment and, 
where there is a threat of such cruel treatment, taking the necessary preventive measures; referral 
of children for monitoring by the health authorities. 
</p>
<p>23. The Ministry for Family, Youth and Sport also run shelters and reception centres for 
street and abandoned children.  These short- and medium-term facilities provide boarding 
facilities for children until a more permanent solution to their needs is found.  During their stay 
at these centres, children of school age will attend local neighbourhood schools. 
</p>
<p>24. The Ministry of Education and its services and institutions ensure that steps are being 
taken to uncover and prevent cases of children being recruited from educational establishments 
for prostitution and pornography, prevent trafficking in children and, if necessary, prosecute 
school employees, pupils and other persons who engage in cruelty against children.  Besides, the 
educational authorities are responsible for conducting prevention programmes at schools and 
together with parents prevent trafficking of children, child prostitution and pornography. 
</p>
<p>25. The Ministry of Education is also in charge of operating the orphanages for children 
without parents or who have been abandoned.  These long-term facilities provide all boarding 
and educational facilities for children from the age of 3 until 18.  In practice, a child can spend 
all his childhood and adolescence at the orphanage, sleeping, eating, attending school, playing 
sports and using other recreational facilities, and, if sick, being treated at the medical facility.  
Only when adopted (within the country or abroad) or when reaching the age of 18 does life 
outside the orphanage begin, with all the difficult adaptations resulting from leaving a sheltered 
environment and joining the outside world, with no more help or assistance.   </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>26. The Ministry of Health has under its auspices all public hospitals and clinics and it also 
runs several sanatoriums for sick and disabled children.  The health authorities also provide 
medical assistance to victims of trafficking, prostitution and pornography and to children who 
have been victims of violence.  Under Ukrainian law, all medical services in public health 
establishments are provided free of charge. 
</p>
<p>27. There are also some specialized institutions run by the services of the Ministry of Labour 
and Social Policy where children with disabilities (not necessarily orphans) are being cared for 
and given vocational training and apprentices&#8217; facilities.  The Ministry of Labour and Social 
Policy is also responsible for ensuring compliance with employment laws and regulations.  The 
Ministry and its labour inspectors are in charge of ensuring that children are not illegally 
employed or exploited.  The minimum age of employment with no limitations is set at 16 years, 
before that a child may, starting at 14 years, work part-time if it is related to his studies and 
starting at 15 years with authorization of the parents or guardians.   
</p>
<p>28. Finally, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, whose terms of reference encompass the law 
enforcement agencies, such as the National Police, is responsible for receiving information about 
cases of cruelty against children, including cases of trafficking in children and their involvement 
in prostitution and pornography, taking steps to bring the perpetrators to justice, and if necessary, 
arranging the urgent removal of children from families, together with the juvenile affairs 
services, who decide on arrangements for future care of the child.  In dealing with cases of 
violations of children&#8217;s rights, employees of the criminal police responsible for minors are 
obliged to keep the following persons informed:  those filing the original complaint, the juvenile 
affairs services, the child&#8217;s parents or persons acting on their behalf, and if necessary the General 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office.  Finally, the Ministry of Justice, in conformity with relevant legislation, is 
competent to examine questions arising from international law norms and international 
agreements, including those in regard to the protection of the rights of the child and of human 
rights and freedoms.  It elaborates, upon request of the Government or on its own initiative, draft 
laws or other legal documents in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>29. The different law enforcement organs in Ukraine are the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and the different police and public security agencies.  The Ukrainian 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is a unified system which is responsible for prosecuting on behalf of the 
State in the courts, representing the interests of the citizen or the State in the courts in the cases 
specified by law, supervising compliance with the law by the organs carrying out operational 
investigative activities, inquiries and pretrial investigation, supervising compliance with the law 
in the implementation of court decisions in criminal cases and in the application of other 
measures of a coercive nature connected with restrictions on citizens&#8217; personal freedom.   
</p>
<p><b>V.  POSITIVE ASPECTS:  SOME POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES 
</b></p>
<p>30. Several programmes for victims of trafficking, including prostitution are active in 
addressing trafficking from different angles - prevention, assistance and reintegration.  The 
Special Rapporteur also witnessed several programmes focusing on children, especially on 
abandoned or street children and others.  The Special Rapporteur was also made aware of several 
policies by different governmental actors to combat trafficking in persons, child prostitution and 
child pornography. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>31. In the area of law enforcement, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, through the 
Anti-Trafficking Section and the National Bureau of Interpol, is working hard to counter 
traffickers of human beings.  A special unit to counter human trafficking was set up in 2005, 
which resulted in the number of cases of trafficking in persons being investigated rising from 2 
in 1998 to 415 in 2005.  Since the beginning of 2006, 274 cases have been investigated.<b>3</b>  
Although most victims of trafficking in persons were adults, in 2005 35 minors were found 
abroad by law enforcement agencies and returned to Ukraine.  As a general pattern, the main 
destinations for trafficked persons are Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (these two countries 
mostly for sex trafficking) and the Russian Federation (mostly for labour exploitation).  These 
investigations resulted in the disbandment of 39 organized criminal groups in 2005, 32 for 
pimping activities and 7 for pornography.   
</p>
<p>32. Concerning child pornography, the National Bureau of Interpol is working together with 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States of America in a special group 
monitoring the Internet.  Ukraine also ratified the Convention on Cybercrime.  The different 
agencies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are also increasing their cooperation with 
international agencies fighting criminality, such as Europol and Interpol.  The Special 
Rapporteur has had an excellent impression from the work of these anti-trafficking and Interpol 
brigades, which have demonstrated very serious competences and effective results.<b>4</b>  It is 
encouraging to see a young generation of qualified and enthusiastic professionals working 
effectively to combat trafficking in persons and crimes against children and to ensure that those 
responsible for this contemporary form of slavery are brought to justice. 
33. The Special Rapporteur was also deeply impressed by the work undertaken by the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM).  The programme developed by IOM to counter 
trafficking has been in place since 1998 and incorporates a systematic approach focusing on the 
three phases of this phenomenon:  prevention by means of developing public awareness 
campaigns and disseminating the information throughout the country; prosecution and 
criminalization by means of encouraging law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to act more 
effectively to combat these crimes and the traffickers; and protection and reintegration by means 
of providing assistance and support to victims of trafficking returning to Ukraine, both directly 
and with the help of NGOs. 
</p>
<p>34. In this context, the Special Rapporteur visited the Rehabilitation Centre for victims of 
trafficking in Kiev, which consists of medical and psychosocial facilities where victims of 
trafficking, upon their return to Ukraine after they escape sexual or labour exploitation abroad, 
arrive and receive medical treatment and counselling.  This particular rehabilitation centre has

<p>been in place since 2002 and has since then assisted over 900 victims of trafficking.<b>5</b>  Most of the 
victims of trafficking have been referred to the IOM Rehabilitation Centre in the following ways:  
when they were trafficked in a foreign country, the victims were identified as Ukrainians by the 
consulate of Ukraine through the local IOM office and returned with assistance to their country, 
where they were taken care of immediately after their arrival at this rehabilitation centre.  There 
they received medical and psychological assistance which can last from a few weeks to several 
months depending on their condition and needs.  After this initial stage, IOM and its partner 
NGOs establish a reintegration plan, where a local NGO is assigned to monitor the education and 
career path of the victim of trafficking, offering educational and vocational training, legal and 
social support as well as financial support, if necessary.   
</p>
<p>35. Since 2000, over 3,000 victims of trafficking have received reintegration assistance from 
IOM and its partner NGOs, including the 900 victims who have been cared for at the 
rehabilitation centre in Kiev.  Out of these victims, 120 were minors at the time they were 
repatriated to Ukraine.  IOM also operates six other different shelters throughout Ukraine in 
various regions of the country.  Out of the total number of victims who have received these 
forms of assistance, a very high number (81 per cent) had been offered a stable employment 
position after one year of assistance in the programme.<b>6</b>  The Special Rapporteur was highly 
impressed by the professionalism and dedication of the medical and psychological team and also 
had the opportunity to speak privately with a former victim of trafficking, a minor at the time 
when she was trafficked out of the country, and he was comforted by her strength and courage 
and by the fact that she had, during her stay at the rehabilitation centre, developed a career path 
in order to be able to acquire the skills needed for the profession she wanted. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur also paid a visit to the international women&#8217;s rights centre 
&#8220;La Strada-Ukraine&#8221; in Kiev.  The main activities of La Strada include providing a broad range 
of assistance for trafficked persons; maintaining a &#8220;Hot line&#8221; for emergency telephone 
assistance; analysing the problem of violence against women; providing expertise on legislation 
in an advisory capacity concerning women&#8217;s status in Ukraine; conducting educational 
programmes among youth on the problem of women&#8217;s rights; preventing trafficking in women 
and other kinds of violence and exploitation and cooperation with mass media; distributing the 
information about these issues.<b>7</b>  La Strada also cooperated with Ukraine&#8217;s Parliament in 
discussions and adoption of the law against trafficking in women (article 124 of Ukraine&#8217;s 
Criminal Code).  The Ministries of Family and Youth, Social Services, and Education have been 
cooperating with La Strada in the fight against trafficking.  Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, with the help of information provided by La Strada, has been able to assist victims of 
trafficking abroad in returning to Ukraine.

</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur has had the opportunity to visit a shelter for minors run by the 
Service for Minors of the Kiev City Administration on the outskirts of the city.  This shelter has 
different facilities for boys and girls.  Accommodation and meals are provided in the shelter, as 
well as a range of cultural and sports activities.  The children also attend local schools.  At the 
time of visit, there were about 12 boys and 20 girls staying at this facility, most of them coming 
from outside of Kiev, having been abandoned by their parents or having run away from violent 
or poor families.  The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the professionalism and dedication 
of the staff, especially by the director of the Service for Minors of the municipality of Kiev and 
the director of this shelter.  The affection that the children showed for them and their enthusiasm 
with which they showed the Special Rapporteur around the facility and talked openly about the 
problems and challenges they faced has to be praised.  This facility, which was of a human scale, 
offered the children a roof, food and the opportunity to attend school after they suffered such a 
horrendous experience of having been abandoned by their parents or having had to flee a violent 
or miserable household.   
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur also visited a private daytime centre, &#8220;Beth Miriam&#8221;, for children 
from fragile families, run by different religious organizations such as Christian Solidarity 
International and the association &#8220;Triumph of Heart&#8221;, with the help of donations from Western 
European countries.  Although at this time there were no clear laws regulating private shelters 
for children, which in fact made it impossible for children to be accommodated at the centre, the 
different partners running this brand new centre are offering educational and social activities to 
the children enrolled in their programme, such as help with homework, computer facilities, a 
library and some sport activities.  The parents are informed of all these activities and have agreed 
to their children&#8217;s involvement at the centre which also serves meals to the children who 
continue to live with their families and attend public schools in their neighbourhoods.  The 
educators would like to be able to have orphans or street children stay at the centre and provide 
them with all their facilities, something the current law prohibits at the moment, since the State 
assumes all responsibility and competence for orphans and street children.   
</p>
<p>39. Finally, the Special Rapporteur noticed that the amount of foreign aid provided a 
favourable ground for NGOs to develop, especially in the area of social services, however far 
less so in advocacy, and that it was mostly on limited-time projects.  When this foreign aid 
declines, the survival of many NGOs will be put at risk.  Their access to public funds is still quite 
limited, and so is the collaboration between public authorities and civil society on social matters.  
The cultural heritage of a State that used to be the only actor in all spheres is still present and 
affects a fully fruitful relationship between public authorities and civil society.  This is also valid 
for the business sector, whose involvement in social initiatives is still very limited.  Trade unions 
may be another actor with potential to be a vocal advocate for children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  MAJOR CONCERNS 
</b></p>
<p>40. The collapse of the Soviet system with its model of full State control and funding of all 
activities, including social and family matters, has led to a radical reconstruction of the social 
base of Ukrainian society as it faced the challenge of transition from a planned economy to a 
market one.  Crime and violence, and aggression towards children are nowadays realities that 
plague countries such as Ukraine.  The nature of this social transformation - the scale, trends, 
depth and means by which change has occurred, has greatly affected all levels of Ukrainian 
society.   </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Children deprived of parental care 
</b></p>
<p>41. Today there are about 100,000 children in Ukraine in orphanages or deprived of parental 
care.<b>8</b>  The vast majority of them are being brought up in State institutions and other shelters and 
houses of children.  A few of them (less than 2,000) are brought up in foster families and 
adopted.  State institutions and children&#8217;s homes, together with socially disadvantaged families, 
are the main cause of homelessness of children.  In 2005, the number of such children deprived 
of parental care increased up to 50,000.  The numerous orphanages and boarding facilities for 
orphans or abandoned children see to it that the State ensures protection for the most vulnerable 
persons in society.   
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur has serious doubts that institutions where 100 to 200 children 
grow and live together is the best form, since nobody has so many brothers and sisters.  This 
creates a tremendous difficulty for each child when he attends the local school, plays with other 
children of the neighbourhood and especially when he reaches adult age and leaves the 
institution for the outside world.  The Special Rapporteur remains of the opinion that orphanages 
are anti-natural and artificial institutions and as such should be as small as possible so as to be 
able to create an environment where each child could grow and develop the tools that will allow 
him or her to become a fully integrated adult in tomorrow&#8217;s society.  Even if children are living 
and receiving education in the State institutions, nobody can say that their future is safe and well 
provided for.  The education level at these institutions has proven not to be high; as a rule, the 
children afterwards do not enter higher education institutions.  Even if there were quotas for 
those children at the higher education institutions, most of them would have no capacity for 
continuing education. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur has been made aware that the procedures regarding adoptions, 
especially international adoption, are lengthy and complicated.  Although the authorities have 
privileged adoption within the country - the number of Ukrainian families adopting children 
from orphanages has doubled - the demand for international adoption remains high with 
2,500 children having left the country in 2005.<b>9</b>  The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that, 
although adoption laws must introduce safeguards in the criteria for adoption, particularly 
outside the country, it is always in the best interests of a child to be brought up in a family which 
has clearly expressed the will to raise children rather than at an orphanage where they would be 
deprived of parental care.  The Special Rapporteur welcomes new legislation on adoption that is 
being prepared as a firm reaction to irregularities and distortions of the past and as a conducive 
measure to develop alternatives inside the country in the best interests of children. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur would like to underscore that the initiatives and experience 
of private actors and NGOs in the protection of children should be encouraged and the private 
sector should become involved and play a greater role so as to offer these children career 
opportunities and training programmes, and the governmental policy aimed at 
deinstitutionalization of State institutions should also be continued.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Street children 
</b></p>
<p>45. The phenomenon of children living in the streets started with the collapse of the Soviet 
State system in the early 1990s when all facilities such as orphanages, boarding schools and 
hospitals were left with very little or no financial resources.  At the same time, many families 
lost jobs, experienced a decline in income, and the pauperization of whole sectors of society, as 
well as of the whole regions, was under way.  This brutal phenomenon led to alcoholism, 
domestic violence and abuses against children in many families; as a result many children and 
minors left their homes and broken families in search of a better future.  Children also end up in 
the streets after fleeing from State institutions and families, and often they try to avoid violence 
and abuse.  They also easily fall victims to traffickers and pimps involved in prostitution and 
pornography.  The number of street children reached its peak in the mid-1990s, and since the 
country&#8217;s economy started to grow again, the number has remained the same over the years.   
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur has had the opportunity to meet, through various NGOs, with 
minors and young adults living in the street.  The Special Rapporteur also visited shelters where 
children found abandoned on the street are taken care of by the social services.  The Special 
Rapporteur has been made aware by several researchers and academics that the number of street 
children or children in a vulnerable situation which can turn them into street children, although 
not verified, reaches approximately 12,000 in Kiev alone.  Street children face enormous 
difficulties such as a complete lack of resources, food and shelter, vulnerability to abuses by 
other street children and often by police officials.  A large number of street children become 
addicted to alcohol and drugs, and in order to buy these products or just to be able to survive, 
resort to prostitution and become victims of forced labour.  Although there is no official statistics 
on street children, researchers estimate that at least one third of these persons are being sexually 
exploited.  Concern has also been raised about the total lack of health protection, especially 
HIV/AIDS treatment amongst this very vulnerable population group. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur has expressed his great concern about the absence of effective 
governmental policies with respect to this particularly vulnerable sector of society.  The 
allocation of resources to tackle this problem should be a priority.  The Special Rapporteur finds 
also extremely worrying that, according to studies, only 10 per cent of the parents of children 
who run away from home try to find their children, in other words, 90 per cent of parents of such 
children take no action to recover their &#8220;missing&#8221; children.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>48. The trafficking in children through and from Ukraine is a very big problem and a severe 
reality which needs profound solutions and innovative ways of combating and preventing it.  
According to the data provided by IOM, 10 per cent of all victims of trafficking who are known

</p>
<p>to return to Ukraine, either voluntarily or not, are aged between 13 and 18.  Most of them are 
girls trafficked into sexual exploitation.  Boys are also part of child trafficking mostly as cheap 
labour (for unskilled jobs or to peddle drugs).  Children are generally lured into trafficking, both 
domestic and cross-border.  For those trafficked internally, the use of force is widespread.  The 
recruitment of children into cross-border trafficking generally involves acquaintances and friends 
of the children; children trafficked internally are often victims of a &#8220;deal&#8221; or mediation by a 
family member, often a parent. 
</p>
<p>49. In general, the trafficked girls are sent to the Russian Federation, Turkey, Poland, 
the Czech Republic, Italy and the United Arab Emirates.  The boys are sent to the 
Russian Federation, Poland, Moldova, Turkey and Romania.  Half of the children trafficked 
across borders go to neighbouring countries (the Russian Federation, Moldova); the rest go to 
urban centres in countries outside the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).  The exact 
destination of the child depends on where the child came from and may vary from region to 
region.  The children trafficked across borders are exploited in street-vending, domestic labour, 
agriculture, dancing, as waiters/waitresses, or they provide sexual services.  Most often, the 
children are expected to dance, beg or provide sexual services regardless of what they had 
anticipated doing.   
</p>
<p>50. Furthermore, many of the children trafficked across borders are often trafficked within 
the country too.  One characteristic of child trafficking in Ukraine is that in most cases children 
are trafficked within the country.  Children trafficked internally are also expected to provide 
sexual services or to beg, despite promises of work as cleaners, waiters or hawkers. 
</p>
<p>51. The recruitment for trafficking often takes place when traffickers, to force their victims to 
work, trap children in debt bondage:  to pay off the costs of their trip and related &#8220;services&#8221; such 
as food and accommodation, the children must stay and work.  Repayment of debt is also given 
as the reason why most of the children trafficked received no payment for the work they do, or 
only part of it.  And this is despite the fact that children are obliged to work long hours (often 
eight hours a day) and frequently at night.  They have no way of negotiating conditions and are 
involved in forced labour.  In the majority of cases, trafficked children are deprived of freedom 
of movement, the possibility of communicating with others and contacting people close to them.  
They are under the constant surveillance of their employers and are seldom left alone, living and 
working with other children.  Opportunities to escape are rare. 
</p>
<p>52. According to statistics provided by IOM, as of 30 June 2006 120 unaccompanied 
children were repatriated from nine countries, mostly from the Russian Federation, Turkey and 
Poland.  The Special Rapporteur has been made aware of the number of victims being trafficked both 
outside the country and within Ukraine.  Among these persons, about 10 per cent were minors at the 
time they were lured into being trafficked, whether for sexual or forced labour purposes.  The Special 
Rapporteur, although acknowledging the very useful efforts undertaken by IOM and its partner NGOs 
in providing assistance to victims of trafficking, remains nevertheless concerned that the figure of 
2,345 persons assisted since 2000 is just a tip of the iceberg and that many victims remain unaccounted 
for and unassisted abroad or when they return to Ukraine. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the high number of persons leaving the country 
for prospects of a better future abroad, as the statistics on the decline of population have shown.  The 
root causes of this emigration process are the collapse of the Soviet State system as well as the 
temptation of the West with its consumer societies, higher wages and better living conditions.  All this 
facilitates the recruitment of potential victims of trafficking, and problems faced by numerous children 
in violent and alcoholic families increase their vulnerability in terms of being lured by better life 
conditions elsewhere. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Child prostitution and pornography 
</b></p>
<p>54. The prostitution of children is one form of abuse of children in sexual activities for 
remuneration or otherwise.  Generally, it means that a party benefits from a commercial 
transaction in which a child is made available for sexual services involving either a pimp or an 
abuser who negotiates directly with the minor.  The Special Rapporteur has been made aware 
that child prostitution in Ukraine has increased in recent years.  According to a survey by the 
Ukrainian Institute of Social Studies, in 2001-2002 among females who engaged in commercial 
sex 11 per cent were minors of 12 to 15 years, while 20 per cent were minors of 16 to 17 years.<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>The focus group members also spoke of 10-year-old girls being forced into prostitution.  People 
engaged in the sex industry tend to keep strict secrecy that considerably complicates 
communication with them in the course of conducting a sociological survey.  This group, 
including minors, paid fines for engaging in prostitution.  According to police records, 
5,300 people are involved in the prostitution business in Ukraine.<b>12</b>  Therefore, real figures 
regarding the number of minors engaged in the commercial sex sector are higher than the survey 
would have shown.   
</p>
<p>55. The age at which people first enter prostitution is not officially known, although statistics 
in surveys indicates that the age of &#8220;sexual debut&#8221; is declining.  This may be connected with the 
rapid expansion of communication technologies and the fact that young people receive mixed 
messages as the infiltration of Western consumer culture becomes stronger. 
</p>
<p>56. Concerning child pornography, the Special Rapporteur is also preoccupied by many 
examples shown to him that suggest that there is much evidence of the production, distribution 
and use of pornography in Ukraine, and that this criminal activity appears to be well organized.  
However, the extent to which children are used in the production of such materials is less clear, 
although the allegations received indicate a worrying trend.  Concerns were expressed that there 
was a major underground industry producing pornography with participation of adults, and in 
this light, it is evident that vulnerable children are also at risk.  Information has also been 
received regarding cases where parents make their children available to pornographers, while in 
other situations street children are lured into pornography by promises of reward.  As for the 
distribution of child pornography via Internet and Ukraine-based child pornography websites, 
there is little information on that matter.   
</p>
<p>

<p><b>12
</b>  See footnote 3 above. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned by these terrible phenomena affecting 
the most vulnerable persons in the society and by how exploiters, whether pimps, traffickers, 
producers of pornographic material and in some cases even parents, take advantage of these 
children for the most abhorrent activities.  The Special Rapporteur has learnt, through the main 
media and tourist information, about numerous advertisements of &#8220;marriage&#8221;, &#8220;dating&#8221; and all 
sorts of services catered to the visitors, which do not appear to be clearly regulated or controlled.  
With the lifting of visas for most Western-country visitors, the country is increasingly becoming 
a main destination for sex tourism, and the Special Rapproteur fears that minors are being 
exploited in these developing activities.   
</p>
<p><b>E.  Young offenders 
</b></p>
<p>58. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur found that in Ukraine no separate juvenile justice 
systems existed for young offenders or minors in conflict with the law.  Offences committed by 
minors are treated according to the same procedures as those committed by adults, both at the 
phase of investigation and trial.  From 14 years onwards, a minor can be detained, whether at a 
police station for 48 hours following arrest, at a remand centre while awaiting trial, or at prison 
after being convicted.  Although there are separate prison facilities for minors who have been 
convicted to sentences of imprisonment for serious crimes, there are no such separate facilities at 
the initial arrest phase (police stations, investigation centres) and while awaiting trial (remand 
centres).  Although authorities have assured that minors are always separated from adults while 
being detained at these facilities, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the risks of abuses 
for these minors in conflict with the law, especially since they may face detention from such an 
early age as 14. 
</p>
<p>59. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned that in Ukraine, although it has 
over the last 15 years changed a significant number of its laws and adapted them to the 
international standards, a separate juvenile justice system has not yet been put into place.  
Although the Special Rapporteur has been assured that in judicial proceedings involving young 
offenders the Government intends to appoint welfare officers in courts to protect the minors&#8217; 
interests and that the Supreme Court has issued a directive recommending that in cases involving 
minor offenders judges with at least three years of work in this field should be appointed to hear 
such cases, the establishment of a separate juvenile justice system in conformity with 
international standards should be a priority.   
</p>
<p><b>F.  Values and mentalities </b></p>
<p>60. As discussed earlier, Ukraine is a country in transition, not only politically and 
economically, but perhaps more importantly in terms of cultural values and mentalities.  
Although dramatic changes have taken place since the collapse of the State Soviet system, 
mentalities and values need much more than merely a decade or so to evolve.  Moreover, for 
more than 70 years, and even longer, the country has been kept under tight rule and dissent was 
severely reprimanded.  As the Special Rapporteur learnt from a local source, &#8220;for decades 
people have been told that things were either forbidden or compulsory.  Nowadays, it is hard for 
them to take personal initiatives and get rid of this system of thought&#8221;. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>61. The attitude towards protection of children still reflects this mindset that the State knows 
what is best for the interests of children and assumes responsibility and control for their 
education, well-being and leisure activities, especially for children coming from problematic 
families or for those deprived of parental care.  Unfortunately, as the Special Rapporteur could 
notice, the State has given up for some time this role and is now unable to assume all these 
responsibilities alone.  The Special Rapporteur believes that other actors such as NGOs and the 
private sector have a role to play in the protection of children and in assuming responsibility in 
these new areas where they have been absent, they will contribute over the years to a gradual 
change in mentalities and values, as far as the role of the State and protection of children are 
concerned.   
</p>
<p><b>G.  Corruption </b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur heard about allegations of corruption in the State apparatus 
throughout his visit, which aroused his concern.  Often it was not NGOs, academics or even 
victims of trafficking or prostitution who evaluated this phenomenon in the most severe terms, 
but professionals working in the system themselves, such as police officials, lawyers and even 
some judges who had the most negative perception of some of their colleagues and of how this 
widespread phenomenon affects public administration. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur has been made aware of parents who have to pay their children&#8217;s 
teacher to ensure a positive result in examinations.  Similarly, in the health sector, giving some 
money to the doctor and nurses to &#8220;advance&#8221; in the waiting list for an appointment or to ensure 
that the doctor visits the patient at home in due course is a common practice, which is not even 
perceived as corruption.  The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Bar Association of 
Ukraine that half of the judges are involved in corruption practices.  Moreover, there exists a 
whole list of fixed prices to pay to court officials in order to speed up proceedings and even get 
issued a ruling in favour of the &#8220;contributing&#8221; party.  Several police officials involved in 
protection of children and young offenders have also claimed that many of their colleagues 
cannot survive on their regular low salary and thus have to complement it with &#8220;bribes&#8221; in order 
to ensure a decent standard of living.   
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about these widespread allegations that 
corruption undermines the enforcement of the law, the delivery of social services and the overall 
capacity of the State to prevent and redress human rights violations, especially in a period of 
political instability, such as Ukraine is experiencing now. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Multiplicity of actors involved in the protection of children 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur during his visit met with many different actors at the 
governmental level involved in the issues of protection of children.  Five different ministries are 
involved in just providing care and assistance to children:  the Ministry of Family and Youth, the 
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy as well 
as the Ministry of Internal Affairs, each being assigned a share of the responsibility.  
Furthermore, several committees of the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) are dealing with issues </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>and policies regarding protection of children.  This multiplicity of public actors involved in 
providing assistance and care to the most vulnerable and tomorrow&#8217;s citizens leads to situations 
where these actors cease to assume their responsibilities because of the limitations of their 
mandates and for fear of intervening in the mandates and responsibilities of others.  Eventually, 
as one observer of this situation summarized it, &#8220;when everyone is responsible, no one is 
responsible any more&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur would therefore recommend avoiding spreading responsibility 
for children&#8217;s issues over several actors and to limit this mandate to as few actors as possible, but 
at the same time to invest them with due power and render them accountable for the protection of 
children&#8217;s interests and rights. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>67. Ukraine is now at a crossroads and at this point it will have to build a new model of 
protection of children&#8217;s rights; otherwise the consequences will seriously affect the future 
generations.  Although the country has undertaken serious efforts in order to comply with the 
standards set forth in the international and European conventions relating to the protection of 
children, the slow progress made in reforming the social protection system leaves many children 
and adolescents vulnerable to trafficking and prostitution.  The lack of a coherent adoption 
policy, whether at the domestic or international level, remains a challenge for the country.  The 
good news is that there are many persons and organizations with motivation and good intentions 
that need to be encouraged and given the tools and possibilities to implement their ideas and 
projects. 
</p><p>68. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the high number of persons leaving the country for 
prospects of a better future abroad, as the statistics on the decline of population have shown.  Internal 
trafficking is overshadowed by its international aspects, which so far attracted most of the 
attention of authorities, media, the donors&#8217; community and organizations with expertise in this 
area.  Nevertheless, it is clear that internal trafficking opens doors to international trafficking, 
and no anti-trafficking strategy can be efficient if it does not address the problem internally, with 
adequate prevention policies and rehabilitation programmes for victims of internal trafficking 
that at present do not exist.  Also, the illegality of prostitution makes prostitutes, especially 
adolescents, more vulnerable to exploitation and abuses.   
</p>
<p>69. Social exclusion, discrimination and stigmatization combined together act as contributing 
factors and root causes of vulnerability to trafficking and sexual exploitation.  The following 
groups are exposed to higher risks:  children from dysfunctional and poor families with a low 
level of education, street children, victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence, children in 
State institutions for minors or who recently left such institutions.  The list is not exhaustive.  
Rural and economically disadvantaged areas are particularly affected by poverty and social 
exclusion, with lack of or limited access to primary social services, such as health and education.  
Preventive programmes targeting children and youth from poor and vulnerable neighbourhoods 
are very limited, and private initiatives are not encouraged by the State who still sees its role as 
the protector of children and provider of services. </p>

</p>
<p>70. Furthermore, corruption is widespread in the public administration, particularly in the 
judiciary and the law enforcement sectors, which greatly undermines the enforcement of the law, 
the delivery of social services and the overall capacity of the State to prevent and redress human 
rights violations.  The struggle against corruption should be seen as a national challenge since it 
affects all levels of public administration and generates multiple complications in the daily life of 
Ukrainians. 
</p>
<p>71. Even though everyone agrees that the model of full State control and funding of social 
and family matters has collapsed resulting in the problems we are now experiencing, such as the 
lack of initiative and responsibility before its citizens and members of civil society.  However, 
the State cannot, on the other hand, remain unconcerned by the difficulties its citizens are facing.  
The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the feeling many people continue to nourish 
that the State has to undertake, control and implement all social policies.  Besides, the 
multiplicity of public actors involved in providing assistance and care to children leads to 
situations where competence and responsibilities jeopardize their ultimate goal because of the 
limitations of their mandates and for fear of intervening in the mandates and responsibilities of 
others. 
</p>
<p>72. Finally, the Special Rapporteur believes that the role of the State is to open possibilities 
and initiatives and generate policies in order to allow concerned actors such as NGOs, 
international organizations and civil society to contribute and become involved in the protection 
of children and minors.  This plurality of actors will not only ensure a better future for the 
following generations but also strengthen democracy as a whole.  In this sense, it is of utmost 
importance that NGOs and private initiatives for protection of children&#8217;s rights be supported and 
funded by the State so as not to get bogged in the State bureaucracy and never reach those who 
are in need. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The lack of a separate juvenile justice system is a major gap in the protection of 
children&#8217;s rights.  Therefore, the Special Rapporteur recommends the establishment of 
such a separate justice system for minors in conformity with international standards.  Such 
a system should encompass different courts dealing with young offenders.  Moreover, the 
law enforcement agencies, such as the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, should have separate units for 
judicial proceedings involving minors, not only when they are in conflict with the law, but 
also when they testify as witnesses in cases involving child trafficking, prostitution or 
pornography.  The Special Rapporteur also recommends setting up separate detention 
facilities (police stations, pretrial investigation centres and remand facilities).  The Special 
Rapporteur nevertheless believes that only serious crimes committed by minors should 
result in detention. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> In order to better protect the interests of all children and help formulate a clear 
policy on children&#8217;s rights and issues, the Special Rapporteur, in line with the concluding 
observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding Ukraine,13 also

<p><b>recommends to create a high-level independent institution, such as a National Commission 
on Children, Youth and Family dealing specifically with enforcing children&#8217;s rights and 
public policies with regard to children.  Such an institution would be headed by a respected 
and non-partisan personality and could benefit from the assistance of the Ministry of 
Youth, Family and Sports.  NGOs and civil society should be an integral part of this 
mechanism.  In formulating such policy, this institution should take into account positive 
experiences of other countries, as well as programmes developed by NGOs and the private 
sector. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> With regard to legislation, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Ukraine: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, the United Nations Convention against International 
Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Officially decriminalize prostitution and define the age of sexual consent; 
 (c) Clearly define the crimes of child pornography; 
 (d) Allow children to file, without parental consent, complaints of abuse; 
 (e) Improve procedures related to legal guardianship when families are involved 
in trafficking in their children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Adopt a law on clear and accessible procedures enabling victims of 
trafficking to get compensation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Continue to conclude bilateral agreements on anti-trafficking measures with 
destination countries, especially with the Russian Federation which has a long common 
border with Ukraine and with which there are no bilateral agreements; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Examine the possibility of concluding agreements with other European 
countries in order to receive training for social educators. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> To facilitate the law enforcement, the Special Rapporteur recommends: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To give more powers and resources to police units such as the 
anti-trafficking unit, the child protection unit and the Interpol unit, and to consider how to 
deal with victims of trafficking, domestic violence and sexual abuse; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To establish a system of witness protection in cases of trafficking.  Witnesses 
must be given not only protection but also incentives to testify; </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.2 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p><b> (c) To coordinate the actions of the Frontier Police with those of the other 
institutions working under the Ministry of Internal Affairs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To address the problem of corruption, especially in the law enforcement and 
judiciary sectors.  Codes of conduct, incentives for reporting unethical behaviour and other 
initiatives can be introduced in the public administration; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) To regulate strictly the numerous dating and marriage agencies which often 
constitute a disguised form of prostitution and trafficking which occasionally may involve 
minors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) To set up a national toll-free telephone line accessible everywhere to report 
complaints and cases of trafficking in children or disappearances, and to offer children 
assistance in all confidentiality. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> Concerning boarding schools, the Special Rapporteur insists that children in 
shelters and orphanages and those who find themselves in vulnerable and disadvantaged 
situations should not be forgotten.  He recommends: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To transform large-scale institutions into smaller boarding schools in order 
to create an environment where each child could grow and develop the skills that would 
allow him or her to become a fully integrated adult in tomorrow&#8217;s society;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To place children deprived of parental care from birth till the age of three in 
foster families as they should not stay at boarding facilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To facilitate procedures of adoption, giving priority to foster families with all 
the help and resources to assist them adequately, and then to adoption inside the country 
and international adoption; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To introduce the system of &#8220;specialized educator&#8221; to work at specialized 
institutions for minors. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Alternatives to placement in orphanages must be sought whenever possible.  The 
establishment of a deinstitutionalization commission would be a welcomed alternative and 
would be able to look individually at the options for every child deprived of a family 
environment.  Besides, a new policy regarding adoption is needed, with a national agency in 
charge of setting up a transparent policy and ensuring rigorous selection in the placement 
of children, always ensuring that the interest of every child remains the main criterion and 
that this placement is free from corruption or political intervention. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> To be effective, policies and programmes to fight trafficking and sexual exploitation 
of children must address the root causes of the phenomenon.  Social exclusion and 
discrimination are major root causes.  In order to deal with such vast, comprehensive and 
ultimately rather vague concepts, the Special Rapporteur suggests targeting groups 
affected in different ways and to different extent by social exclusion, discrimination and 
stigmatization.  These include street children, victims of sexual abuse and domestic </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>violence, children at boarding facilities or who recently left them, children from 
dysfunctional and poor families with a low level of education.  The Special Rapporteur 
recommends strengthening the role of local social services in proactively identifying and 
referring children at risk; monitoring standards of care; assessing the situation and 
developing community child and family protection plans; and serving as focal point for 
coordinated referral and response.  The Special Rapporteur also recommends that, in the 
curriculum of primary and secondary schools, special attention is paid to the issues of 
trafficking in the global human rights perspective as well as to the struggle against 
corruption. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The collaboration between the State and civil society needs improvement.  New 
mechanisms should be developed to enhance collaboration with NGOs and the private 
sector.  The State should collaborate and delegate to capable and credible NGOs those 
services that would be delivered more efficiently by more flexible organizations than by the 
public administration.  The Special Rapporteur recommends the creation of mechanisms to 
allow the State to subsidize NGOs attending vulnerable children and youth through public 
funds.  The Special Rapporteur also invites NGOs not to limit their activities to the delivery 
of social services but to be more vocal in their advocacy role. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to seek the assistance from the 
United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and other international organizations in 
implementing the recommendations of this report.  In particular, the UNCT can provide 
assistance in monitoring the implementation of the national strategies on children and in 
combating child trafficking; in carrying out evaluations of rehabilitation programmes for 
victims of trafficking and in setting up a system to monitor standards of care provided by 
social services; as well as in institutional and capacity-building initiatives, including 
assessing and drawing lessons from experience of coordination and institutional set ups on 
children operating at the local level; in providing guidelines and tools to set up a separate 
juvenile justice system and an independent high-level institution for the promotion and 
protection of children&#8217;s rights and interests.
