</b></p>
<p><b>  Comments of the Government of the Philippines on the 
mission report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. General comments 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Philippines takes note of the <i>Report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children on her Mission to the Philippines</i> 
(A/HRC/23/48/Add.3) which examines the situation of trafficked persons and the impact of 
anti-trafficking measures in the country. The Philippines recognizes the integral role of the 
Special Rapporteur in promoting a human rights-based approach to combat trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children.  
</p>
<p>2. The Philippines would nonetheless like to clarify certain inaccuracies in fact and law 
in the report. The Philippines believes that some parts of the report contain sweeping 
generalizations that were based on unsubstantiated allegations or isolated incidents that do 
not reflect the actual conditions in which the Philippines pursues its campaign against 
trafficking in persons. Through its laws and programs, the Philippines is further 
intensifying its campaign against trafficking in persons, by allocating its limited resources 
aimed at progressively realizing the full protection of the population, especially the sectors 
most vulnerable to the economic pressures of trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Comments on main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Trafficking for forced and bonded labor 
</i></p>
<p>3. With respect to the comments in paragraph 4 of the report, the Philippine 
Government wishes to stress that, in 2012 alone, it carried out the following operations and 
programs in furtherance of its campaign against trafficking for labor exploitation:   
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Department of Labor and Employment undertook rescue operations through 
<i>Sagip Batang Mangagawa</i>1 Quick Action Teams, in which <i>two hundred and twenty 
three (223)</i> victims, were rescued from conditions of forced labor or other labor-
related violations.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Regional Offices of the Department of Labor rescued and assisted at least <i>three</i> 
<i>hundred seventy five (375)</i> victims of trafficking for labor exploitation:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; To enhance the legal regime against trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation, 
the Expanded Anti-Trafficking Act of 2012, which was enacted after the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur, modified the definition of forced labor to include &#8220;any work or 
service extracted from any person under the menace of penalty&#8221;2, based on the 
definition of forced labor by the International Labor Organization. The statute also 
included among its definitions new paragraphs defining &#8220;Slavery&#8221; and &#8220;Involuntary 
Servitude&#8221;3; and it contains a new provision punishing as a distinct offense 
</p>
<p>  
 1 &#8220;Save Child Laborers&#8221; 
 2 Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act 10364, Section 3(d), last clause. 
 3 Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act 10364, Section 3(e),(f).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>recruitment of persons for labor exploitation, including coercion of a worker through 
threats against other persons and abuse or threatened use of legal processes4. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To strengthen the institutional capacity of the government to combat trafficking for 
labor exploitation, the Department of Labor and Employment developed the <i>Manual 
of Procedures in Handling Complaints on Trafficking in Persons,</i> <i>Illegal 
Recruitment and Child Labor</i> in 2012. The Department of Labor and Employment 
also developed a <i>Module on Child Protection Laws </i>which was integrated into its 
advocacy programs, and conducted other advocacy programs, including Orientations 
on Child Labor and Trafficking. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Philippine Government is finalizing a <i>Manual on Trafficking in Persons for 
Forced Labor</i>, based on Philippine laws and policies and international best 
practices, which will provide judges, prosecutors, law enforcement officers, social 
workers, and other persons engaged in ant-trafficking work with a one-volume guide 
in the identification and prosecution of incidents of trafficking for the purpose of 
labor exploitation. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Trafficking for domestic servitude 
</i></p>
<p>4. With respect to the comments in paragraph 9 of the report, the Philippines wishes to 
stress the shared responsibility of source, transit, and destination countries to combat 
trafficking in persons, protect the human rights of migrant workers, and provide assistance 
to trafficking victims.  
</p>
<p>5. The Philippines is working to facilitate international cooperation and compliance 
with international minimum standards for the protection of domestic workers. It ratified the 
Domestic Workers Convention (ILO 189) and chaired the Committee that developed it. The 
Philippines has also signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia on a new Standard Employment Contract (SEC),5 which the Philippines intends to 
replicate in other receiving countries, especially in the Middle-East. The Philippines 
likewise supports the <i>Framework of Regional Collaboration, 2012 for the Abu Dhabi 
Dialogue</i>. Among the important provisions of this Framework are: increased collaboration 
and partnerships to ensure welfare and protection of contract workers; enhancement of the 
employability and skills of workers; improvement of the recruitment process; and 
facilitation of the re-employment and reintegration of workers. 
</p>
<p>6. The Philippines is of the view that the comments in paragraph 11 of the report are 
sweeping generalizations which are not supported by accurate quantitative data and do not 
reflect the conditions of the majority of domestic workers in the Philippines. It further notes 
that it is implementing reform measures to enhance the protection of domestic workers 
within the Philippines, such as the <i>Kasambahay Act </i>(Republic Act 10631 or &#8220;An Act 
Instituting Policies for the Protection and Welfare of Domestic Workers&#8221;) and the 
</p>
<p><i>Household Service Workers (HSW) Reform Package</i>, which is being supervised by the 
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act 10364, Section 4(j). 
 5 The new Standard Employment Contract contains 19 articles that spells out clear and specific 
</p>
<p>provisions on salary (minimum of $400) and the manner of its payment (through a bank account to be 
opened by the employer domestic worker in Saudi Arabia; rest hours (at least 8 hours of continuous  
rest) and rest days (at least one day per week); and paid vacation leave in the Philippines (30 days for 
every two years of service with free round-ticket economy class air ticket). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p><i> (c) Trafficking for sexual exploitation 
</i></p>
<p>7. The Philippines rejects the sweeping generalizations in paragraph 14 of the report, 
particularly its statement that the &#8220;exploitation of children, especially girls, for sex tourism 
is alarmingly common and sometimes socially and culturally tolerated in many areas of the 
country.&#8221;6 These generalizations appear to be based on a small and unrepresentative 
sampling of anecdotal evidence7 and not on accurate quantitative data. The Philippines, 
however, shares the concern over the reported cases, and as a state party to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, is actively enforcing the following laws to protect children from 
all forms of sexual exploitation, in addition to those specifically cited in the report: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The <i>Revised Penal Code</i> of 1930 (Act No. 3815 as amended) punishes anyone who 
promotes or facilitates the prostitution or corruption of minors with up to six years&#8223; 
imprisonment8. Anyone who has sex with a woman below twelve years old will 
suffer up to forty years&#8223; imprisonment9; and any person who sexually assaults 
anyone below twelve years old will suffer twelve years&#8223; imprisonment, or up to 
</p>
<p>twenty years&#8223; imprisonment if the act was attended by aggravating circumstances10. 
Any person who seduces a minor woman over twelve years old may suffer up to 
four years&#8223; imprisonment11. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The <i>Child and Youth Welfare Code</i> of 1974 (Presidential Decree 603) enacted norms 
upholding the dignity of every child and the right of children to be protected against 
exploitation, improper influences, hazards, and other conditions or circumstances 
prejudicial to their development. Thus it provided rules for the protection of 
neglected children12; required hospitals to report cases of abused, maltreated, or 
exploited children13; and mandated strict confidentiality of records of sexually 
abused children14. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The <i>Inter-Country Adoption Act of 1995</i> (Republic Act 8043) and <i>Domestic 
Adoption Act of 1998 </i>(Republic Act 8552) enacted safeguards to ensure that 
adoption will prove beneficial to the child's best interests and that his/her 
fundamental rights will be protected. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The <i>Anti-Trafficking Act of 2003</i> (Republic Act 9208) punishes persons who use 
trafficking victims for the purpose of prostitution15. The <i>Expanded Anti-Trafficking 
Act of 2012</i> (Republic Act 10364) increased the penalty for this offense to six (6) 
years to twelve (12) years imprisonment, or up to forty (40) years&#8223; imprisonment if 
</p>
<p>the male or female trafficking victim was subjected to force or intimidation, is 
deprived of reason or unconscious, or is under twelve (12) years of age16. 
Furthermore, it expressly provides that if this offense is committed by a foreigner, he

<p>or she shall be immediately deported after serving his or her sentence and be barred 
permanently from entering the country.17 
</p>
<p>8. The Philippine Government is even now advocating the passage of a law that would 
prioritize the rescue of persons forced into prostitution, and which would focus on the 
criminal liability of users, customers, and business owners complicit in acts of prostitution. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Trafficking for the purpose of removal of organs 
</i></p>
<p>9. In relation to paragraph 16, the Philippines questions the observation regarding 
&#8220;transplant tourism&#8221; in the country as this does not appear to be based on credible and 
verifiable information, such as documented cases. It likewise wishes to correct the 
statement on &#8220;the absence of any law explicitly prohibiting the sale of human organs from a 
living donor&#8221;. In fact, Section 4(g) of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003 
categorically punishes with twenty (20) years&#8223; imprisonment, or life imprisonment if the act 
was qualified by certain aggravating circumstances18, any person who shall:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;recruit, hire, adopt, transport or abduct a person, by means of threat or use of force, 
fraud, deceit, violence, coercion, or intimidation for the purpose of removal or sale 
of organs of said person&#8221;.19  
</p>
<p>10. The Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012 further strengthened this 
provision by including perpetrators who &#8220;transfer, obtain, harbor, maintain, provide, offer, 
receive&#8221; these trafficking victims20, and by punishing any person who shall attempt to carry 
out this offense, or acts as an accomplice in or an accessory to its commission.21  
</p>
<p><b> B. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>11. In relation to paragraph 43, the Philippines wishes to underscore the fact that its 
agencies, particularly the Department of Justice, are implementing measures to investigate 
and prosecute government officials involved in facilitating and promoting trafficking. In 
furtherance of this objective, up to <i>five hundred ninety eight (598)</i> administrative cases 
have been filed against <i>eight hundred ninety three (893)</i> government employees for their 
alleged involvement in human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>12. The IACAT is finalizing cooperative arrangements with the agencies responsible for 
policing the ranks of the civil service. The IACAT and the Office of the Ombudsman have 
finalized and are ready to sign a Memorandum of Agreement for the formulation of 
mechanisms to ensure the timely and speedy disposition of trafficking related corruption 
cases. The IACAT and the Civil Service Commission committed to further educate public 
officers or employees on the indicators, specific risk, exposure and vulnerabilities relating 
to trafficking in persons, and to strengthen the imposition of administrative sanctions on 
public officials and employees for their explicit involvement in trafficking in persons cases. 
These agencies undertook to formulate the appropriate circulars, orders and code of conduct 
for public officers and employees with respect to public officers and employees involved in 
trafficking in persons and to ensure that public officials would not go unpunished for 
charges or prosecution for their complicity in trafficking in persons cases.

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5

<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>13. In reference to paragraph 44, as well as the concern raised in paragraph 74 on the 
sustainability of projects against trafficking, the Philippines notes that it has continually 
increased the amount of Government financial and human resources dedicated to the 
campaign against trafficking in persons. Thus, under the administration of President 
Aquino, the funding for the prosecution and investigation of trafficking in persons was 
doubled from 25 million pesos in 2011 to 50 million pesos in 2012; and it was doubled 
again to 100 million pesos in 2013. Likewise, the Philippine Government established and 
staffed its anti-trafficking task forces in strategic locations nationwide. It also created 
within the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) a division specifically dedicated to the 
suppression of trafficking, namely, the Anti-Human Trafficking Division; and it formed the 
IACAT Operations Center under the joint supervision of the Office of the Vice President 
and the NBI.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Protection, recovery and reintegration of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>14. In reference to the concern raised in paragraph 45 of the report, the Philippines 
wishes to emphasize that through the intensified capacity-building programs of the 
government, law enforcers continually receive trainings for purposes of the identification of 
trafficking victims. Thus, departing personnel are replaced with capable and trained law 
enforcement officers. 
</p>
<p>15.  In relation to paragraph 47, the Philippines reiterates that the Anti-Trafficking in 
Persons Act of 2003 punishes the trafficking of persons for the purpose of removal or sale 
of organs of said person22. The Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012 further 
strengthened this provision by including perpetrators who &#8220;transfer, obtain, harbor, 
maintain, provide, offer, receive&#8221; these trafficking victims23, and by punishing any person 
who shall attempt to carry out this offense, or acts as an accomplice in or an accessory to its 
commission.24  
</p>
<p>16. In relation to paragraph 49 of the report25, the Philippines notes that it has 
implemented measures to progressively realize the full protection of victims and witnesses. 
Thus, from April 2012 to January 2013 alone, eighty one (81) trafficking victims were 
referred to the Witness Protection Program (WPP) and given protection, shelter, and 
financial assistance, aided in many cases by the IACAT Operations Center. To give the 
witnesses enhanced medical care, the Government enrolled them in its public insurance 
program administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, and accorded them 
preferential treatment at the Philippine General Hospital. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government also leased several farmlands and developed them into <i>witness 
communities</i>, where witnesses learn farming, poultry, cattle raising and other livelihood 
skills that tangibly increase their economic self-sufficiency and improve their psychological 
well-being. The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has further 
established the National Recovery and Reintegration Database to continually monitor the 
safety and condition of victims.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. In addition to the shelters operated by the Department of Social Welfare and 
Development and NGOs, the IACAT Operation Center established a temporary shelter for 
witnesses and trafficking victims. In 2012, the IACAT Operation Center identified <i>three 
hundred ninety three (393)</i> trafficking victims. <i>One hundred thirty five (135)</i> of them were 
</p>
<p>  
 22 Republic Act 9208, previously section 4(g), now section 4(h) 
 23 Republic Act 10364, section 4(h) 
 24 Republic Act 9208, sections 4-A to 4-C. 
 25 In relation to Mission Report, 80. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>referred to shelters of the Department of Social Welfare and Development, <i>fifteen (15)</i> 
victims were placed at the temporary shelter of the IACAT Operation Center, and the rest 
were reintegrated with their families.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Non-criminalization of trafficked persons 
</i></p>
<p>19. In reference to the concern raised in paragraph 50, the Philippines notes that the 
Expanded Anti-Trafficking Act of 2012 now categorically provides that:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Victims of trafficking for purposes of prostitution as defined under Section 4 of this 
</p>
<p>Act are not covered by Article 202 of the Revised Penal Code and as such, shall not 
be prosecuted, fined, or otherwise penalized under the said law.&#8221;26 
</p>
<p>20. Furthermore, the Philippines wishes to emphasize that the primary objects of its 
punitive legislation are those persons who use trafficking victims for the purpose of 
prostitution. This is already punished under the Anti-Trafficking Act of 200327; and the 
Expanded Anti-Trafficking Act of 2012 further strengthened this norm by raising the 
penalty to six (6) years to twelve (12) years imprisonment, or up to forty (40) years&#8223; 
</p>
<p>imprisonment if the male or female trafficking victim was subjected to force or 
intimidation, is deprived of reason, was unconscious, or is under twelve (12) years of age28. 
</p>
<p>21. The Philippines believes that the statement in paragraph 50 on the &#8220;the absence of 
any opportunity for reintegration&#8221; should be corrected. The Philippines notes that the 
IACAT has established various technical education, livelihood and skills training programs 
for the rehabilitation and reintegration of trafficked victims into the mainstream of society, 
which is being carried out in coordination with the Technical Education and Skills 
Development Authority, the Government agency mandated to register and implement 
programs for vocational and livelihood education. The Philippines also reiterates that it 
maintains communities where victims/witnesses learn livelihood skills to increase their 
economic self-sufficiency, and that it enrolls them in insurance and medical programs to 
maintain their physical and psychological well-being. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Rescue operations 
</i></p>
<p>22. In reference to the concern raised in paragraph 51 on the participation of media in 
raid operations, the Philippines notes that the Philippine Commission on Women, in 
partnership with the IACAT-Advocacy and Communications Committee (ADVOCOM), is 
conducting Advocacy Trainings for Media Professionals on Anti-Trafficking. The first of 
these was held in October 2012 for forty (40) media professionals, who were trained on 
gender-sensitive reporting of trafficking cases and on other issues on human trafficking and 
other related laws. The IACAT trained an additional one hundred sixty (160) media 
personnel on trafficking issues in 2012, while another fifty (50) media professionals were 
trained on issues specific to trafficking for labor exploitation.   
</p>
<p>23. In reference to the concern raised in paragraphs 51 and 52 on the protection of 
victims&#8223; rights during rescue operations, Philippine law fully protects the right of victims to 
privacy29 and confidentiality30. Thus, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, as amended, 
provides that: 
</p>
<p>  
 26 Republic Act 10364, section 17, 2nd paragraph. 
 27 Republic Act 9208, section 11. 
 28 Republic Act 10364, section 11. 
 29 Republic Act 386 (Civil Code), article 26, 32(9).  
 30 Republic Act 9208, section 7 (2003), as amended by Republic Act 10364 (2012). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;At any stage of the investigation, <i>rescue</i>, prosecution and trial of an offense under 
this Act, law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, court personnel, social 
workers and medical practitioners, as well as parties to the case, shall protect the 
right to privacy of the trafficked person&#8230; The name and personal circumstances of 
the trafficked person or any other information tending to establish the identity of the 
trafficked person and his or her family shall not be disclosed to the public.&#8221;31 
</p>
<p>24. In relation to minor victims of all forms of child abuse, the Operational Procedures 
of the Philippine National Police expressly protects the right of the child to privacy, and 
mandates that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The police officer shall at all times respect the right to privacy of the child and shall 
</p>
<p>observe confidentiality of information and records pertaining to child rights cases he 
investigated or is investigating&#8230;&#8221;32 
</p>
<p>25. In cases involving a child victim, the Philippine National Police &#8220;shall activate a 
Rescue Team to be headed by officer/s of the WCPD [Women and Children Protection 
Desk]&#8221;. The child victim &#8220;shall be handled preferably by a police officer of the same 
</p>
<p>gender as the victim, who has appropriate trainings on child rights, and in the investigation 
and handling of child-abuse cases&#8221;33. Furthermore, he/she must be turned over to the Local 
Social Welfare Development Office (LSWDO) for protective custody.34 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Support to trafficked persons in recovery and reintegration 
</i></p>
<p>26. The Philippines believes that the statement in paragraph 55 citing that a very low 
number of victims that have benefited from nominal financial assistance should be 
corrected, because it is contrary to the information verified and compiled by the 
Department of Social Welfare and Development. In 2012 alone, the DSWD provided 
assistance in <i>two thousand one hundred eighty three</i> (2,183) cases, involving one or more 
persons, including (a) 1,903 victims of trafficking who were returning or had returned to 
the Philippines; (b) the families and relatives of the victims-survivors of trafficking; and (c) 
communities with high incidence of trafficking. From this number, financial assistance was 
given in 586 cases, skills training or livelihood assistance was given in 124 cases, 
temporary shelter and recovery/medical services were given in 1,030 cases, legal assistance 
was given in 141 cases, and <i>Balik-Probinsya</i>35 transportation assistance was given in 302 
cases. The various forms of economic assistance enabled the victims to either start their 
own livelihood or finance their expenses while seeking employment, while the 
transportation assistance helped the TIP victims to return to their places of origin.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Support to trafficked persons in recovery and reintegration 
</i></p>
<p>27. The Philippines wishes to correct the last sentence in paragraph 54. In fact, the 
Philippines provides multiple layers of support for the repatriation of distressed nationals, 
including victims of trafficking. The Migrant Workers Act provides that the repatriation of 
the worker shall be the primary responsibility of the agency which recruited or deployed the 
worker overseas36; and where emergency repatriation is required, it shall be undertaken by

<p>the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA)37. The law created an emergency 
repatriation fund under the administration, control, and supervision of the OWWA, initially 
consisting of one hundred million pesos (P100,000,000.00)38.  
</p>
<p>28. In the particular case of trafficking victims, the Expanded Anti-Trafficking Act 
provides that the Department of Foreign Affairs shall repatriate them with their consent.39 
The Filipino victim is given temporary shelter in the Foreign Workers Resource Center 
(FWRC) pending the prosecution of trafficking cases abroad; and when the FWRC is not 
available, the Foreign Service Post exhausts all other possible means to provide temporary 
shelter to the victim, through the NGOs, Filipino Community leaders, or private 
accommodation providers like hotels and apartments. Such assistance is rendered at no cost 
to the victim; and all the expenses for assistance to victims are usually sourced from the 
Assistance to Nationals (ATN) Fund or the Legal Assistance Fund, which are adequately 
funded and readily available. It is illegal for the Department of Foreign Affairs personnel to 
charge victims for lodging, and any who do so are subject to administrative disciplinary 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p>29. The Philippines believes that the last sentence in paragraph 59 should be corrected. 
The particular facility visited by the Special Rapporteur in Zamboanga was provided by the 
Government with publicly owned premises for its operation; and it is managed by a civil 
society organization (CSO) with historically adequate international funding and support. 
Consequently, it received assistance from the Department of Social Welfare and 
Development only upon the specific request of the CSO. Three of the shelters managed by 
this CSO are now fully funded by the Government, which assumed joint responsibility for 
their operation.  
</p>
<p>30. In reference to paragraph 61, the Government has recognized the different needs of 
male and female victims of trafficking that require specialized care or services. This is the 
reason for the establishment and continued maintenance of shelters like Marillac Hills and 
the Haven which cater to the special needs of women and girls who are trafficking victims. 
Likewise, female Immigration Officers of the Bureau of Immigration with sufficient 
background on gender and development (GAD) are tasked to assist profiled female victims 
during the interview and other processes conducted by the Bureau. As for the male victims, 
the Department of Social Welfare and Development, through its Policy Development and 
Planning Bureau, issued a policy directive to ensure special care for male trafficked 
victims.  A program for a specialized support program for male victims and a safe and 
separate temporary shelter was pursued by the DSWD Field Office in the National Capital 
Region. A center for male trafficking victims was established in Jose Fabella Center in 
Mandaluyong City, which will be fully operational in 2013. To continuously address the 
special needs of male trafficked victims, specific program enhancement and exploration of 
other field offices are outlined in the Second IACAT Strategic Plan. 
</p>
<p>31. The Philippines believes that paragraph 62 should be corrected. The National 
Referral System (NRS) for the Recovery and Reintegration of Trafficked Persons of the 
Department of Social Welfare and Development is being implemented to establish and 
strengthen the referral network of agencies dealing with trafficked persons. At present, the 
network facilitates rescue operation work and provides for referral needs of rescued 
trafficked victims, while also enabling TIP law enforcement and prosecution of cases. All 
rescued trafficked persons are provided with temporary shelters, counseling, legal 
assistance and referral to services.

<p>32. To ensure the reintegration of victims, each Regional Office of the Department of 
Labor and Employment designated focal persons to manage cases of Trafficking in Persons, 
Illegal Recruitment and Child Labor cases. The following services are being provided by 
the Department of Labor and Employment: (i) Financial Assistance; (ii) Educational 
Assistance for children at risk; (iii) Skills training; and (iv) Livelihood Assistance. For the 
year 2012, the Department identified <i>two hundred fifty one (251)</i> cases of human 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>33. In reference to paragraph 63 of the report, the Philippines respectfully refers to 
the response contained in paragraph 3 of this document. Further, the Philippines wishes 
to clarify that under its law, it is natural persons and not corporations as such that are 
charged criminally; hence, in cases involving acts perpetrated through licensed 
agencies, it is the officers and employees of the agency who are indicted40. The 
Philippines notes that multiple cases of illegal recruitment have been filed against 
natural persons connected to licensed agencies. In 2011, 19 illegal recruitment cases 
involving 37 complainants were filed against licensed agencies; and in 2012, 8 illegal 
recruitment cases were filed involving 22 complainants.  
</p>
<p>34. In reference to the conduct of POEA officials, the POEA has demonstrated it will 
not tolerate corrupt and illegal acts by its officers, who would be subject to investigation 
over offenses like the irregular issuance of Overseas Employment Certificates. Thus, the 
POEA Administrative Complaints Committee handled 9 cases in 2011 and 2012, four of 
which have led the filing of formal charges, even against supervisory POEA personnel.  In 
addition, a Special Fact-finding Committee was created in December 2012 to investigate 
the processing of 7 workers as <i>Balik-Manggagawa</i>, alleged to be new-hires.  
</p>
<p>35. The Philippines wishes to correct the statement that only one case of labor 
trafficking referred to the Department of Justice in 2011. In fact, the POEA referred seven 
(7) cases of labor trafficking to the IACAT for case build up in 2011. 
</p>
<p>36. With respect to paragraph 65, the Philippines wishes to highlight that there has been 
a significant 67% inrease in the number of convictions under the administration of 
President Benigno S. Aquino III, which demonstrates the Government&#8223;s continuing resolve 
to investigate, prosecute and punish all acts of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>37. In connection with the measures created by the Government to facilitate the 
prosecution of TIP cases, the Department of Justice established a case monitoring program 
to detect and address the delays in the resolution trafficking cases, a major component of 
which is the expansion of the scope of data gathered on trafficking cases. The Office of the 
Solicitor General (OSG) likewise agreed to assist IACAT to fulfill its comprehensive 
campaign to investigate cases of trafficking in persons by constituting &#8220;IACAT-OSG Anti-
Human Trafficking Task Force.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>38. In reference to the concern raised over the length of judicial proceedings, the 
Philippines notes that this is founded on the presence of multiple safeguards required to 
equally protect the right of victims to redress and the right of the accused to due process of 
law, as one of the internationally recognized fundamental rights. Among other remedies, 
Philippine law generally allows a party to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i>41 against the actions 
of the trial court for committing &#8220;grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of 
</p>
<p>  
 40 Republic Act 8042, section 6, as amended by Republic Act 10022.  
 41 Rules of Court, Rule 65  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>jurisdiction&#8221;42. These may be filed even in the middle of a trial to prevent the alleged grave 
abuse from affecting the proceedings beyond redress. 
</p>
<p>39. In light of the foregoing, the Philippines Government is implementing measures to 
ensure the speedy and just resolution of judicial proceedings. Thus, the Supreme Court has 
issued the Judicial Affidavit Rule43, which requires parties to submit the judicial affidavits 
of witnesses in place of their testimony on direct examination, and to attach the parties&#8223; 
</p>
<p>documentary evidence to these judicial affidavits. Moreover, in reference to trafficking in 
persons, the Office of the Court Administrator directed judges to hear and try trafficking 
cases expeditiously,<b>44 </b> and to submit reports on the status of trafficking cases pending 
before them<b>.45</b> 
</p>
<p>40. Furthermore, to prevent parties from abusing the safeguards that protect their rights 
and from using them to delay the proceedings, the Department of Justice issued Department 
Circular No. 57 directing all prosecutors to prioritize and expedite the resolution and trial of 
human trafficking cases and to vigorously oppose motions designed to delay the case. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Redress 
</b></p>
<p>41. In reference to the concern in paragraph 67 of the report, please refer to the 
comments in paragraphs 38 to 40 of this document. In addition, the Philippines wishes to 
note that under the Civil Code of the Philippines, compensation through the payment of 
moral damages may be given to persons who underwent &#8220;physical suffering, mental 
anguish&#8230;, social humiliation, and similar injury&#8221;46 through the acts of an offender, 
including in cases of trafficking for sexual exploitation, which is analogous to &#8220;seduction, 
abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts&#8221;.47 Furthermore, compensation through the 
payment of exemplary damages may be awarded in addition to the payment of moral 
damages or when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.48<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Comments on conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>42. In reference to the concern raised in paragraph 77 of the report, the Philippines 
wishes to emphasize that it is presently carrying out measures to ensure the coordinated and 
uniform implementation of the anti-trafficking law, through the Second National Strategic 
Action Plan Against Trafficking (2012-2016), which was launched on December 12, 2012. 
This comprehensive operations plan, which was formulated by a multi-sectoral group 
composed of Government agencies and NGOs, is divided into four (4) Key Results Areas: 
Advocacy and Prevention; Protection, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reintegration; Law 
Enforcement and Prosecution; and Partnership and Networking. Each component maps the 
activities to be implemented in a systematic manner by Government agencies, NGOs and 
other stakeholders at the local, regional and national levels, provides tangible standards to

</b></p>
<p>assess anti-trafficking endeavors, and gives overall direction in the implementation of the 
amended anti-trafficking law. 
</p>
<p>43. The Strategic Action Plan includes measures to enhance the institutional capacity of 
agencies that investigate, prosecute, and try the perpetrators of trafficking; and to facilitate 
inter-governmental coordination in intelligence-gathering and enforcement. It likewise 
proposes intensified media campaigns to encourage partnerships with private citizens in 
anti-trafficking efforts; and it seeks to mobilize the resources of all stakeholders. Most of 
all, it seeks to improve the delivery of services to trafficking victims and to empower them 
for their reintegration into society through education end economic independence. In so 
doing, they may even become active partners in protecting other potential victims. 
</p>
<p>44. With respect to the points addressed in paragraph 78 and the recommendation in 
paragraph 83(d) of the report, the Philippines wishes to note that it has conducted numerous 
programs, trainings, and fora for government officers to boost the awareness and anti-
trafficking expertise of law enforcement and other frontline public officers. 
</p>
<p>45. The IACAT has carried out programs for the capacity development of law 
enforcement officers (intelligence agents, immigration officers, policemen and even 
members of the marine corps), prosecutors, judges, social workers, labor officers, local 
government personnel, as well as members of non-government organizations and civil 
service organizations, by organizing <i>one hundred four (104)<b></b></i><b> </b>trainings and seminars to 
strengthen anti-trafficking approaches and responses in their area of jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>46. On 1-4 October 2012, the Department of Social Welfare and Development&#8223;s Social 
Technology Bureau conducted the Training of Social Workers on Social Case Study 
Writing and Project Documentation to enhance the reporting and documentation skills of 
officers working on cases of trafficked persons. Participants attended from the sixteen regions of the Philippines, as well as from the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. 
All the <i>seventeen (17)</i> Field Offices of the Department also conducted Roll-Out Trainings 
on the Recovery and Reintegration Program for Trafficked Persons at the LGU levels. 
</p>
<p>47. The Department of Labor and Employment conducted numerous programs 
including: Orientation on Child Labor and Trafficking, Capacity Building for Members of 
the<i> Sagip Batang Manggawa</i>49&#8212;Quick Action Teams, and Orientation of Public 
Employment Services Office Managers on Child Labor. About <i>two hundred fifty (250)</i> 
government personnel have been trained on TIP by the Department of Labor and 
Employment. Towards the 4th  quarter, the regional implementers of the Department of 
Labor and Employment were also trained on the procedures to handle cases on trafficking 
in persons, illegal recruitment, and child labor; specifically, on obtaining vital information 
for  prosecution based on the Manual developed by the Department of Labor and 
Employment. 
</p>
<p>48. The Regional Offices of the Department of Labor and Employment also conducted 
various trainings relating to trafficking within their respective regions. 
</p>
<p>49. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, in line with its mandate to 
implement an effective pre-employment orientation seminar and a comprehensive and 
integrated program on overseas employment, conducted Anti-Illegal 
Recruitment/Trafficking in Persons Seminars, Pre-Employment Orientation Seminars and 
Capability Enhancement Trainings. In 2012, <i>forty-eight (48)</i> Anti-Illegal 
Recruitment/Trafficking in Persons Seminars were held nationwide, primarily for law 
enforcement officers, local government officials, Public Service Employment Office 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>employees, and prosecutors. These were attended by 4203 persons, of whom <i>ninety percent 
(90%)</i> are government personnel. 
</p>
<p>50. On June 25 and July 9, 2012, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration 
conducted a training entitled &#8220;Effective Litigation and Trial Techniques Seminar&#8221; for 
</p>
<p><i>sixteen (16)</i> of its Legal Officers to enhance their trial skills as collaborating counsels for 
illegal recruitment. 
</p>
<p>51. To further enhance the delivery of government services in relation to trafficking 
cases, a skills enhancement training for case officers of the 1343 Actionline against Human 
Trafficking was conducted at the Institute of Women&#8223;s Studies-St. Scholastica&#8223;s College 
from 15-16 December 2012. Case officers from the Commission on Filipinos Overseas, the 
Philippine National Police, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, the 
Department of Social Welfare and Development, and the Department of Science and 
Technology participated in the training. 
</p>
<p>52. Various line agencies conducted an orientation seminar on government programs 
addressing illegal recruitment and human trafficking for the employees of Public Service 
Employment Offices in local government units. 
</p>
<p>53. Agents from the Anti-Human Trafficking Division and the International Airport 
Investigation Division of the National Bureau of Investigation underwent training in 2012: 
through the &#8220;Capacity Building Training on TIP&#8221; conducted by IACAT in Tanza, Cavite 
</p>
<p>Province, on August 29-31, 2012; and the &#8220;Trafficking in Persons Training&#8221; conducted by 
International Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok, Thailand on July 16-27, 2012 and 
December 10-21, 2012. 
</p>
<p>54. In order for the Bureau of Immigration to be better equipped in the fight against 
human trafficking, <i>four hundred four (404)</i> of its regular employees and <i>two hundred 
seventy three (273)</i> of its confidential agents attended trainings on the Anti-Trafficking in 
Persons Act and other TIP-related laws. The Bureau also sent representatives to participate 
in several international training programs like the 2nd Conference on Technical Cooperation 
and Capacity Building for Border Management in Thailand, the Capacity Building for 
Frontline Border Control Officers to Combat People Smuggling in Cambodia and the 
Expert Group Meeting on Corruption and Smuggling of Migrants in Vienna, Austria. 
</p>
<p>55. The Philippine Center for Transnational Crime organized a Training Workshop on 
the new Standard Operating Procedures for Trafficking in Persons Investigations of the 
Philippine National Police. Likewise, under INTERPOL&#8223;s Capacity Building Programme 
on the Prevention of Migrant Smuggling and Illegal Migration in South East Asia with the 
sponsorship of the Canadian Government, it sent participants from local agencies abroad 
for training on TIP. 
</p>
<p>56. In partnership with the International Organization for Migration for the Campaign 
Against Illegal Recruitment, Trafficking in Persons and Irregular Migration (CAIRTIM), 
<i>twenty nine (29)</i> personnel of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration attended 
a Trainers Training on February 6 &amp; 7, 2012. This aimed to provide updates on the 
Overseas Employment Program, and to further build the capacity of resource persons to 
conduct Anti-Illegal Recruitment/Trafficking in Persons Seminars and Pre-Employment 
Orientation Seminars nationwide. 
</p>
<p>57. A total of <i>one thousand six hundred sixteen (1,616)</i> personnel from all the regional 
offices of the Philippine National Police received Anti-Trafficking related training in 2012. 
The Philippine National Police-Maritime Group, Women and Children Protection Desk also 
conducted a Specialized Crime Training and Operation Workshop under the INTERPOL 
Capacity Building Program on the Prevention of Migrant Smuggling, Phase 3. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>58. As to the concerns raised in paragraph 79 of the report, please refer to Paragraphs 11 
and 34 of this document. The Philippines further notes that, in addition to their 
administrative cases, criminal charges for violation of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, 
Child Abuse, and Illegal Recruitment have been filed against a number of these government 
officials for their alleged involvement or complicity in human trafficking cases.  
</p>
<p>59. In reference to the concern raised in paragraph 80 of the report, the Philippines has 
adopted multi-sectoral strategies to progressively increase the numbers of trafficking cases 
that are investigated and prosecuted by the Government. Thus, from April 2012 to January 
2013, the prosecution offices have received two hundred nine (209) complaints for alleged 
TIP violations, of which sixty three (63) were initiated by the IACAT Task Forces. Of 
these, one hundred fifty three (153) cases have been filed with the Regional Trial Courts for 
violation of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act while sixty-five (65) cases are pending 
preliminary investigation for other offenses such as Illegal Recruitment, violation of the 
passport law, and child abuse or child pornography under the Anti-Child Abuse Law of 
</p><p>1992. For related comments, please see paragraphs 36 to 40 and 16 to 18. 
</p>
<p>60. The Philippines would like to stress that the factors discussed in paragraph 82 of the 
report are currently being addressed by the Philippine Government through its anti-poverty 
initiatives. Among these programs is the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Program 
administered by the Department of Social Welfare and Development. It provides direct 
financial assistance to impoverished households to improve the health, nutrition and 
education of their members, particularly children aged 14 and below, and to break the inter-
generational cycle of poverty. Since its inceptions up until to 2011, a total number of Two 
Million Three Hundred Forty Five Thousand, Six Hundred and Thirty Nine (2,345,639) 
households have received assistance under the CCT. 
</p>
<p>61. For 2012, a total of 39,444,651,000.00 pesos was allocated for the program, which 
was distributed to 775,891 families. In 2013, the allocation for the program was increased 
to 44,255,644,000.00 pesos; and as of 27 February 2013, 730,161 families have already 
benefited from this allocation. This program had a significant impact on the campaign of 
the Philippine Government against trafficking as it directly addresses poverty, which makes 
people more vulnerable to trafficking. 
</p>
<p>62. The CCT and the Self-Employment Assistance-Kaunlaran (SEA-K) program, which 
provides capital assistance and income generating opportunities, form the two core poverty 
reduction programs of the Department of Social Welfare and Development. These 
aforementioned core social protection programs aim to provide a more sustainable and 
tangible impact on poverty reduction, and would further alleviate the condition of 
underprivileged families in trafficking prone areas. The government has also developed a 
program for skills development and micro-financing that would provide opportunities for 
entrepreneurship and economic growth. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Philippines is of the view that the Government is already implementing the 
majority of the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur, and would like to 
provide the following information:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>64. As to the concerns raised in paragraph 83(a) of the report, the Philippine 
Government notes that it has a centralized repository of relevant information on trafficking, 
and is also improving mechanisms for gathering data.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Philippine Center for Transnational Crime, which serves as the Secretariat of 
the National Central Bureau-Manila50 and of the Office of the Special Envoy on 
Transnational Crime51, gathers and collates data from different government agencies to 
predict trends in the commission of transnational offenses. Thus, the Philippine Center for 
Transnational Crime consolidates data in order to analyze the relationships of given factors 
for the formulation of individual and collective strategies relative to the prevention, 
detection and apprehension of organized crime groups and other criminal elements.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>66. Moreover, in order to put in place a comprehensive database of all the trafficking in 
persons cases, the IACAT Secretariat created a team to monitor and inventory the cases 
pending in the Regional Trial Courts of the country. As part of the effort to expedite the 
resolution of TIP cases, the IACAT monitoring team identifies cases that have been 
pending for more than 5 years, determines the cause of delay, and reports the same to the 
Department of Justice for appropriate action.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>67. Furthermore, the previously launched Philippine Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
Database (PATD) is now being integrated with the master file of all the monitored cases 
gathered by the team. Upon encoding the details of all 1,670 cases, this database will 
represent the comprehensive case inventory of all the TIP cases in the country. The 
database is designed to track the progress of the cases at the prosecutor level and those that 
have been filed in court.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. In addition, the IACAT recently engaged a team of experts to update the information 
on TIP cases in the Philippines and to analyze the progress of the said cases. The team of 
experts, under its contract with the IACAT, shall submit its report not later than 30 
September 2013. The Kingdom of Netherlands has confirmed its interest to jointly 
undertake the said project.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Philippines notes that the recommendation in paragraph 83(d) is already being 
undertaken by the Philippine Government. For comments, please refer to paragraphs 44 to 
57 of this document.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. As to the recommendation in paragraph 83(f) of the report, the Philippine 
Government is implementing measures in relation to the structural concerns addressed by 
this recommendation. Thus, on October 5, 2011, the Secretary of Justice issued Department 
Order No. 826 reconstituting task forces in the DOJ main office, including the Task Force 
on Anti-Trafficking in Persons. Furthermore, the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act 
of 2012 expressly provides for the creation of a secretariat to the IACAT to be headed by an 
Executive Director, who shall be appointed by the Secretary of Justice upon the 
recommendation of the IACAT.52<b> 
</b></p>
<p>71. With regard to the recommendation in paragraph 83(h), the Philippines has 
consistently recognized, since the enactment of R.A. 9208, that international collaboration 
is vital to avert the threat of TIP. In this connection, the Philippines, through the IACAT 
and the individual member-agencies, undertook efforts to strengthen its ties with the 
international community. Thus, on 28 October 2012, the Philippines and the Netherlands 
conducted a parallel and simultaneous operation against a group suspected of trafficking for 
labor exploitation, while Philippine anti-trafficking officials held bilateral exchanges with 
Netherlands authorities to formulate preventive and combative measures against modern 
day slavery. The MOA subsequently executed between the representative agencies of the 
two countries highlighted the importance of international cooperation to address TIP.<b>

<p>72. Members of the IACAT attended the 6th Session of the Conference of Parties to the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Crime and Protocols thereto (COP-
UNTOC) in Vienna, Austria on 15-19 October 2012, which was held to review the Three 
Protocols on Trafficking, Migrant Smuggling, and Arms Smuggling pursuant to Article 32 
of the UNTOC. The delegates from the IACAT and the Bureau of Immigration participated 
in the side event on Trafficking in Persons, where they delivered a presentation on the 
Philippine Government&#8223;s efforts to combat Human Trafficking and the practices that led to 
</p>
<p>the dramatic increase in its prosecution and conviction rates. They also took the opportunity 
to request technical assistance from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) for the 
drafting of an Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Bill. At the Philippine delegation&#8223;s meeting 
with the UNODC Technical Assistance Unit, the UNODC Technical team signified their 
readiness to start providing legislative assistance to the Philippines.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>73. IACAT representatives attended the Program on Prevention of Migrant Smuggling 
and Illegal Migration in Phuket, Thailand. The objective was to increase the number of 
government officers trained in the prevention of migrant smuggling and human trafficking, 
especially in the networking and sharing of information through the use of INTERPOL&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>tools and databases, which are available to 187 member countries worldwide.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. On 28-30 May 2012, a Philippine delegation composed of representatives of IACAT 
member-agencies attended the Technical Experts Workshop on Combating Trafficking in 
Persons in Bali, Indonesia, which was held under the auspices of the Bali Process on People 
Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. The Philippine 
delegates provided a case study of international and multi-sectoral cooperation against 
trafficking.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>75. The work of sharing best practices and building international linkages resumed at 
the 6th Ad Hoc Group Senior Officials&#8223; Meeting of the Bali Process, which was held on 1 
June 2012 in Bali, Indonesia. The Philippine Delegation actively worked to build an 
international partnership that would not only enforce penal laws against human trafficking 
but also address the social and economic conditions that render potential victims vulnerable 
to trafficking syndicates.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Undersecretary-In-Charge of IACAT in the Department of Justice traveled to 
the United States in August 2012 to meet a number of possible partners in raising 
awareness of trafficking among overseas Filipinos and generating additional support for the 
Philippines&#8223; anti-human trafficking initiatives. The Undersecretary had a series of meetings 
with the officers of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, California Chapter, members of 
the media from the West Coast, and members of key Philippine-American communities. 
These interfaces resulted in increased awareness on the problem of human trafficking in the 
target communities in the United States. Further during this trip, discussions on the 
possibility of a partnership with Fil-Am Legal Development and Education Fund 
(FALDEF) was explored whereby the FALDEF acts as the IACAT&#8223;s partner in the United 
</p>
<p>States in assisting Filipino victims of human trafficking as they file and pursue cases 
against their perpetrators. The creation of similar partnerships in other identified destination 
countries is now being pursued.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>77. With respect to paragraph 83(i) of the report, we note that the Philippine 
Government observes the policy of zero tolerance for trafficking-related corruption among 
public officials. To highlight the drive of the government towards this end, please refer to 
paragraphs 11 to 12 and 34 of this document.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>78. In connection with the recommendation in paragraph 83(l) of the report, the 
Philippines wishes to stress that it supports the victim-centered approach in raid and rescue 
operations. For information on government acts which reflect this recommendation, please 
refer to paragraphs 22 to 25 of this document.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>79. In reference to the recommendation in paragraph 83(r) of the report, the Philippines 
would like to note that it has undertaken numerous campaigns to inform and educate the 
public on human trafficking, especially vulnerable sectors like migrant workers; and it is 
broadening these public information campaigns in various traditional and emerging media 
platforms. Thus, awareness-raising programs have been continually carried out by the 
Government. In the year 2012 alone, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration 
conducted <i>forty eight (48)</i> seminars on Anti-Illegal Recruitment/Trafficking in Persons. It 
also conducted <i>eight hundred sixty two (862)</i> Pre-Employment Orientation Seminars, which 
were attended by <i>One hundred sixty one thousand one hundred sixty six (161,166)</i>
