      RE-INITIATES WORK ON PROSPERITY COPPER-GOLD PROJECT </font></strong></p>

      Russell Hallbauer, President and CEO of Taseko Mines Limited (TSX Venture:
      TKO; AMEX: TGB), announces that the Company has re-initiated work on its
      Prosperity Copper-Gold Project, located 125 kilometres southwest of the
      City of Williams Lake in south-central British Columbia. The Prosperity
      property hosts a large porphyry copper-gold deposit amenable to large 
scale
      open pit mining. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      In the years prior to 2001, Taseko carried out extensive exploration, 
engineering,
      mine planning, environmental, and socio-economic studies on the Prosperity
      project. Permitting activity included two years in the British Columbia
      Environmental Assessment (BCEA) process. Early in 2005, with the price 
outlook
      for copper and gold remaining at levels that are attractive for mine 
development,
      Taseko applied to the British Columbia Government to re-activate the BCEA
      process. As a result, the BC Government has granted an extension order for
      the Prosperity Project Application until April 30, 2007. This extension
      allows the Company to collect the additional information which is required
      to satisfy the Provincial assessment criteria for mine development as well
      as those required for the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA).
      Taseko has maintained communication with local First Nations groups 
regarding
      the Prosperity project and the extension to the process timeline provides
      the opportunity to expand consultation with these groups. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Parallel to the permitting and consultation process, Taseko is reviewing
      previous feasibility studies and re-assessing the project economics based
      on new technologies, concepts, and innovative approaches to mine 
development.
      This includes re-examining optimal mining rates and mining equipment size,
      analyzing the economics of constructing and operating a single line mill
      rather than multiple smaller lines, and evaluating the potential 
improvements
      which could be realized with state of the art metallurgical technologies
      such as large tank flotation circuits and expert computerized mill control
systems. The Company is also reassessing major infrastructure plans, such
      as the power-line route, to determine if there are synergies which could
      be achieved with the other communities of interest in the area. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Taseko Mines Limited is a copper-molybdenum producer with projects located
      in British Columbia. Taseko and its joint venture partner Ledcor CMI Ltd.
      successfully re-opened the Gibraltar copper-molybdenum mine in south-
central
      British Columbia in late 2004. In addition to the re-assessment of the 
Prosperity
      Project, several other key initiatives are currently under consideration,
      including the development of a Copper Refinery at Gibraltar and the 
advancement
      of the Harmony gold project. <br>
