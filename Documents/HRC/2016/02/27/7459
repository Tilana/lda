<p><b>Protection of the human rights of migrants at sea 
</b></p>
<p> At the 42nd meeting, on 26 September 2014, the President of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council made the statement below: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Human Rights Council,  
</p>
<p>Recognizing that migrants often undertake dangerous journeys, including in 
</p>
<p>crowded and unsafe boats, and deeply concerned at the frequent recurrence of tragic 
</p>
<p>events at sea, 
</p>
<p>Alarmed at the reports of the sinking of boats, that has resulted in the death of 
</p>
<p>hundreds of people, deeply concerned at the persistent vulnerability of migrants, and 
</p>
<p>expressing grave concern at the inhuman exploitation suffered by migrants at the 
</p>
<p>hands of organized criminal groups, 
</p>
<p>Concerned that the protection of the human rights of migrants at sea 
</p>
<p>continues to pose a serious challenge and requires a holistic analysis and assessment, 
</p>
<p>as well as a concerted international response through genuine multilateral 
</p>
<p>cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination, 
</p>
<p>Underlining the important role of the Human Rights Council in the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including for 
</p>
<p>migrants, 
</p>
<p>1. Expresses deep sorrow at the massive loss of innocent lives of 
</p>
<p>migrants, including at sea; 
</p>
<p>2. Calls upon States to take further steps, in accordance with their 
</p>
<p>international obligations, to provide persons in distress at sea with assistance;  
</p>
<p>3. Urges States, individually and collectively, to protect the human rights 
</p>
<p>of migrants and to address the root causes that drive persons to make such dangerous 
</p>
<p>journeys; 
</p>

<p>4. Calls upon the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and other relevant special 
</p>
<p>procedures of the Council, within their respective mandates, to pay particular 
</p>
<p>attention to the protection of the human rights of migrants at sea.&#8221;
