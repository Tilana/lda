a follow-up report on the study on the right to the truth, which shall include best national and 
international practices, in particular legislative, administrative or any other measures, as well as 
individual and societal dimensions of this right, taking into account the views of States and 
relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to be examined at its 
fifth session in June 2007&#8221;. A verbal note to this effect was circulated on 6 December 2006. 
</p>
<p> International instruments and domestic law, and also domestic and international 
jurisprudence are all increasingly recognizing the right to the truth about gross human rights 
violations and serious violations of human rights law. The contributions received in response to 
the note verbale dated 14 July 2005 and addressed to all States and relevant intergovernmental 
and non-governmental organizations confirm the close links between the right to the truth and 
other rights, as highlighted in the study on the right to the truth contained in document 
E/CN.4/2006/91. In addition, the information submitted demonstrates the existence of highly 
valuable and diversified experience in efforts to uphold and strengthen the right to the truth. The 
present report is concerned exclusively with topics and examples provided in the 
communications submitted, and does not undertake to cover all aspects of the right to the truth, 
as defined in the study. With the information provided, it has been possible to identify essential 
issues which merit closer consideration. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to resolution 2005/66 of the Human Rights Commission, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted a study on the right to truth, 
contained in document E/CN.4/2006/91, surveying and analysing different aspects of this law: its 
legal and historical basis, its material scope, its holders, its nature and content, its relationship 
with other rights and the institutional and procedural mechanisms for its implementation.  
</p>
<p>2. The study concludes that the right to the truth about gross human rights violations and 
serious violations of human rights law is an inalienable and autonomous right, linked to the duty 
and obligation of the State to protect and guarantee human rights, to conduct effective 
investigations and to guarantee effective remedy and reparations. The study also stresses that this 
right is closely linked with other rights and has both an individual and a societal dimension and 
should be considered as a non-derogable right and not be subject to limitations. 
</p><p>3. The study affirms in its conclusions that the right to the truth implies knowing the full and 
complete truth as to the events that transpired, their specific circumstances, and who participated 
in them, including knowing the circumstances in which the violations took place, as well as the 
reasons for them (E/CN.4/2006/91, para. 59). From the conceptual viewpoint, this right therefore 
occupies a central and fundamental position in action to combat impunity and in the quest for 
justice. 
4. The present report is principally organized around examples drawn from the responses sent 
to the Office of the High Commissioner by a number of States and non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>5. For the purposes of its analysis, the report draws on such existing instruments as the Basic 
Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross 
Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law (resolution 60/147, annex - hereinunder referred to as &#8220;the Basic Principles 
and Guidelines&#8221;) and the updated set of principles for the protection and promotion of human 
rights through action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1 - hereinunder referred to as 
&#8220;the set of principles&#8221;) and uses them as points of reference. 
</p>
<p>6. On 6 December 2006, the Office of the High Commissioner sent a verbal note to all States 
and requested information from various intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, 
in compliance with Human Rights Council decision 2/105, on measures adopted to give effect to 
the right to the truth. The present report has been drawn up on the basis of the comments sent in 
by 16 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, 
Israel, Mexico, Morocco, Paraguay, Philippines, Serbia and Switzerland. Responses were also 
received from three non-governmental organizations: the International Federation of Human 
Rights Leagues (FIDH), the Argentine Centre for Legal and Social Studies (CELS) and the 
International Commission of Jurists (ICJ). The report presents a summary of the information 
provided. 
</p>
<p>7. The Office of the High Commissioner expresses its appreciation to the States and 
organizations which have contributed to the preparation of the present report.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ASPECTS, NATURE AND CONTENT OF THE RIGHT TO THE TRUTH 
</b></p>
<p>8. The conclusions of the study on the right to the truth indicate that the right to the truth is 
rooted in a series of resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly during 
the 1970s on the issue of disappeared persons. This right was subsequently given implicit 
recognition in international humanitarian law, through article 32 of the Protocol Additional to the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, relating to the Protection of Victims of International 
Armed Conflicts (Protocol I). 
</p>
<p>9.  The right to the truth subsequently featured as one of the three mainstays of action to 
combat impunity, alongside the right to justice and the right to reparation. 
</p><p>10.  In the same spirit, disclosure of the truth has been promoted as a form of reparation - or, 
more precisely, of satisfaction - in the Basic Principles and Guidelines adopted by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 60/147. 
</p>
<p>11.  The study on the right to the truth recalls the contributions made by the jurisprudence of 
regional human rights courts and the views adopted by the United Nations treaty monitoring 
bodies, which have helped flesh out this right. 
</p>
<p>12.  The adoption by the General Assembly, in its resolution 61/177, of the recent International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance marked an important 
milestone in giving recognition to the right to the truth, an achievement welcomed by a number 
of States in their responses to the note verbale. In article 24, paragraph 2, the Convention 
enshrines the right of the victims of enforced disappearances to know the truth, while 
paragraph 3 of the same article spells out the corresponding obligations of the State.  
</p>
<p>13. Following on from the study, certain States have reaffirmed the autonomy of the right to 
the truth and its connections with other rights, including the right to information, the right to 
justice, the right to reparation and the right to an identity. They have also given particular 
attention to the purpose of the right to the truth, namely, to restore to the victims of manifest 
violations of human rights their dignity and to ensure that such misdeeds do not recur. 
</p>
<p>14. Beyond this international recognition, some States, like Colombia, have incorporated the 
right to the truth in their domestic legal system through legislative measures and through their 
jurisprudence.<b>1</b> In several judgements, the Colombian Constitutional Court has developed 
jurisprudence recognizing the right of the victims of gross human rights violations to know the 
truth and has reaffirmed that this right is conducive to the eradication of impunity.<b>2</b> It has 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Act 600 of 2000, or the Code of Criminal Procedure; Act 906 of 2004, or the new Code of 
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure; and Act 975 of 2005, referred to as the Justice and Peace Act, and also 
through the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court. 
<b>2
</b>  Judgements T-249/03 of 20 January 2003; C-228/32 of 2 April 2002; C-580/02 of 2002; and 
</p>
<p>C-458/06 of 2006, among others.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>affirmed that the right to the truth is both an individual right of the victims and their families and 
a social right, since all members of society should be informed about all facts related to such 
violations.  
</p>
<p>15. Article 7 of the Colombian Justice and Peace Act states: &#8220;Society, and in particular 
victims, have an inalienable, full and effective right to know the truth about violations committed 
by organized armed groups operating outside the law and about the fate and destiny of the 
victims of abduction and enforced disappearance. Judicial inquiries and proceedings to which the 
present Act applies must promote action to ascertain what has happened to the victims of such 
acts and must inform their families accordingly. The criminal proceedings which are initiated 
under the present Act shall not impede the possible application in the future of other non-judicial 
arrangements for the restoration of the truth.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. For its part, Argentina stresses that the right to the truth is an autonomous right, both 
individual and communal in nature, and that, alongside justice, memory and reparation, 
constitutes one of the four mainstays of action to combat impunity, in cases involving gross 
violations of human rights. The right to the truth is viewed as an indispensable element in any 
process of restoring democracy, since it plays an essential role in the historical reconstruction of 
the causes and consequences of human rights violations. This right also entails the right to full 
knowledge of gross human rights violations, of the circumstance and reasons for their 
perpetration and the identity of those responsible for them. 
</p>
<p>17. In its case, however, Switzerland argues that there is no human rights instrument which 
identifies the right to the truth as a specific and autonomous right and that only certain of the 
provisions of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions touch on the &#8220;right&#8221; to know. Accordingly, 
the only provision which is concerned explicitly with the right of victims to know the truth is that 
contained in article 24, paragraph 2, of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance (see paragraph 12 above). At the same time, it is generally 
accepted that States have a certain number of obligations, dictated by human rights, that are 
connected with the issue of victims&#8217; right to know the truth. 
</p>
<p>18.  Neither, according to Switzerland, do the human rights treaties, taken in their entirety, 
make any provision for the right of peoples to know the truth, although they do recognize the 
inherent rights of victims of massive human rights violations, such as the right to know, the right 
to reparation and to justice, and the right to guarantee of non-recurrence. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RIGHT TO THE TRUTH AND  
OTHER RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE STATE 
</b></p>
<p>19. The contributions sent in highlight the close links between the right to the truth and other 
human rights, including the right to have access to justice, the right to an effective remedy and 
the right to objective information.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Cuba, Mexico and Paraguay, among others. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. Accordingly, a direct connection is made between the right to the truth and such measures 
as amnesties or other juridical arrangements of comparable effect, since these measures not only 
promote impunity: they also pose a major obstacle to efforts to uphold the right to the truth by 
inhibiting the conduct of full inquiries. 
</p>
<p>21. Some States also see links between the right to the truth and other rights, such as the right 
to information, and stress that it is enshrined in law and that there should be bodies entrusted 
with monitoring its observance. States also reaffirm the connection between the right to the truth 
and the right to reparation, since, by shedding light on violations, the right to the truth helps 
ensure that victims receive reparations and that further human rights violations are stopped. The 
right to the truth has also been associated with the duty of States to preserve memory: it requires 
the State to take the necessary steps to preserve the collective memory of gross human rights 
violations and of breaches of international humanitarian law, including by maintaining national 
archives and by making these available to the public. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Obligation to investigate 
</b></p>
<p>22.  As affirmed in the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and 
Reparation, &#8220;the obligation to respect, ensure respect for and implement international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law &#8230; includes, inter alia, the duty to: &#8230; investigate 
violations effectively, promptly, thoroughly and impartially&#8221; (resolution 60/147, annex, 
para. 3 (b)). 
</p>
<p>23. To achieve this, the right to the truth is given effect through the conduct of judicial or 
non-judicial inquiries, which are of key significance (such as those conducted by an 
ombudsman). The right to the truth is tied up with the State&#8217;s obligation to conduct 
investigations and to prosecute, try and punish the perpetrators of gross human rights violations. 
States stress that, in the case of enforced disappearances, this obligation to investigate with a 
view to exposing human rights violations continues so long as the fate and welfare of the 
disappeared person and the circumstances in which the offence was committed remain unknown. 
</p>
<p>24. In this context, Argentina points out that the right to the truth must be interpreted as part of 
the general duty of States to investigate gross human rights violations, to accord reparation to 
victims and prosecute, try and punish those responsible for such violations. 
</p>
<p>25. Morocco refers to the obligation to seek the truth through a process of inquiry and, in this 
context, draws attention to its Equity and Reconciliation Commission. It explains that 
investigations conducted under the auspices of the Commission are concerned with gross human 
rights violations which are of a massive or systematic nature. 
</p>
<p>26. More specifically, Mexico stresses the vital role played by prosecutors and by the 
ombudsman&#8217;s office in conducting inquiries, both judicial and non-judicial, into human rights 
violations and in upholding the right to the truth. It points out that the goal of reasserting the 
truth was considerably promoted by disseminating the findings and their recommendations of 
inquiries conducted by the ombudsman&#8217;s office. The new special services set up under the office </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the Attorney General, such as the special prosecutor for enforced disappearances committed 
during the 1970s and early 1980s, also provide institutional arrangements conducive to 
upholding the right to the truth. Mexico also stresses that the lack of any preliminary 
investigations or negligence in the conduct of such investigations by the government officials 
responsible pose serious obstacles to exercise of the right to the truth. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Right to justice and an effective remedy 
</b>27. The right to have access to justice also includes the right to an effective judicial remedy 
pursuant to international law and represents one of the means of seeking the truth. Finland states 
its view that criminal procedure also offers a means of ascertaining the truth regarding atrocities 
committed in the past and that amnesty measures evade the issue of the liability of perpetrators 
of gross human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>28.  In November 2005, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
adopted a new general comment, entitled: &#8220;Disappearances, amnesty and impunity: general 
comment on article 18 of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/56, para. 49). The Working Group recommended that: &#8220;States 
should refrain from making or enacting amnesty laws that would exempt the perpetrators of 
enforced disappearance from criminal proceedings and sanctions, and also prevent the proper 
application and implementation of other provisions of the Declaration.&#8221;  It was of the view that 
&#8220;An amnesty law should be considered as being contrary to the provisions of the Declaration &#8230; 
if, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of its application or implementation, it results in any 
or all of the following: &#8230; Concealing the names of the perpetrators of disappearance, thereby 
violating the right to truth and information, which can be inferred from articles 4 (2) and 9 of 
the Declaration.&#8221; It also stressed that measures similar to amnesties were contrary to the 
obligations set out by the Declaration, particularly when they had the effect of making &#8220;the 
victim&#8217;s right to truth, information, redress, reparation, rehabilitation, or compensation 
conditional on the withdrawal of charges or the granting of pardon to the alleged perpetrators of 
the disappearance&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>29. In Chile the task of investigating violations of the right to life committed under the military 
regime, of ensuring accountability and of punishing the culprits has been entrusted to the courts. 
Over the last two years there have been significant developments in the process relating to the 
right of victims to justice, notwithstanding the practical problems posed by the decree on 
amnesty. From the end of the 1990s, there has been a shift in the Supreme Court&#8217;s jurisprudence, 
as it began overturning the judgements of military courts based on application of the amnesty 
decree. Another important development in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court consisted in 
its decision to accord &#8220;disappeared detainees&#8221; the status of victims not of murder, but of 
abduction, which had the effect of voiding any request for amnesty or prescription until such 
time as the fate of the victim had been ascertained. 
</p>
<p>30. Mention here should also be made of a new trend in the country&#8217;s higher courts to rule that 
amnesty is inapplicable in their judgements, and to invoke, as the legal foundation, the obligation 
to abide by the international human rights treaties ratified by Chile. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Right to reparation 
</b></p>
<p>31. As the study on the right to the truth stated, the right to the truth may well be an 
autonomous one with its own legal basis but it is nevertheless closely linked to other rights 
including the right to reparation. Despite the link between them, these two rights are distinct 
because the object of the right to the truth is to shed light on the facts and identify those 
individually responsible. 
</p>
<p>32. The Basic Principles and Guidelines stipulate that victims should receive full and effective 
reparation, as laid out in principles 19-23, in the form of restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, 
satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition, as appropriate and in proportion to the gravity of 
the violation and the circumstances of each case. 
</p>
<p>33. As the Basic Principles and Guidelines put it, satisfaction includes verification of the facts 
and full and public disclosure of the truth (principle 22). The Basic Principles and Guidelines 
also say that victims and their representatives should be entitled to seek and obtain information 
on the causes leading to their victimization and on the causes and conditions pertaining to the 
gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law, and to learn the truth in regard to these violations. 
</p>
<p>34. Under the right to reparation, the Basic Principles and Guidelines provide a useful 
framework for considering the various initiatives that States have taken in this area. In their 
replies to the Office of the High Commissioner, some States mention reparation programmes that 
they have launched in response to the work and recommendations of the truth commissions that 
they set up. These programmes have offered individual or collective reparations. 
</p>
<p>35. In the case of individual reparations, States have offered compensation and adopted 
recommendations on medical and psychological rehabilitation, reintegration into society, the 
settlement of legal, administrative and professional issues which, in the case of some victims, 
had remained pending, and the award of pensions. Some individual reparation programmes have 
also provided educational benefits for victims&#8217; children, such as the payment of enrolment fees 
and charges. 
</p>
<p>36. For collective reparations, States have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure that 
violations are not repeated, in part by preserving memories and conducting institutional reforms. 
The principal object of such moves is to clear away the aftermath of violations, restore 
confidence in institutions and ensure respect for the rule of law and human rights. 
</p>
<p>37. States have used various means to perpetuate historical memory through culture, family 
recollection, collective and social memory, and historical sites offering tangible proof of past 
events. They have reformed institutions and taken steps to promote the rule of law in order to 
guarantee that violations are not repeated. 
</p>
<p>38. Some States have given particular prominence to community reparation through the 
adoption and execution of social, economic and cultural development programmes for towns and 
regions affected by violence. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Right to information 
</b></p>
<p>39. One of the most decisive ways of ensuring the right to the truth is still the right to 
information. On this subject, Israel mentions its Freedom of Information Law of 1998, which 
establishes the right to information, in part by giving all citizens and residents the right to obtain 
information from the public authorities whether or not they have any personal interest in the 
information requested, and without having to justify their request. The Act also applies to people 
who are neither citizens nor residents. Exceptions are permitted in certain specific situations 
which include matters of public safety and questions of privacy. Refusal to satisfy the right to 
information can be appealed before the national courts, and the burden of proof lies with the 
public authorities, which must explain and justify their refusal. 
</p>
<p><b>III. INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS AND MEASURES 
PROMOTING THE RIGHT TO THE TRUTH 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Truth commissions and machinery to follow up on their recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>40. It is becoming more and more commonplace for countries emerging from civil war or 
authoritarian regimes to set up a truth commission to operate during the immediate transition 
period. Such commissions - officially approved temporary, non-judicial investigative bodies - are 
given a period of time for collecting testimony, holding inquiries, mounting investigations and 
holding public hearings before publishing the final report. The work of a truth commission may 
be used in support of any subsequent prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>41. In their submissions to the Office of the High Commissioner, several countries report on 
commissions of this type, such as the Equity and Reconciliation Commission in Morocco and the 
truth and reconciliation commissions in Serbia, Chile and Paraguay. 
</p>
<p>42. Giving effect to the recommendations of truth commissions is a major challenge. Once the 
commissions have submitted their final reports, other bodies must carry out their 
recommendations. The follow-up mechanism may take the form of an official watchdog 
committee or a standing public authority responsible for putting the recommendations into effect. 
</p>
<p>43. In Morocco, for example, the Consultative Council on Human Rights was given the 
mandate of following upon the recommendations of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. 
</p>
<p>44. Chile set up various mechanisms to follow up on the report of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission, notably the National Reparation and Reconciliation Corporation (Act No. 19123), 
reporting to the Ministry of the Interior, in 1992. Then in 1996 it instituted a programme of 
investigations to establish the fate of missing detainees and people whose deaths had been 
legally recognized but whose bodies had never been found. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Commissions of inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>45. As the set of principles emphasizes, measures to guarantee the right to the truth may 
include &#8220;non-judicial processes that complement the role of the judiciary. Societies that have 
experienced heinous crimes perpetrated on a massive or systematic basis may benefit in 
particular from the creation of a truth commission or other commission of inquiry to establish the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>facts surrounding those violations so that the truth may be ascertained and to prevent the 
disappearance of evidence&#8221; (principle 5). In their responses to the note verbale, States give both 
recent and older examples of commissions of inquiry they have established. 
</p>
<p>46. Having admitted that people who had disappeared because of their involvement or alleged 
involvement in political activities in a period between September 1961 and October 1988 had 
died, Brazil passed a law (No. 10.875/2004 of 24 March 2004) setting up an ad hoc commission 
to identify the disappeared persons whose names did not appear in the annex to the law, find 
their bodies and express an opinion on applications for compensation. 
</p>
<p>47. A decree (No. 4.850/2003 of October 2003) established an inter-ministerial committee for 
the purpose of obtaining information leading to the location, identification, transport and burial 
of the remains of people who had taken part in the guerrilla movement in Araguaia. 
Administrative steps were also taken, including the establishment of a database of biological 
samples and genetic profiles for use in identifying the human remains of victims of the military 
regime. 
</p>
<p>48. Similarly, the Philippines mentions a commission of inquiry into involuntary 
disappearances, which was responsible for scientific elucidation of the circumstances of each 
disappearance and for the safe keeping of evidence relating to the identities of the individuals 
involved and the causes of death. 
</p>
<p>49. Argentina&#8217;s experience led, in connection with the link between the right to the truth 
and the right to an identity, to the creation of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, which 
has been playing a very important role in seeking out and identifying disappeared persons, 
locating people killed in extrajudicial executions, helping the courts bring the facts to light and 
helping, with victims&#8217; families, to establish the truth. Argentina has established a National 
Commission on the Right to an Identity (Act No. 25.457 of 1992) and a National Genetic Data 
Bank (Act No. 23.511 of 1987) in which genetic maps of all the families which have lost 
children in forced disappearances are archived and indexed. 
</p>
<p>50. From the peace agreement of 10 April 1998 in Ireland (the &#8220;Good Friday Agreement&#8221;) 
stemmed moves to acknowledge and tackle the suffering caused to victims of the conflict. A 
Victims&#8217; Commissioner was appointed to identify what further steps to take to acknowledge and 
take account of the suffering of those concerned. Later, commissions of inquiry were set up to 
shed light on the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan and, more generally, on the violence which 
began in the 1970s. 
</p>
<p>51. Separately, an independent commission was set up to locate the remains of victims of 
paramilitary violence. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Court proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>52. Besides setting up truth commissions and non-judicial commissions of inquiry, some States 
report proceedings brought before national courts against those responsible for war crimes 
against civilian groups, explaining, where cases might also come under the jurisdiction of an 
international tribunal, what cooperative mechanisms had been established with the tribunal 
concerned. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>53. Argentina emphasizes that the right to the truth could be satisfied by a number of different 
institutional means and mechanisms, some judicial, some not. It comments on the importance of 
the &#8220;truth trials&#8221; at the Federal Court in La Plata: the court had instituted judicial proceedings 
limited to investigations and the compilation of case files on forced disappearances which, 
because of the amnesty laws in force, were not followed by prosecutions and punishment. When 
the laws in question were repealed, the court handling the various &#8220;truth trials&#8221; was able to hand 
the case files over to the criminal justice system. Further to these two judicial steps, the &#8220;truth 
trials&#8221; and the criminal trials proper, the Argentine Government set up a support and assistance 
programme with a Federal Human Rights Council for complainants, victims and witnesses of 
State terrorism, and a national protection programme for complainants and victims of human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p>54. Serbia describes cases brought before Serbian courts against the perpetrators of war crimes 
against civilian groups, and the cooperative machinery that it has set up with the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. 
</p>
<p>55. Serbia reports the judgements handed down by national courts in the <i>Podujevo, Strbci</i> and 
<i>Sjeverin</i> trials on charges of war crimes punishable under article 142 of the Criminal Code of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It also draws attention to a change in its own judicial system 
made in 2003: the creation of a war crimes division in the Belgrade district court, with 
jurisdiction over war crimes as stipulated in the Criminal Code and article 5 of the Statute of the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. 
</p>
<p>56. Mention has been made, in connection with judicial proceedings, of the role played by 
applicants for civil indemnification in connection with criminal trials. In a number of 
judgements, the Colombian Constitutional Court has emphasized the importance of having such 
applicants present at the criminal trials of those responsible for grave human rights violations, as 
a means of guaranteeing victims and their families the right to the truth. 
</p>
<p>57. On a similar note, FIDH advocates a study of national legislation to see whether it allows 
victims to attend trials and be kept regularly informed of inquiries in progress, and whether it 
establishes a general right of access to information on human rights violations. The Federation 
also suggests that the issue of the right to the truth should be further studied in the context of the 
development of international criminal justice. With a view to better understanding of the right to 
the truth, Argentina has suggested preparing and distributing a handbook on best practice in the 
exercise and protection of this right. To facilitate the exercise of the right to the truth, 
Switzerland suggests guidelines on the protection of archives relating to human rights 
violations, and considers that thought might be given to the establishment of a special adviser or 
United Nations rapporteur on the question of the &#8220;treatment of the past&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Preservation of and access to archives on human rights 
violations and the question of memory 
</b></p>
<p>58. Archives of human rights violations, originally intended to buttress repressive regimes of 
all kinds, are vital in making reparation for the injury suffered by victims of repression and in 
prosecuting those responsible for atrocities. They have an intrinsic value directly related to the 
exercise of victims&#8217; rights, the work of the courts and non-judicial mechanisms for establishing </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the facts, the preservation of memory and history. The question of archives is closely bound up 
with the right to information, the fundamental right of each individual to have access to 
information on the public record relating to himself or herself. 
</p>
<p>59. Other individual rights can be upheld by using the archives as evidence: public 
rehabilitation of people convicted on political grounds, families&#8217; rights to know where their 
missing relatives are, political prisoners&#8217; right to amnesty and victims&#8217; rights to reparation and 
compensation. 
</p>
<p>60. Archives also enable every nation to exercise its right to an undistorted written record, and 
the right of each people to know the truth about its past. 
</p>
<p>61. As Louis Joinet has very aptly put it,<b>4</b> &#8220;establishing responsibility for human rights 
violations, allowing justice to be done and victims to know the truth, requires evidence. People 
tend, however, to overlook the obvious point that much of the evidence comes from archives&#8221;. 
He emphasizes the fundamental role of oppressive regimes&#8217; archives as political, legal, historical 
and testamentary sources, and the need for action to ensure that they are kept, handled and used 
in secure conditions. 
</p>
<p>62. The topics of the preservation of and access to archives bearing witness to violations are 
also broached in the set of principles (principles 14-18). &#8220;The right to know implies that archives 
must be preserved. Technical measures and penalties should be applied to prevent any removal, 
destruction, concealment or falsification of archives, especially for the purpose of ensuring the 
impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights and/or humanitarian law&#8221; (principle 14). 
&#8220;Access to archives shall be facilitated in order to enable victims and their relatives to claim their 
rights&#8221; and &#8220;as necessary, for persons implicated &#8230; for their defence&#8221; and &#8220;in the interest of 
historical research&#8221; (principle 15). 
</p>
<p>63. At its thirty-seventh session, the International Conference of the Round Table on Archives 
(CITRA) passed a resolution on archives and human rights violations in which, taking into 
account the fundamental importance of archives in all States as &#8220;evidence supporting victims&#8217; 
rights for reparation; as an essential element of collective memory; as a means of determining 
responsibilities for rights violations; and as a basis for reconciliation and universal justice&#8221;,<b>5</b> it 
recommended that government authorities and international organizations should facilitate the 
effective exercise of the right to know, by taking steps to ensure the preservation and 
conservation of archives of all kinds which document these crimes, make the existence of these 
archival fonds known and facilitate access to them by adapting or creating adequate legal 
frameworks for their accessibility, and ensuring that these arrangements respect both privacy and 
the need to make the truth known. 
</p>
<p>64. Some States have indicated that they have taken steps to conserve and provide access to 
archives on human rights violations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>65. Brazil has both adopted legislation and taken administrative steps. Act No. 8.159/91 
defines national policy on public and private archives. Anyone is allowed access, upon 
application, to information in the archives of public services; exceptions may be made where 
information must be kept confidential for reasons linked to the security of society or the State, or 
the protection of people&#8217;s private lives, honour or good names. 
</p>
<p>66. The administrative measures relate to the transfer to the national archives of documents 
from the army, the police and the secret services so that the public can consult non-confidential 
documents in accordance with the law in force. 
</p>
<p>67. The question of archives has also given rise to projects such as the creation of a reference 
centre on political repression in Brazil (1964-1985) to serve as a depository for information, 
documents, files and artwork of symbolic value connected with the human rights violations 
committed during the period of military dictatorship. 
</p>
<p>68. By presidential decree (No. 1259/2003), Argentina set up the National Memory Archives 
where all documents relating to the human rights violations committed under the military regime 
are preserved and organized. This, again, is to safeguard the right to the truth. 
</p>
<p>69. Colombia emphasizes the importance of establishing, organizing and preserving archives 
on serious human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law. It has passed 
an act (No. 594 of 2000) laying down measures to prevent the destruction, removal or 
falsification of archives. It also reports that the Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation has 
begun to set up a &#8220;right to the truth, historical memory and preservation of archives&#8221; programme. 
</p>
<p>70. Switzerland has taken initiatives on a number of fronts as regards the handling of archives 
on human rights violations. It is supporting three war crimes archives in the Balkans and is 
helping, in Guatemala, to salvage the archives of the national civil police. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  NEW DEVELOPMENTS AT THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL LEVEL 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  UNITED NATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>71. On 20 December 2006, the General Assembly adopted the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (see paragraph 12 above). In the last 
preambular paragraph of the Convention, the States parties recognize the right to the truth: 
&#8220;<i>Affirming</i> the right of any victim to know the truth about the circumstances of an enforced 
disappearance and the fate of the disappeared person, and the right to freedom to seek, receive 
and impart information to this end.&#8221; Paragraph 2 of article 24 of the Convention furthermore 
states: &#8220;Each victim has the right to know the truth regarding the circumstances of the enforced 
disappearance, the progress and results of the investigation and the fate of the disappeared 
person. Each State Party shall take appropriate measures in this regard.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, in its report to the 
General Assembly, affirmed that &#8220;In any peace and reconciliation scheme the victims&#8217; rights to 
truth, justice and reparation must be maintained&#8221; (A/61/289, para. 66). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. In its concluding observations regarding the reports submitted by States parties under 
article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Human Rights 
Committee has expressed support for the creation of mechanisms to give effect to the right to the 
truth. In one case, the Committee expressed regret at a State party&#8217;s &#8220;failure to adopt an 
appropriate law on the establishment of a Committee for Truth and Reconciliation, as well as of 
other initiatives to promote reconciliation&#8221; and suggested that the State party should &#8220;intensify 
its efforts to adopt a systematic approach to re-establishing mutual trust between different ethnic 
groups and accounting for past human rights abuses&#8221;.<b>6</b> In another case,<b>7</b> it suggested that a State 
party should act swiftly to implement the recommendations of the &#8220;national dialogue&#8221; on the 
establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. 
</p>
<p>74. The Committee has also frequently reminded States parties that, in the event of violations 
of human rights and of international law, they are under an obligation to investigate the 
violations and to bring the perpetrators to justice.<b>8</b> The Committee has, for example, 
recommended that the competent authority should ensure that the relatives of disappeared and 
abducted persons have access to information about the fate of the victims, as well as to adequate 
compensation.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>75. In another case, which illustrates the relationship between the right to the truth and other 
rights, the Committee asked the State party to consider other methods of accountability for 
human rights crimes committed under the military dictatorship, including disqualifying 
gross human rights violators from relevant public office and establishing justice and truth inquiry 
processes. The Committee expressed the view that the State party should make public all 
documents relevant to human rights abuses, including the documents currently withheld pursuant 
to a presidential decree.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>76. Moreover, in early 2006, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
published a series of five &#8220;rule-of-law tools&#8221; designed to ensure long-term, sustainable 
institutional capacity to respond to the demands of justice in periods of transition. These tools 
outline the basic principles involved in: mapping the justice sector, prosecution initiatives, truth 
commissions and vetting and monitoring legal systems. A new series dealing with subjects such 
as reparation and the legacy of international tribunals is to be published shortly. Other topics 
are being considered, in particular, national consultations on the implementation of transitional 
justice mechanisms, amnesties and mainstreaming the gender perspective in the transitional 
justice process.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Inter-American system 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Organization of American States (OAS), at its thirty-sixth regular session held in 
June 2006, adopted a resolution<b>11</b> on the right to the truth, in which it recalls that the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights has recognized the right to the truth and that the regional 
community supports recognition of the right of victims of gross violations of human rights and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law, and their families and society as a whole, to 
know the truth regarding such violations to the fullest extent practicable, in particular the identity 
of the perpetrators, the causes and facts of such violations, and the circumstances under which 
they occurred. It also recognizes that States, within the framework of their own internal legal 
systems, should preserve records and other evidence concerning gross violations of human rights 
and serious violations of international humanitarian law, in order to facilitate knowledge of such 
violations, investigate allegations, and provide victims with access to an effective remedy in 
accordance with international law and in order to prevent these violations from occurring again 
in the future. It stresses the importance of ad hoc or non-judicial mechanisms, such as truth and 
reconciliation commissions, that complement the justice system and encourages States members 
of OAS to disseminate and implement their recommendations. It has furthermore tasked the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights with the preparation of a report on the right to the 
truth. 
</p>
<p>78. In numerous cases which it adjudicated in 2006 and 2007,<b>12</b> the Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights recalled that the families of victims of serious human rights violations had the 
right to know the truth and that that right was linked to the right to reparation and to the 
obligations of States to conduct impartial and thorough investigations and to prohibit impunity. 
The Court affirmed that when that right to the truth was recognized and exercised in a specific 
situation, it constituted an important measure of reparation for the victim and his family and was 
an expectation that the State must satisfy.<b>13</b> According to the Court, the establishment of the truth 
as to the facts and the circumstances in which human rights violations were committed helps to 
preserve the historical memory, to make reparation to the victims&#8217; next of kin and to avoid the 
repetition of similar acts.<b>14</b>

</p>
<p>79. Finally, the Inter-American Court stresses that, while the establishment of truth 
commissions is an important means of seeking and establishing the truth, the &#8220;historical truth&#8221; 
which commissions establish &#8220;does not substitute the State&#8217;s obligation to also establish the truth 
through judicial proceedings&#8221;.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Mercosur 
</b></p>
<p>80. In the framework of Mercosur (the Common Market of the Southern Cone), the question of 
the right to truth was discussed at the sixth meeting of Mercosur high-level human-rights 
authorities and foreign ministries (5 and 6 December 2006). After that meeting, the States 
members of Mercosur and of the &#8220;Somos Mercosur&#8221; programme adopted a declaration, at the 
Mercosur Social Summit held on 14 December 2006, highlighting &#8220;the importance of 
guaranteeing the right to truth and to memory&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The right to know the truth about gross human rights violations and serious 
violations of humanitarian law is recognized in some international treaties and 
instruments, in the national legislation of several countries, in national, regional and 
international jurisprudence and by many international and regional intergovernmental 
organizations.</b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>The right to the truth presupposes the disclosure of the whole and complete truth 
about the events that occurred, the specific circumstances attending them and the 
individuals involved, including the circumstances in which the violations were committed 
and the reasons for their commission. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> While the right to the truth is an individual right of victims and their families, it also 
has a collective and a societal dimension. At that level, the right to the truth is closely 
linked to the rule of law and the principles of transparency, accountability and good 
governance in a democratic society. Together with justice, memory and reparation, it 
constitutes one of the mainstays of action to combat impunity for grave human rights 
violations and breaches of international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The question of the right to the truth is a complex one, because this right is closely 
linked to several obligations of States, particularly those of protecting and guaranteeing 
human rights, effectively investigating gross human rights violations and serious violations 
of humanitarian law and guaranteeing adequate remedies and reparation for victims and 
their families. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> Although the right to the truth is an autonomous right, it is closely linked to other 
human rights such as the right to an effective remedy; the right to the protection of the law 
and the courts; the right to a family life; the right to an effective investigation; the right to 
a hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal; the right to obtain

</b>  Judgement of 29 November 2006, <i>La Cantura v. Peru</i>. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>reparation; the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment; and the right to seek 
and to impart information. As indicated in many communications which States and 
non-governmental organizations have submitted to the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, the right to the truth is a fundamental right which States must 
guarantee fully and effectively. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> Because it is linked to other fundamental rights and to the fundamental obligations of 
States, particularly the obligation to combat impunity, the right to the truth is an 
inalienable and inderogable right. Amnesties and similar measures and restrictions on the 
right to seek information must not be used to limit, nullify or impair the right to the truth. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The right to the truth, as is clear from the communications received, is evolving 
steadily. In recent years, national laws and other measures have been adopted. In many 
countries, international and regional human rights organizations and courts and national 
courts have developed a significant body of jurisprudence on the right to the truth, its 
essence and scope, thereby helping to flesh out the meaning of the right. New international 
legal instruments, which deal with the question of the right to the truth, have been adopted 
in recent years. Many aspects and dimensions of the right to the truth require further 
analysis, however. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> The right to the truth touches on many questions. For example, as many States and 
non-governmental organizations have acknowledged, the right to the truth is closely 
related to the question of historical memory and the duty of both the State and society to 
preserve that memory. The societal dimension of the right to the truth, which is linked to 
the question of historical memory, raises specific issues that would repay a closer study, 
including the question of records and of the historical memory. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> With regard to the workings of criminal justice, many communications stress the 
vital role of criminal proceedings in upholding the right to the truth. The role of victims 
and their families in criminal proceedings, the relevant international standards and 
national and international practices should be analysed in detail. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> With regard to institutional means and mechanisms for guaranteeing, safeguarding 
and implementing the right to the truth, the national experiences of which the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has been apprised point to a diverse 
range of modalities. International criminal courts, truth commissions, investigation 
commissions, national criminal courts, national human rights institutions and other bodies 
and administrative procedures, means of recourse such as habeas corpus and <i>habeas data 
</i>and historical records can be important means of guaranteeing the right to truth. When it 
comes to guaranteeing and implementing the right to truth, however, experiences differ 
and results are uneven. These institutional means and mechanisms should be analysed 
more fully. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The above-mentioned aspects - records, the historical memory, the role of victims and 
their families in criminal proceedings and institutional means and mechanisms - should be 
studied and analysed in greater detail in order not only to draw lessons from them but also 
to elaborate recommendations and standards to better protect and guarantee the right to 
the truth. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>92.<b> The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends 
that the right to the truth should continue to be examined with a view to a better 
understanding of this right, particularly the aspects mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 
To that end, the Office recommends that one or several in-depth studies be conducted on 
the following aspects of the right to the truth: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The contribution of criminal justice systems - both national and international - 
to the implementation and effective protection of the right to the truth and particularly the 
role of victims and their families in criminal proceedings; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The question of records and the right to the truth, with a view to the creation of 
guidelines on protecting records concerning human rights violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Institutional means, procedures and mechanisms to improve the 
implementation of the right to the truth - on the individual and the societal levels - taking 
account of national experiences and developments in international law.
