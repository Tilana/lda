<p><b>  Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comments on the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in 
South Sudan from 6 to 15 November 2013. 
</b>1. The Government of South Sudan expresses its appreciation to the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur, Dr Chaloka Beyani in order to acquaint himself with the conditions of the 
internally displaced persons in South Sudan. During his visit he has gathered a lot of 
information on the situation of IDPs which constitute the basis of rending his Report. The 
Report reflects his findings and observations taking into consideration the Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement which seek to protect all internally displaced persons in 
internal conflict situations, natural disasters and other situations of forced displacement. 
These Principles are consistent with international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law and other international standards relevant to the protection and assistance 
of internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>2. The Government appreciates the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s Report which is designed to 
address the challenges the IDPs are facing in the Republic of South Sudan due to a number 
of factors. The Government is also appreciative of the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on issues relating to improving the conditions of IDPs and supporting the 
institutional capacity building in collaboration with other stakeholders. However, the 
Report contains quite a number of issues of concern which deserve clarifications. In order 
to clarify the position of the Government, the Government has made the following 
comments on the preceding paragraphs of the Report.  
</p>
<p>3. Part II B Paragraph 11 
</p>
<p>In paragraph 11 of the Report, the Special Rapporteur stated that the dismissal of the entire 
cabinet in July 2013 led to political instability which resulted in endemic violent conflict 
that broke within the SPLA in December 2013. 
</p>
<p>Comment 
</p>
<p>It is normal for any Government to dissolve or reshuffle its entire cabinet and this does not 
amount to political instability. The Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South 
Sudan, 2011 empowers the President of the Republic of South Sudan to appoint, reshuffle, 
dissolve and re-appoint the cabinet. Moreover, the dissolution of the last cabinet was based 
on demand by the people for a lean Government and also supported by the international 
community. Therefore, it is the failed coup attempt by Dr Riak Machar that led to this 
current political instability. 
</p>
<p>4. Part II B Paragraph 13 
</p>
<p>In paragraph 13 of the Report, the Special Rapporteur stated that while South Sudan is a 
signatory to the major UN human rights treaties as well as the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights 1985, ratification and implementation of these instruments are vital to 
contribute to the stability of the country and the well-being of the South Sudanese people. 
</p>
<p>Comment 
</p>
<p>The Government is committed to protection of fundamental human rights enshrined in all 
major international and regional human rights instruments. All these major international 
human rights treaties have been approved by the Council of Ministers and submitted to the 
National Legislative Assembly for ratification. Others are before the relevant Parliamentary </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>Specialised Committees. The following have been ratified by the National Legislative 
Assembly: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment 1984; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989; 
(c) The African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights was adopted in 1981. It entered 
into force in 1986 and not in 1985 as indicated in the Report; 
</p>
<p>(d) The Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa 
1969 
</p>
<p>5. Part III A Paragraph 22 
</p>
<p>In paragraph 22, the Special Rapporteur stated that many people in Pibor have been 
internally displaced as result of the conflict between David Yau Yau rebel group. 
</p>
<p>Comment 
</p>
<p>The Government of the Republic South Sudan has lately signed a peace agreement with 
David Yau Yau&#8217;s group. Hence, there is no longer any conflict between the SPLA and this 
group. As such many people have returned to their respective areas. 
</p>
<p>6. Part III A Paragraph 23 
</p>
<p>In Paragraph 23 of the Report, it is stated that the armed conflict that unfolded in December 
2013 has become increasingly entrenched along ethnic lines. It is also stated in the Report 
that the return of the IDPs within the UN premises is not possible due the prevailing 
security situation and especially young men are reluctant to leave due to fear of being 
targeted. 
</p>
<p>Comment 
</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the SPLA comprises all ethnic groups who are currently defending 
the country from the rebellion. The conflict does not have an ethnic dimension.  
</p>
<p>As to the issue of the IDPs, who are believed to be hesitant to vacate the UNMISS 
compounds citing security concerns, it should be noted that quite a good number of IDPs 
have left UNMISS compounds. Many have returned to their homes and to work in Juba and 
other States and there are no cases of them being targeted by the Government or any group. 
</p>
<p>7. Part III A Paragraph 24 
</p>
<p>In paragraph 24 of the Report, it is stated that armed forces and Government officials 
attempted to force their entry into UN protected areas for IDPs in Bor and there is a duty on 
the part of the government to refrain from such acts. It is also stated that there is a 
significant concern about the recruitment of children into the military. 
</p>
<p>Comment 
</p>
<p>The Government honours its obligations under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)and 
is conscious of the fact that any such forced attempt of entry into UNMISS compound 
constitutes a violation of the Agreement. To clarify the situation, the Government had 
wanted to talk to UNMISS staff about the issue of weapons sneaked into its compound in 
Bor by some rebels. The Government had kindly requested UMNISS to handover the 
weapons and stated clearly that it had nothing to do with the rebels who sought refuge in 
UNMISS compound as they are under UNMISS protection.  
</p>
<p>As to the issue of recruitment of children, such recruitment is prohibited under the 
constitution and other applicable laws in force in the Republic of South Sudan. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan, 2011 prohibits recruitment of 
children under the age of 18. There are also other statutory laws which prohibit such 
recruitment in particular the SPLA Act 2009 and the Child Act 2008. The Republic of 
South Sudan has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 20 December 2013 
and has a duty to ensure that Children under the age of 18 are not recruited into the Army. 
The Child Act gives effect to the provisions of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>8. Part III A Paragraph 25 
</p>
<p>In paragraph 25 of the Report, it is stated that the IDPs within UNMISS protected areas 
face a congested and overcrowded situation prone to politicised ethnic tensions and health 
hazards. 
</p>
<p>Comment 
</p>
<p>The congestion of IDPs in UNMISS compounds is no longer there anymore. As stated 
earlier, many of the IDPs have returned to their homes and to work. As for some still living 
in UNMISS compounds, it has been agreed between the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General, Hilde Johnson and the Minister of Cabinet Affairs, Dr Martin Elia 
Lomoro to open new houses for them.  
</p>
<p>9. Part III Paragraph 45 (c) 
In paragraph 45 (c) of the report, it is stated that the Government of South Sudan including 
its armed and police forces and all other parties to the conflict must refrain from directly or 
indirectly inciting communities against each other for political or other reasons. 
</p>
<p>Comment 
</p>
<p>Neither the Government of South Sudan nor any of its organised forces do directly or 
indirectly incite communities against each other for political or other reasons.<b>
