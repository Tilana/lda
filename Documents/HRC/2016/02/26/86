Thirtieth session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 5 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 1 October 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>30/13. Promotion and protection of the human rights of peasants 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other people working in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Determined</i> to foster strict respect for the purposes and principles enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and all other 
</p>
<p>relevant human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 13/4 of 24 March 2010, 16/27 
</p>
<p>of 25 March 2011 and 19/7 of 22 March 2012 on the right to food, and in particular Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 21/19 of 27 September 2012 and 26/26 of 27 June 2014 on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of the human rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the imperative need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 
</p>
<p>2015 in order to contribute to making the right to development a reality for everyone, and 
</p>
<p>welcoming the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> General Assembly resolution 66/222 of 22 December 2011, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly declared 2014 the International Year of Family Farming, and welcoming also its 
</p>
<p>resolution 68/232 of 20 December 2013, in which the Assembly declared 2015 the 
</p>
<p>International Year of Soils, 
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> that hunger, like poverty, is still predominantly a rural problem, 
</p>
<p>and that in the rural population it is those who produce food who suffer disproportionately, 
</p>
<p>and alarmed that 75 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, particularly 
</p>
<p>in developing countries, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, as 
</p>
<p>well as subsistence farmers, and that they are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, 
</p>
<p>malnutrition, discrimination and exploitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that livelihoods in rural areas are disproportionately affected by 
</p>
<p>poverty, climate change, lack of development and lack of access to scientific progress, 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>

<p><i>Convinced</i> <i>of the need</i> to strengthen the protection and realization of the human 
</p>
<p>rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the report of the open-ended intergovernmental working group on a 
</p>
<p>United Nations declaration on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas 
</p>
<p>on its second session,<footnote name="1">A/HRC/30/55. </footnote> held from 2 to 6 February 2015, pursuant to Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 21/19 and 26/26, and in particular the inputs from Governments, regional 
</p>
<p>groups, civil society and relevant stakeholders, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the development of this issue, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> that the working group with the mandate to negotiate, finalize and 
</p>

</p>
<p>the working group at its second session will be translated in all official languages of the

</p>
<p>held on this basis, taking into consideration the report of the Chair-Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>second session; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Requests</i> the Chair-Rapporteur of the working group to conduct informal 
</p>
<p>consultations during the intersessional periods, as appropriate, with Governments, relevant 
</p>
<p>special procedures of the Human Rights Council, regional groups, intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, United Nations mechanisms, civil society and representatives of peasants 
</p>
<p>and other people working in rural areas, as well as with other relevant stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>other relevant specialized agencies of the United Nations system; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>

</p>
<p>expert panellists, including representatives of peasants and other people working in rural 
</p>
<p>areas, civil society and grass-roots organizations from developing countries, in order to 
</p>
<p>contribute to the analysis and interactive dialogues; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the working 
</p>
<p>group with the human, technical and financial assistance necessary for it to fulfil its 
</p>
<p>mandate, and to prepare a background study for the working group in relation to the rights 
</p>
<p>included in the draft declaration before the third session of the working group; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Invites</i> States, civil society and all relevant stakeholders, in particular
