<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth 
session from 21 May to 4 June 2012.  The review of India was held at the 8th meeting on 
24 May 2012. The delegation of India was headed by Goolam E. Vahanvati, Attorney 
General of India. At its 13th meeting, held on 30 May 2012, the Working Group adopted 
the report on India. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of India: Kuwait, Mauritius and Mexico. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 16/21 of 25 March 2011, the following 
documents were issued for the review of India: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/13/IND/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/IND/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/IND/3; and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to India through the troika. These questions 
are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of India stated that India saw the universal periodic review (UPR) 
mechanism as one of constructive engagement. The fact that the delegation consisted of 
experts from various ministries of the Central Government bore testimony to India&#8217;s 
commitment to this process. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation outlined the methodology used in the preparation of the National 
Report which included an extensive and inclusive consultation process involving various 
Ministries of the Government, experts and civil society.  The report was posted on the 
website and made accessible to the general public. Ranbir Singh, Vice-Chancellor of 
National Law University, Delhi, was given the task of preparing this report with the 
extensive involvement of various stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>7. The annexures in the national report highlighted the evolution of fundamental rights 
in India&#8217;s Constitution through judicial pronouncements over the years. This reflected a 
</p>
<p>vibrant and evolving Constitution, which placed human rights in the forefront of 
governance. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation highlighted some significant developments in the field of human 
rights.  The Right to Information Act (RTI) had revolutionized the concept of good 
governance. Several seminal laws brought in a rights-based approach to subjects which 
were fundamental to human existence, inter alia, work and employment, education and food </p>


<p>security. These included the landmark Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), the Right to Education Act of 2009 and the National Food 
Security Bill. 
</p>
<p>9. Transparency in governance was brought about through the RTI, Citizens Charter 
and E-governance. The right to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of 
fundamental rights was elevated by the Constitution to the status of a fundamental right. 
Also, enforcement of social, economic and political rights was advanced by the effective 
use of &#8220;public interest litigation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. Terrorism and insurgency posed existential threats. Left-wing extremism and 
violence was an internal challenge which was being met with resolve coupled with 
compassion and people-oriented development. 
</p>
<p>11. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) 1948 was held to be constitutional 
by the Supreme Court. Several checks and balances had been introduced with strict 
guidelines when dealing with terrorists and insurgents, and that violations were dealt with 
swiftly and transparently. The implementation of this Act remained under constant review. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation referred to India&#8217;s standing invitation to special procedures of the 
Council and stated that in 2011 Christoph Heyns, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, visited India. The Supreme Court and National Human 
Rights Commission (NHRC) promptly looked into allegations of enforced disappearances. 
Also, India had been working closely with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
to strengthen response against trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>13. For centuries, India had welcomed all religious denominations, minorities and 
refugees, including the Jewish community which had lived in India for thousands of years 
without discrimination, and the Zorastrians/Parsis over hundreds of years or, more recently, 
refugees from Tibet, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and other countries. India&#8217;s practices on refugees 
were far more developed, caring and humane than that provided for in the current 
international regime. 
</p>
<p>14. The last four years had seen tremendous strides in focusing on groups needing 
special attention including children, women, the disabled, the elderly, minorities, Scheduled 
Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 
</p>
<p>15. India&#8217;s efforts in the sphere of social and economic advancement had been 
significant.  Poverty had declined by 9 per cent in a decade.  MGNREGA played an 
extremely crucial role and provided 54 million households with employment in 2010 and 
</p><p>2011.  Forty-eight per cent of the employment created was for women. The declining trend 
in the unemployment rate between the years 2004&#8211;05 and 2009&#8211;10 was equally visible 
among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and minorities. 
</p>
<p>16. India was also striving to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  It was on 
course to meet the universal primary education goals. The infant mortality rate decreased 
appreciably from 58 per thousand live births in 2005 to 47 in 2010. The maternal mortality 
rate was down from 254 in 2004 to 212 per 100,000 live births in 2008, though much more 
needed to be done. 
</p>
<p>17. The Right to Education Act made primary education a fundamental right and 
required the State to provide, by law, free and compulsory education to all children of the 
age of 6 to 14 years. This Act contained several visionary changes, including the 
requirement that schools must admit a minimum of 25 per cent of children who belong to 
weaker sections and disadvantaged groups. This was a significant step towards social and 
cultural integration and elimination of disparities in the country. </p>


<p>18. The success of Government&#8217;s programmes such as Sarvashiksha Abhiyan has led to 
high levels of enrolment in schools. 
</p>
<p>19. Equal emphasis had been placed on children&#8217;s well-being with enhancement of their 
food and nutrition through mid-day meals programmes in schools; and also on the 
availability of teachers and their retention. Civil society had contributed positively in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>20. Rural habitation with access to primary schools had increased from 87 per cent in 
2002 to 99 per cent in 2008. Female literacy showed considerable improvement by nearly 
50 per cent in the last decade. Marginalized and minority group trends were also 
converging towards the national average in terms of literacy rate. 
</p>
<p>21. While the figures of child labour dropped sharply in the last decade, the problem of 
children who were neither working nor studying continued. In 2007, the National 
Commission for the Protection of Child Rights was established. 
</p>
<p>22. With regard to empowerment of women, the delegation stated that over one million 
of the over 3 million elected local representatives in Panchayats or village-level self-
government were women. Gender was being mainstreamed through several initiatives, 
including gender budgeting in all Government policies and programmes. A National 
Mission for Empowerment of Women was launched in March 2010. 
</p>
<p>23. India&#8217;s programme of affirmative action was unique in scale and dimension. The 
guarantee of equality in the Constitution was a positive mandate for eradication of 
inequalities and discrepancies. 
</p>
<p>24. Several recent steps have been taken to impact positively on the lives of the 
Scheduled Castes as well as the tribal population. Under the Scheduled Tribes and other 
Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, as of February 2012, 
India had settled 2.72 million claims out of the 3.17 million filed, or 86 per cent of the total 
claims and 1.25 million titles distributed. The Prime Minister&#8217;s new 15-point programme 
for the welfare of minorities was being actively pursued. Certain proportion of development 
projects was being earmarked for minorities&#8217; concentration areas. 
</p>
<p>25. The delegation stated that more than 90 per cent of all households used improved 
sources of drinking water in 2008&#8211;09. 
</p>
<p>26. The National Food Security Bill was a historic initiative in ensuring food security, as 
it marked a paradigm shift from welfare to a rights-based approach. People had access to 
adequate quantity and quality of food at affordable prices, enabling them to live a life of 
dignity. About two thirds of the population would be entitled to receive subsidized food 
grains under Targeted Public Distribution System. There was special focus on women, 
children and other Special Groups. 
</p>
<p>27. The Public Service Delivery Acts enacted by more than 12 states of India guaranteed 
specified service standards to the vulnerable sections of the society. &#8220;Aadhaar&#8221; would give 
a unique identity to all residents to ensure streamlined and effective access to social and 
organized infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>28. The delegation stated that India&#8217;s establishment of the National Green Tribunal was 
yet another innovative action widely welcomed internationally. 
</p>
<p>29. The delegation stated that in 2011, Margaret Sekkagya, Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, visited India. It mentioned the Government&#8217;s active 
association with civil society and the increasing and important role that civil society and 
human rights defenders are playing in the area of human rights. The media, civil society 
and other activists have helped the Government to be vigilant against transgressions. The </p>


<p>National Human Rights Commission strived to strengthen human rights practices and 
served as the moral compass of the nation. 
</p>
<p>30. Freedom of religion was guaranteed under article 25 of the Constitution. The 
problem arose when the act of propagating one&#8217;s religion transgressed the limits and 
stopped being voluntary, and instead became coercive or induced. Some states had taken 
exception to this. These issues could be challenged and the person had every right to 
approach the courts. 
</p>
<p>31. The delegation thanked the &#8220;troika&#8221; countries of Kuwait, Mexico and Mauritius for 
facilitating the process. It reiterated India&#8217;s pledge of continued engagement with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and the Council and that over the years has made several contributions to 
human rights-related bodies in the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>32. The delegation stated that India was a huge country and by reason of its area and 
diversity alone there were bound to be problems. India had the ability to self-correct and 
redress mechanisms were available. The delegation quoted Mahatma Gandhi who said, 
&#8220;You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean. If a few drops of the ocean 
</p>
<p>were dirty, the ocean does not become dirty&#8221;, and added that India was indeed a vast ocean. 
It expressed confidence that India would be able to deliver to every person their full rights 
and entitlements. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>33. During the interactive dialogue, 80 delegations made statements. Many delegations 
thanked India for the presentation of its comprehensive national report and expressed 
appreciation for its engagement with the UPR. Recommendations made during the dialogue 
are to be found in section II of this report. 
</p>

</p>
<p>74. India<b> </b>stated that the Convention against Torture may only be ratified once the 
definition of torture was  fully reflected in domestic legislation. The Lok Sabha passed the 
Prevention against Torture Bill in 2010 but the Rajya Sabha referred the Bill to a Select 
Committee whose report was being examined. Nevertheless, there were sufficient 
provisions in Indian law prohibiting torture, including the Indian Penal Code. Also, the 
right to life under article 21 of the Constitution encompassed the right to live with dignity. 
The provisions in the Constitution and Criminal Procedure Code against self-incrimination, 
the obligation to produce an arrestee before a magistrate within 24 hours of such arrest and 
to ensure that the arrestee is informed of the grounds of arrest, provide further safeguards. 
</p>
<p>75. Freedom of speech and expression was a fundamental right, guaranteed by the 
Constitution, with accepted restrictions. India&#8217;s vibrant media bore testimony to this. The 
</p>
<p>Information Technology Act amended in 2011 had no provision to restrict or block Internet 
contents. Removal of illegal contents, including child pornography, should not be construed 
as restricting Internet freedom; such restrictions were addressed towards cyber-security, 
essential for increasing e-commerce and Internet use. 
</p>
<p>76. The delegation stated that through MGNREGA, over 12 billion person-days of work 
had been generated with a total expenditure of over US$ 30 billion, benefitting 54 million 
families. It also provided a safety net to the 92 per cent of workers who are unorganized, 
mostly in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>77. The death penalty was imposed with strong procedural safeguards when life 
imprisonment appeared inadequate. The President of India and the Governors of the 
respective states had the power to grant pardons, reprieves, remission or suspension for any 
offence.  Statistics on the death penalty and commutations granted were provided. </p>


<p>78. With regard to the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual (LGBT)  
persons, the delegation stated that article 15 of the Constitution clearly prohibited 
discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Article 16 provided 
for equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. The Delhi High Court 
judgment in 2009 had decriminalized consensual sex between adults of the same sex in 
private. Transgender persons also had the right to be listed as &#8220;other&#8221; rather than &#8220;male&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;female&#8221; on electoral rolls and voter identity cards. 
</p>
<p>79. The norms of the Right to Education Act and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan ensured 
inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream education. It made education 
accessible, ensured physical mapping, educational placement, provision of aids and 
appliances, training of teachers etc. Of the 3 million children identified, 2.6 million had 
been enrolled, 20,000 teachers and 24,000 voluntary supporters appointed, 751,000 schools 
made barrier free. 
</p>
<p>80. In response to an inquiry about the time frame for passing the Constitutional 
Amendment Bill reserving one third seats in the Lok Sabha and the State Assemblies for 
women, the delegation stated that the Rajya Sabha passed the bill in 2010 and it was 
currently in the Lok Sabha. It was therefore not appropriate for it to comment on the time 
frame. 
</p>
<p>81. The adequate and comprehensive legislative provisions existed to protect human 
rights defenders (HRDs). The highest court of the land could be invoked directly for 
violation of human rights. NHRC also had several measures focusing on protection of 
HRDs. 
</p>
<p>82. With regard to restrictions imposed by the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, 
the delegation stated that it welcomed foreign funds for charitable purposes, subject to 
regulation, to ensure that no money was diverted to terrorist financing or money laundering. 
This is incumbent on India as a member of the Financial Action Task Force. 
</p>
<p>83. Regarding the AFSPA, the delegation reiterated that the issue had already been 
covered in the opening statement. 
</p>
<p>84. India&#8217;s federal structure required a bottom-up approach for developing a national 
plan reflecting a range of views. While the NHRC had been entrusted with this task, it had 
to be an inclusive process bringing together different strands of policy perspectives. 
Various ministries had already woven human rights issues into their own action plans. 
</p>
<p>85. The delegation stated that India recognized the problem of child labour and was 
committed to progressively eliminating it in a coordinated and sustainable manner. As a 
result of the approach taken, child labour had declined by 45 per cent in the last five years. 
</p>
<p>86. The delegation reiterated India&#8217;s commitment to strengthen implementation of 
Domestic Violence Act of 2005. 
</p>
<p>87. Securing equal rights to property acquired during marriage was a complex subject 
with every religion having its own specific approach to this issue. An amendment to Hindu 
Marriage Act was before Parliament. 
</p>
<p>88. The delegation stated that a socio-economic caste census was under way and would 
take into account multiple dimensions of deprivations for arriving at specific entitlements 
under Government programmes and schemes. 
</p>
<p>89. The delegation stated that more than 84 per cent of households had drinking water. 
According to the Joint Monitoring Programme Report 2012 by WHO and UNICEF, India
