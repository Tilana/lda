JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

[1]     
This application is an abuse of process. The matter was heard fully in the February Session and it was dismissed. The document filed on 2 May 2008 describes itself as an application for leave to file 25 additional grounds. None of them raises any new matter. Most of them involve a contemptuous canvassing of this Courts reasons. There is a passing reference to s.122(5) of the Constitution, which empowers this Court to review an earlier order. However nothing has occurred since February 2008 justifying an application to exercise such jurisdiction. 

[2]     
We were told today that the applicant wishes to challenge his sentence. He has not yet done so in the Court of Appeal. Whether that Court would entertain an application to do so at this time is a matter for it. This Court has not addressed the matter of sentence.

[3]     
The petition is dismissed, and the Court orders that no further petition or application relevant to conviction be filed in this matter in the Supreme Court without the leave of a Judge of the High Court which may be granted or refused in Chambers without an oral hearing.
