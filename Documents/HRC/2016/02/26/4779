human rights for all, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing in particular</i> the important and valuable work of Monsignor Oscar

his messages, in which he denounced violations of the human rights of the most vulnerable 
populations,

humanity, in the context of armed conflicts, as a humanist dedicated to defending human 
rights, protecting lives and promoting human dignity, his constant calls to dialogue and his 
opposition to all forms of violence to avoid armed confrontation, which consequently led to 
his death on 24 March 1980,
