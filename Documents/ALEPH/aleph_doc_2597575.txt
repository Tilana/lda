Directors’ Report  
 
Operating and Financial Review 
 
The following operating results and key events from FY16 are discussed in this Directors’ Report. 
 
Summary of results and events
• 
•
Beach produced 9.7 MMboe, of which oil accounted for 53% and gas and gas liquids accounted for 47%.   
Total oil production was 5.2 MMbbl, up 12% from FY15 due to successful completion of the merger with 
Drillsearch, new wells brought online and various field development projects.
•  Gas and gas liquids production was 4.5 MMboe, down 1% from FY15 as successful drilling campaigns and new
•
•
•
•
•
wells online offset natural field decline.   
Capital expenditure of $184 million was down $232 million from FY15, with discretionary expenditure proactively 
managed due to the continuing environment of lower oil prices.  
Consequently, less drilling was undertaken with 51 wells completed at an overall success rate of 90%.  
Exploration and appraisal wells accounted for 31% and 24% of total wells, respectively, with success rates of 75% 
and 92%, respectively.  
Beach successfully completed the merger with Drillsearch, which provided full ownership of key Western Flank oil 
and gas permits, additional gas and gas liquids exploration acreage, and expected annual pre-tax cost savings of 
up to $40 million.   
An organisational review was completed in conjunction with a global consulting firm, and various 
recommendations regarding structure and headcount were implemented. 
Beach continued to deliver results in line with its vision to become a premier multi-basin upstream oil and gas 
company, focussed on delivering sustainable growth in shareholder value.

Western Flank Oil 
Beach’s  Western  Flank  oil  operations  comprise  interests  in  operated  and  non-operated  permits  which  account  for  the 
majority of Beach’s oil production and free cash flow generation.  Western Flank oil operations include a 100% interest in 
ex PEL 91, a 75% operated interest in ex PEL 92, and a 40% non-operated interest in ex PEL 104 / 111.  The successful 
merger with Drillsearch and various field development projects resulted in increased Western Flank oil production in FY16.  
Net production was 4.0 MMbbl (11,000 bopd), up 17% from FY15.  
 
Ex PEL 91 (Beach 100%) 
Beach’s interest in ex PEL 91 increased from 40% to 100% upon completion of the merger with Drillsearch, with additional 
production  recognised  from  1  March  2016.    Gross  oil  production  of  4.4  MMbbl  was  up  8%  from  FY15,  and  net  oil 
production  of  2.6  MMbbl  was  up  59%  from  FY15.    Production  benefited  from  commissioning  of  new  facilities  at  the 
Stunsail and Pennington fields, new wells brought online and various production optimisation initiatives, including variable 
speed beam pump installations in the Chiton, Kalladeina and Sceale fields.  Three wells were drilled within the permit area, 
including two successful appraisal wells in the Bauer Field.  At year-end, 2P reserves were 10.0 MMboe (up 4.2 MMboe). 
  
Ex PEL 92 (Beach 75% and operator, Cooper 25%) 
Gross oil production of 1.2 MMbbl (895 kbbl net) was down 20% from FY15, mainly due to natural field decline.  Various 
field development projects and production optimisation initiatives were undertaken to help mitigate natural field decline, 
including two wells brought online in the Callawonga Field, installation of artificial lift and flowline reconfigurations.  No 
drilling activity was undertaken.  At year-end, 2P reserves were 2.7 MMboe (up 0.2 MMboe). 
 
Ex PEL 104 / 111 (Beach 40%, Senex 60% and operator) 
Gross oil production of 1.3 MMbbl (520 kbbl net) was down 21% from FY15, mainly due to natural field decline.  New wells 
brought  online,  including  the  second  Namur  Sandstone  producer,  Martlet  North-1,  and  continued  strong  performance 
from the Growler and Martlet fields helped mitigate natural field decline.  Three wells were drilled within the permit area, 
including two successful development wells.  At year-end, 2P reserves were 1.1 MMboe (down 0.4 MMboe). 
 
Western Flank Gas 
Beach’s Western Flank gas operations comprise interests in operated and non-operated permits, which provide a material 
contribution to Beach’s gas and gas liquids production.  Western Flank gas operations include a 100% interest in ex PEL 
106,  a  40%  non-operated  interest  in  ex  PEL  513  /  632,  and  various  other  interests  in  conventional  and  unconventional 
acreage.  Net production was 370 kboe (1,015 boepd), up 13% from FY15.

For the year ended 30 June 2016 
Directors’ Report  
 
Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
 
Ex PEL 106 (Beach 100%) 
Beach’s interest in ex PEL 106 increased from 50% to 100% upon completion of the merger with Drillsearch, with additional 
production recognised from 1 March 2016.  Gross gas and gas liquids production of 495 kboe was down 24% from FY15, 
and net gas and gas liquids production of 295 kboe was down 10% from FY15.  Production was impacted by natural field 
decline and repair and maintenance works in Q4 FY16 at the Middleton gas separator.  Work continued on the Middleton 
compression  project  and  connection  of  two  new  wells  occurred  at  year-end.    These  new  wells  have  resulted  in  a  near 
doubling of production, with approximately 3,700 boepd produced in July 2016.  Two exploration wells were drilled within 
the permit area, with one success.  At year-end, 2P reserves were 4.8 MMboe (up 2.6 MMboe). 
 
Ex PEL 513 / 632 (Beach 40%, Santos 60% and operator) 
Ex PEL 513 / 632 was acquired as part of the merger with Drillsearch.  Net gas and gas liquids production of 78 kboe was 
recognised since 1 March 2016.  Three wells were drilled within the permit area, including two successful exploration wells 
and one successful appraisal well.  Beach recognised 0.2 MMboe of 2P reserves at year-end. 
 
Delhi 
The Delhi operations comprise non-operated interests in the South Australian Cooper Basin joint ventures (Beach 17.14% 
and 20.21%) and the South West Queensland joint ventures (Beach 20% to 40%).  These joint ventures account for the 
majority of Beach’s gas production and a material portion of oil production.  Net sales gas and gas liquids production of 4.1 
MMboe was down 3% from FY15, as successful drilling campaigns and well connections broadly offset natural field decline.  
Net oil production of 810 kbbl was down 9% from FY15, mainly due to natural field decline.  A total of 36 wells were drilled 
at  a  success  rate  of  97%.    A  five-well  near-field  exploration  campaign  redefined  the  play  fairway  of  the  Whanto-1  gas 
discovery  in  the  Windorah  Trough  in  Queensland.    The  program  delivered  five  new  field  discoveries  and  included 
infrastructure  installations  and  connection  of  previously  stranded  fields.    Other  drilling  activity  focussed  on  liquids-rich 
fields, with seven wells cased and suspended in the Tirrawarra and Gooranie fields, and under-balanced drilling, with three 
wells  cased  and  suspended  in  the  Moomba  South  Field.    Drilling  also  included  gas  appraisal  campaigns  in  the  Durham 
Downs  and  Coolah  complexes  in  Queensland,  infill  drilling  in  the  Moomba  North  Field  in  South  Australia,  and  various 
standalone oil and gas wells across the basin.  At year-end, 2P reserves were 46.5 MMboe (down 12.4 MMboe). 
 
Other operating results and key events 
Operating results and key events from FY16 which occurred outside of Beach’s core Western Flank and Delhi operations 
are discussed below. 
 
Operated oil and gas exploration 
The Thylungra-2 gas exploration well in PL 184 (Beach 80.4% and operator, Australian Gas Fields 19.6%) was cased and 
suspended following the intersection of gas pay across the Toolachee and Patchawarra formations.  The Maroochydore-1 
oil exploration well in ATP 924 (Beach 100%) was plugged and abandoned, however advanced Beach’s understanding of 
the north-eastern flank of the Cooper Basin.  The Jute-1 and Willow-1 gas exploration wells were drilled by Drillsearch in ex 
PEL 101 (Beach 80% and operator, Mid Continent 20%).  Subsequent testing failed to record meaningful gas flow and these 
wells were plugged and suspended. 
 
Acquisition of 3D seismic in the offshore Otway Basin (Beach 30%, 3D Oil 70% and operator) 
Interpretation and mapping of the 974 km2 Flanagan 3D seismic survey in the north of T/49P confirmed the presence of 
two large structures, Flanagan and Whalebone.  A nine month suspension and extension to the permit’s third year licence 
conditions was granted by NOPTA, which will allow analysis to be completed before deciding on future activity. 
 
Withdrawal from joint ventures 
Beach announced its withdrawal, subject to approval of various conditions precedent, of the Basker, Manta and Gummy 
gas field permits VIC/RL 13, 14 and 15 in the offshore Gippsland Basin, ATP 732 on the eastern flank of the Cooper Basin, 
and PEP 52181 in the Taranaki Basin in New Zealand.  These withdrawals were consistent with Beach’s ongoing focus on 
portfolio optimisation and capital allocation to achieve required shareholder returns. 
 
Egypt (Beach 22%, KEE 50% and operator, Dover 28%) 
Production  of  190  kboe  (net  entitlement)  was  up  33%  from  FY15  due  to  new  wells  brought  online  and  a  full  year  of 
operation  of  the  gas  pipeline  from  the  El  Salmiya  Field.    The  pipeline  was  installed  in  late  FY15  to  alleviate  production 
constraints previously encountered due to gas flaring restrictions.  Subsequent to year-end, Beach completed its exit from 
Egypt with the sale of Beach Egypt to Rockhopper.  The sale will provide all cash consideration of up to US$20.5 million 
(subject to certain terms and adjustments).  Further details are contained in the announcement of 17 August 2016.

Directors’ Report  
 
Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
 
Corporate activities 
Significant corporate activities from FY16 are discussed below. 
 
Completion of merger with Drillsearch 
A  scheme  of  arrangement  to  merge  Beach  and  Drillsearch  was  implemented  on  1  March  2016,  and  integration  of  the 
Drillsearch business was completed in Q4 FY16.  The merger delivered a range of benefits, including full ownership of key 
Western  Flank  oil  and  gas  permits,  additional  gas  and  gas  liquids  acreage,  and  an  enlarged  exploration  footprint.    In 
addition,  up  to  $40  million  of  annual  pre-tax  cost  savings  will  be  achieved  in  FY17  due  to  elimination  of  duplicated 
operational and administration functions. 
 
Completion of organisational review 
In conjunction with the integration of Drillsearch, a review of Beach’s organisational structure was completed by a global 
consulting  firm.    The  review  concluded  that  Beach  has  been  operating  with  a  lean  structure  and  top-quartile  staffing 
metrics.  However, various changes were recommended and implemented to ensure Beach’s structure and capabilities are 
aligned with its strategic objectives.  As a consequence, the combined headcount of Beach and Drillsearch reduced from 
301 at 30 June 2015 to 214 at 30 June 2016. 
 
Reserves and resources 
Beach’s reserves and contingent resources as at 30 June 2016 are summarised in the tables below.  Key movements since 
30 June 2015 include volumes produced, additional reserves and resources due to permit interests acquired as part of the 
merger with Drillsearch, a downward revision and reclassification of undeveloped reserves attributable to the SACB and 
SWQ joint ventures, and a downward revision of contingent resources attributable to the Nappamerri Trough natural gas 
project.    Further  information  is  detailed  in  Beach’s  announcement  of  29  August  2016.    No  new  information  has 
subsequently come to hand which would materially alter these estimates or underlying assumptions.

Sales revenue was down 23% from FY15 to $558 million due to lower oil prices.  This reduction in sales revenue 
was partly offset by a lower average A$/US$ exchange rate and higher total sales volumes.
Cost of sales were down 15% from FY15 to $478 million, mainly as a result of lower third party purchases, lower 
depreciation from impairment charges, lower royalties from the fall in the oil price and lower operating costs. 
A net loss after tax of $589 million was reported, as non-cash impairment charges of $635 million and lower oil 
prices offset a strong underlying operating performance.
•  Other expenses were $692 million, $136 million lower than FY15, mainly due to lower asset impairment charges.

Directors’ Report  
 
Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
 
Revenue 
Lower oil prices and third  party  sales volumes in  FY16 contributed to a 23% fall in sales revenue to $558 million ($728 
million in FY15). Higher oil production, higher gas/ethane prices and a lower average A$/US$ exchange rate partly offset 
the reduction in oil prices. Sales revenue from production decreased by $106 million and third party sales decreased by $64 
million. Sales volumes of 10.8 MMboe were 3% higher than FY15 due to higher oil production and gas sales volumes, offset 
by lower third party volumes. 
The average realised oil price  decreased to A$60/bbl, down A$30/bbl from FY15, due to a lower US$ oil price, but was 
partly offset by a fall in the average A$/US$ exchange rate.

Gross Profit 
Gross profit for the full year of $80 million (FY15 $165 million) was down 51%. The fall in gross profit was primarily due to 
lower sales revenue, offset by lower total cost of sales which were down 15% from FY15 to $478 million.  The reduction in 
cost  of  sales  is  principally  due  to  lower  third  party  purchases  ($70  million),  lower  depreciation  and  amortisation  ($70 
million)  and  lower  cash  production  costs  ($10  million)  partly  offset  by  a  decrease  in  inventory  ($65  million).  Cash 
production costs were down $10 million (4%), reflecting lower royalties from the fall in oil prices and lower field operating 
costs as a result of various measures to reduce controllable costs, offset in part by higher pipeline tariffs and processing 
tolls paid due to higher production following the Drillsearch merger. Lower depreciation and amortisation charges were 
mainly due to asset impairment charges taken in FY15 and 1H FY16. Third party oil and gas purchases decreased due to 
lower  oil  prices  and  volumes.  The  decrease  in  inventory  primarily  reflects  a  build-up  of  inventory  during  FY15  and  the 
expensing  of  higher  cost  inventory  in  FY16  following  further  impairment  charges  and  a  change  in  third  party  crude 
inventory. Key movements in gross profit are summarised below:
Net profit/(loss) after tax (NPAT)  
The reported net loss after tax of $589 million is $75 million higher than FY15, primarily due to the sustained fall in oil 
prices over the year.     
Other  expenses  were  down  16%  to  $692  million,  $136  million  lower  than  FY15.  Impairment  charges  (pre-tax)  of  $635 
million were recognised in 1H FY16 and included Cooper Basin assets ($525 million) due to lower oil prices, exploration 
interests ($83 million) including Nappamerri Trough Natural Gas and Tanzania due to limited work programs, and available 
for sale financial assets ($26 million) due to a fall in the market value of these investments.

Underlying NPAT 
By  adjusting  FY16  NPAT  to  exclude  impairment  and  non-recurring  items  (as  summarised  below),  underlying  NPAT  was

Directors’ Report  
 
Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
 
Financial Position
Cash flow from operations of $233 million; and 
Cash balances acquired of $182 million;
Assets 
Total assets decreased by $211 million to $1,626 million. An increase in assets resulting from the successful merger with 
Drillsearch was more than offset by asset impairment write-downs. 
Cash balances increased by $29 million to $199 million, primarily due to: 
• 
• 
partly offset by: 
• 
• 
Receivables decreased by $41 million primarily due to lower prices for sales accruals. Inventories decreased $37 million 
due  to  the  expensing  of  higher  cost  inventory  in  FY16  following  further  impairment  charges.  Available  for  Sale  (AFS) 
financial assets decreased by $33 million, due mainly to the fall in value of investments over the period along with the 
elimination of the investment held in Drillsearch on completion of the merger. Assets held for sale have increased by $44 
million mainly due to increased assets for Egypt and the sale of certain Queensland oil assets by Beach and interests in 
Tintaburra acquired through the merger with Drillsearch.  
Fixed assets, petroleum and exploration assets decreased by $172 million. Amortisation and depreciation of $153 million, 
impairment charges of $609 million and reclassifications to assets held for sale of $7 million, were partly offset by capital 
expenditure of $175 million, increases for restoration of $91 million and assets acquired of $330 million.
Capital expenditure of $216 million; and 
Repayment of Drillsearch convertible notes of $165 million.
Liabilities 
Total liabilities increased by $69 million to $551 million, mainly due to higher restoration provisions of $102 million, offset 
in  part  by  lower  payables  of  $42  million  reflecting  lower  activity  across  the  Cooper  Basin,  and  a  reduced  deferred  tax 
liability of $27 million due to the recognition of deferred tax assets with respect to impairment charges. Other movements 
included an increase in other provisions of $8 million, representing an estimate of onerous contracts and other contingent 
liabilities associated with the Drillsearch merger, lower current tax payable of $6 million and an increase in liabilities held 
for sale of $37 million for the sale of certain Queensland oil assets by Beach and interest in Tintaburra acquired through the 
merger with Drillsearch.  
Equity 
Equity decreased by $280 million, mainly due to the net loss after tax of $589 million and dividends paid during the year of 
$7 million from the profit distribution reserve, partly offset by shares issued during the year (primarily for the Drillsearch 
merger) of $299 million and an increase in other reserves of $16 million, primarily due to the recognition of accumulated 
losses in the available for sale reserve as an impairment expense in the Statement of Profit or Loss.

Operating and Financial Review (continued) 
Dividends 
During the financial year the Company paid the FY15 final fully franked dividend of 0.5 cents per share. The Company will 
also pay an FY16 fully franked final dividend of 0.5 cents per share from the profit distribution reserve.
State of affairs 
In  the  opinion  of  the  directors,  other  than  the  effect  of  the  movement  in  oil  prices  summarised  below,  there  were  no 
significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group that occurred during the financial year under review not disclosed 
elsewhere in the Directors’ Report.
Oil prices 
The average A$ realised oil price for FY16 fell 33% from the average price received in FY15.  This low oil price environment 
resulted in Beach reviewing and significantly reducing its FY16 capital expenditure program.  Beach is also committed to 
reduce operating and corporate costs where possible.   
The  underlying  performance  of  Beach’s  business  is  strong  and  well  positioned  to  take  advantage  of  a  future  oil  price 
recovery.
Matters arising subsequent to the end of the financial year
Egypt divestment 
On 17 August 2016, Beach announced it had completed the sale of Beach Petroleum (Egypt) Pty Ltd, whose core asset is a 
22%  interest  in  the  Abu  Sennan  Concession,  to  Rockhopper  Exploration  plc.  Transaction  terms  provide  for  cash 
consideration of up to US$20.5 million. An upfront payment of US$10.8 million was received on completion, and deferred 
consideration  of  approximately  US$7.4  million  is  expected  over  the  next  12  months  subject  to  receipt  of  outstanding 
receivables.  Payments  received  by  Beach  prior  to  completion  include  a  deposit  of  US$1.1  million  and  outstanding 
receivables of US$1.2 million. In addition to cash consideration payments, a post completion adjustment will be agreed and 
settled  by  early  Q2  FY17  to  account  for  net  cash  flow  attributable  to  the  assets  from  1  January  2016  to completion.  A 
payment to Beach is expected in relation to this adjustment. 
 
Sale of Queensland oil assets 
On 3 August 2016, Beach announced it had entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement with Bridgeport in relation 
to  the  sale  of  various  operated  oil  permit  interests  within  the  greater  Kenmore-Bodalla  area.    The  mature  oil  fields 
comprise Beach’s only operated production in the Queensland area of the Cooper Basin and contributed 140 kbbl of net 
production  in  FY16.    The  transaction  is  expected  to  complete  by  the  end  of  Q2  FY17  and  will  provide  modest  cash 
consideration, manage ongoing liabilities and increase the efficiency of Beach’s Cooper Basin operations. 
 
 
Other than the above matters, there has not arisen in the interval between 30 June 2016 and up to the date of this report, 
any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the directors, to affect substantially 
the operations of the Group, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent financial 
years, unless otherwise noted in the Financial Report.

Future developments
Our strategy 
During FY16, Beach completed its whole-of-organisation review, which aimed to clearly define the Company’s medium and 
long-term strategies, and ensure an appropriate structure and capabilities are in place to achieve the Company’s goals.  
Beach’s  strategy  is  premised  on  a  refreshed  Vision:  We  aim  to  be  Australia’s  premier  multi-basin  upstream  oil  and  gas 
company,  and  a  refreshed  Purpose:  To  deliver  sustainable  growth  in  shareholder  value.    To  achieve  these  goals,  four 
strategic pillars drive all decision-making and serve as a roadmap for the future.  The four strategic pillars are:
•  Optimise our core in the Cooper Basin. 
• 
• 
•  Maintain financial strength.
Build a complementary gas business in east coast basins. 
Pursue compatible growth opportunities in Australia and nearby.
In FY16, Beach demonstrated its ability to deliver results in line with its Vision and Purpose, with tangible progress made 
across each strategic pillar.  Key outcomes are noted below.

FY17 outlook 
 
Capital Expenditure 
Activity in FY17 will focus on proactive management of discretionary expenditure and result in greater allocation of capital 
to Western Flank exploration and development activities, and less capital allocation to the SACB and SWQ joint ventures.  
FY17 capital expenditure is expected to be within the range of $180 – 200 million and reflects Beach’s strict focus on value 
accretive capital allocation.  Approximately 55% of the FY17 program is discretionary expenditure.  These projects have 
been  high-graded  to  maximise  returns  and  have  satisfied  Beach’s  capital  allocation  requirements.    Accordingly,  these 
discretionary projects:

For the year ended 30 June 2016 
Directors’ Report  
 
Operating and Financial Review (continued)
• 
•
Present the most attractive expected return on capital profiles within Beach’s current opportunity set; 
Satisfy strict financial metrics, including but not limited to: NPV, risk weighted NPV, payback period and capital 
efficiency measures; 
Provide near-term line of sight to production and financial return;  
Balance the need for both development and replacement of 2P reserves; and
• 
• 
•  May be selectively deferred if oil prices materially decline.
The  remaining  45%  of  the  FY17  program  is  stay-in-business  and  committed  expenditure  (Fixed  Expenditure).    This  is 
required  expenditure  on  existing  assets  for  purposes  such  as  maintenance,  regulatory  commitments  and  contractual 
obligations.   
 
Western Flank Oil 
Approximately $40 – 48 million of discretionary expenditure is allocated to Beach’s Western Flank oil permits.  An active 
exploration program and a broad suite of development activities are planned to balance the need for both replacement 
and development of 2P reserves.   
 
Exploration activities will target reserve additions through near-field drilling, with up to 12 exploration wells planned across 
Beach’s  operated  and  non-operated  permits.    These  wells  will  be  located  close  to  existing  infrastructure,  thus  enabling 
timely  connection  and  commencement  of  production  in  the  event  of  exploration  success.    Exploration  drilling  will  test 
extensions of existing reservoirs, as well as new play types such as the Birkhead and Patchawarra formations in ex PEL 91.  
If  successful,  these  new  play  types  will  provide  significant  opportunity  for  follow-on  drilling.    Beach  will  also  seek  to 
replenish its seriatim of exploration prospects through the acquisition of approximately 300 km2 of 3D seismic, inversion of 
approximately  1,700  km2  of  3D  seismic,  and  acquisition  of  approximately  200  km  of  2D  seismic.    Broad  ranging 
development activities will be undertaken to mitigate natural field decline and accelerate production where appropriate.  
Activities include up to four development wells, expansion of the Bauer facility to 120,000 barrels of fluid per day (+60% / 
45,000 barrels), additional artificial lift and various other initiatives.   
 
Western Flank Gas 
Approximately $25 – 30 million of discretionary expenditure is allocated to Beach’s Western Flank gas permits. The FY17 
program  is  mainly  focussed  on  reserve  additions  through  exploration  activities,  and  maintaining  maximum  production 
capacity from the Middleton compression project. 
 
Exploration  activities  include  up  to  three  wells  in  ex  PEL  106  which  will  test  near-field  and  step-out  extensions  of  the 
proven gas and gas-liquids fairway.  These wells will be located proximal to existing infrastructure, thus enabling timely 
connection and commencement of production in the event of exploration success.  Acquisition of approximately 250 km2 
of 3D seismic will be undertaken in the underexplored ex PEL 107 permit area to assess a possible southern extension of 
the  ex  PEL  106  fairway.  Development  activities  include  the  Middleton  gas  compression  project  which  aims  to  achieve 
maximum production capacity, well connections and testing of prior year exploration wells.   
 
Delhi 
Approximately $35 - 40 million of discretionary expenditure is allocated to the SACB and SWQ joint ventures, and mainly 
relates to participation in selected gas drilling campaigns.  Beach’s primary objective in relation to FY17 SACB and SWQ 
joint venture expenditure is the cost effective development of gas reserves to satisfy existing contractual obligations.  In 
doing so, Beach will participate in those drilling campaigns which meet our capital allocation requirements and therefore 
provide an attractive expected return on investment.  This approach also preserves capital for deployment within other 
business areas or in line with Beach’s growth strategy. 
 
Total FY17 capital expenditure for the SACB and SWQ joint ventures is expected to be within the range of $75 – 85 million 
(Discretionary and Fixed).  Due to an ongoing focus on reducing costs, and Beach’s ability to selectively participate in most 
drilling  campaigns,  FY17  expenditure  represents  a  reduction  of  approximately  35%  from  FY16,  and  a  reduction  of 
approximately 65% from FY15.  Furthermore, FY17 capital expenditure for the SACB and SWQ joint ventures represents a 
significantly smaller fraction of Beach’s total capital expenditure (c.42%) compared with FY16 (c.66%).  Beach is working 
closely with Santos, operator of the SACB and SWQ joint ventures, in an ongoing drive to further reduce costs and execute 
capital programs as efficiently as possible.

Production 
FY17 production is expected to exceed volumes achieved in FY16, with guidance in the range of 9.7 – 10.3 MMboe and 
comprising  approximately  53%  oil  and  47%  gas  and  gas  liquids.    FY17  production  is  expected  to  be  influenced  by  the 
following factors, which are incorporated into guidance estimates:
↑  Additional oil and gas production from ex PEL 91 and ex PEL 106 due to the merger with Drillsearch;  
↑  Additional oil and gas production from various field development activities, including:
•  Bauer facility expansion: Fluid handling capacity to be increased to 120,000 barrels of fluid per day (+60% / 
45,000 barrels), enabling a material increase in production capacity.  Commissioning is expected in early Q3 
FY17.
•  Middleton compression project: Gas compression to be completed at the Middleton facility in ex PEL 106 to
achieve maximum production capacity.  Commissioning is expected in early Q3 FY17.
•  Full field development plans: Recently completed oil field development plans will be executed during FY17.
Activities include connection of well stock, development drilling, artificial lift and other initiatives.
↓  Natural field decline due to increasing water cuts and recent reductions in drilling activity;  
↓  No further Egypt production post anticipated completion of sale in Q1 FY17; and 
−
Successful FY17 exploration wells assumed to commence production in FY18.
Funding and capital management 
As at 30 June 2016, Beach held cash and cash equivalents of $199.1 million. In December 2015, Beach negotiated a $530 
million secured corporate debt facility comprising a $200 million three year revolving general facility, a $200 million five 
year  revolving  general  facility,  a  $100  million  three  year  revolving  acquisition  facility  and  a  $30  million  letter  of  credit 
facility. The new facility replaced the previous $330 million secured corporate debt facility. As at 30 June 2016, $150 million 
of the three year revolving general facility with a maturity date of 4 December 2018 was drawn, with the remaining $50 
million undrawn.  The $200 million revolving general facility with a maturity date of 4 December 2020 remained undrawn, 
the $100 million revolving acquisition facility with a maturity date of 4 December 2018 remained undrawn, and $19 million 
of the letter of credit facility had been utilised by way of bank guarantees.   
Beach anticipates that its current funding to be adequate for capital expenditure anticipated in the 2017 financial year.
Material Business Risks 
 
Beach  recognises  that  the  management  of  risk  is  a  critical  component  in  Beach  achieving  its  purpose  of  delivering 
sustainable growth in shareholder value.  
 
The Company has a framework to identify, understand, manage and report risks.  As specified in its Board Charter, the 
Board has responsibility for overseeing Beach’s risk management framework and monitoring its material business risks.  
 
Given  the  nature  of  Beach’s  operations,  there  are  many  factors  that  could  impact  Beach’s  operations  and  results.    The 
material business risks that could have an adverse impact on Beach’s financial prospects or performance include economic 
risks,  health,  safety  and  environmental  risks  and  social  licence  to  operate  risks.    These  may  be  further  categorised  as 
strategic risks, operational risks, commercial risks, regulatory risks, reputational risks and financial risks.  A description of 
the  nature of the risk and how such risks are managed is  set out below.  This list  is  neither  exhaustive nor in order of 
importance.
Economic risks: 
Exposure to oil and gas prices 
A  decline  in  the  price  of  oil  and  gas  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  Beach’s  financial  performance.  Historically, 
international  crude  oil  prices  have  been  very  volatile.    A  sustained  period  of  low  or  declining  crude  oil  prices  could 
adversely affect Beach’s operations, financial position and ability to finance developments.  Beach has a policy for hedging 
oil price and currency risks.  Beach has responded to the sustained low oil price by developing a structured framework for 
capital allocation decisions.  The process provides rigorous value and risk assessment against a broad range of business

metrics  and  stringent  hurdles  to  maximise  return  on  capital.    This  process  is  a  significant  development  in  Beach’s 
continuing focus on reducing capital and operating expenditure and improving business efficiency.  
 
Declines in the price of oil and continuing price volatility may also lead to revisions of the medium and longer term price 
assumptions for oil from future production, which, in turn, may lead to a revision of the carrying value of some of Beach’s 
assets. 
 
The valuation of oil and gas assets is affected by a number of assumptions, including the quantity of reserves and resources 
booked in  relation to these oil  and gas assets and their expected cash flows.  An extended or substantial decline  in oil 
and/or gas prices or demand, or an expectation of such a decline, may reduce the expected cash flows and/or quantity of 
reserves  and  resources  booked  in  relation  to  the  associated  oil  and  gas  assets,  which  may  lead  to  a  reduction  in  the 
valuation  of  these  assets.    If  the  valuation  of  an  oil  and  gas  asset  is  below  its  carrying  value,  a  non-cash  impairment 
adjustment to reduce the historical book value of these assets will be made with a subsequent reduction in the reported 
net profit in the same reporting period. 
 
Foreign exchange and hedging risk 
Beach’s  financial  report  is  presented  in  Australian  dollars.    Beach  converts  funds  to  foreign  currencies  as  its  payment 
obligations in those jurisdictions where the Australian dollar is not an accepted currency become due.  Certain of Beach’s 
costs will be incurred in currencies other than Australian dollars, including the US dollar, the New Zealand dollar and the 
Tanzanian  shilling.    Accordingly,  Beach  is  subject  to  fluctuations  in  the  rates  of  currency  exchange  between  these 
currencies. 
 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest 
rate  swaps  to  hedge  certain  risk  exposures,  including  commodity  price  fluctuations  through  the  sale  of  petroleum 
productions and other oil-linked contracts.  The Company does not have a policy to hedge interest rates, which means it 
may be adversely affected by fluctuations in interest rates. 
 
Ability to access funding 
The oil and gas business involves significant capital expenditure on exploration and development, production, processing 
and  transportation.    Beach  relies  on  cash  flows  from operating  activities  and  bank  borrowings  and  offerings  of  debt  or 
equity securities to finance capital expenditure. 
 
If cash flows decrease or Beach is unable to access necessary financing, this may result in postponement of or reduction in 
planned  capital  expenditure,  relinquishment  of  rights  in  relation  to  assets,  or  an  inability  to  take  advantage  of 
opportunities or otherwise respond to market conditions.  Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on 
Beach’s ability to expand its business and/or maintain operations at current levels, which in turn could have a material 
adverse effect on Beach’s business, financial condition and operations. 
 
Beach has a Board approved financial risk management policy covering areas such as liquidity, investment management, 
debt management, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and counterparty credit risk.  The policy sets 
out the organisational structure to support this policy.  Beach has a treasury function and clear delegations and reporting 
obligations.  The annual capital and operating budgeting processes approved by the Board ensure appropriate allocation of 
resources.
Operational risks: 
Joint Venture Operations 
Beach participates in a number of joint ventures for its business activities.  This is a common form of business arrangement 
designed  to  share  risk  and  other  costs.    Under  certain  joint  venture  operating  agreements,  Beach  may  not  control  the 
approval of work programs and budgets and a joint venture partner may vote to participate in certain activities without the 
approval of Beach.  As a result, Beach may experience a dilution of its interest or may not gain the benefit of the activity, 
except at a significant cost penalty later in time.

Directors’ Report  
 
Material Business Risks (continued) 
 
Failure to reach agreement on exploration, development and production activities may have a material impact on Beach’s 
business.  Failure of Beach’s joint venture partners to meet financial and other obligations may have an adverse impact on 
Beach’s business. 
 
Beach works closely with its joint venture partners to minimise joint venture misalignment. 
 
Material change to reserves and resources 
Underground oil and gas reserves and resources estimates are expressions of judgement based on knowledge, experience 
and industry practice.  Estimates which are valid at a certain point in time may alter significantly or become uncertain when 
new oil and gas reservoir information becomes available through additional drilling, or reservoir engineering over the life 
of the field.  As reserves and resources estimates change, development and production plans may be altered in a way that 
may adversely affect Beach’s operations and financial results. 
 
Beach’s  reserves  are  estimated  in  accordance  with  SPE  Petroleum  Resources  Management  System  (PRMS)  guidelines 
(November 2011) and are subject to periodic external review or audit. 
 
Exploration and development  
Success  in  oil  and  gas  production  is  key  and  in  the  normal  course  of  business  Beach  depends  on  the  following  factors: 
successful exploration, establishment of commercial oil and gas reserves, finding commercial solutions for exploitation of 
reserves, ability to design and construct efficient production, gathering and processing facilities, efficient transportation 
and marketing of hydrocarbons and sound management of operations.  Oil and gas exploration is a speculative endeavour 
and  the  nature  of  the  business  carries  a  degree  of  risk  associated  with  failure  to  find  hydrocarbons  in  commercial 
quantities or at all.  
 
Beach  utilises  well-established  prospect  evaluation  and  ranking  methodology  to  manage  exploration  and  development 
risks. 
 
Production risks 
Any oil or gas project may be exposed to production decrease or stoppage, which may be the result of facility shut-downs, 
mechanical  or  technical  failure,  climactic  events  and  other  unforeseeable  events.    A  significant  failure  to  maintain 
production could result in Beach lowering production forecasts, loss of revenue and additional operational costs to bring 
production back online.  
 
There may be occasions where loss of production may incur significant capital expenditure, resulting in the requirement for 
Beach to seek additional funding, through equity or debt.  Beach’s approach to facility design and integrity management is 
critical to mitigating production risks.
Social licence to operate risks: 
Regulatory risk 
Changes in government policy (such as in relation to taxation, environmental protection and the methodologies permitted 
to be used in oil and gas exploration and production activity) or statutory changes may affect Beach’s business operations 
and its financial position.  A change in government regime may significantly result in changes to fiscal, monetary, property 
rights and other issues which may result in a material adverse impact on Beach’s business and its operations. 
 
Companies in the oil and gas industry may also be required to pay direct and indirect taxes, royalties and other imposts in 
addition to normal company taxes.  Beach currently has operations or interests in Australia, New Zealand and Tanzania.  
Accordingly its profitability may be affected by changes in government taxation and royalty policies or in the interpretation 
or application of such policies in each of these jurisdictions. 
 
Beach monitors changes in relevant regulations and engages with regulators and governments to ensure policy and law 
changes are appropriately influenced and understood. 
 
Permitting risk 
All petroleum licences held by Beach are subject to the granting and approval of relevant government bodies and ongoing 
compliance with licence terms and conditions.  
Tenure management processes and standard operating procedures are utilised to minimise the risk of losing tenure.

Directors’ Report  
 
Material Business Risks (continued) 
 
Land access and Native Title 
Beach is required to obtain the consent of owners and occupiers of land within its licence areas.  Compensation may be 
required to be paid to the owners and occupiers of land in order to carry out exploration activities. 
 
Beach operates in a number of areas within Australia that are or may become subject to claims or applications for native 
title  determinations  or  other  third  party  access.    Although  Beach  has  experience  in  dealing  with  native  title  claims  in 
Australia in relation to some of its existing Cooper Basin licences, native title claims have the potential to introduce delays 
in  the  granting  of  petroleum  and  other  licences  and,  consequently,  may  have  an  effect  on  the  timing  and  cost  of 
exploration, development and production. 
 
Native or indigenous title and land rights may also apply or be implemented in other jurisdictions in which Beach operates 
outside of Australia. 
 
Beach’s standard operating procedures and stakeholder engagement processes are used to manage land access and native 
title risks.
Health, safety and environmental risks: 
The business of exploration, development, production and transportation of hydrocarbons involves a variety of risks which 
may impact the health and safety of personnel, the community and the environment.  
 
Oil and gas production and transportation can be impacted by natural disasters, operational error or other occurrences 
which can result  in hydrocarbon leaks or spills, equipment failure and  loss of well control.  Potential failure to manage 
these risks could result in injury or loss of life, damage or destruction of wells, production facilities, pipelines and other 
property, damage to the environment, legal liability and damage to Beach’s reputation. 
 
Losses and liabilities arising from such events could significantly reduce revenues or increase costs and have a material 
adverse effect on the operations and/or financial conditions of Beach. 
 
Beach employs a combination of insurance policies, standard operating procedures, contractor pre-qualification, facility 
design and integrity management systems to mitigate these risks. 
Forward Looking Statements 
This  report  contains  forward-looking  statements,  including  statements  of  current  intention,  opinion  and  predictions 
regarding the Company’s present and future operations, possible future events and future financial prospects. While these 
statements  reflect  expectations  at  the  date  of  this  report,  they  are,  by  their  nature,  not  certain  and  are  susceptible  to 
change.  Beach  makes  no  representation,  assurance  or  guarantee  as  to  the  accuracy  or  likelihood  of  fulfilling  of  such 
forward looking statements (whether expressed or implied), and except as required by applicable law or the ASX Listing 
Rules, disclaims any obligation or undertaking to publicly update such forward-looking statements. 
Material Prejudice 
As permitted by sections 299(3) and 299A(3) of the Corporations Act 2001, Beach has omitted some information from the 
above  Operating  and  Financial  Review  in  relation  to  the  Company’s  business  strategy,  future  prospects  and  likely 
developments in operations and the expected results of those operations in future financial years on the basis that such 
information,  if  disclosed,  would  be  likely  to  result  in  unreasonable  prejudice  (for  example,  because  the  information  is 
premature,  commercially  sensitive,  confidential  or  could  give  a  third  party  a  commercial  advantage).  The  omitted 
information typically relates to internal budgets, forecasts and estimates, details of the business strategy, and contractual 
pricing.

Environmental regulations and performance statement 
Beach  participates  in  projects  and  production  activities  that  are  subject  to  the  relevant  exploration  and  development 
licences prescribed  by government.  These licences specify the  environmental regulations applicable to the exploration, 
construction  and  operations  of  petroleum  activities  as  appropriate.    For  licences  operated  by  other  companies,  this  is 
achieved by monitoring the performance of these companies against these regulations. 
There have been no known significant breaches of the environmental obligations of Beach's operated contracts or licences 
during the financial year. 
Beach reports under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act.

Non-audit services 
Beach  may  decide  to  employ  the  external  auditor  on  assignments  additional  to  their  statutory  audit  duties  where  the 
auditor’s expertise and experience with Beach are important. 
The Board has considered the position and is satisfied that the provision of the non-audit services is compatible with the 
general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001.  The directors are satisfied that the 
provision of non-audit services by the auditor as set out below, did not compromise the audit independence requirement 
of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons: 
•
All non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit Committee to ensure they do not impact the impartiality and 
objectivity of the auditor. 
None of the services undermine the general principle relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code – 
Code  of  Ethics  for  Professional  Accountants,  including  reviewing  or  auditing  the  auditor’s  own  work,  acting  in  a 
management or a decision making capacity for Beach, acting as advocate for Beach or jointly sharing economic risk 
and reward.
•
Details of the amounts paid or payable to the external auditors, KPMG for audit and non-audit services provided during the 
year are set out at Note 28 to the financial statements. 
 
Rounding off of amounts 
Beach is an entity to which ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191 issued by 
the  Australian  Securities  and  Investments  Commission  applies  relating  to  the  rounding  off  of  amounts.    Accordingly, 
amounts in the directors’ report and the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand dollars, 
unless shown otherwise.

Remuneration 
Report
98% ‘YES VOTE’
Total fixed remuneration (TFR) did not increase for senior 
executives from the previous year. Some increases in TFR were 
made due to a change in a role or responsibilities.
The return on capital and a one year relative total shareholder 
return against the ASX 200 Energy Index hurdles were not met so 
no STI was awarded to senior executives for FY16.   
STI performance rights issued in 2012 and 2013 to senior 
executives, following assessment of the performance of KPIs by 
the Board, converted automatically to shares on the employment 
retention condition being met on 1 July 2015.
LTI performance rights issued in December 2012 were measured 
during the year.  The measure over a three year period, Beach’s 
total shareholder return (TSR), was negative so no performance 
rights vested.
Non-executive directors’ base fees and committee fees (other 
than the Risk Committee) did not increase for the financial year. 
Prior to 2015 no committee fees were paid to the chairman or 
members of the Risk Committee.  From 2015 only the chairman 
was paid a fee. A fee is also paid to a director as a sitting fee to 
attend Reserves Committee meetings. 
Mr Beckett was appointed the Deputy Chairman for which  he is 
paid an additional $10,000 per annum (inclusive of 
superannuation). This fee was formerly paid to the Lead 
Independent Director, a position that has been replaced by the 
role of Deputy Chairman.
Beach received more than 98% of “yes” votes on a poll to adopt 
its Remuneration Report for the 2015 financial year.  No specific 
feedback on Beach’s remuneration practices was received at the 
2015 annual general meeting.
Realised cash remuneration paid to senior executives in FY16 
The summary in Table 1 shows what was actually paid to senior executives in the reporting period. It does not include the 
value of any securities issued as STIs or LTIs during the year.  
Disclosures required in the Remuneration Report by the Corporations Act, particularly the inclusion of accounting values 
for LTI performance rights awarded but not vested, can vary significantly from the remuneration actually paid to senior 
executives.  This is because the Accounting Standards require a value to be placed on a right at the time it is granted to a 
senior executive and then reported as remuneration even if ultimately the senior executive does not receive any actual 
value, for example because  performance conditions are not met and the rights do not vest.

Remuneration Report (Audited) 
 
 
This report has been prepared in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) for 
the consolidated entity for the financial year ended 30 June 2016.  This Remuneration Report has been audited as required 
by section 308(3C) of the Corporations Act and forms part of the Directors' Report.  
This  report  details  the  key  remuneration  activities  in  2016  and  provides  remuneration  information  in  relation  to  the 
Company’s  directors,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Company’s  senior  executives  who  are  the  key  management 
personnel (KMP) of the consolidated entity for the purpose of the Corporations Act and the Accounting Standards.

2. Beach’s remuneration policy framework 
Beach’s purpose is to deliver sustainable growth in shareholder value.
Beach’s remuneration policy framework for its senior executives is designed to:
•
•
•
Attract, motivate and retain a skilled and talented senior executive team focused on achieving the 
Company’s purpose by offering fixed remuneration that aligns the roles and responsibilities of the senior 
executive with market practice and prevailing economic conditions; 
Link ‘at risk’ performance based incentives to shorter term and longer term Company goals that contribute 
to the achievement of the Company’s purpose; and 
Align the longer term ‘at risk’ incentive rewards with expectations and outcomes consistent with 
shareholder objectives and interests by: 
 
o  Benchmarking shareholder return against a peer group of companies that could be considered as an
alternative investment to Beach;
o  Giving share based rather than all cash based rewards to senior executives.
Two additional features of Beach’s policy framework are:
• 
•
A right to recover remuneration benefits awarded in situations involving fraud or dishonesty; 
A process to monitor compliance with prohibition on hedging to ensure ‘at risk’ incentives are genuinely ‘at 
risk’.
These features are described in more detail below.

For the year ended 30 June 2016 
Remuneration Report (Audited) 
 
 
Clawback of Senior Executive Remuneration 
The Board can take action in relation to vested and unvested entitlements where a senior executive acts fraudulently or 
dishonestly or in breach of his or her obligations to Beach. In these circumstances the Board may decide that entitlements 
such as shares or rights lapse, are forfeited or that cash awards be repaid, or that the proceeds of the sale of shares be paid 
to the Company.  
 
Where an award vests because of the fraud, dishonesty or breach of obligations by a senior executive and other senior 
executives not involved also benefit, the Board may decide that the award has not vested or shares issued are forfeited to 
ensure that there is no unfair benefit. The Board may make a different award to those not involved in the inappropriate 
conduct.  A claw back of incentive benefits applies to STI and LTI offers. 
 
Hedging  
The  Corporations  Act  prohibits  KMPs  and  their  closely  related  parties  from  entering  into  transactions  that  limit  the 
economic risk of participating in unvested entitlements or vested entitlements subject to holding locks imposed by  the 
Company  in  equity  based  remuneration  schemes.    Beach  monitors  this  requirement  through  a  policy  that  includes  the 
requirement that a senior executive confirm compliance with the policy and/or provide confirmation of dealings in Beach 
securities on request.  This prohibition is also reflected in Beach’s Share Trading Policy which can be viewed on Beach's 
website www.beachenergy.com.au.
3. How Beach makes decisions about remuneration 
The  Board  has  responsibility  for  the  remuneration  of  its  KMP.   A  Board  committee,  the  Remuneration  and  Nomination 
Committee  oversees  remuneration  matters  concerning  Beach’s  KMP.    It  makes  recommendations  to  the  Board  about 
remuneration policy, fees and remuneration packages for non-executive directors and senior executives.   
The committee’s charter can be viewed on Beach’s website at www.beachenergy.com.au. The committee comprises non-
executive directors. 
At the invitation of the committee, the Chief Executive Officer also attends its meetings in an advisory capacity.   Other 
senior executives may also attend committee meetings to provide management support.  Senior executives are excluded 
from discussion concerning their own remuneration arrangements. 
4. External advisers and remuneration advice 
Beach engaged independent remuneration advisers Guerdon Associates, during the year to advise it and undertake work 
on KMP remuneration issues and to remain up to date with market practices. That work included providing data for the 
new Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration package, TSR performance testing, share rights valuation work and information 
for  enagagement  with  stakeholders.    None  of  the  work  undertaken  by  Guerdon  during  FY16  was  classified  as  a 
‘remuneration recommendation’ under the Corporations Act. 
Where advisers are engaged by the Board and the Remuneration and Nomination Committee to undertake remuneration 
related work, where a remuneration recommendation is made, the engagement occurs in accordance with its protocol.  
The protocol for the engagement of external remuneration advisers is used to ensure that the information, advice or work 
the committee and the Board receives is free from any undue influence from management.  The Board or the committee, 
through its chairmen, appoints and engages directly with the consultant in relation to remuneration matters for KMP.  The 
terms of any engagement are finalised by the Board or committee and all remuneration advice, work or recommendations 
are provided directly to the Board or committee chairman.  Management is involved in this process only to the extent that 
it can assist to coordinate the work of the advisers as requested. 
In  addition  to  engaging  external  advisers  to  provide  advice  and  undertake  work  on  KMP  remuneration  issues,  the 
committee may also request recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer about remuneration packages for Beach’s 
senior  executive  team  (other  than  the  Chief  Executive  Officer).  The  committee  also  considers  industry  benchmarking 
information including the National Rewards Group Incorporated remuneration survey. The Board through the Chairman 
and  the  chairman  of  the  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  consulted  with  governance  specialists  and  other 
stakeholder groups during the year on a range of matters including KMP remuneration. These views are taken into account 
in the recommendations made to the Board by the committee, recognising that there is no commonly held view on various 
key remuneration issues across these stakeholder groups.

5. How the Company links performance to incentives 
Beach’s remuneration policy includes short and long term incentive plans designed to align management performance with 
shareholder interests.  The LTI in particular links long term management performance to an increase in shareholder value 
through a total shareholder return measure applied over an extended period.  The STI is an incentive comprising an equal 
proportion of cash and performance rights for Beach shares. 
The  following  table  shows  Beach’s  gross  revenue,  net  profit  or  loss  after  tax,  dividends  and  reserves  and  production 
position for the last 5 financial years.  It also shows the share price at the end of each of those financial years. No incentives 
were awarded for the previous or the current year’s performance.

6. Senior executive remuneration structure 
This section details the remuneration structure for senior executives  
Remuneration mix 
Remuneration  for  senior  executives  is  a  mix  of  a  fixed  cash  salary  component  and  an  ‘at  risk’  component.  The  ‘at  risk’ 
component means that specific targets or conditions must be met before a senior executive becomes entitled to it. 
 
What is the balance between 
fixed and ‘at risk’ 
remuneration?
The  remuneration  structure  and  packages  offered  to  senior  executives  for  the  period 
were:
•
Fixed remuneration;
•
Performance based ‘at risk’ remuneration comprises:
•
•
Short  term  incentive  (STI)  -  an  annual  cash  and  equity  based  incentive,  which 
may be offered at the discretion of the Board, linked to Company and individual 
performance over a year; and
Long term incentive (LTI) - equity grants, which may be granted annually at the 
discretion  of  the  Board,  linked  to  performance  conditions  measured  over  a 
period of three years.
The balance between fixed and ‘at risk’ depends on the senior executive’s role.  The Chief 
Executive Officer has the highest level of ‘at risk’ remuneration reflecting the greater level 
of responsibility of this role. 
Table 3 sets out the relative proportions of the three elements of the senior executives 
total  remuneration  packages  for  the  2015  and  2016  financial  years  that  relate  to 
performance and those that are not.

Fixed remuneration 
What is fixed remuneration?
How is fixed remuneration 
reviewed?
Senior  executives  are  entitled  to  a  fixed  cash  remuneration  amount  inclusive  of  the 
guaranteed  superannuation  contribution.    The  amount  is  not  based  upon  performance.  
Senior  executives  may  decide  to  salary  sacrifice  part  of  their  fixed  remuneration  for 
additional superannuation contributions and other benefits.  
Fixed remuneration is determined by the Board based on independent external review or 
advice  that  takes  account  of  the  role  and  responsibility  of  each  senior  executive.    It  is 
reviewed  annually  against  industry  benchmarking  information  including  the  National 
Awards Group Incorporated remuneration survey.
Fixed remuneration for the year 
For the reporting period fixed remuneration did not increase for senior executives. Some changes in fixed remuneration 
were made due to a change in a role or responsibilities. These are detailed in Table 10. 
Remuneration details for individuals are provided in Table 1 and Table 10. Table 10 reports on the remuneration for senior 
executives  as  required  under  the  Corporations  Act.  Table  1  shows  the  actually  realised  cash  remuneration  that  senior 
executives received.

Short Term Incentive (STI) 
What is the STI?
How does the STI link to 
Beach’s objectives?
What are the performance 
conditions or KPIs?
The STI is part of ‘at risk’ remuneration offered to senior executives. It measures individual 
and Company performance over a 12 month period coinciding with Beach's financial year.  It 
is provided in equal parts of cash and equity that may or may not vest subject to additional 
retention conditions.  It is offered annually to senior executives at the discretion of the Board.   
The  STI  is  an  at  risk  opportunity  for  senior  executives  to  be  rewarded  for  meeting  or 
exceeding  key  performance  indicators  that  are  linked  to  Beach’s  key  purpose.    The  STI  is 
designed  to  motivate  senior  executives  to  meet  Company  expectations  for  success.    Beach 
can only achieve its objectives if it attracts and retains high performing senior executives.  An 
award made under the STI has a retention component as half of the award is paid in cash with 
the remaining half issued as performance rights with service conditions attached.  
The  performance  conditions  or  key  performance  indicators  (KPIs)  are  set  by  the  Board  for 
each  12  month  period  beginning  at  the  start  of  a  financial  year.  They  reflect  financial  and 
operational goals of Beach that are essential in achieving Beach’s key purpose. Individual KPIs 
are also set for each senior executive to reflect their particular responsibilities.   
For the reporting period, the performance measures comprised:
•
Company KPIs (60% weighting)
o  Operating costs (12%)   
o 
o 
o
Production (12%)  
Safety (12%) and  
Strategic objectives (24%).
•
Individual KPIs (40% weighting).
Are there different 
performance levels?
What is the value of the STI 
award that can be earned?
How are the performance 
conditions assessed?
Is there a threshold level of 
performance or gate before 
an STI is paid?
The Board sets KPI measures at threshold, target and  stretch levels.  A threshold objective 
must be achieved in any individual KPI before a participant is entitled to any payment for that 
KPI.  A stretch level indicates a maximum performance outcome for a KPI. 
The incentive payment is based on a percentage of a senior executive’s fixed remuneration. 
Typically, the Chief Executive Officer can earn from 25% to a maximum of 100% of his fixed 
remuneration. The Chief Executive Officer, Mr Kay did not participate in the FY16 STI as he 
commenced his employment with Beach in the last quarter of the performance period. 
The value of the award that can be earned by other senior executives ranges from 15% to a 
maximum of 45% of fixed remuneration.  
The KPIs are reviewed against an agreed target.   
The Board assesses the extent to which KPIs were met for the period after the close of the 
relevant  financial  year  and  once  results  are  finalised.    The  assessment  of  performance  of 
senior executives other than the Chief Executive Officer is made by the Board on the Chief 
Executive Officer’s recommendation.  The Board assesses the achievement of the KPIs for the 
Chief Executive Officer.   
Yes. A calculation at the end of a performance period (being the end of Beach’s financial year) 
of both a return on capital and a one year relative total shareholder return against the ASX 
200 Energy Index as set out in the table below.

If any one of the measures  in the table falls within the red band or any two measures fall 
within  the  yellow  band  then  the  Board  may  use  its  discretion  to  determine  by  resolution 
whether to award an STI or decrease the award of an STI. 
On achievement of the relevant KPIs, half of the STI award is paid in cash.  Any cash that is 
earned pursuant to the STI is included in the financial statements for the financial year but 
paid after the conclusion of the financial year, usually in September after release of annual 
financial results. 
The  remaining  half  of  the  STI  award  value  is  issued  in  performance  rights  that  vest 
progressively  over  the  one  and  two  years,  subject  to  the  senior  executive  remaining 
employed with Beach at each vesting date. If a senior executive leaves Beach’s employment 
the performance rights will be forfeited.  Early vesting of the performance rights may occur at 
the discretion of the Board if the senior executive leaves Beach due to death or disability.  The 
Board  also  reserves  the  right  to  exercise  its  discretion  for  early  vesting  in  the  event  of  a 
change of control of the Company.  There is a general discretion available to the Board, to 
allow  early  vesting  of  performance  rights.    However,  the  Board  would  require  exceptional 
circumstances to exist before it would consider using its discretion.
What happens if an STI is 
awarded?
STI Performance for the year 
At the completion of the financial year the Board tested each senior executive’s performance against the STI performance 
conditions set for the year. As the return on capital and a one year relative total shareholder return against the ASX 200 
Energy Index hurdles were not met, no STI was awarded.  
The percentage of the  STI that  will be paid for the  period for each senior executive was zero and correspondingly,  the 
percentage of the maximum STI payable that was forfeited by each senior executive was 100%. 
Although the hurdle or gates were not met, the outcomes of the testing of the Company related performance conditions 
that make up 60% of the STI KPIs are summarised below.

Link to Beach’s strategy
Performance and score
Beach’s key value is that ‘Safety takes 
precedence in everything we do’. 
Beach is focused on ensuring it and its 
contractors operate in a safe manner.  
Other safety and reliability measures 
can be found in our annual 
Sustainability Report.
Beach’s strategy is to maintain financial 
strength. It has planned its operations 
to adapt to an environment where oil 
prices remain lower for longer. This 
measure focuses on Beach maintaining 
its low cost and reliable operator 
status.
Beach’s safety record in the financial 
year exceeded the threshold target 
with a TRIFR of 3.8. 
Beach was also Lost Time Injury (LTI) 
free for the year. 
 
Score - Met
The target was set for this measure 
prior to the acquisition of Drillsearch 
Energy Limited in the last quarter of 
the year. The KPI was measured against 
full year operating costs which included 
the costs of both entities and did not 
meet pre-merger targets. It is noted 
that Beach also narrowly missed pre- 
Drillsearch merger targets. 
Score – Not met
Production of 9.7 MMboe was at near 
record levels and exceeded target on 
both a pre-Drillsearch merger and post-
Drillsearch merger basis.  
Score - Met
The senior executives achieved a score 
between target and stretch.

STI performance rights and CEO commencement rights issued or in operation in FY16 
The fair value of services received in return for STI rights and the Chief Executive Officer’s commencement rights (see Table 
15) granted is measured by reference to the fair value of STI rights granted calculated using the Binomial or Black-Scholes 
Option Pricing Models. The contractual life of the STI rights is used as an input into the valuation model. The expected 
volatility is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the rights), adjusted 
for  any  expected  changes  to  future  volatility  due  to  publicly  available  information.    The  risk  free  rate  is  based  on 
Commonwealth Government bond yields relevant to the term of the performance rights.

Long Term Incentive (LTI)  
What is the LTI?
How does the LTI link to 
Beach’s key objective?
What equity based grants 
are given and are there 
plan limits?
What is the performance 
condition?
Why choose this 
performance condition?
alternative investment option to Beach;
•  Giving  share  based  rather  than  cash  based  rewards  to  executives  to  link  their  own
rewards to shareholder expectations of dividend return and share price growth.
The LTI is an equity based ‘at risk’ incentive plan.  The LTI is intended to reward results that 
promote long term growth in shareholder value or total shareholder return (TSR).  LTIs are 
offered to senior executives at the discretion of the Board. 
The LTI links to Beach’s key purpose by aligning the longer term ‘at risk’ incentive rewards 
with expectations and outcomes that match shareholder objectives and interests by: 
•  Benchmarking  shareholder  return  against  a  peer  group  of  companies  considered  an
Performance  rights  are  granted.  If  the  performance  conditions  are  met,  senior  executives 
have the opportunity to acquire one Beach share for every vested performance right. There 
are no plan limits as a whole for the LTI.  This is due to the style of the plan combined with 
the guidance requested from external remuneration consultants about appropriate individual 
plan limits.  Those individual limits for the plans that are currently operational are set out in 
Table 7. 
The performance condition is based on Beach’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
relative to the ASX 200 Energy Total Return Index such that the initial out-performance level 
is set at the Index return plus an additional 5.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over 
the three year performance period.  
Beach’s TSR performance relative to the ASX 200 Energy Total Return Index such that the 
initial out-performance level is set at the Index return plus an additional 5.5% compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) over the performance period such that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TSR is a measure of the return to shareholders over a period of time through the change in 
share price and any dividends paid over that time. The dividends are notionally reinvested for 
the  purpose  of  the  calculation.    This  performance  condition  was  chosen  to  align  senior 
executives’ remuneration with a corresponding increase in shareholder value. The Board has 
reinforced the alignment to shareholder return by imposing two additional conditions.  First, 
the  Board  sets  a  threshold  level  that  must  be  achieved  before  an  award  will  be  earned.  
Secondly, the Board will not make an award if Beach’s TSR is negative.
Between  the Index return and Index + 5.5% - a prorated number will vest;
= or > Index return + 5.5% – 100% vesting.
< the Index return - 0% vesting
= the Index return - 50% vesting;
Is shareholders equity 
diluted when shares are 
issued on vesting of 
performance rights or 
exercise of options?
What happens to LTI 
performance rights on a 
change of control?
The Board has not imposed dilution limits having regard to the structure of the LTI plan as a 
whole and that the historical level of rights on issue would result in minimal dilution.  If all of 
the  current  performance  rights  vested  at  30  June  2016,  shareholders  equity  would  have 
diluted  by  0.36%  (FY15  -  0.58%).    It  has  been  the  practice  of  the  Board  when  there  is  an 
entitlement to shares on vesting of performance rights to issue new shares.  However, there 
is provision for shares to be purchased on market should the Board consider that dilution of 
shareholders equity is likely to be of concern.   
The  Board  reserves  the  right  to  exercise  its  discretion  for  early  vesting  in  the  event  of  a 
change of control of the Company.  Certain adjustments to a participant's entitlements may 
occur in the event of a company reconstruction and certain share issues.

Details of LTI performance rights (including CEO 2015 LTI performance rights) issued or in operation in FY 2016 
The fair value of services received in return for LTI performance rights granted is measured by reference to the fair value of 
LTI performance rights granted calculated using the Binomial or Black-Scholes Option Pricing Models. The estimate of the 
fair value of the services received for the LTI performance rights and options issued are measured with reference to the 
expected outcome which may include the use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The contractual life of the LTI performance 
rights is used as an input into this model. Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into a Monte Carlo simulation 
method  where  applicable.  The  expected  volatility  is  based  on  the  historic  volatility  (calculated  based  on  the  weighted 
average  remaining  life  of  the  rights  or  options),  adjusted  for  any  expected  changes  to  future  volatility  due  to  publicly 
available information. The risk free rate is based on Commonwealth Government bond yields relevant to the term of the 
performance rights.

Other plans that senior executives have participated in that are still in operation: Employee Incentive Plan (EIP) 
Senior executives have previously participated in the shareholder approved Employee Incentive Plan where at the Board's 
discretion, employees may be offered fully paid ordinary shares or options to acquire fully paid ordinary shares in Beach by 
way of non-recourse loans for a term of 10 years which are repayable on cessation of employment with the consolidated 
entity  or  expiry  of  the  loan.  In  2007  as  a  result  of  the  introduction  of  a  formal  STI  /  LTI  incentive  scheme,  the  Board 
determined that senior executives would not participate in the EIP in the future.  However, the senior executives continue 
to participate in the EIP in respect of the shares already issued to them under the EIP. An exception was the issue of EIP 
shares to Mr Dodd and Mr Jamieson as they were not senior executives as the time of issue. 
A  total  of  $798,870  in  EIP  loans  remains  outstanding  from  employee  shares  issued  in  prior  reporting  periods  to  senior 
executives as detailed in Table 9:

7. Employment agreements – senior executives 
The senior executives have employment agreements with Beach. 
The provisions relating to duration of employment, notice periods and termination entitlements of the senior executives 
are as follows: 
Chief Executive Officer  
The Chief Executive Officer’s employment agreement commenced with effect 2 May 2016 and is ongoing until terminated 
by either Beach or Mr Kay on six months’ notice. Beach may terminate the Chief Executive Officer's employment at any 
time  for  cause  (for  example,  for  serious  breach)  without  notice.    In  certain  circumstances  Beach  may  terminate  the 
employment on notice of not less than three months for issues concerning the Chief Executive Officer's performance that 
have not been satisfactorily addressed. 
The Chief Executive Officer may also give one month’s notice of termination of his employment in the event that Beach 
requires him to permanently transfer to another location outside of Adelaide. If this occurs, Beach will pay to the Chief 
Executive Officer a retirement payment equal to six months’ salary.     
Other Senior Executives 
Other senior executives have employment agreements that are ongoing until terminated by either Beach from between 3 
and 12 months’ notice or the senior executive upon giving three months’ notice. Beach may terminate a senior executive's 
appointment for cause (for example, for serious breach) without notice.  Beach must pay any amount owing but unpaid to 
the employee whose services have been terminated at the date of termination, such as accrued leave entitlements.  In 
certain circumstances Beach may terminate employment on notice of not less than three months for issues concerning the 
senior  executives  performance  that  have  not  been  satisfactorily  addressed.  If  Beach  terminates  the  senior  executive’s 
appointment other than for cause or he or she resigns due to a permanent relocation of his or her workplace to a location 
other than Adelaide, then they are entitled to an amount up to one times their final annual salary.

Remuneration Report (Audited) 
 
 
9. Remuneration policy for non-executive directors 
The fees paid to non-executive directors are determined using the following guidelines.  Fees are:
•  Not incentive or performance based but are fixed amounts; 
•
Determined  by  reference  to  the  nature  of  the  role,  responsibility  and  time  commitment  required  for  the 
performance of the role including membership of board committees; 
Are based on independent advice and industry benchmarking data; and 
Driven  by  a  need  to  attract  a  diverse  and  well-balanced  group  of  individuals  with  relevant  experience  and 
knowledge.
• 
•
The  remuneration  of  Beach  non-executive  directors  is  within  the  aggregate  annual  limit  of  $1,300,000  approved  by 
shareholders at the 2014 annual general meeting.   
The  remuneration  for  non-executive  directors  comprises  directors’  fees,  board  committee  fees  and  superannuation 
contributions to meet Beach's statutory superannuation obligations.  Prior to 2015 no committee fees were paid to the 
chairman or members of the Risk Committee. From 2015 only the chairman was paid a fee. A fee of $15,000 (inclusive of 
superannuation) is also paid to Dr Schwebel as a sitting fee to attend Reserves Committee. 
Mr Beckett was appointed the Deputy Chairman for which is he paid an additional $10,000 (inclusive of superannuation). 
This  fee  was  formerly  paid  to  the  Lead  Independent  Director,  a  position  that  has  been  replaced  by  the  role  of  Deputy 
Chairman.  Other  than  superannuation  contributions,  Beach  does  not  have  a  scheme  for  retirement  benefits  for  non-
executive directors. 
Directors who perform extra services for Beach or make any special exertions on behalf of Beach may be remunerated for 
those services in addition to the usual directors' fees. Non-executive directors are also entitled to be reimbursed for their 
reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of their directors' duties.  
Details of the fees payable to non-executive directors for Board and committee membership are set out in Table 11.

(1)   The rights that vested resulted in the issue of one share for each right as set out in Table 14. No amount was paid for the issue
of those shares.
(2)  Relates  to  rights  that  did  not  vest  due  to  performance  conditions  not  being  met  and  were  forfeited  during  the  year  and 
changes resulting from individuals ceasing to be KMPs during the period. The fair value of equity instruments which do not 
vest during the reporting period is determined as at the grant date and is progressively allocated over the vesting period.  The 
amount included as remuneration is not related to or indicative of the benefit (if any) that individuals may ultimately realise 
should the rights vest.  The fair value of the rights as at the date of their grant has been determined in accordance with AASB 
2.  The calculations are performed using various approved option valuation methodologies.  The total value of the rights, if the 
performance conditions are not met, is nil. No rights that vested during FY16 were unexercisable at the end of the reporting 
period. The percentage of all rights that vested in the year and lapsed in the year for senior executives listed was 100%.  All 
rights issued during the year are issued with a zero exercise price.

For the year ended 30 June 2016 
Remuneration Report (Audited)
Related party disclosures 
During the financial year ended 30 June 2016, Beach used the legal services of DMAW Lawyers, a legal firm of which Mr Davis 
is  a  principal.   Beach  paid  $248,039  during  the  financial  year  (FY15:  $160,339)  to  DMAW  lawyers  for  legal  and  advisory 
services, of which $3,879 related to FY15. In addition to fees paid during the year a further $22,771 (FY15: $3,879) is payable 
to DMAW Lawyers as at 30 June 2016 for invoices received but not yet paid and work in progress not yet invoiced. Directors 
fees payable to Mr Davis for the year ended 30 June 2016 of $250,000 (FY15: $250,000) were also paid directly to DMAW 
Lawyers. 
During the current financial year Beach paid $41,250 (FY15: $33,000) to Energy Insights (a company owned by Mr Rayner) for 
office rental in Brisbane.
12. Looking ahead - Remuneration for 2017
Review of total fixed remuneration for 2017
The Board provided a CPI increase for all employees including senior executives for the coming year.
Review of non-executive directors fees
The Board did not increase Board or committee fees for the coming year.
Review of remuneration structure for FY17
In  FY16  Beach  reviewed  the  short  term  incentives  offered  to  senior  executives  to  better  align  them  with  shareholder 
expectations particularly that incentives should not be awarded when expected returns on investment are not achieved. A 
broader  review  of  Beach’s  remuneration  framework  has  commenced  to  ensure  that  it  continues  to  meet  current  market 
practice  and  that  there  is  an  appropriate  alignment  between  achievement  of  company  goals,  shareholder  return  and  the 
ability to attract and retain the right skills to meet company goals. The review will consider all aspects of Beach’s framework, 
including remuneration structure and incentive arrangements.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Basis of preparation   
 
This  section  sets  out  the  basis  upon  which  the  Group’s  (comprising  Beach  and  its  subsidiaries)  financial  statements  are 
prepared as a whole. Significant accounting policies and key judgements and estimates of the Group that summarise the 
measurement  basis used and assist  in  understanding  the financial statements are described in the relevant note to the 
financial statements or are otherwise provided in this section.  
Beach Energy Limited (Beach) is a for profit company limited by shares, incorporated in Australia and whose shares are 
publicly  listed  on  the  Australian  Securities  Exchange  (ASX).  The  nature  of  the  Group’s  operations  are  described  in  the 
segment note.  The consolidated general purpose financial report of the Group for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 
was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 29 August 2016.  
This general purpose financial report:
•
•
•
•
Has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  adopted  by  the  Australian Accounting 
Standards  Board  and  the  Corporations  Act  2001.    Australian  Accounting  Standards  incorporate  International 
Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRSs)  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board.    Compliance 
with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that the financial statements and notes of Beach Energy Limited 
also comply with IFRSs. 
Has  been  prepared  on  an  accruals  basis  and  is  based  on  the  historical  cost  convention,  as  modified  by  the 
revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
at fair value through profit or loss or other comprehensive income. 
Is  presented  in  Australian  dollars  with  all  amounts  rounded  to  the  nearest  hundred  thousand  dollars  unless 
otherwise  stated,  in  accordance  with  ASIC  Corporations  (Rounding  in  Financial/Directors’  Reports)  Instrument 
2016/191 issued by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. 
Has  been  prepared  by  consistently  applying  all  accounting  policies  to  all  the  financial  years  presented,  unless 
otherwise stated.
Notes to the financial statements   
The notes include information which is required to understand the financial statements that is material and relevant to the 
operations,  financial  position  or  performance  of  the  Group.  Information  is  considered  material  and  relevant  where  the 
amount is significant in size or nature, it is important in understanding changes to the operations or results of the Group or 
it may significantly impact on future performance. 
 
Key judgements and estimates  
In  the  process  of  applying  the  Group’s  accounting  policies,  management  has  had  to  make  judgements,  estimates  and 
assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual 
results  may  differ  from  these  estimates  and  the  reasonableness  of  these  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are 
reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or  complexity,  or  areas  where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are found in the following notes: 
Note 5 – Taxation 
Note 9 - Petroleum assets 
Note 12 - Impairment of non-financial assets
Note 8 - Property, plant and equipment 
Note 10 - Exploration and evaluation assets 
Note 13 – Provisions
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements are those of Beach and its subsidiaries (detailed in Note 21).  Subsidiaries are those 
entities that Beach controls as it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.  
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated 
on consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies. Where unrealised losses 
on intra-group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a group 
perspective.  Profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income  of  subsidiaries  acquired  or  disposed  of  during  the  year  are 
recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable. The acquisition of 
subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.

Basis of preparation (continued) 
 
Foreign currency 
Both the functional and presentation currency of Beach is Australian dollars. Some subsidiaries have different functional 
currencies which are translated to the presentation currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the 
functional  currency  by  applying  the  exchange  rate  ruling  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities 
denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are  retranslated  at  the  foreign  exchange  rate  ruling  at  the  reporting  date.  Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit or loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the initial 
transaction.  Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  that  are  stated  at  fair  value  are 
translated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. Foreign 
exchange  differences  that  arise  on  the  translation  of  monetary  items  that  form  part  of  the  net  investment  in  a  foreign 
operation  are  recognised  in  equity  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Revenues,  expenses  and  equity  items  of 
foreign operations are translated to Australian dollars using the exchange rate at the date of transaction while assets and 
liabilities  are  translated  using  the  rate  at  balance  date  with  differences  recognised  directly  in  the  Foreign  Currency 
Translation Reserve. 
 
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards 
In  the  current  year,  the  Group  has  adopted  all  of  the  new  and  revised  Standards  and  Interpretations  issued  by  the 
Australian Accounting Standards Board that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current annual reporting 
period. The adoption of these new and revised Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations has had no significant 
impact on the Group’s accounting policies or the amounts reported during the financial year.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted 
early by the Group:
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to 
existing standards have been published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group. 
Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Group's accounting policies for the 
first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement.  Information on new standards, amendments and 
interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below.
Year ended 30 June 2019:  
 
Amendments to AASB 116 and AASB 138, Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation 
This  standard  will  clarify  that  revenue  based  methods  to  calculate  depreciation  and  amortisation  are  not  considered 
appropriate. This will not result in a change to the manner in which the Group’s financial result is determined as no such 
method is currently in use. 
 
AASB 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
This  standard  will  change  the  timing  and  in  some  cases  the  quantum  of  revenue  recognised  from  customers.  AASB  15 
requires  an  entity  to  recognise  revenue  by  identifying  for  each  customer  contract,  the  performance  obligations  in  the 
contract  and  the  transaction  price.  The  transaction  price  is  then  allocated  against  the  performance  obligations  in  the 
contract with revenue recognised when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance obligation. Management is currently 
assessing the impact of the new standard but it is not expected to have a material impact on the financial performance or 
financial position of the Group. 
 
AASB 9: Financial Instruments 
AASB 9, approved in December 2015, replaces the existing guidance in AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. AASB 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including 
a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting 
requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from AASB 
139. AASB 9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. 
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of AASB 
9.

Basis of preparation (continued) 
 
 
Year ended 30 June 2020: AASB 16: Leases 
AASB  16  Leases  removes  the  lease  classification  test  for  lessees  and  requires  all  leases  (including  those  classified  as 
operating leases) to be brought  onto the  balance sheet (effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 
2019). Management is currently assessing the impact of the new standard but it is not expected to have a material impact 
on the financial performance or financial position of the Group. 
 
Results for the year 
This section explains the results and performance of the Group including additional information about those individual line 
items in the financial statements most relevant in the context of the operations of the Group, including accounting policies 
that are relevant for understanding the items recognised in the financial statements and an analysis of the Group’s result 
for the year by reference to key areas, including operating segments, revenue, expenses, employee costs, taxation and 
earnings per share.  
 
1. Operating segments 
 
The Group has identified its operating segments to be its Cooper Basin, Other Australia and International interests based on 
the  different  geographical  regions  and  the  similarity  of  assets  within  those  regions.    This  is  the  basis  on  which  internal 
reports are provided to the Chief Executive Officer for assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources 
within the Group.    
 
The  Other  Australia  operating  segment  includes  the  Group’s  interest  in  all  on-shore  and  off-shore  production  and 
exploration tenements within Australia other than the Cooper Basin while the International operating segment includes the 
Group’s interests in all areas outside Australia. 
 
The  Group  operates  primarily  in  one  business,  namely  the  exploration,  development  and  production  of  hydrocarbons. 
Revenue is derived from the sale of gas and liquid hydrocarbons. Gas sales contracts are spread across major Australian 
energy  retailers  and  industrial  users  with  liquid  hydrocarbon  products  sales  being  made  to  major  multi-national  energy 
companies based on international market pricing.  
 
Cooper  Basin  segment  revenue  represents  oil  and  gas  sales  from  Australian  production.  International  segment  revenue 
represents oil and gas sales from Egyptian production.  
 
Details  of  the  performance  of  each  of  these  operating  segments  for  the  financial  years  ended  30  June  2016  and  
30 June 2015 are set out as follows:

2. Revenue and other income  
The Group’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of gas and liquid hydrocarbons.  Sales revenue is recognised on the 
basis of the Group’s interest in a producing field, when the physical product and associated risks and rewards of ownership 
pass  to  the  purchaser,  which  is  generally  at  the  time  of  ship  or  truck  loading,  or  on  the  product  entering  the  relevant 
pipeline.

4. Employment benefits  
Provision is made for the Group's employee benefits liability arising from services rendered by employees to the end of the 
reporting period.  These benefits include wages, salaries, annual leave and long service leave. Where these benefits are 
expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, they are measured at the amounts expected to be paid 
when the liabilities are settled. Expenses for non-vesting personal leave are recognised when the leave is taken and are 
measured at the rates paid or payable. Liabilities for long service leave and annual leave that is not expected to be taken 
wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which the employee rendered the related service, are 
recognised and measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of employees’ 
services up to the reporting  date. The obligation is calculated using expected future increases in wage and salary rates, 
experience  of  employee  departures  and  periods  of  service.  Consistent  with  the  determination  that  Australia  now  has  a 
deep  market  for  high  quality  corporate  bonds,  the  estimated  future  payments  have  been  discounted  using  Australian 
corporate bond rates. The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the statement of financial position if the Group 
does not have the unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting date, regardless of 
when the actual settlement is expected to occur.   
Superannuation commitments:   Each employee nominates their  own superannuation fund into which Beach contributes 
compulsory superannuation amounts based on a percentage of their salary.   
Termination benefits:  Termination benefits may be payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement 
date, without cause, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.  Beach recognises 
termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to making these payments. 
Equity settled compensation:   
Employee Incentive Plan - The Group operates an Employee Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders. Shares are allotted 
to employees under this plan at the Board’s discretion.  Shares acquired by employees are funded by interest free non-
recourse loans for a term of 10  years which are repayable on cessation of employment with the consolidated entity or 
expiry of the loan term. The fair value of the equity to which employees become entitled is measured at grant date and 
recognised as an expense over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of shares issued is 
determined with reference to the latest ASX share price.  Rights are valued using an appropriate valuation technique such 
as the Binomial or Black-Scholes Option Pricing Models which takes into account the vesting conditions. 
 
The following employee shares are currently on issue 
Balance as at 30 June 2014 
Sold / loan repaid during the financial year  
Balance as at 30 June 2015 
Sold / loan repaid during the financial year  
Balance as at 30 June 2016 
 
No shares were issued to employees during the financial year, pursuant to this plan.   
 
The  closing  ASX  share  price  of  Beach  fully  paid  ordinary  shares  at  30  June  2016 was  $0.61  as  compared  to  $1.05  as  at  
30 June 2015.

4. Employment benefits (continued) 
Incentive Rights – The Group operates an Executive Incentive Plan for key management personnel providing  both Short 
Term Incentives (STIs) and Long Term Incentives (LTIs). The STI is part of ‘at risk’ remuneration offered to senior executives. 
It  measures  individual  and  Company  performance  over  a  12  month  period  coinciding  with  Beach's  financial  year.    It  is 
provided in equal parts of cash and equity that may or may not vest subject to additional retention conditions.  It is offered 
annually to senior executives at the discretion of the Board.  The LTI is an equity based ‘at risk’ incentive plan.  The LTI is 
intended to reward efforts and  results that promote long term  growth in shareholder value or  total shareholder return 
(TSR).  LTIs are offered to senior executives at the discretion of the Board. The fair value of performance rights issued are 
recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity.  The fair value of the performance 
rights are measured at grant date and recognised over the vesting period during which the key  management personnel 
become entitled to the performance rights.  The fair value of the STIs is measured using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing 
Model  and  the  fair  value  of  the  LTIs  is  measured  using  Monte  Carlo  simulation,  taking  into  account  the  terms  and 
conditions upon which these rights were issued. 
Movements in unlisted performance rights are set out below:

On  1  December  2015,  Beach  issued  2,787,763 LTI  unlisted  performance  rights  under  the  Executive  Incentive  Plan  (EIP).  
These performance rights, which expire on 30 November 2020, are exercisable for nil consideration and are not exercisable 
before 1 December 2018.  
 
On 19 May 2016, Beach issued various unlisted rights granted pursuant to the EIP and the employment contract between 
the Company and the Chief Executive Officer, as announced on 12 January 2016. 815,401 2015 LTI unlisted performance 
rights were issued which expire on 30 November 2020 and subject to meeting performance criteria, are not exercisable 
before 1 December 2018, and were issued for nil consideration. 565,956 unlisted rights were issued which are subject to a 
12 month service condition starting on 2 May 2016 and ending on 2 May 2017 inclusive. A further 414,547 unlisted rights 
were issued which are subject to a 24 month service condition starting on 2 May 2016 and ending on 2 May 2018 inclusive.

5. Taxation  
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other 
comprehensive income.  The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable 
income,  which  is  based  on  the  notional  income  tax  rates,  adjusted  by  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities 
attributable  to  temporary  differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the 
financial  statements, and to unused tax losses. These  temporary differences are recognised at the tax rate  expected to 
apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantively 
enacted  for  each  jurisdiction.    The  relevant  tax  rates  are  applied  to  the  cumulative  amounts  of  deductible  and  taxable 
temporary  differences  to  measure  the  deferred  tax  asset  or  liability.    An  exception  is  made  for  certain  temporary 
differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability.  Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible 
temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise 
those temporary differences and losses.

Beach  and  its  wholly  owned  Australian  subsidiaries  are  consolidated  for  Australian  income  tax  purposes  with  Beach 
responsible for recognising the  current and  deferred tax assets  and liabilities for the  tax consolidated  group. Beach has 
entered into tax sharing agreements with its wholly owned subsidiaries whereby each company in the group contributes to 
the  income  tax  payable  in  proportion  to  their  contribution  to  the  net  profit  before  tax  of  the  tax  consolidated  group. 
Accordingly, as head entity, Beach is responsible for recognising current tax liabilities, current tax assets and deferred tax 
assets from unused tax losses and credits of members of the tax consolidated group.  Deferred tax liabilities and deferred 
tax assets arising from temporary differences of the members  of the tax consolidated group are allocated amongst the 
members  of  the  tax  consolidated  group  using  the  “Separate  Taxpayer  within  Group”  approach  in  accordance  with 
Interpretation 1052, Tax Consolidation Accounting.

5. Taxation (continued) 
Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT): PRRT is recognised as an income tax under AASB112 - Income Taxes. From 1 July 
2012, the PRRT regime was extended to all Australian onshore oil and gas projects. Accounting for PRRT involves judging 
the impact of the combination of production licences into PRRT projects, the taxing point of projects, the measurement of 
the  starting  base  of  projects,  the  impact  of  farm-ins,  the  deductibility  of  expenditure  and  the  impact  of  legislative 
amendments. A deferred tax asset is recognised in relation to the carry forward deductible PRRT expenditure of projects 
only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. The 
group has determined the carry forward deductible PRRT expenditure of projects including augmentation on expenditure 
categories in the calculation of future taxable profit when assessing the extent to which a deferred tax asset should be 
recognised in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets in respect of PRRT are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Beach has previously applied for and was granted a PRRT combination 
certificate  by  the  Minister  for  Industry  in  respect  of  its  Cooper  Basin  projects.  Therefore,  the  Cooper  Basin  production 
licences together are treated as one project for PRRT purposes. The government has also enacted legislation which will 
enable  contract  liabilities  with  third  parties  to  be  apportioned  based  on  the  extent  that  the  expenditure  relates  to  the 
petroleum project. Due to the substantial value of carry forward deductible PRRT expenditure at 30 June 2016, the Group 
does  not  expect  to  pay  PRRT  in  the  short  to  medium  term  and  as  a  result,  no  additional  deferred  tax  asset  has  been 
recognised in the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016.

Goods and services tax 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST).  The net amount of GST 
recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the  taxation  authority  is  included  as  part  of  receivables  or  payables.    Cash  flows  are 
included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis. 
 
6. Earnings per share (EPS) 
The  Group  presents  basic  and  diluted  EPS  for  its  ordinary  shares.    Basic  EPS  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  profit  or  loss 
attributable  to  ordinary  shareholders  of  the  Company  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares  outstanding 
during the year.  Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares for the dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding share rights which have been 
issued to employees. 
 
Earnings after tax used in the calculation of EPS is as follows:

6. Earnings per share (EPS) (continued) 
 
4,911,585 (2015: 4,397,898) potential ordinary shares relating to performance rights were not considered dilutive during the 
period as vesting would not have occurred based on the status of the required vesting conditions at the end of the relevant 
reporting period and so have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. Since the end of the current financial year 
and before the completion of this report, 77,580 ordinary shares were issued upon vesting of unlisted performance rights 
issued pursuant to the Executive Incentive Plan.
Capital Employed 
This section details the investments made by the Group in exploring for and developing its petroleum business including        
inventories, property plant and equipment, petroleum assets, joint operations and any related restoration provisions as 
well as an assessment of asset impairment and details of future commitments.  
 
7. Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.  Cost is determined as follows:
(i)  Drilling and maintenance stocks, which include plant spares, consumables, maintenance and drilling tools used
for ongoing operations, are valued at weighted average cost; and
(ii)  Petroleum  products,  which  comprise  extracted  crude  oil,  liquefied  petroleum  gas,  condensate  and  naphtha 
stored in tanks and pipeline systems and process sales gas and ethane stored in sub-surface reservoirs, are valued 
using the absorption cost method in a manner which approximates specific identification.

8. Property, plant and equipment (PPE) 
PPE is measured at cost less depreciation and impairment losses. The carrying amount of PPE is reviewed bi-annually for 
impairment (refer  Note 12). The cost of PPE constructed within  the Group includes the cost of materials, direct labour, 
borrowing  costs  and  an  appropriate  proportion  of  fixed  and  variable  overheads.  Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the 
asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  All other repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. The assets residual 
values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. Gains and losses on disposals are 
determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the profit or loss.   
The depreciable amount of all PPE excluding freehold land is depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful lives to 
the Group commencing from the time the asset is held ready for use. Production facilities, field equipment and buildings 
are depreciated based on the proved and probable hydrocarbon reserves. 
The depreciation rates used in the current and previous period for each class of depreciable asset are:
• 
• 
•
2% for the corporate head office building;  
5-33% for other equipment; 
Life  of  the  area  according  to  the  rate  of  depletion  of  the  proved  and  probable  hydrocarbon  reserves  for 
production facilities and field buildings and equipment.

9.  Petroleum assets 
Petroleum assets are measured at cost less amortisation and impairment losses. The assets useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at each  reporting date. The carrying amount of petroleum assets is reviewed bi-annually (Refer 
Note 12).  Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and included in 
the profit or loss. Petroleum assets are amortised over the life of the area according to the rate of depletion of the proved 
and  probable  hydrocarbon  reserves.  Retention  of  petroleum  assets  is  subject  to  meeting  certain  work  obligations/ 
commitments as detailed in Note 14.

10. Exploration and evaluation assets 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest.  These costs 
are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through the successful development or sale of 
the area or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence 
of proved and probable hydrocarbon reserves. A bi-annual review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the 
appropriateness  of  continuing  to  carry  forward  costs.  All  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is  capitalised  until  a 
“trigger  event”  occurs  that  will  invoke  impairment  testing.    A  trigger  event  could  arise  from  a  significant  change  in  the 
forward  looking  assessment  of  geo-technical  and/or  commercial  factors.    This  could  involve  a  series  of  dry  holes,  the 
relinquishment of an area, a significant farm-out of an area or any similar type event.  Once impairment testing events 
arise, Beach will complete a full assessment of the recoverable value of the area of interest as compared to the carrying 
value of the area of interest.  This may result in a write down of its carrying value. Accumulated costs in relation to an 
abandoned area are written off in full in the profit or loss in the year in which the decision to abandon the area is made. 
When production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are transferred to petroleum assets 
and  amortised  over  the  life  of  the  area  according  to  the  rate  of  depletion  of  the  proved  and  probable  hydrocarbon 
reserves.

The application of this policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and 
circumstances.    Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available.  If, after having 
capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure,  activities  in  the  area  have  reached  a  stage  that  permits  reasonable 
assessment of the existence of proved and probable hydrocarbon reserves and management concludes that the capitalised 
expenditure is unlikely to be recovered by future exploitation or sale, then the relevant capitalised amount is written off 
through  the  profit  or  loss.  Retention  of  exploration  assets  is  subject  to  meeting  certain  work  obligations/exploration 
commitments (Note 14).

11. Interests in joint operations 
Exploration and production activities are conducted through joint arrangements governed by joint operating agreements, 
production sharing contracts or similar contractual relationships. A joint operation involves the joint control, and often the 
joint ownership, of one or more assets contributed to, or acquired for the purpose of the joint operation and dedicated to 
the purposes of the joint operation. The assets are used to obtain benefits for the parties to the joint operation. Each party 
may take a share of the output from the assets and each bears an agreed share of expenses incurred. Each party has 
control over its share of future economic benefits through its share of the joint operation. The interests of the Group in 
joint operations are brought to account by recognising in the financial statements the Group’s share of jointly controlled 
assets, share of expenses and liabilities incurred, and the income from the sale or use of its share of the production of the 
joint operation in accordance with the Group’s revenue policy.  
 
The  Group  has  a  direct  interest  in  a  number  of  unincorporated  joint  operations  with  those  significant  joint  operation 
interests shown below.

12. Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying value of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed on a bi-annual basis 
to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.  Petroleum assets and property, plant and equipment are 
assessed for impairment on a cash-generating unit (CGU) basis.  A CGU is the smallest grouping of assets that generates 
independent cash inflows, and generally represents an area of interest. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs 
are allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets on a pro-rata basis. An impairment loss is recognised in the profit 
or loss whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
This requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the area of interest to which each asset belongs. The recoverable 
amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is assessed on the basis 
of the expected net cash flows that will be received from the assets continued employment and subsequent disposal.  For 
oil and gas assets the estimated future cash flows are based on estimates of hydrocarbon reserves, future production 
profiles, commodity prices, operating costs and any future development costs necessary to produce the reserves. Estimates 
of future commodity prices are based on contracted prices where applicable or based on market consensus prices.  
 
For the current financial year, the following assumptions were used in the assessment of the CGU’s recoverable amounts:
Brent oil price of US$50/bbl in FY17, US$60/bbl in FY18, US$65/bbl in FY19 and US$70/bbl beyond FY19. 
A$/US$ exchange rate of 0.73 in FY17, 0.72 in FY18, 0.70 beyond FY18.  
Inflation rate – both revenue and costs have not been inflated.
• 
• 
• 
•  Where appropriate the cash flow inputs have been adjusted to reflect identifiable uncertainty and risk.    
•
Pre-tax real discount rate of 7.5% (FY15: 8.0%) to take into account the risks that have not already been adjusted 
for in the cash flows.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of other assets or groups of assets, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. 
 
For the financial year ended 30 June 2016, the Group assessed each CGU to determine whether an indicator of impairment 
existed. Indicators of impairment include changes in future selling prices, future costs and reserves. As a result, the 
recoverable amounts of the CGUs and some specific oil and gas assets were formally assessed, resulting in the recognition 
of an impairment loss of $608.8 million as detailed below. In the previous financial year, Cooper Basin assets were impaired 
by $583.2 million, Egypt was impaired by $173.7 million and Romania by $32.2 million.

12. Impairment of non-financial assets (continued) 
 
Estimates of reserve quantities  
The  estimated  quantities  of  proved  and  probable  hydrocarbon  reserves  reported  by  the  Group  are  integral  to  the 
calculation  of  amortisation  (depletion),  depreciation  expense  and  to  assessments  of  possible  impairment.    Estimated 
reserve quantities are based upon interpretations of geological and geophysical models and assessment of the technical 
feasibility and commercial viability of producing the reserves.  Management prepare reserve estimates which conform to 
guidelines prepared by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. These assessments require assumptions to be made regarding 
future development and production costs, commodity prices, exchange rates and fiscal regimes.  The estimates of reserves 
may change from period to period as the economic assumptions used to estimate the reserves can change from period to 
period, and as additional geological data is generated during the course of operations. 
 
13. Provisions  
A provision for rehabilitation and restoration is provided by the Group where there is a present obligation as a result of 
exploration, development, production, transportation or storage activities having been undertaken, and it is probable that 
an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation. The estimated future obligations include the costs 
of  removing  facilities,  abandoning  wells  and  restoring  the  affected  areas  once  petroleum  reserves  are  exhausted. 
Restoration  liabilities  are  discounted  to  present  value  and  capitalised  as  a  component  part  of  petroleum  assets.    The 
capitalised costs are amortised over the life of the petroleum assets and the provision revised at the end of each reporting 
period through the profit or loss as the discounting of the liability unwinds.  The unwinding of discounting on the provision 
is recognised as a finance cost. 
 
Estimate of restoration costs 
As  in  most  instances  restoration  will  occur  many  years  in  the  future,  management  is  required  to  make  judgements 
regarding  estimated  future  costs  of  restoration,  taking  into  account  estimated  timing  of  restoration  activities,  planned 
environmental legislation, the extent of restoration activities and future removal technologies.

14. Commitments for expenditure 
 
 
 
Capital Commitments 
The Group has contracted the following amounts for capital expenditure at the end of the reporting period for which no 
amounts have been provided for in the financial statements. 
Due within 1 year 
 Due within 1-5 years 
 Due later than 5 years 
  
Minimum Exploration Commitments 
The  Group  is  required  to  meet  minimum  expenditure  requirements  of    various  government  regulatory  bodies  and  joint 
arrangements.  These obligations may be subject to renegotiation, may be farmed out or may be relinquished and have not 
been provided for in the financial statements. 
Due within 1 year 
 Due within 1-5 years 
 Due later than 5 years 
  
The Group's share of the above commitments that relate to its interest in joint arrangements are $21.3 million (2015: $39.5 
million) for capital commitments and $124.9 million (2015: $108.3 million) for minimum exploration commitments. 
 
Operating Commitments 
The Group has contracted the following amounts for operating expenditure at the end of the reporting period for which no 
amounts have been provided for in the financial statements. 
Due within 1 year 
 Due within 1-5 years 
 Due later than 5 years 
  
 
Default  on  permit  commitments  by  other  joint  arrangement  participants  could  increase  the  Group’s  expenditure 
commitments  over  the  forthcoming  5  year  period  and/or  result  in  relinquishment  of  tenements.    Any  increase  in  the 
Group’s commitments that arises from a default by a joint arrangement party would be accompanied by a proportionate 
increase in the Group’s equity in the tenement concerned.

Financial and Risk Management 
This section provides details on the Group’s debt and related financing costs, interest income, cashflows and the fair values 
of items in the Group’s statement of financial position. It also provides details of the Group’s market, credit and liquidity 
risks and how they are managed. 
 
15. Finances and borrowings  
Borrowings  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value,  net  of  transaction  costs  incurred.    Subsequent  to  initial  recognition, 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption being recognised in the profit or 
loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.  Transaction costs are amortised on a straight line 
basis over the term of the facility. The unwinding of present value discounting on debt and provisions is also recognised as 
a  finance  cost.  Borrowings  are  classified  as  current  liabilities  unless  the  group  has  an  unconditional  right  to  defer 
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Interest income is recognised in the 
profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method and if not received at balance date, is reflected in the balance 
sheet as a receivable.

In December 2015, Beach negotiated a $530 million secured corporate debt facility comprising a $200 million three year 
revolving general facility, a $200 million five year revolving general facility, a $100 million three year revolving acquisition 
facility and a $30 million letter of credit facility. The new facility replaced the previous $330 million secured corporate debt 
facility.  
 
As at 30 June 2016, $150 million of the three year revolving general facility with a maturity date of 4 December 2018 was 
drawn,  with  the  remaining  $50  million  undrawn.    The  $200  million  revolving  general  facility  with  a  maturity  date  of  4 
December 2020 remained undrawn, the $100 million revolving acquisition facility with a maturity date of 4 December 2018 
remained undrawn, and $19 million of the letter of credit facility had been utilised by way of bank guarantees.  Bank debt 
bears interest at the relevant reference rate plus a margin.  
 
Prior to the merger between Beach and Drillsearch (refer Note 26), Drillsearch had US$125 million of Convertible Notes 
(Notes) on issue.  Under the terms and conditions of the Notes, the Notes became repayable at face value and were fully 
repaid during March and April 2016.

17. Financial risk management 
The  Group’s  activities  expose  it  to  a  variety  of  financial  risks  including  currency,  commodity,  interest  rate,  credit  and 
liquidity  risk.    Management  identifies  and  evaluates  all  financial  risks  and  enters  into  financial  risk  instruments  such  as 
foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge certain risk  exposures and minimise 
potential  adverse  effects  of  these  risk  exposures  in  accordance  with  the  Group’s  financial  risk  management  policy  as 
approved by the Board.  The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
The  Board  actively  reviews  all  hedging  on  a  regular  basis  with  updates  provided  to  the  Board  from  independent 
consultants/banking analysts to keep them fully informed of the current status of the financial markets. Reports providing 
detailed analysis of all hedging are also continually monitored against the Group’s financial risk management policy. 
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value being the cost on trade date, which includes transaction costs, 
when the related contractual rights or obligations exist.  Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are measured 
as set out below: 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for 
the purpose of selling in the near term. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
these assets are included in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.   
Loans and receivables: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 
are not quoted in an active market and are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Held-to-maturity  investments:  These  investments  have  fixed  maturities,  and  it  is  the  Group’s  intention  to  hold  these 
investments  to  maturity.    Any  held-to-maturity  investments  of  the  Group  are  stated  at  amortised  cost  using  effective 
interest rate method. 
Available-for-sale  financial  assets:  Available  for  sale  financial  assets  include  any  financial  assets  not  capable  of  being 
included in the above categories.  Available-for-sale financial assets are reflected at fair value.  Unrealised gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to equity. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or 
loss in equity is reclassified to profit or loss. 
Financial  liabilities:  Non-derivative  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  at  amortised  cost,  comprising  original  debt  less 
principal payments and amortisation. 
Fair  value:  Fair  value  is  determined  based  on  current  bid  prices  for  all  quoted  investments.    Valuation  techniques  are 
applied  to  determine  the  fair  value  for  all  unlisted  securities,  including  recent  arm’s  length  transactions,  reference  to 
similar instruments and option pricing models. 
Impairment: At each reporting date, the consolidated entity assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial 
instrument has been impaired.  In the case of available-for-sale financial instruments, a significant or prolonged decline in 
the  value  of  the  instrument  is  considered  to  determine  whether  an  impairment  has  arisen.    Impairment  losses  are 
transferred from the available for sale reserve to be recognised in the profit or loss. 
 
(a) Fair values 
Certain  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  Group  are  recognised  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  at  their  fair  value  in 
accordance  with  accounting  standard  AASB  13  Fair  Value  Measurement.  The  methods  used  in  estimating  fair  value  are 
made according to how the available information to value the asset or liability fits with the following fair value hierarchy: 
• 
•
Level 1 - the fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets; 
Level 2 - the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability; and 
Level 3 - the fair value is estimated using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market 
data.

  Financial assets 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Financial liabilities 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  methods  and  valuation  techniques  used  for  the  purpose  of  measuring  fair  value  are  unchanged  compared  to  the 
previous reporting period. 
 
The  following  summarises  the  significant  methods  and  assumptions  used  in  estimating  the  fair  values  of  financial 
instruments: 
 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative  financial  instruments  are  initially  recognised  at  cost.    Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  derivative  financial 
instruments are recognised at fair value using valuation techniques that maximise the use of observable market data where 
it is available with any gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value being recognised through the profit or loss. The Group’s 
derivatives  are  not  traded  in  active  markets,  however  all  significant  inputs  required  to  fair  value  an  instrument  are 
observable (Level 2). 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to their quoted closing price at the reporting 
date (Level 1).  These  investments are measured at fair value  using the closing price on the reporting date as  listed on 
various securities  exchanges. Unrealised  gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are  taken  directly to equity. 
When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is reclassified to the profit or loss. 
 
The Group did not measure any financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis as at 30 June 
2016 and there have been no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended 30 June 2016.  
 
The Group also has a number of other financial assets and liabilities which are not measured at fair value in the Statement 
of Financial Position as their carrying values are considered to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

17. Financial risk management (continued) 
(b) Market Risk 
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in 
a  currency  that  is  not  the  entity’s  functional  currency.    The  Group  sells  its  petroleum  and  commits  to  contracts  in  US 
dollars.  Australian  dollar  oil  option  contracts  are  used  by  the  Group  to  manage  its  foreign  currency  risk  exposure.  Any 
foreign currencies held which are surplus to forecast needs are converted to Australian dollars as required.    
The  Group  is  exposed  to  commodity  price  fluctuations  through  the  sale  of  petroleum  products  and  other  oil-linked 
contracts.  Option contracts are used by the Group to manage its forward commodity risk exposure.  The Group policy is to 
hedge up to 80% of forecast oil production costs and corporate costs by way of Australian dollar denominated oil options 
for up to 18 months.  Changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognised immediately in the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income.

Sensitivity analysis for all market risks  
The following table demonstrates the estimated sensitivity to changes in the relevant market parameter, with all variables 
held  constant,  on  post  tax  profit  and  equity,  which  are  the  same  as  the  profit  impact  flows  through  to  equity.    These 
sensitivities should not be used to forecast the future effect of a movement in these market parameters on future cash 
flows which may be different as a result of the Group commodity hedge book. 
 
 
 
Impact on post-tax profit and equity 
A$/$US - 10% increase in Australian/US dollar exchange rate  
A$/$US - 10% decrease in Australian/US dollar exchange rate 
 
US$ oil price – increase of $10/bbl 
US$ oil price – decrease of $10/bbl

(c) Credit risk 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and  deposits  with banks and financial 
institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions, and 
represents the potential financial loss if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. Management monitors credit risk on 
an ongoing basis. Gas sales contracts are spread across major Australian energy retailers and industrial users with liquid 
hydrocarbon products sales being made to major multi-national energy companies based on international market pricing.  
 
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that Beach's exposure to bad debts is 
not significant. The Group does not hold collateral, nor does it securitise its trade and other receivables.  At 30 June 2016, 
Beach does not have any material trade and other receivables which are outside standard trading terms which have not 
been provided against. 
 
 
 
Ageing of Receivables : 
Receivables not yet due * 
Past due not impaired 
Considered impaired 
Total Receivables 
*This excludes a $7.5 million receivable in relation to international taxes which has been fully provided for.  
 
Trade debtors to be settled within agreed terms are carried at amounts due. The collectability of debts is assessed at the 
end of the reporting period and specific provision is made for any doubtful accounts.  
 
The  Group  manages  its  credit  risk  on  financial  assets  by  predominantly  dealing  with  counterparties  with  an  investment 
grade credit rating. Customers who wish to trade on unsecured credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. 
Cash is placed on deposit amongst a number of financial institutions to minimise the risk of counterparty default.

17. Financial risk management (continued) 
(d) Liquidity Risk 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding 
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Group aims at 
maintaining flexibility in funding to meet ongoing operational requirements, exploration and development expenditure, 
and small-to-medium-sized opportunistic projects and investments, by keeping committed credit facilities available.  
Details of Beach's financing facilities are outlined in Note 15.

Equity and Group Structure 
This section provides information which will help users understand the equity and group structure as a whole including 
information on equity, reserves, dividends, subsidiaries, the parent company, related party transactions and other relevant 
information.  
 
 
 
18. Contributed equity 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Transaction costs of an equity transaction are accounted for as a reduction to the 
proceeds  received,  net  of  any  related  income  tax  benefit.  Transaction  costs  are  the  costs  that  are  incurred  directly  in 
connection with the issue of those equity instruments and which would not have been incurred had those instruments not 
been issued.

18. Contributed equity (continued) 
 
In accordance with changes to applicable corporations legislation effective from 1 July 1998, the shares issued do not have 
a par value as there is no limit on the authorised share capital of the Company. All shares issued under the Company’s 
employee incentive plan are accounted for as a share-based payment (refer Note 4 and 19 for further details). Shares 
issued under the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan and employee incentive plan represent non-cash investing and 
financing activities. On a show of hands, every person qualified to vote, whether as a member or proxy or attorney or 
representative, shall have one vote.  Upon a poll, every member shall have one vote for each ordinary share held. 
Details of shares and rights issued and outstanding under the Employee Incentive plan and Executive Incentive Plan are 
provided in Note 4.   
Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
Beach has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan under which holders of fully paid ordinary shares may elect to have all 
or part of their dividend entitlements satisfied by the issue of new fully paid ordinary shares rather than by being paid in 
cash.  Shares are issued under this plan at a discount to the market price as set by the Board. 
Capital management 
Management  is  responsible  for  managing  the  capital  of  the  Group,  on  behalf  of  the  Board,  in  order  to  maintain  an 
appropriate debt to equity ratio, provide shareholders with adequate returns and ensure the Group can fund its operations 
with secure, cost-effective and flexible sources of funding. The Group debt and capital includes ordinary shares, borrowings 
and financial liabilities including derivatives supported by financial assets.  Management effectively manages the capital of 
the Group by assessing the financial risks and adjusting the capital structure in response to changes in these risks and in the 
market.  The responses include the management of debt levels, dividends to shareholders and share issues.  There have 
been no changes in the strategy adopted by management to control the capital during the year.  The Group gearing ratio is  
13.5%  (2015:  11.0%).  Gearing  has  been  calculated  as  financial  liabilities  (including  borrowings,  derivatives  and  bank 
guarantees) as a proportion of these items plus shareholder’s equity.   
 
 
19. Reserves  
The Share based payments reserve is used to recognise the fair value of shares, options and rights issued to employees of 
the Company.
The Available-for-sale reserve is used to recognise changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets. Amounts 
are recognised in the profit or loss when the associated assets are sold or impaired.
The Foreign currency translation reserve is used to record foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the 
financial statements of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than Australian dollars.
The Profit distribution reserve represents an amount allocated from retained earnings that is preserved for future dividend 
payments.

22. Deed of cross guarantee  
Pursuant to Class Order 98/1418, wholly-owned subsidiaries Australian Petroleum Investments Pty Ltd, Delhi Petroleum Pty 
Ltd, Drillsearch Energy Pty Ltd, Impress Energy Pty Ltd, Impress (Cooper Basin) Pty Ltd and Springfield Oil & Gas Pty Ltd

26. Business combination  
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, including business combinations 
involving  entities  or  businesses  under  common  control,  regardless  of  whether  equity  instruments  issued  or  liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Where equity instruments are issued in an acquisition, the fair value of the 
instruments  is  their  published  market  price  as  at  the  date  of  exchange  unless,  in  rare  circumstances,  it  can  be 
demonstrated  that  the  published  price  at  the  date  of  exchange  is  an  unreliable  indicator  of  fair  value  and  that  other 
evidence and valuation methods provide a more reliable measure of fair value. Transaction costs arising on the issue of 
equity  instruments  are  recognised  directly  in  equity.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the 
extent of any non-controlling interest. Transaction costs incurred in relation to the business combination are expensed as 
incurred to the Statement of Profit or Loss. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the consolidated 
entity’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as an increase in the  development / exploration assets 
acquired. 
 
On 23 October 2015, Beach and Drillsearch Energy Limited (Drillsearch) announced they had entered into a binding Merger 
Implementation Agreement to create the leading mid-cap ASX oil and gas company through an all-scrip merger. Under the 
terms of the agreement, Beach agreed to acquire all of the shares in Drillsearch that it did not already own via a Scheme of 
Arrangement (the Scheme).  
 
Following approval of the Scheme by the Federal Court of Australia in February 2016, the scheme was implemented on 1 
March 2016 with Drillsearch shareholders receiving 1.25 Beach shares for each Drillsearch share held and Drillsearch 
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Beach. 
 
A gain of $1.0 million on the revaluation of Beach’s initial 4.9% interest in Drillsearch to fair value was recognised in the 
Statement of Profit or Loss along with the expensing of merger costs of $7.7 million. 
 
The acquisition had the following effect on the consolidated entity: 
 
 
Purchase consideration 
Fair value of net assets acquired  
Goodwill on acquisition 
 
 
 
 
Assets and liabilities held at acquisition date: 
 
 
 
 
Net assets 
 
The acquisition of Drillsearch resulted in a net cash inflow of $184.0 million for the Group comprising cash acquired on the 
acquisition  of  $185.5  million  less  a  $1.5  million  payment  for  Drillsearch  options.  The  purchase  consideration  of  $311.0 
million comprised $295.6 million for the value of Beach shares issued (Note 18) and $13.9 million for the fair value of an 
initial shareholding the Company held in Drillsearch prior to the acqusition and the $1.5 million payment for Drillsearch 
options. 
 
The  fair  value  assigned  to  non-current  assets  of  $328.3  million  included  $39.4  million  for  property,plant  &  equipment,  
$211.6 million for development assets and $77.3 million for exploration.  
 
In the full year to 30 June 2016, Drillsearch contributed $61.3 million to group revenues and $3.9 million profit to the 
consolidated loss before tax.

Additional information required to be disclosed under Australian Accounting Standards. 
 
27. Contingent liabilities  
 
The directors are of the opinion that the recognition of a provision is not required in respect of the following matters, as it 
is  not  probable  that  a  future  sacrifice  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required  or  the  amount  is  not  capable  of  reliable 
measurement. 
 
Service agreements 
Service  agreements  exist  with  other  executive  officers  under  which  termination  benefits  may, 
in  appropriate 
circumstances, become payable. The maximum contingent liability at 30 June 2016 under the service agreements for the 
other executive officers excluding the Chief Executive Officer (and the Managing Director for 2015) is $1,921,850 (2015: 
$2,807,900). 
 
Bank guarantees 
As  at  30  June  2016,  Beach  has  provided  $22.2  million  of  bank  guarantees  or  letters  of  credit  as  security  for  our 
environmental obligations, corporate leases and work programs. 
Beach has been provided with a $30 million letter of credit facility, of which $19.5 million had been utilised by way of bank 
guarantees  (refer  Note  15  for  further  details  on  the  syndicated  debt  facility)  with  the  remaining  $2.7  million  of  bank 
guarantees being cash secured.  
 
Parent Company Guarantees 
Beach has provided parent company guarantees in respect of performance obligations for certain exploration interests.

Fees paid to KPMG have increased in FY16 mainly due to the additional non-recurring work associated with the merger 
with  Drillsearch.    Other  services  provided  for  overseas  subsidaires  is  expected  to  fall  as  Beach  completes  its  exit  from 
certain overseas interests.   
 
29. Subsequent events  
Egypt divestment 
On 17 August 2016, Beach announced it had completed the sale of Beach Petroleum (Egypt) Pty Ltd, whose core asset is a 
22%  interest  in  the  Abu  Sennan  Concession,  to  Rockhopper  Exploration  plc.  Transaction  terms  provide  for  cash 
consideration of up to US$20.5 million. An upfront payment of US$10.8 million was received on completion, and deferred 
consideration  of  approximately  US$7.4  million  is  expected  over  the  next  12  months  subject  to  receipt  of  outstanding 
receivables.  Payments  received  by  Beach  prior  to  completion  include  a  deposit  of  US$1.1  million  and  outstanding 
receivables of US$1.2 million. In addition to cash consideration payments, a post completion adjustment will be agreed and 
settled  by  early  Q2  FY17  to  account  for  net  cash  flow  attributable  to  the  assets  from  1  January  2016  to  completion.  A 
payment to Beach is expected in relation to this adjustment. 
 
Sale of Queensland oil assets 
On 3 August 2016, Beach announced it had entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement with Bridgeport in relation 
to the sale of various operated oil permit interests within the greater Kenmore-Bodalla area. The mature oil fields comprise 
Beach’s only operated production in the Queensland area of the Cooper Basin and contributed 140 kbbl of net production 
in  FY16.    The  transaction  is  expected  to  complete  by  the  end  of  Q2  FY17  and  will  provide  modest  cash  consideration, 
manage ongoing liabilities and increase the efficiency of Beach’s Cooper Basin operations. 
 
Other than the above matters, there has not arisen in the interval between 30 June 2016 and up to the date of this report, 
any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the directors, to affect substantially 
the operations of the Group, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent financial 
years, unless otherwise noted in the financial report.
