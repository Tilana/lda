<p><b>  Report of the independent expert on the situation of human 
rights in Somalia, Shamsul Bari</b>* 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> Intensified fighting in Mogadishu beginning late August between armed militant 
groups, Al&#8211;Shabaab and its allies, and the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) 
forces supported by AMISOM has led to serious worsening of the human rights and 
humanitarian law situation in Somalia. More civilians were killed or injured during this 
period than at any other time in the recent past. 
</p>
<p> The drawing of the fighting into areas populated or frequented by civilians, and 
the use of imprecise mortars by all parties causing severe casualties and property damage 
continued to be a matter of serious concern. There have been persistent allegations that 
heavy retaliatory mortar fire by AMISOM troops has been responsible for many civilian 
casualties. 
</p>
<p> The recruitment, training and use of children in the conflict, especially by the 
armed militants, continued unabated. While recruitment of girls has been rare and is 
generally regarded as socially unacceptable, there are documented accounts of girls 
working for armed opposition groups, particularly in cooking and cleaning. Girls are also 
brought in to transport detonators, for logistics, and intelligence collection, though they 
do receive weapons training as well. The lack of schooling for children has made them 
especially vulnerable for recruitment by armed groups. 
</p>
<p> In territories controlled by armed insurgents, many civilians do not have access to 
humanitarian aid and they are at increasing risk of being punished under arbitrary 
interpretations of sharia law. Journalists and civil society activists have seen their space 
for work restricted by threats, intimidation, arbitrary arrests and killings. 
</p>
<p>  
 * The report was submitted after the deadline in order to include the most recent developments. 
</p>

<p> 
 The situation of human rights defenders deteriorated significantly. They have 
been targeted by all actors involved in the conflict. Key media outlets and individual 
journalists have come under attack. Many journalists, who were targeted, arbitrarily 
arrested, subjected to kidnapping and targeted killings, fled the country to seek refuge in 
the neighbouring countries. 
</p>
<p> In Puntland and Somaliland, the situation remained more stable, with functioning 
authorities in both. In Somaliland, the successful holding of peaceful presidential 
elections in June and the inauguration of a new President have raised hopes for a new 
era, including with respect to human rights. In Puntland, the human rights situation 
deteriorated in the past few months, as a result of measures undertaken by the 
government to step up security in the face of increased infiltration by armed militants 
from the south. These included the forced transfer of some 900 male IDPs from Bossasso 
to Galkayo, restrictions on the media, including the imprisonment of a journalist for six 
years and other measures which are limiting the space of civil society. 
</p>
<p> Overall, Somalia continued to slide deeper and deeper into humanitarian crisis. 
Despite this, however, there are hopeful signs on the horizon. An effort has been made in 
this report to draw attention upon them. The report has argued for continued and 
intensified efforts of all concerned to sustain the positive developments.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/26 
of October 2009, in which the Council expressed its deep concern at the deteriorating 
human rights and humanitarian conditions in Somalia and renewed the mandate of the 
independent expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia (independent expert) for one 
year. The expert was requested to submit his reports to the thirteenth and fifteenth sessions 
of the Council. The present report covers the period from March to August 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert undertook his fifth mission to Somalia from 26 July to 6 
August 2010. This took him to Nairobi, Hargeisa in Somaliland, Garowe in Puntland and 
Kampala. He was unable to visit south&#8211;central Somalia and Mogadishu for security 
reasons. The visit to Uganda was undertaken primarily to visit the headquarters of the 
European Union Training Mission (EUTM) for Somali Security Forces. The independent 
expert had earlier also visited Rome on 6 and 7 July 2010 to discuss the human rights 
situation in Somalia with the Italian authorities and academic institutionsfor reasons 
mentioned below.  
</p>
<p>3. In Nairobi, the independent expert met the new Special Representative of the 
Secretary&#8211;General for Somalia, Augustine Mahiga, with whom he had extensive 
discussions on the situation in Somalia and possible areas of cooperation between them. 
The independent expert benefited from his talks with the United Nations Resident and 
Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia, Mark Bowden, who briefed him on developments 
in the previous six months. He received extensive briefings from other members of the 
United Nations country team, including from the Head of Human Rights Unit of the United 
Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS) who accompanied him during the whole trip. 
The meeting with senior officials of the African Union was extremely useful in better 
understanding the role of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the 
circumstances under which it operate. Additionally, he met with representatives of donor 
Governments, a senior official of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), 
members of the non&#8211;governmental organizations (NGO) community and Somali citizens. 
Ministers of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) were not available to meet the 
expert. 
</p>
<p>4. In Hargeisa, the independent expert was received by the new President of 
Somaliland, Mohamed Mahmud Silanyo. He was honoured to meet the President so soon 
after his formal inauguration. He benefited from the views of the President on, inter alia, 
the situation of Somalia as a whole.  
</p>
<p>5. In Puntland, the independent expert met with the President of Puntland, Abdirahman 
Farole, and certain ministers and senior officials of his administration. Discussions with 
them centred primarily on the prevailing security situation in the region and its impact on 
internally displaced persons (IDPs). The independent expert visited IDP settlements in 
Garowe.  
</p>
<p>6. In both Puntland and Somaliland, he had extensive discussions with members of the 
United Nations country team, the NGO community and some local citizens. 
</p>
<p>7. In Kampala, the independent expert met with senior officials of the Ugandan 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defence who provided him with the Ugandan perspective 
on the situation in Somalia. He also met with members of the United Nations country team 
in Kampala, some civil society organizations (CSOs) and a large number of Somali 
nationals, refugees and diaspora residing in Uganda. An important aspect of his Uganda trip 
was the briefings he received from EUTM on the training provided by them to new recruits 
of the Somali Security Forces, including on human rights and humanitarian law.  </p>


<p>8. In Rome, the independent expert had useful talks with senior officials of the 
Government of Italy on the human rights and humanitarian situation in Somalia. They 
discussed possible new activities which could be undertaken by the international 
community to improve the situation. Useful discussions also took place with Italian 
academics and scholars on Somalia. The independent expert was invited to address the 
Human Rights Committee of the Italian Senate, following which address useful exchanges 
took place. The participation of the Italian Permanent Representative in Geneva in the 
meetings demonstrated the country&#8217;s abiding interest in improving the human rights 
situation in Somalia.  
</p>
<p>9. The independent expert also benefited enormously from his talks with the Somali 
Ambassador in Rome, former Somali Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein Adde. The 
Ambassador had also arranged for a meeting at his office with members of the Somali 
diaspora living in Italy, with whom the independent expert had most useful discussions. 
Both the meetings were enhanced by the presence of the Somali Permanent Representative 
to the United Nations in Geneva, Yusuf Ismail Bari&#8211;Bari. The independent expert&#8217;s 
understanding of the conflict in Somalia was greatly enhanced by his talks with the two 
ambassadors. He is immensely grateful to them.  
</p>
<p>10. The information contained in this report, particularly on the human rights and 
humanitarian law situation in Mogadishu and south&#8211;central Somalia, is based on the 
independent expert&#8217;s talks with the above&#8211;mentioned persons and reports from United 
Nations agencies and NGOs. The independent expert also consulted some recent 
publications on developments in Somalia and daily media reports. Since he was not able to 
visit the areas concerned, he tried to cross&#8211;check relevant information, wherever possible, 
with refugees and IDPs who recently arrived from the war zone.  
</p>
<p>11. The focus of this report is primarily on developments since the last report of the 
independent expert to the Council in March 2010. The report is structured under the 
following headings/chapters: the human rights and humanitarian law situation in 
Mogadishu and other parts of south&#8211;central Somalia; human rights in Somaliland; human 
rights in Puntland; some reflections on recent developments; and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights and humanitarian law situation in Mogadishu 
and other parts of south&#8211;central Somalia  
</b></p>
<p>12. The human rights and humanitarian law situation in Somalia continued to be 
extremely precarious during the reporting period. The violence which has long stalked 
Somalia continued unabated, particularly in Mogadishu, making it perhaps the worst 
anthropogenic humanitarian crisis in the world today. And yet it continues to receive the 
least attention from the international community.   
</p>
<p>13. An effort has been made in the following paragraphs to put together selected 
information on the human rights and humanitarian law violations which occurred during the 
reporting period. It is intended to convey the scale, nature and type of violations which have 
been taking place though it is far from exhaustive, given the constraints on human rights 
monitoring due to the lack of access to the area.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Conflict&#8211;related violations 
</b></p>
<p>14. At the time of writing, heavy fighting which had broken out in Mogadishu on 23 
August 2010 was again taking its toll on the civilian population. ICRC reported hospitals 
being &#8220;swamped&#8221; with war&#8211;wounded. Among the victims was a veteran journalist killed by 
a stray bullet. Three students were reportedly among those who died when a roadside bomb </p>


<p>exploded.  Four AMISOM soldiers also died in an attack directed at the presidential palace. 
The most egregious incident occurred on 24 August 2010 when suicide bombers attacked 
Hotel Muna, killing at least 32 persons, including 4 members of parliament, hotel workers 
and others. Observers described the incident, as part of which the two suicide bombers blew 
themselves up, as one of the most violent witnessed in the capital for some time. As the 
fasting month of Ramadan began on 11 August 2010, it was reported that the hardline 
militant groups Al&#8211;Shabaab, Hizbul Islam and Ahlu Sunnah Waljama&#8217;a had vowed to 
increase their attacks on TFG and AMISOM troops throughout the month.  
</p>
<p>15. These incidents added to the toll of suffering that Somalis have endured for so long.  
According to a report by the Elman Peace Center of Somalia,1 the death toll rose in the first 
seven months of 2010 as a result of increased shelling and fighting. It stated that: &#8220;at least 
918 civilians died and 2,555 others were injured in violence since January &#8230; The death toll 
of the first seven months of 2010 is higher than that of the same period of 2009. Most of the 
casualties were caused by shelling by the warring groups in Mogadishu&#8221;. Some 745 people 
died and 3,435 others were injured in the same period in 2010. While most of the casualties 
appeared to have been caused by violent attacks by the militant group Al&#8211;Shabaab and its 
allies, against TFG and AMISOM forces and retaliatory attacks by the latter, direct fighting 
between moderate Islamists, namely Ahlu Sunnah, and Al&#8211;Shabaab, combined with inter&#8211;
clan clashes in central Somalia, also contributed to the higher number of deaths. 
</p>
<p>16. A press release from M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) contained in the weekly 
report of the Protection Cluster Update of 6 August 2010 also provides a good description 
of the nature and scale of casualties caused by the continued fighting and shelling in 
Mogadishu during the first half of 2010. It stated that, of a total of 2,854 patients treated by 
MSF&#8211;sponsored medical teams at its hospital in Dayniile, Mogadishu, in the last seven 
months, 48 percent had suffered &#8220;war&#8211;related injuries&#8221;. It further stated that&#8221;: &#8220;in the 84&#8211;
bed hospital, 64 percent of the war&#8211;wounded patients sustained serious blast injuries, 
largely consistent with continuous intensive mortar fire in the city residential areas. 
Notably, 38 percent of the people with war&#8211;related injuries were women and children under 
14 years of age.&#8221; The register of the surgical programme at the hospital, which began its 
operations in September 2007, showed that 50 per cent of the 11,888 patients to date have 
suffered &#8220;war&#8211;related injuries&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>17. In addition, specific reports received by the United Nations from its partners listed 
more than 290 incidents during the period from January to June 2010 in which civilians 
were reportedly injured or killed as a result of failure of parties to the conflict, including 
TFG and AMISOM forces, to adhere to the principles of international humanitarian law 
relating to the protection of civilians. The waging of hostilities in urban areas &#8211; as provoked 
by Al&#8211;Shabaab &#8211; inevitably brings with it huge risks to the civilian population, particularly 
if the principles of international humanitarian law of proportionality, targeting of only 
military objects and the requirement to take precautionary measures to avoid civilian 
casualties are disregarded. Both TFG and AMISOM have suffered many fatal casualties as 
a result of attacks by Al&#8211;Shabaab.  
</p>
<p>18. In&#8211;depth interviews carried out by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and UNPOS of a cross&#8211;section of individuals who 
had fled south&#8211;central Somalia in recent months and taken shelter in the Dadaab refugee 
camps in Kenya confirmed the ongoing patterns of violations of international human rights 
and humanitarian law, including failure by the parties to protect civilian populations 
adequately and the use and recruitment of children and young people.  The interviews also

</p>

<p>highlighted once again the severe nature of abuses committed in areas which are under the 
control of Al&#8211;Shabaab or other armed groups.     
</p>
<p><b> B. Abuses by armed groups in areas under their control 
</b></p>
<p>19. Between April and early July, United Nations human rights workers recorded 
reports of nine executions by firing squad or stoning by Al&#8211;Shabaab mostly for alleged 
spying or murder, five cases of amputation, mostly of suspected thieves, and the flogging or 
whipping of some 28 individuals on the orders of courts set up by these groups. Whatever 
the accusation against the persons concerned, these cases amount to violations of the right 
to life and physical integrity and the right to due process, given the summary nature of the 
proceedings against the accused. Often the punishments were carried out in public. In 
addition, seven cases of beheading were reported, including five workers allegedly killed in 
April 2010 because they were involved in reconstruction work at the Parliament. 
</p>
<p>20. Some of the reported violations occurred in the context of orders issued by Hizbul 
Islam and Al&#8211;Shabaab, restricting social behaviour or dress codes, such as bans on playing 
music or watching football issued by Al&#8211;Shabaab and Hizbul Islam. In one case, two 
people were allegedly shot dead on 12 June 2010 when they fled Hizbul Islam, which had 
raided a home in Mogadishu where fans were watching a football World Cup game and 
captured dozens of those present. In another case, three women were allegedly captured and 
beaten by Al&#8211;Shabaab for failing to wear the <i>abaya</i> in June. 
</p>
<p>21. A recent example of the nature of physical punishment being imposed by Islamist 
militants in areas under their control is the reported whipping with 50 lashes, imposed on 
30 July 2010 on a 31&#8211;year&#8211;old man, originally from Gaalkacyo, who was arrested by 
members of Al&#8211;Shabaab when he was found chewing <i>khat</i> in Ayub, Warsheikh district.  
There have been reports of other more serious punishments meted out to &#8220;offenders&#8221; in Al&#8211;
Shabaab&#8211;controlled areas, including one in which the tongue of a young man was allegedly 
cut out. 
</p>
<p>22. In a press statement released on 10 August 2010 after completion of his recent 
mission to the region, the independent expert urged the international community to &#8220;explore 
all possible means to stop summary executions, including beheadings of innocent people, 
amputations; floggings, whippings, forcible marriages of young girls to militiamen, the use 
of civilians as human shields, the imposition of strictest dress code for women and the 
prohibition of public mass media and the bans imposed on listening to music and public 
gathering, all with lack of due process.&#8221;2 Threats and intimidation transmitted in person, by 
order or via mobile phones have become routine for many and form part of the panoply of 
measures used to impose the armed group&#8217;s power.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>23. The media continued to be targeted, mostly by the insurgents Al&#8211;Shabaab and 
Hizbul Islam. In Mogadishu, media houses were caught between Hizbul Islam, who in 
April 2010 ordered all radio stations to stop playing music, and the Benadir Administration 
which threatened to close down any radio station that obeyed the music ban. One radio 
station was raided on 14 April 2010 by Hizbul Islam. Another local radio station was raided 
by Al&#8211;Shabaab on 21 May 2010 and equipment was taken away. At least three journalists 
were held briefly during this period by Hizbul Islam. Eight others were wounded when a 
</p>
<p>  
 2  See http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10269&amp;LangID=E. </p>


<p>bomb was detonated at a police building where Al&#8211;Shabaab was holding a press 
conference. There were also concerns about two incidents involving Government 
authorities and related to the ongoing conflict.  A reporter and cameraman were reportedly 
detained and questioned after they took pictures of their colleague who was wounded in 
crossfire on 1 July 2010. Most serious was the arrest warrant issued against a Somali <i>New 
York Times</i> journalist after the newspaper published an article about the recruitment and use 
of children by Government forces in June.    
</p>
<p><b> D. Displacement of population 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to a UNHCR report, as a result of continued violence and insecurity, in 
the first seven months of 2010, almost 50,065 Somalis sought refuge in neighbouring 
countries and over 200,000 were internally displaced, mainly in south&#8211;central Somalia, in 
particular from Mogadishu.3 That makes Somalia the country generating the highest 
number of refugees in the world after Afghanistan and Iraq. As of the end of July 2010, 
there were 600,484 Somali refugees, mainly hosted by Kenya, Yemen, Ethiopia, Eritrea, 
Djibouti, Tanzania and Uganda. In addition 1.4 million Somalis were internally displaced 
within the country.4  
</p>
<p>25. A further indication of the desperation of the people living in war&#8211;stricken areas of 
Somalia was the flight of tens of thousands of people from the country who risked their 
lives by undertaking dangerous journeys across the Gulf of Aden to reach Yemen. Many 
died during the journey, while others were subjected to abuse and injured at the hands of 
unscrupulous smugglers. While there were some Ethiopians among them, the majority of 
persons attempting to use these routes were from Somalia. The rates of human smuggling 
continued to rise every year. While in 2007, 29,500 people tried to cross the Gulf of Aden, 
in 2008 the number rose to 50,000 &#8211; with more than 1,000 dying during the journey &#8211; and 
to 77,802 in 2009. Since January 2010, more than 21,000 individuals had crossed into 
Yemen.  
</p>
<p>26. Indeed, human trafficking, especially for the purposes of sexual exploitation and 
domestic servitude, both inside and outside the country, remains an issue of serious 
concern. In May 2010, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) issued a fact 
sheet highlighting the widespread nature of the problem and the vulnerability of IDPs, 
economic migrants, and especially women and children from very poor families relating to 
this practice. In collaboration with the Somaliland and Puntland authorities and civil 
society, IOM has developed counter&#8211;trafficking programmes.      
</p>
<p><b> E. Sexual and gender&#8211;based violence 
</b></p>
<p>27. While such violence is normally underreported, according to a likely confidential 
database kept by United Nations agencies, some 409 incidents of rape, attempted 
rape/sexual assault, forced prostitution and domestic violence took place in the period 
January to June 2010 in Somalia. Assessments conducted revealed that there was a high 
prevalence of sexual violence in IDP settlements, where victims were generally of minority 
clan origin, bereft of clan protection and often forced to engage in risky coping 
mechanisms.   
</p>
<p>  
 3  See &#8220;UNHCR Somalia Briefing Sheet&#8221;, July 2010. 
 4  Ibid. </p>


<p><b> F. Child rights 
</b></p>
<p>28. Children continued to be disproportionately affected by the conflict in central and 
southern Somalia. Recruitment of children to be put on the front line remained an issue of 
major concern, as recent media attention highlighted the presence of children within the 
ranks of the forces linked to the Government, although the TFG has denied this. The 
majority of the reports of new instances of recruitment and training of children attribute 
responsibility to the anti&#8211;Government elements. On 15 June 2010, TFG President Sheik 
Sharif Ahmed, in a public statement, instructed his Army Chief to investigate the alleged 
presence of children in the Armed Forces.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Somali conflict impacted children more generally in and around Mogadishu. As 
an example, it was reported that on 4 July 2010, an explosion killed some staff of the 
Ministry of Finance. Government forces responded by storming the neighbouring Alhilal 
Primary and Secondary School in the Hamweyne District, where they arrested 19 students 
aged between 7 and 16 years. These children were subsequently released, but the incident 
demonstrated the extreme vulnerability of young people to the suspicion of being directly 
involved in the fighting. 
</p>
<p>30. Rape and other grave sexual violence against children continued to be a major 
protection concern. Impunity for the perpetrators of crimes against children, including 
sexual violence, remained common in all parts of Somalia. This was happening despite 
ongoing United Nations work with law enforcement entities and the judiciary in certain 
areas to ensure such cases are passed through the formal legal system. There was, however, 
no evidence to suggest that the parties to the conflict were systematically engaging in 
patterns of rape and other acts of sexual violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to food, nutrition and health 
</b></p>
<p>31. According to United Nations reports, the nearly countrywide good rains during the 
April&#8211;June <i>Gu</i> rainy season had improved the food security situation in Somalia, reducing 
the number of people facing a humanitarian crisis from 2.65 million to 2 million people, 
which is a 25 per cent of reduction from the previous season. However 2 million in crisis 
represents 27 per cent of the total population, which is still very significant and of great 
concern. This figure, based on the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) 
Post&#8211;<i>Gu</i> countrywide assessment released in August 2010,5 was a slight improvement from 
the beginning of the year when 3.2 million, or 43 per cent of the population, were in need of 
humanitarian assistance. Nevertheless, nationally, the number of acutely malnourished 
children was estimated to be 230,000, of which 35,000 are severely malnourished, the 
majority of the latter being in south&#8211;central Somalia.   
</p>
<p>32. The forced movement of people caused by the conflict, combined with the rains, had 
also limited people&#8217;s ability to access clean water and basic health services. Thus, even 
though access to food may have improved for some, a &#8220;public health crisis&#8221; persisted in 
south&#8211;central Somalia. For example, there were 25,000 reported cases of acute watery 
diarrhoea from January to May 2010, the majority of which were children<i>. 
</i></p>
<p>33. The FSNAU assessment confirmed deterioration in the rates of severe acute 
malnutrition from 4.6 per cent six months previously to 7.1 per cent in the Central region, 
which was most affected by the cumulative effects of drought, high food prices and 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>http://www.fsnau.org/in-focus/somalia-humanitarian-crisis-eases-2-million-somalis-still-need-aid. </p>


<p>displacement. One in six Somali children countrywide and one in five in south and central 
regions were malnourished, while in Mogadishu there was a notable increase in the number 
of admissions of malnourished children to feeding centres.  
</p>
<p>34. It was not clear whether the suspension of World Food Programme food assistance 
in 2009 in areas under the control of Al&#8211;Shabaab and its allies in the south&#8211;central region 
had a serious negative impact on the nutrition situation there. In the interim period, 
agencies were focusing on nutritional interventions such as supplementary and therapeutic 
feeding centres. Food aid was still continuing in Mogadishu, where many of the most 
vulnerable persons were located, and in some areas of Central and North Somalia, a total of 
nearly 1.8 million people were receiving some form food assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>35. During two decades of conflict, almost two generations of Somali boys and girls 
have been denied the benefit of a full education. Existing education systems, already 
limited in their scope, have been severely affected by the conflict. Somalis have 
nevertheless managed to organize strong networks of independent and private schooling in 
many parts of the country. The traditional education system &#8211; Madrasas and Quranic 
schools &#8211; is filling the gap left by formal schooling.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Right to justice 
</b></p>
<p>36. The absence over many years of a central government left the Somali population 
mostly in the hands of clan&#8211;based local authorities with militia powers. Islamist insurgents 
subsequently joined the fray. Combined with inefficient or ineffective systems, this long 
left the civilian population without effective legal recourse. Under these conditions, there is 
no mechanism to bring justice to the victims or any measure of accountability for 
perpetrators of the crimes. This led to the prevalence of a culture of impunity and the 
breakdown of any value system that leads to respect for rule of law and human rights. The 
question of impunity is at the core of the ongoing conflict in Somalia. This probably was 
one of the most neglected aspects of the Somali conflict. </p>
<p><b> III. Human rights in Somaliland 
</b></p>
<p>37. The trip of the independent expert to Hargeisa, Somaliland, was very short mainly 
because of limited flight possibilities. However, despite his short stay, the independent 
expert was grateful to have been received by the new President of Somaliland, Mohamed 
Mahmud Silanyo, within two days of him assuming office. The assumption of office in 
Somaliland by the new President had created new hope not only for Somaliland but also for 
Somalia as a whole.  
</p>
<p>38. The independent expert told President Silanyo, inter alia, that the international 
community had high hopes that Somaliland would set an example of good governance for 
the region which would be based on principles of human rights and respect for the human 
person. He welcomed the President&#8217;s decision to dismantle the much criticized regional 
security committees which had served as arbitrary instruments in the hands of the executive 
without due process. He added that the President would have the opportunity to revise the 
Somaliland Human Rights Commission Act that the previous Government had enacted and 
make it fully compliant with the Principles relating to the status of national institutions for 
the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles).  </p>


<p>39. The President said that he was aware of the many challenges facing his 
administration. He had inherited a very difficult economic and security situation. There 
were extremist groups operating in Somaliland which was a matter of great concern for his 
Government and people. He referred to the recent suicide bombing by Al&#8211;Shabaab in 
Kampala was a lesson for the entire region. 
</p>
<p>40. The President recalled that in his first public statement he made a commitment to 
dissolving the regional security committees so that the courts would be able to fully 
exercise their jurisdictions. He pledged to strengthen the rule of law and respect for human 
rights. He promised to review the human rights violations committed under the previous 
regime and to release immediately those who were innocent and being detained illegally 
without due process. 
</p>
<p>41. The independent expert felt that the inauguration of President Silanyo to the highest 
office in Somaliland had opened new opportunities for Somalia and the region as a whole. 
The international community should take full advantage of the situation and make sure that 
the new Government was helped in every ways possible so that it could fulfil his 
commitments to human rights. The importance of the success of Somaliland for the future 
of Somalia as a whole could not be overemphasized.  
</p>
<p>42. While in Hargeisa, the independent expert also had useful meetings with United 
Nations agencies, representatives of NGOs/CSOs, including the Centre of Research and 
Development from Mogadishu, and the President of the Parliamentary Committee for 
Human Rights and Justice. They all shared the optimism generated by the recent elections 
and change of Government.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights in Puntland 
</b></p>
<p>43. The trip of the independent expert to Puntland was equally short. He could only visit 
Garowe and could not go to Bossaso where the largest concentration of IDPs was located 
because of the recent attack that was launched by the &#8220;Atom armed group&#8221; against the 
Puntland forces around the Bossasso city. His meeting with Abdirahman Farole, President 
of the Puntland State of Somalia, was as usual most warm and cordial. As before, the 
President had asked a number of his senior ministers and officials to be present.  
</p>
<p>44. The independent expert complimented President Farole on the achievements of his 
Government since their last meeting two years previously. These include that the 
Government was able to pay the salaries of civil servants; the education curricula was being 
updated and harmonized with UNESCO standards; there had been improvements in the 
delivery of health services; an independent electoral commission had been set up; a new 
constitution had been adopted by the Puntland Parliament to be put to the people for a 
referendum; and efforts were continuing to combat piracy. 
</p>
<p>45. The independent expert then raised a concern about the recent forcible deportations 
by the Puntland authorities of some 900 IDPs from Bossaso to areas in the south. This, he 
said, was contrary to the long tradition of hospitality shown by Puntland to IDPs, as well as 
to its responsibilities under international law. Having said this, he also recognized that 
Puntland still hosted the largest number of Somali IDPs on its territory. In response, 
President Farole emphasized the changed circumstances created by the infiltration of Al&#8211;
Shabaab elements in Puntland, particularly among the IDP population. He pointed out that 
his Government was spending bulk of its financial resources to meet security requirements 
and could not afford to take any risks. He cited the recent attacks in Galgala in the north, by 
an insurgent group linked to Al&#8211;Shabaab, as evidence that the security threats in Puntland 
were effective. He mentioned that three members of the Puntland Parliament had been </p>


<p>killed by this group which also aided pirates and was involved in human trafficking and 
weapons smuggling to Yemen.  
</p>
<p>46. On the forcible deportation of 900 IDPs to the south, the President underlined that 
only young men had been deported. He stated that his Government had found, after 
investigation, that many of these young IDPs had been kidnapped, brainwashed and trained 
by Al&#8211;Shabaab prior to being sent to Puntland with specific tasks. He noted that his 
Government had the responsibility to make sure that IDPs were not used to harm his 
people. He further underlined that following the deportations, his administration was 
liaising with the United Nations agencies to ensure humanitarian needs and respect for 
human rights of the IDPs in Puntland.  
</p>
<p>47. On piracy, President Farole mentioned that as a result of his administration&#8217;s efforts, 
piracy&#8211;related activities had reduced by 70 per cent and most of the pirates had shifted from 
Puntland to the Central regions, north of Mogadishu and Kismayo. There were 400 pirates 
in Puntland prisons, including some listed by United States intelligence, which exceeded 
the capacity of the prisons. Clan elders had done a commendable job of sensitizing the 
youth to abandoning piracy. He was saddened to learn that despite the efforts of his 
administration, the International Maritime Organization had characterized Puntland, in a 
report, as a criminal state and a hub for piracy.  
</p>
<p>48. President Farole reiterated his displeasure that Puntland was not fully involved in the 
Djibouti peace process. He added, however, that he had written to the new Special 
Representative of the Secretary&#8211;General for Somalia to welcome his appointment and was 
looking forward to meeting and working with him. He welcomed UNPOS decision to open 
permanent offices in Puntland. 
</p>
<p>49. In his meetings with United Nations agencies in Garowe, the independent expert was 
informed about measures undertaken by the United Nations to deal with the IDP and 
refugee situation in Puntland, in particular to lessen the tension between the latter and the 
local population and the Puntland administration. The independent expert was particularly 
impressed by the useful work being done by the United Nations Development Programme&#8217;s 
(UNDP) Rule of Law and Security Programme (ROLS) as well as the work of UNHCR to 
build upon existing UNDP interventions, which included support to local police 
administration in improving its capacity and infrastructure to deal with the situation on 
ground. The independent expert believed these measures were likely to promote a greater 
spirit of cooperation between the United Nations and Puntland authorities. He also believed 
that relations were likely to improve if some of the basic assistance needs of Puntland, 
which was genuinely faced with a serious security threat on its territory and did not have 
enough resources to deal with it, were properly met. He sincerely hoped that such 
cooperation would lead to the adoption and implementation of a national IDP policy which 
the Puntland Government was in the process of elaborating with support of the United 
Nations.  
</p>
<p>50. Following his meeting with the Government, the independent expert visited IDP 
settlements in Garowe and the new site where those IDPs would be relocated. He hoped 
that the new site would provide better amenities to the IDPs. The independent expert 
wished to underline that he was terribly pained to see the extremely poor living conditions 
of the IDPs at their present location in Garowe. He told the United Nations that while he 
could understand the quick airing of their concern about the deportation of IDPs referred to 
above, he could not appreciate their seeming lack of concern about the terrible living 
conditions of the IDPs. </p>


<p><b> V. Some reflections on recent developments 
</b></p>
<p>51. The human rights and humanitarian law violations in Somalia depict a grim picture 
indeed. The situation deteriorated further since the last report of the independent expert to 
the Human Rights Council. The fighting among the warring groups had intensified during 
the month of Ramadan, which led to a high number of casualties and massive displacement. 
Al&#8211;Shabaab and its allies had reportedly consolidated their stronghold on people under 
their control, imposing harsh laws and justice. Somalis continued to bleed and suffer 
terrible pain.  
</p>
<p>52. However, despite this grim reality, there appears to be a glimmer of hope. A faint 
light is slowly emerging at the end of the proverbial dark tunnel. TFG has survived despite 
serious onslaughts by the insurgents. Its Armed Forces, with the help of AMISOM troops, 
have managed to hold on to and defend areas of Mogadishu under TFG control. Thus the 
earlier fears that it might crumble under pressure did not materialize.  
</p>
<p>53. Since he was not able to visit areas under the control of the militants, the 
independent expert had no way of knowing how people there felt about them. However, he 
spoke to people who had recently fled such areas, including some Al&#8211;Shabaab fighters who 
had defected and sought refuge abroad, who all said that Al&#8211;Shabaab had little or no 
support from the general population and ruled through fear. Those who joined them were 
mostly forced or lured by money. The general population in fact strongly resented the harsh 
laws imposed upon them. They continued to hope against hope that, despite its 
shortcomings, TFG would eventually emerge as a viable Federal Government for Somalia. 
</p>
<p>54. If the above reading is correct, it should provide an added incentive for the United 
Nations and the international community to continue to back TFG and help it with greater 
vigour to grow into an effective Government which would not only be able to hold on to 
Mogadishu, albeit with the help of AMISOM, but also gradually extend its control through 
a combined military and political strategy.  
</p>
<p>55. Under such a strategy, TFG would gradually extend its present boundaries through 
recovering territories held by the insurgents, by political means and/or military, and 
establish its hold over them. The latter would be facilitated if TFG developed a positive 
image in the minds of the people by its hard work, dedication and honesty. Such an image 
would make it easier for them to be welcomed by the population of territories it recovered 
from the insurgents. However, to make it possible, it would need the support of the 
international community.  
</p>
<p>56. In March 2010, when the independent expert presented his report to the Council, he 
had not been so hopeful. But this time, for reasons mentioned below, he thought that the 
prospects for such an option had brightened. However, he feels that it would only work if 
the international community was ready to support the process both in the medium and the 
long term, keeping in mind that there could be no lasting short&#8211;term military solution for 
Somalia.  
</p>
<p>57. The medium to long&#8211;term perspective is based on the fact that almost twenty years 
of internecine warfare has caused so much of damage to Somalia &#8211; to its basic 
infrastructures, institutions, social structures, social values and norms and in the State itself 
&#8211; that it is not realistic to expect that they could be repaired in the short term. It would 
require a long process of steady rebuilding of the basic components of state&#8211;building, the 
foremost among which are trust and social cohesion, which have been key casualties of the 
conflict.   
</p>
<p>58. This optimism in the midst of continuing and intensified carnage can perhaps be 
justified on the following two grounds. First, Al&#8211;Shabaab&#8217;s efforts to win over more </p>


<p>territories and to drive TFG out of Mogadishu appear to have failed. It has made no 
significant territorial gains in the last six months &#8211; in some places it is even said to have 
been bogged down in fighting with other Islamists. That it has turned to repressing people 
under its control is perhaps indicative that it is not at ease with them. That Al&#8211;Shabaab 
could not find volunteers from among Somalis and had to hire Kenyan mercenaries to do 
the job in Kampala could be interpreted as showing their inability to win over enough local 
Somalis to join their mission. In fact, most of their suicide bombers appear to have been 
recruited from abroad.  
</p>
<p>59. Second, according to United Nations sources, important developments are taking 
place in Mogadishu which are likely to enhance the credentials of TFG and the confidence 
of people in it. The strength and efficiency of the Somali Security Forces (SSF) is being 
bolstered; firm commitments have been made to increase the number and capacity of 
AMISOM troops which would enhance their ability to protect the Government and 
infrastructures in Mogadishu; important measures are being put in place to augment the 
capacity of Somali civil servants, the police, members of the correctional services and the 
judiciary; arrangements are made to ensure payment of the salaries of public servants. 
Significant progress has been made in preparing a draft Federal Constitution for Somalia 
which would be vetted by the people soon. All these steps, if followed up carefully, are 
likely to generate public confidence in TFG.   
</p>
<p>60. The independent expert was briefed on the above developments by those directly 
involved with the processes. In regard to the security sector, the developments included the 
increase in the number of Somali Security Forces (SSF), which is likely to rise further once 
those presently under training were inducted into the army. The independent expert was 
assured through his visit to the EUTM headquarters in Kampala that the new recruits were 
receiving professional training from expert trainers, including on human rights and 
humanitarian law. He was particularly heartened to learn that arrangements were being 
made to develop a proper command structure of SSF; the soldiers, both old and new, would 
have proper housing and other amenities and would be assured a proper salary. This would 
make a difference from the past when the soldiers had no barracks to stay in and were not 
paid regularly, resulting in slack discipline, abuse of power and, in many cases, even 
defections. They were now likely to be more aware about their professional responsibilities 
and their duty to respect human rights and humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>61. The independent expert also learnt from the United Nations that important progress 
is being made to impart proper training to the police and to ensure their well&#8211;being through 
proper infrastructure&#8211;building and payment of salaries. Some of this had already been 
implemented. This would hopefully make the Somali Police Force effective, professional 
and accountable. If they are able to ensure the safety and protection of the lives and 
property of Somali citizens, the reputation of TFG would improve immensely. The 
projected 10,000&#8211;strong police force, trained to acceptable rule of law and human rights 
standards, would make a significant difference. The same is necessary for training of 
members of correctional services. Important progress had also been made in the judicial 
sector. Together, these measures are likely to yield positive results in terms of creating 
public confidence in the Government. 
</p>
<p>62. In regard to the drafting of the Federal Constitution, significant progress appears to 
have been made, as the Independent Federal Constitutional Commission, which was 
supported by UNDP, reportedly handed over the first draft to the TFG Minister for 
Constitutional Affairs in early August 2010. This could become an important milestone on 
the path to recovery if the draft is widely shared with the Somali people and their views are 
taken into account before a final version is put up for a referendum.  
</p>
<p>63. If only part of the optimism expressed above was true, it could be considered as 
significant progress. When one recalls that Somalia is not a high&#8211;profile operation and </p>


<p>international support thereto has at best been lukewarm, the achievements assume more 
significance. Added to that is the fact that Somalia remains one of the most dangerous 
places in the world in which to work. So the United Nations staff and those of many other 
international and local NGOs who have braved the difficult circumstances in Somalia to 
work there deserve to be especially commended.  
</p>
<p>64. As the independent expert has stated in his earlier reports, the resolution of the 
Somali conflict ultimately depends upon the meaningful participation of all Somali citizens 
in the process of reconciliation and nation&#8211;building. A way must be found which would 
facilitate such participation.  In this respect, the independent expert was pleased to see the 
efforts of NGOs like InterPeace aiming to involve the general Somali public in discussing 
issues that concern them and to seek their views through a process of participatory action 
research. It is hoped that more such efforts would be supported by the international 
community.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  For the parties to the conflict 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The parties to the Somali conflict must recognize that there can be no military 
solution to achieving their objectives. There may be occasional victories on the 
battlefields but these would not last without the support of the people. TFG, the 
insurgents, the warlords and everyone else concerned must negotiate a political 
settlement. The insurgents in particular must bear in mind that, contrary to their 
depiction of TFG, Somali citizens do not consider it to be the agent of the West or as 
infidels who must be ousted and replaced by an Islamic regime. The people know that 
not very long ago, members of the present TFG were themselves known as Islamic 
forces, fighting to oust the former TFG and its allies. Like them they too are 
supporting the use of sharia law as a foundation for the legislative framework in the 
country. Islam therefore cannot be a basis for solution of the Somali crisis.  
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> Protection of civilians should be a matter of constant focus for all the parties 
concerned, particularly TFG. Addressing impunity should remain a key human rights 
concern of the Government. It should cooperate with the United Nations to 
document/register all ongoing violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law. It should establish a strong accountability mechanism for the 
security forces. All the parties should also ensure that no recruitment and use of 
children in armed conflict takes place under any circumstances.  The independent 
expert welcomes the dialogue that has been initiated between TFG and the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in this regard.    
</b></p>
<p><b>  For TFG 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>TFG should bear in mind that it has been entrusted with the onerous 
responsibility of steering Somalia through the transition process as foreseen in the 
Transitional Federal Charter. It must demonstrate through its actions and utterances 
that it is able to lead the nation towards its declared goals. It should set out a clear 
vision and make it known to the people that it wishes to establish itself as the 
Government of the people and for the people and eventually to become a Government 
by the people.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>TFG must not use security concerns to explain its inaction in areas where 
action is feasible. People recognize the security constraints but they do not understand </b></p>


<p><b>why the Government cannot show that it is at least making an honest effort. People 
wish to see them doing their best to weed out corruption, to deliver basic social 
services, such as in education, health, law and order, to raise internal revenue, to 
move out of total dependence upon outside help as soon as possible, to develop a 
framework of professional government servants, etc. Most importantly the people 
wish to see that the Government is dedicated to establish the rule of law and good 
governance.   
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>While security must indeed remain a key preoccupation of TFG, winning the 
war against the insurgents will require that the Government wins the minds and 
hearts of the people first. In this regard, TFG will have to demonstrate that it not only 
cares for the people but has the political will to win the war by taking the people along 
with them, and that before, during and after the war, it is able to provide a 
Government that the people is able to consider to be their own. As stated at a recent 
gathering of Somali diaspora, &#8220;the Government should tend to defeat their opponents 
on the political front before they try to defeat them in the battle front. It should try to 
win the hearts and minds of the Somali people.&#8221;</b>6<b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>TFG must constantly look for ways and means to become a people&#8217;s 
Government and not that of particular interest groups or clans. The dos and don&#8217;ts in 
this regard, as identified by the Somali diaspora in a recent gathering, are: the 
Government must be a minimum and be effective; it must fight corruption, be 
transparent and accountable, display political will, avoid political patronage, help 
rebuild societal values and norms, get rid of weak or absent management system, 
procedure and practices, avoid misusing discretionary powers, must display 
professional integrity, shun tribalism, favouritism, nepotism and cronyism, avoid 
greed and establish the rule of law. This is a tall order but not impossible to achieve 
over a period of time. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>TFG should recognize that the high rate of unemployment among Somali youth 
leads many young men to turn to radical Somali groups for help and employment. Job 
creation for the youth should, therefore, be given high priority. Joining the Al&#8211;
Shabaab militias is currently the only and the most potential recruitment channel for 
the unemployed youth in the country.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>TFG should expand the political dialogue to include all the so&#8211;called &#8220;spoilers&#8221;. 
More particularly it should give greater attention to shoring up local and grassroots 
peacebuilding processes and organizations. Grassroots organizations should be given 
a platform in state&#8211;building in Somalia. They are the ones who are doing the ground 
work and have direct and daily contact with the community.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>TFG should give more attention to forge alliances with Somaliland and 
Puntland. They can not only play a significant role in bringing peace in the south&#8211;
central region but are very much willing to do so. The new President of Somaliland 
has promised full support to the peace process in Somalia and the President of 
Puntland has expressed his willingness to work together with TFG on basis of the 
agreement recently signed between him and the Prime Minister of TFG. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>With support from the international community, TFG should build capacity of 
the Ministry of Information so that it is able to keep the Somali people properly 
informed about matters of concern to them. In the war against insurgents people 
should be seen as allies.  
</b></p>
<p>  
 6  Information from the ninth Horn of Africa Conference: Focus on Somalia &#8211; The Role of Democratic 
</p>
<p>Governance vs. Sectarian Politics in Somalia, held in Lund, Sweden, on 4&#8211;6 June 2010. </p>


<p><b>  For the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Of all the anthropogenic humanitarian crises that United Nations is presently 
dealing with, the crisis in Somalia is perhaps the most challenging. It also offers 
perhaps the most creative opportunities. If Somalia is the most &#8220;failed&#8221; State in the 
world today, the United Nations has the unique opportunity to steer its revival. Such 
an opportunity does not exist for the United Nations in Afghanistan, Iraq or 
elsewhere, where there are other &#8220;big&#8221; players to lead. The United Nations has thus a 
special responsibility for Somalia.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The United Nations should take the lead in raising and holding the attention of 
the international community on the terrible plight of the Somali people until a 
satisfactory solution has been found. It should not be lost sight of simply because there 
is no big power interest in Somalia today. Through its efforts and activities, the United 
Nations should constantly highlight the dangers of the Somali conflict spilling over in 
the region. In doing so, it must also highlight the positive developments arising from 
the military/security/counter&#8211;terrorism/insurgency strategy that it is trying to put in 
place in Somalia. It must continue its efforts to ensure that adequate resources, 
including in the security and military sectors, are in place to create and sustain 
positive progress towards the end of the transitional process in August 2011 and 
beyond, till Somalia springs back from a failed State to a revived State. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The United Nations must ensure greater integration and coherence among all 
agencies working for Somalia and make sure that all its activities are specifically 
focused on protecting and promoting human rights and humanitarian law. In this 
regard, the Human Rights Unit attached to UNPOS should be strengthened and 
upgraded so that it can fulfil its role to act as focal point for all United Nations 
activities in this field. It has unfortunately not been able to play this role effectively so 
far apparently because of cumbersome recruitment processes of the United Nations, 
as a result of which during the course of the last two years it had to make do with 
stop&#8211;gap arrangements. This must change and a special dispensation should be 
considered for Somalia, if necessary. Together with security, human rights and 
respect for humanitarian law must receive the highest attention from the United 
Nations in Somalia. To give more visibility to human rights concerns, a robust 
reporting strategy on human rights issues should be established. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>OHCHR should offer help to TFG in developing its universal periodic review 
report which is due in 2011. While OHCHR has not been able to make much headway 
in building technical capacity of TFG in regard to human rights because of ground 
realities, the report could serve as a baseline to identify human rights needs of the 
Government. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>OHCHR&#8211;UNPOS should ensure systematic documentation of human rights 
and humanitarian law abuses currently taking place in Somalia with a view to 
identifying the perpetrators. For this purpose, staff from the agencies should 
undertake regular visits to IDP camps in Somalia and refugee camps in neighbouring 
countries. A mechanism should be found to systematically document human rights 
violations, to make recommendations to ensure accountability and to follow up on 
such recommendations. IDPs and newly arrived refugees in neighbouring countries 
are an important source of information about the current situation in Somalia. The 
establishment of such a mechanism would send a strong message to the perpetrators 
of human rights and humanitarian law violations in Somalia that they are being 
watched and will eventually be made to account for their crimes. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Secretary&#8211;General should consider the establishment of an Independent 
International Commission of Inquiry into human rights and humanitarian law </b></p>


<p><b>violations, or similar mechanism to investigate all abuses committed by all actors 
involved in the Somali conflict, including those committed in the past, and recommend 
ways forward for accountability. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The United Nations should take the lead to ensure technical support to increase 
AMISOM efforts to protect civilians, including proper equipment to the forces to 
minimize risks of civilian casualties. It is imperative for the success of its mission that 
AMISOM is seen by the local population as their friend, which unfortunately has not 
always been the case. In consultation with AMISOM, a strategy should be developed 
to address the allegations of indiscriminate and disproportionate response. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Innovative ways must be developed to ensure medical/health services for people 
in the war&#8211;affected areas. It is heartening to learn that the United Nations has 
managed to support hospitals to provide emergency services in seven regions of south&#8211;
central Somalia and that nearly 800 health&#8211;care workers have been trained in various 
fields. But these efforts are not enough. There should be special coordination between 
all United Nations agencies involved in this field, and with AMISOM, which extends 
its medical services to the population within its reach. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Similar coordination is also necessary in the field of education which has been 
most affected by the conflict over the last two decades. It is heartening to note from 
United Nations reports that since the beginning of the year, access to emergency 
education was increased through the construction of classrooms, rehabilitation of 
learning spaces and installation of school tents and training of school teachers. But 
these are mainly in areas within the reach of the international community. What 
about those which are within the control of the militants? There is a need for 
innovative ways to promote education in these areas through arrangements with the 
local authorities and population. In this regard, rapport with Somali CSOs/NGOs is 
essential.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The United Nations should explore all possibilities to develop/maintain dialogue 
with all parties on the ground in order to improve humanitarian access to vulnerable 
areas and people. Where the United Nations is unable to operate, local arrangements 
should be made. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Specific and systematic focus must be given on sustainable livelihoods. Special 
attention should be given on creating jobs for the youth, keeping in mind that one way 
of combating terrorism is to deny terrorist organizations recruits. The lack of 
livelihood and alternative sources of income drives many youths to join the insurgents. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>It is imperative that the United Nations offices for Somalia, presently based in 
Nairobi, are moved to safer places in Somalia itself as soon as possible. The United 
Nations and its personnel should be where the victims are. There are many relatively 
junior employees of the United Nations who have long been braving the situation in 
the field and doing a splendid job. There cannot be any reason why the senior officials 
could not also be there. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>It is heartening to note that the United Nations itself has now suggested that 
significant &#8220;light footprint&#8221; should be established in Mogadishu by the end of 2010. 
Such a presence would boost the various efforts of the United Nations and TFG 
referred to above. However, should the situation in Mogadishu continue to be 
precarious over a longer period of time, alternative arrangements to operate from 
elsewhere within Somalia should be considered.    
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The announcement by the new Special Representative of the Secretary&#8211;General 
for Somalia that he intends to move United Nations offices, presently based in Nairobi, 
to Puntland and Somaliland by October 2010 is most welcome. While it may not be </b></p>


<p><b>possible to meet the deadline fully, the process should be set in motion in all earnest. It 
will be a tremendous psychological booster for the beleaguered Somali population. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Following the recent suicide bombings in Kampala, the situation of Somali 
refugees in Uganda has become more precarious. UNHCR/Uganda must give special 
attention to the particularly difficult reality facing Somalis in Uganda today. UNHCR 
and OHCHR should consider developing a cooperative mechanism to deal with 
human rights problems of refugees and others in similar situation whether in Uganda 
or elsewhere. Particular attention in this regard must be given to the protection of 
human rights defenders who were forced to flee their country. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The United Nations must give special attention to involving the Presidents of 
Somaliland and Puntland in the Somalia peace process. The commitment made by the 
new Special Representative in this regard is most reassuring. Particular attention 
must also be given to the security concerns of these two states. Strong, stable and 
prosperous Somaliland and Puntland could serve as beacons of hope for the rest of 
Somalia. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  For AMISOM 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>While the expert recognizes that its troops have to serve under most difficult 
circumstances in Somalia, particularly when their opponents do not always respect 
the basic principles of humanitarian law, he emphasizes that AMISOM must 
nevertheless do everything possible to ensure that its troops respect those principles 
fully and take due care to avoid civilian casualties. In this respect, it should consider 
providing its troops with proper equipment that would help minimize the risk of 
civilian casualties.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The African Union and AMISOM should establish an investigation mechanism 
to conduct prompt, independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of 
violations of international humanitarian law by AMISOM personnel, including 
allegations of indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks, such as mortar firing or 
shelling in densely populated areas. Such a mechanism should ensure the 
confidentiality and the safety of potential complainants and witnesses, report its 
findings publicly and recommend disciplinary measures and the initiation of criminal 
proceedings against any personnel found to have been responsible for such violations.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The African Union and AMISOM should consider developing its military 
doctrine and concept of operations in situations like that of Mogadishu in consultation 
with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, UNPOS, OHCHR, ICRC, relevant 
NGOs and others as appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  For the international community 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The international community must commit to funding all relevant United 
Nations activities at this critical juncture of the implementation of an international 
strategy for Somalia. It is worrying that, as of end of June 2010, the 2010 consolidated 
appeal for all United Nations activities in Somalia had only received US$337 million, 
which is 57 per cent of the revised budget. The reduced funding has affected all non&#8211;
food programmes, including health, nutrition, water, sanitation, agriculture and 
livelihood. Lack of fund would badly impact United Nations efforts for peace and 
reconciliation in Somalia. </b></p>


<p>95. <b>The professionalism displayed by EUTM in ensuring training for all new 
Somali recruits, including in the field of human rights and humanitarian law, is most 
commendable. It is of utmost importance to ensure that, after the end of training and 
before deployment, the new soldiers are assured of a stipend for at least 12 months. It 
is important to remember that because of lack of proper remuneration, some 
members of SSF have in the past joined the ranks of the militants. A harmonized 
arrangement should be made to ensure that stipends/salaries are also guaranteed for 
all members of the police, correction services and the judiciary. It is unrealistic to 
expect public employees to serve without a salary, which appears to have long been 
the case in Somalia.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Somali human rights defenders work in most precarious security conditions. 
The international community should enhance its financial, logistical and political help 
them to enhance their security and protection and reinforce their capacity to carry out 
regular human rights monitoring and reporting. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>All States and intergovernmental organizations providing assistance to TFG 
should support measures to end impunity in Somalia, including the establishment of 
an independent and impartial commission of inquiry or similar mechanism, to 
investigate and map crimes under international law committed in the country 
throughout the many years of conflict and recommend measures to ensure 
accountability. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>To address its concerns about piracy in and around Somali waters, it is 
important for the international community to remember that piracy can only be 
effectively ended by setting up a functioning government in Somalia. The millions of 
dollars being spent on patrolling the waters around Somalia against piracy should be 
balanced by making funds available to build a viable Somali government. A 
multidimensional strategy that addresses the interlocking issues of piracy, illegal 
fishing and dumping of toxic waste in Somali waters should be considered. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The development of a team of capable civil servants in Somalia, who would be 
able to put public services back on their feet again, is of utmost importance. However, 
since education has been a main casualty of the long&#8211;running war, there would be a 
need for some quick fixes. For this, setting up residential schools/colleges in safer 
places in Somalia, such as in Puntland and Somaliland should be considered. Here, 
among others, students from the south&#8211;central region could be enrolled in significant 
numbers. Such an opportunity would provide an alternative to the youths to avoid 
joining the militants for survival. Another alternative would be to offer scholarships 
to Somali students/citizens for training abroad.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The international community should consider supporting projects aimed at 
bringing Somali professional groups, such as teachers and medical doctors, to 
Puntland and/or Somaliland for short&#8211;term refresher courses. The idea would be not 
only to enhance their capacity to deal with the type of emergency situations that they 
are faced with constantly, but equally importantly to give them an opportunity to 
relax and breathe freely, far&#8211;removed daily tensions. The Somali diaspora could be 
involved in these activities which would also help build people to people bridges in 
Somalia.       
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Governments hosting Somali refugees and asylum&#8211;seekers on their territories 
should not send back at least those among them who originate from south&#8211;central 
Somalia. In particular, Somali human rights defenders, journalists and other civil 
society actors are a category at particular risk. States should find creative ways to 
provide durable solutions for Somali civil society activists, including easily accessible 
asylum procedures, resettlement and funding to continue their work. </b></p>


<p>102. <b>The stand&#8211;alone interactive dialogue scheduled to take place at the fifteenth 
session of the Human Rights Council offers an important opportunity for the United 
Nations and the international community to have an in&#8211;depth discussion on the 
situation in Somalia and to identify additional measures to deal with the humanitarian 
crisis there. As argued in this report, despite the gruesome killings and relentless 
violence that continue to characterize the situation in Somalia today, important 
progress appears to have been made in a number of areas of which advantage must be 
taken and built upon. The desired results may not be obtained in the short term. A 
longer period will be required. Until that time, the international community must 
renew its commitment to the people of Somalia and redouble its efforts to bring their 
seemingly unending nightmare to an end sooner rather than later.
