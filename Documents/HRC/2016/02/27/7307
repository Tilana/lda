<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 15/21 and 24/5. It covers activities carried out between 1 March 2014 and 28 
</p>
<p>February 2015 and addresses legislation and practices in the context of natural resource 
</p>
<p>exploitation that violate the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. At 
</p>
<p>the end of the report, the Special Rapporteur addresses recommendations to various 
</p>
<p>stakeholders with a view to better promoting and protecting the rights under his mandate. 
</p>
<p>2. To prepare the present report, the Special Rapporteur convened an expert 
</p>
<p>consultation in Bangkok on 15 and 16 December 2014. He also benefited from the 
</p>
<p>responses of States and civil society entities to a questionnaire distributed on 17 December 
</p>
<p>2014. He regrets that he did not receive any responses from business entities. He is most 
</p>
<p>grateful to all who contributed to his report with responses. In accordance with Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 15/21, he took into account relevant elements of work available 
</p>
<p>within the Council and the United Nations system.1

<p><b> III. Rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association 
in the context of natural resource exploitation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>6. The global economy relies heavily on the availability and exploitation of natural 
</p>
<p>resources.3 With the industrialization of emerging economies and the ever-increasing needs 
</p>
<p>of older market-economy countries, the demand for natural resources has increased 
</p>
<p>dramatically. With that demand has come a plethora of concerns relating to the 
</p>
<p>sustainability of economic growth and its impact on the climate, the environment and, more 
</p>
<p>generally, on human rights.  
</p>
<p>7. Increased demand for resources has resulted in the opening up of more areas for 
</p>
<p>exploration and exploitation, especially in populated areas, leading to conflict between 
</p>
<p>competing interests. By some accounts, between 93 and 99 per cent of 73,000 mining, 
</p>
<p>logging, agriculture, oil and gas concessions in eight tropical forested countries were 
</p>
<p>inhabited.4 The same sources indicate that, for example, up to 40 per cent of the territory of 
</p>
<p>Peru has been handed over by the Government to private for-profit entities to exploit 
</p>
<p>natural resources and that in Liberia and in Indonesia 35 and 30 per cent, respectively, of 
</p>
<p>the land is in the hands of the private sector for exploitation operations. The existence of 
</p>
<p>widespread social conflict associated with natural resource exploitation is therefore not 
</p>
<p>surprising. For example, in Peru, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office documented 211 social conflicts 
</p>
<p>in the month of February 2015, 66 per cent of which were related to natural resource 
</p>
<p>exploitation.5 In Colombia, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office participated in 218 dialogues between 
</p>
<p>mining companies, protestors and the Government.6 
</p>
<p>8. Moreover, many resource-rich countries suffer from low levels of development, 
</p>
<p>particularly human development, endemic corruption and economic and political instability 
</p>
<p>&#8212; the &#8220;resource curse&#8221;. This, despite a widely shared understanding that natural resources 
</p>
<p>are managed by Governments on behalf of their citizens; an understanding which many 
</p>
<p>countries enshrine in law. The Constitution of Burkina Faso, for example, provides that 
</p>
<p>citizens may petition individually or collectively against acts that harm the environment or 
</p>
<p>the interests of communities.7 A large proportion of the world&#8217;s poor lives in resource-rich 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 For purposes of the present report, the Special Rapporteur takes a broad view of &#8220;natural resources&#8221;, 
taking the term to encompass a wide range of materials, including land, water, soil, air, coal, oil, gas, 
</p>
<p>other mineral and precious metal deposits, flora and fauna, forests and timber. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;exploitation&#8221; is understood to encompass a variety of activities, including extractive processes 
</p>
<p>(mining, fishing, logging, etc.) and construction of mega-projects (dams, nuclear plants, hydro-
</p>
<p>electric facilities, wind farms, land reclamation large-scale farming), that are intended to make use of 
</p>
<p>natural resources, particularly for large-scale commercial gain. The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>recognizes that conservation activities carried out with an accompanying commercial benefit, such as 
</p>
<p>game parks and reserves, forests preserved to offset carbon emissions and the like, often raise the 
</p>
<p>same concerns related to the exercise of peaceful assembly and association rights.

<p>countries but does not share in the benefits of those resources because of inadequate 
</p>
<p>governance. More than 80 per cent of the 58 resource-rich countries in the Resource 
</p>
<p>Governance Index fail to meet satisfactory governance standards. 
</p>
<p>9. Citizen engagement in the natural resources sector is notoriously difficult, with some 
</p>
<p>sectors, such as oil, gas and mining, presenting heightened risks of human rights abuses 
</p>
<p>because they are especially lucrative. The State plays a significant role in regulating access 
</p>
<p>to exploitation opportunities. Secrecy cloaks decision-making processes and outcomes; 
</p>
<p>there is a lack of mechanisms through which interested parties may express their concerns; 
</p>
<p>discussions are often highly technical; and, above all, the financial stakes are often massive. 
</p>
<p>This opaque and lucrative environment presents ideal conditions for corruption to thrive, a 
</p>
<p>challenge with which many resource-rich countries have to contend.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur believes that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>of association play a key role in opening up spaces and opportunities for genuine and 
</p>
<p>effective engagement by civil society in decision-making processes across the spectrum of 
</p>
<p>natural resource exploitation activities. These rights help foster increased transparency and 
</p>
<p>accountability in the exploitation of resources and are basic prerequisites for the ultimate 
</p>
<p>goal of securing substantive rights. Peaceful assembly and association rights can facilitate 
</p>
<p>constructive dialogue, which is necessary given the shared interests and sometimes 
</p>
<p>competing priorities that are intrinsic to exploiting natural resources.  
</p>
<p>11. When the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are restricted 
</p>
<p>contrary to international human rights law standards, questions automatically arise as to 
</p>
<p>how genuine consultation processes or decisions are and how valid is the expression of free, 
</p>
<p>prior and informed consent of affected parties. While restricting these rights in order to 
</p>
<p>streamline resource exploitation may seem tempting to States and corporations8 in the short 
</p>
<p>term, it can be costly in the long run and cause irrevocable damage. As the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has previously noted (see A/HRC/26/29, para. 26), the failure to provide any 
</p>
<p>outlet for excluded groups to air their grievances can be counterproductive and carry severe 
</p>
<p>consequences. He believes that social conflicts experienced in the context of natural 
</p>
<p>resource exploitation are a stark demonstration of the truth of this statement.  
</p>
<p>12. The overall political environment in a State can also have a profound impact on the 
</p>
<p>exercise of peaceful assembly and association rights. States that generally do not respect or 
</p>
<p>facilitate those rights are unlikely to be any more accommodating in the context of natural 
</p>
<p>resource exploitation. In fact, the Special Rapporteur believes that the space to exercise 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and association rights is often more limited in relation to natural 
</p>
<p>resource exploitation because of the significant impact this sector has on the economies of 
</p>
<p>resource-rich countries, the bottom lines of the enterprises involved and the potential for 
</p>
<p>corruption. Having citizen engagement is, therefore, imperative throughout the decision 
</p>
<p>chain right from the initial stages of the process when exploration potential is determined, 
</p>
<p>through to exploitation activities and investment of revenue.9 The rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and of association provide the necessary avenues for this engagement. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Key actors in the natural resource exploitation field 
</b></p>
<p>13. International human rights law places the primary obligation for the respect, 
</p>
<p>protection and fulfilment of rights on the State. In the context of natural resource 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 The terms &#8220;corporation&#8221;, &#8220;company&#8221;, &#8220;business enterprises&#8221; and &#8220;private sector&#8221; are used generically 
</p>
<p>to refer to for-profit enterprises involved in exploitation operations, even if they are State-owned, 
</p>
<p>unless otherwise indicated. 
</p>
<p> 9 See, e.g., the Natural Resource Charter. </p>


<p>exploitation, the obligations may appear to be somewhat distorted owing to the sometimes 
</p>
<p>complex relationships that exist between Governments and the private sector. Governments 
</p>
<p>may engage in for-profit ventures through State-owned or State-run companies, blurring 
</p>
<p>non-profit and for-profit interests and the role of the State in ensuring a level playing 
</p>
<p>ground for both sectors. Moreover, the close relationship that exists between Governments 
</p>
<p>and the private sector is one that the Special Rapporteur has highlighted previously as 
</p>
<p>creating, in some instances, undue advantages for business at the expense of other sectors 
</p>
<p>of society (see A/69/365, paras. 10&#8211;12).  
</p>
<p>14. States are obligated to protect and facilitate the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association in the context of natural resource exploitation, including by 
</p>
<p>ensuring that business interests do not violate these rights. To discharge their duties in that 
</p>
<p>respect, States should, among other things, enact robust national laws that stipulate the 
</p>
<p>rights and responsibilities of all, create independent and effective enforcement, oversight 
</p>
<p>and adjudicatory mechanisms, ensure effective remedies for violations of rights and 
</p>
<p>promote awareness of, and access to information about, relevant policies and practices 
</p>
<p>related to natural resource exploitation.  
</p>
<p>15. States also have an obligation to prevent conflict before it starts, including by 
</p>
<p>creating a legal environment that promotes transparency and fairness. The area of land 
</p>
<p>rights, for example, is often key. The absence of legal frameworks that clearly spell out 
</p>
<p>land rights creates opportunities for arbitrary expropriation or land grabbing, which in turn 
</p>
<p>can lead to conflict. Opaque procedures for granting exploitation licences and concessions 
</p>
<p>aggravate the situation and often fuel social protests.  
</p>
<p>16. States that host natural resource exploitation operations (&#8220;host States&#8221;) have to 
</p>
<p>contend not only with powerful corporations exerting their influence, but also with the so-
</p>
<p>called &#8220;States of origin&#8221;, whose economies stand to benefit from the taxes and other 
</p>
<p>remittances arising from corporations&#8217; profits. States of origin will therefore make 
</p>
<p>significant efforts to facilitate opportunities in foreign markets for companies domiciled in 
</p>
<p>their territory. An indication of this elevation of business interests in international relations 
</p>
<p>is that, in some countries, the trade and investment portfolios are being merged with the 
</p>
<p>foreign affairs and development agendas of Governments. In principle, States have a 
</p>
<p>legitimate interest in pursuing channels that open up business interests for their citizens. 
</p>
<p>But undue deference to business interests at the expense of other legitimate interests, such 
</p>
<p>as human rights, is a source of acute concern.  
</p>
<p>17. The central role of corporations in natural resource exploitation means that they can 
</p>
<p>potentially wield enormous power and influence over host States, rendering authorities 
</p>
<p>unwilling to intervene in their interests. Corporations gain access to the corridors of power 
</p>
<p>and often have the ear of key officials (sometimes through unethical means) and are 
</p>
<p>therefore in a position to influence decisions in their favour at the expense of opposing 
</p>
<p>views of other interested parties, including affected communities. The increasing 
</p>
<p>globalization of access to markets underscores the need to regulate the natural resource 
</p>
<p>exploitation sector at the international level to ensure the preservation of all rights, 
</p>
<p>including peaceful assembly and association rights. 
</p>
<p>18. The complexities of influence between the host State and States of origin is 
</p>
<p>replicated among corporations, where parent companies domiciled in one State may have 
</p>
<p>subsidiaries in other countries exercising various degrees of influence on the policies and 
</p>
<p>practices of the latter entities. Furthermore, international and national financial institutions 
</p>
<p>often have a significant stake in natural resource exploitation activities that they may be 
</p>
<p>supporting financially. Their actions or inaction, primarily through the leverage they have 
</p>
<p>as financiers, could have an impact on the human rights of affected communities, including 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and association rights. The Special Rapporteur subscribes to the premise 
</p>
<p>that international human rights law ascribes the primary duties to States, acting individually </p>


<p>or as members of multilateral institutions. These obligations apply within the territory of 
</p>
<p>the State and extraterritorially. Similarly, non-State actors have responsibilities in relation 
</p>
<p>to human rights, as will be discussed below.  
</p>
<p>19. In many cases, the most egregious violations of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association in the context of natural resource exploitation are committed 
</p>
<p>against groups and individuals inhabiting regions far from centres of power, who are often 
</p>
<p>at risk or already marginalized within society. They may lack access to information or the 
</p>
<p>means of effectively advocating for their concerns, or they may be confronted with 
</p>
<p>authorities are that are unable or unwilling to address their grievances. The ability to freely 
</p>
<p>associate and to peacefully assemble are indispensable in this regard. Some of the 
</p>
<p>categories of persons that require special attention in the context of the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and of association and of natural resource exploitation are women 
</p>
<p>(including women human rights defenders), Afro-descendants, indigenous peoples, peasant 
</p>
<p>farmers, fisher folk and forest dwellers.  
</p>
<p><b> C. International legal and regulatory framework 
</b></p>
<p>20. A complex web of binding international law and voluntary standards and principles 
</p>
<p>regulate and inform the human rights obligations of States and companies in the field of 
</p>
<p>natural resource exploitation. In general, States are bound by international human rights 
</p>
<p>law, while companies adhere on a voluntary basis to standards and principles drawn up by 
</p>
<p>Governments, multi-stakeholder platforms or business forums. Those laws and standards 
</p>
<p>cover a broad range of interests, many of which have implications for the rights to freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly and of association.  
</p>
<p>21. The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association find expression at the 
</p>
<p>global level in article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in articles 21 
</p>
<p>and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.10 The International 
</p>
<p>Labour Organization (ILO) Convention concerning Freedom of Association and Protection 
</p>
<p>of the Right to Organise, 1948 (No. 87), and the ILO Convention concerning the Right to </p>
<p>Organise and Collective Bargaining, 1949 (No. 98), protect the rights of workers to freely 
</p>
<p>establish, join and run organizations of their choosing without unjustifiable interference 
</p>
<p>from the State. Workers are also protected from anti-union discrimination and guaranteed 
</p>
<p>the right to collectively bargain.  
</p>
<p>22. Although States often refer to the permissible limitations embedded in the 
</p>
<p>provisions and instruments cited above, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association should be viewed as the rule and the 
</p>
<p>limitations as the exception (see A/HRC/20/27, para. 16). States may only limit the rights in 
</p>
<p>strictly defined circumstances necessitated by narrowly defined &#8220;legitimate reasons&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>Such restrictions must be prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the 
</p>
<p>interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 Common articles 1(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights guarantee the right of all peoples to freely dispose 
</p>
<p>of their natural wealth and resources. There are also national, regional and international laws and 
</p>
<p>standards relating to the rights of indigenous peoples, labour, the environment and natural resource 
</p>
<p>exploitation activities, such as mining, forestry and fishing, which may impact the exercise of the 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association to varying degrees. More broadly, trade and 
</p>
<p>investment agreements, commodity certification systems and the like may also present opportunities 
</p>
<p>to encourage or undermine civil society participation in the processes related to natural resource 
</p>
<p>exploitation. 
</p>
<p> 11 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, arts. 21 and 22 (2). </p>


<p>morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. They must also be 
</p>
<p>proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims.12 Thus, a blanket prohibition of protests 
</p>
<p>outside business premises or surrounding the operations of mining, resource and forestry 
</p>
<p>companies would be unjustifiable under the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights. Similarly, broad definitions of &#8220;vital installations&#8221; or &#8220;national interests&#8221; that 
</p>
<p>encompass business premises engaged in natural resource exploitation, with a view to 
</p>
<p>shielding them from peaceful assemblies, would not meet international human rights law 
</p>
<p>standards. 
</p>
<p>23. There are no international law instruments in which binding legal obligations for 
</p>
<p>corporations are provided for. However, it is understood that human rights, being universal, 
</p>
<p>indivisible and interdependent, are to be respected by all. The Special Rapporteur takes note 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights Council resolution 26/9 on the elaboration of an international legally 
</p>
<p>binding instrument on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect 
</p>
<p>to human rights, which stresses the primary responsibility of States to protect against 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses by third parties within their territories. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>considers that an instrument negotiated to create binding obligations for corporations is 
</p>
<p>desirable and should set forth norms for all business entities, national and transnational.  
</p>
<p>24. A notable shortcoming of the voluntary obligations for corporations is that they do 
</p>
<p>not go far enough in ensuring that both States and businesses are held accountable for any 
</p>
<p>failures to comply with them, nor do they encourage robust oversight by Governments of 
</p>
<p>actions by businesses that may violate human rights. Several documents set out voluntary 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations for companies in relation to human rights in general and the rights 
</p>
<p>to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in particular. These include: 
</p>
<p>(a) The United Nations Global Compact, a broad initiative on corporate 
</p>
<p>responsibility covering the areas of human rights, labour, environment and the prevention 
</p>
<p>of corruption. Two of the Compact&#8217;s 10 principles emphasize the role of business in 
</p>
<p>supporting and respecting the protection of internationally recognized human rights, and to 
</p>
<p>ensure they are not complicit in human rights abuses. A third principle requires businesses 
</p>
<p>to uphold the freedom of association and recognize the right to collective bargaining; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights<b>, </b>endorsed by the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council in 2011, which set out three pillars to the relationship between 
</p>
<p>business and human rights. Firstly, States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil 
</p>
<p>human rights and they should do this by taking measures that ensure businesses respect 
</p>
<p>human rights, including by promoting and enforcing enabling laws and policies. Secondly, 
</p>
<p>business enterprises have the obligation to respect internationally recognized human rights. 
</p>
<p>Thirdly, States are required to ensure that victims of human rights violations have access to 
</p>
<p>effective remedies including judicial and non-judicial remedies (Guiding Principles 25&#8211;28); 
</p>
<p>(c) The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, designed 
</p>
<p>specifically for the extractive industries sector, to help companies maintain the safety and 
</p>
<p>security of their operations while maintaining respect for human rights. The Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Principles acknowledge the primary role of Governments for maintaining law and order and 
</p>
<p>ensuring human rights. Furthermore, the Principles state that companies should use their 
</p>
<p>influence (i) to ensure that individuals implicated in human rights abuses do not provide 
</p>
<p>security services for companies; (ii) to limit the use of force to circumstances when it is 
</p>
<p>strictly necessary and to an extent proportional to the threat; and (iii) to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 31 (2004) on the nature of the general legal 
</p>
<p>obligation on States parties to the Covenant, para. 6. </p>


<p>human rights of individuals are not violated, including the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association; 
</p>
<p>(d) The International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers, a 
</p>
<p>multi-stakeholder initiative convened by the Government of Switzerland to set standards 
</p>
<p>and principles for the conduct of private security service providers based on international 
</p>
<p>human rights and humanitarian law.13 The initiative establishes an external independent 
</p>
<p>oversight mechanism to enhance accountability; 
</p>
<p>(e) The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines 
</p>
<p>for Multinational Companies, non-binding principles and standards recommended by 
</p>
<p>adhering States for responsible business conduct. The Guidelines are actively promoted by 
</p>
<p>Governments through national contact points, which also provide mediation and 
</p>
<p>conciliation platforms to resolve issues that may arise. Enterprises are encouraged to 
</p>
<p>respect internationally recognized human rights norms and support the promotion of respect 
</p>
<p>for the freedoms of expression, assembly and association online. The recommendations 
</p>
<p>largely mirror those contained in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>discussed above. 
</p>
<p>25. Many States consider that their obligations in relation to human rights apply only 
</p>
<p>within their borders. In recent years, efforts have been made to highlight States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial obligations, which are inherent in international human rights law. The 
</p>
<p>Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the area of Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights were compiled by international experts as a restatement of 
</p>
<p>international law clarifying States&#8217; extraterritorial obligations. Although conceived in 
</p>
<p>relation to economic, social and cultural rights, the principles are also applicable to civil 
</p>
<p>and political rights. Of interest to the Special Rapporteur is the obligation for States to 
</p>
<p>adopt and enforce measures to realize rights not only where the threat or harm occurs 
</p>
<p>within their territory, but also &#8220;where the corporation or its parent or controlling company, 
</p>
<p>has its center of activity, is registered or domiciled, or has its main place of business or 
</p>
<p>substantial business activities, in the State concerned&#8221; (principle 25 (c)). Broadening the 
</p>
<p>concept of responsibility to include more than one State not only strengthens underlying 
</p>
<p>rights, it also increases the chances of victims obtaining redress when violations occur.  
</p>
<p>26. Initiatives such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the Open 
</p>
<p>Government Partnership enshrine the role of citizens in policymaking processes, including 
</p>
<p>those related to natural resource governance.  
</p>
<p>27. The objective of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is to promote 
</p>
<p>openness and accountability in the management of natural resource exploitation through a 
</p>
<p>global standard.14 Implementation and monitoring of the standard is overseen by an 
</p>
<p>international board and national multi-stakeholder groups, consisting of representatives 
</p>
<p>from Governments, companies and civil society representatives. The underlying rationale is 
</p>
<p>that the management of natural resources in any country is a shared interest and can only be 
</p>
<p>effective when all stakeholders have access to relevant information and are able to act on 
</p>
<p>this information to promote sustainable economic and social development. To achieve the 
</p>
<p>objectives of the Initiative, implementing countries are required, among other things, to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 Also of interest is the Montreux Document on pertinent international legal obligations and good 
</p>
<p>practices for States related to operations of private military and security companies during armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, which resulted from an initiative by the Swiss Government and the International Committee 
</p>
<p>of the Red Cross to reiterate international humanitarian and human rights law principles that govern 
</p>
<p>the activities of private military and security companies in the context of armed conflict   (see 
</p>
<p>A/63/467&#8211;S/2008/636, annex). 
</p>

<p>ensure that an enabling environment exists for civil society to engage in the process and 
</p>
<p>express views related to natural resource governance, including in relation to laws, 
</p>
<p>regulations and administrative rules and practice. In its civil society protocol, the Initiative 
</p>
<p>outlines that the rights of civil society to expression, operation, association, engagement 
</p>
<p>and access to public decision-making in the implementing countries must be respected.  
</p>
<p>28. Similarly, the Open Government Partnership provides a platform for civil society to 
</p>
<p>engage in a lasting dialogue with Governments to ensure that the latter are more open, 
</p>
<p>accountable and responsive to their citizens. Participating States subscribe and commit to 
</p>
<p>the values and principles in the Open Government Declaration, including supporting civic 
</p>
<p>participation. These values include protecting the ability of not-for-profit and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations to operate in ways consistent with a commitment to freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p>association, and opinion. The policy document entitled &#8220;Policy upholding the values and 
</p>
<p>principles of the Open Government Partnership, as articulated in the Open Government 
</p>
<p>Declaration&#8221;, which was agreed upon by the Partnership&#8217;s Steering Committee on 25 
</p>
<p>September 2014, provides a means of reacting to developments in participating countries 
</p>
<p>that fall short of State commitments.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur considers the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
</p>
<p>and the Open Government Partnership important for enhancing the public&#8217;s access to 
</p>
<p>information and for reforming government policies that lead to exclusion, inequality and 
</p>
<p>the marginalization of those who should benefit from natural resource exploitation. These 
</p>
<p>initiatives can reinforce and open more space for civil society to engage with other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in decision-making on natural resource exploitation, but only if there is an 
</p>
<p>enabling environment for civil society as a whole. General restrictions on civil society 
</p>
<p>negatively affect their participation within these initiatives, and it is unacceptable to create 
</p>
<p>space only for civil society working on natural resource issues. Effective participation by 
</p>
<p>civil society in these initiatives and the ability of a broader portion of civil society to freely 
</p>
<p>associate and peacefully assemble are both necessary. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Challenges applicable to both the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association 
</b></p>
<p>30. Natural resources present something of a dilemma for even the most conscientious 
</p>
<p>of States. They are a source of economic wealth, yet this wealth also brings the potential for 
</p>
<p>conflict and fierce competition. If natural resources belong to the State itself, and the State 
</p>
<p>is composed of the people, how exactly should resources be shared? What if communities 
</p>
<p>living on the land to be exploited hold other values superior to the value of the economic 
</p>
<p>potential of their land? And who makes the final decision? Ensuring that all voices are 
</p>
<p>heard, including through the free exercise of peaceful assembly and association rights, 
</p>
<p>promotes equitable sharing of benefits.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur has found that States are typically eager to shape their legal 
</p>
<p>and practical environments in ways that encourage investors to exploit natural resources. 
</p>
<p>Global competition for investment is fierce, and businesses, by their nature, tend to favour 
</p>
<p>environments with less regulation so that they can maximize profits. There is thus 
</p>
<p>something of a &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; among States in terms of creating an enabling 
</p>
<p>environment for business. For example, the Environmental Law No. 30230 of Peru reduces 
</p>
<p>the ability of authorities to create natural reserves exempt from exploitation and reduces the 
</p>
<p>time within which environmental impact assessments should be produced.15  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 From the response to questionnaire. </p>


<p>32. This race to the bottom may benefit the business sector, but it is often to the 
</p>
<p>detriment of individuals and communities living on land slated for natural resource 
</p>
<p>exploitation. For businesses, time is money, and consultation with communities is rarely 
</p>
<p>seen as &#8220;efficient&#8221;. At best, States may discourage drawn-out consultation processes that 
</p>
<p>genuinely take into account the concerns of affected communities. At worst, States may 
</p>
<p>resort to harassment and persecution of members of these communities, as well as members 
</p>
<p>of associations investigating alleged violations or people having organized or participated 
</p>
<p>in protests, as noted by the Working Group on Business and Human Rights (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/32, para. 13).  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, of the numerous cases of violations of the 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association reported, comparatively few have 
</p>
<p>been fully investigated, with the perpetrators brought to account. By contrast, the number of 
</p>
<p>arrests and prosecutions for alleged offences committed in the course of the legitimate 
</p>
<p>exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association continues to rise.  
</p>
<p>34. Legal mechanisms, such as injunctions, civil damages and trespass and defamation 
</p>
<p>suits, are often used to curtail the work of civil society organizations and individuals 
</p>
<p>engaged in defending rights in the context of natural resource exploitation. The increasing 
</p>
<p>use of so-called &#8220;strategic litigation against public participation&#8221; suits is of concern because 
</p>
<p>of the chilling effect the proceedings may have on the legitimate expression of dissent or 
</p>
<p>opposition, including through peaceful protest. These suits may be brought by corporations 
</p>
<p>against individuals or associations that are critical of natural resource exploitation activities 
</p>
<p>in order to intimidate them or deter them from their work by burdening them with litigation 
</p>
<p>costs and damages they may be unable to pay. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that an 
</p>
<p>independent judiciary should play a positive role in recognizing and upholding international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards , especially in contexts where human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>communities are subjected to legal proceedings for exercising their rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and association.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur has in previous reports highlighted the significant role that 
</p>
<p>effective remedies play in promoting accountability for human rights violations, stating that 
</p>
<p>States have an obligation to establish accessible and effective complaints mechanisms that 
</p>
<p>are able to independently, promptly and thoroughly investigate allegations of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations or abuses in order to hold those responsible accountable (see A/HRC/20/27, 
</p>
<p>paras. 77&#8211;81). The lack of adequate compensation for violations related to natural resource 
</p>
<p>exploitation may contribute to increased social tensions, with communities feeling at a loss 
</p>
<p>for obtaining redress by alternative means. In the context of natural resource exploitation, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur believes that this obligation to provide remedies lies not only with 
</p>
<p>host States but also with States of origin. 
</p>
<p>36. The obligations of States to ensure the respect of human rights by corporations 
</p>
<p>engaged in natural resource exploitation in their own territory is clear. Less well-developed 
</p>
<p>and understood are the extraterritorial obligations of States arising from the international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards to which they have voluntarily acceded. At a minimum, States of 
</p>
<p>origin should ensure that victims of human rights violations have effective judicial 
</p>
<p>remedies. Doing so also entails a monitoring responsibility to ensure that companies 
</p>
<p>operating abroad adhere to international human rights standards. States from the global 
</p>
<p>North and Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa, where many of 
</p>
<p>the companies engaged in natural resource exploitation around the world are domiciled, 
</p>
<p>have an especially important role to play in this regard. For example, civil society groups in 
</p>
<p>Latin America have in public hearings at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>highlighted the significant role of Canadian companies in human rights violations in the 
</p>
<p>region, and the support provided by the Government of Canada, despite these allegations.  </p>


<p>37. The Special Rapporteur strongly urges all Governments to weigh carefully their 
</p>
<p>involvement in natural resource exploitation activities that have the potential to violate 
</p>
<p>human rights. Introspection is especially needed in view of the State practice of merging 
</p>
<p>foreign affairs, trade and international development portfolios and thus encouraging the 
</p>
<p>alignment of sometimes disparate objectives.  
</p>
<p>38. As a starting point, he commends the decisions of various State institutions, such as 
</p>
<p>the government pension funds of Norway and Sweden, to divest themselves of interests in 
</p>
<p>corporations deemed to engage in acts of environmental degradation or violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights and labour standards.16 Some States have enacted laws that prohibit and punish the 
</p>
<p>bribery of foreign public officials and sanction companies that do not prevent bribery.17 The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes that these laws are a step in the right direction but more still needs 
</p>
<p>to be done. He encourages similar initiatives in respect of violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>abroad.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Challenges to the right to freedom of peaceful assembly  
</b></p>
<p>39. International human rights law affirms the right of individuals to express their 
</p>
<p>opinions, even if these opinions are unpopular or in opposition to government views or 
</p>
<p>policies.18 The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is an essential vehicle for people to 
</p>
<p>express their opinions, and this right cannot be limited based solely upon an assembly&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>message or content. Despite this, the Special Rapporteur has found that content often plays 
</p>
<p>a decisive role in whether peaceful assemblies are facilitated or suppressed. Assemblies that 
</p>
<p>support the Government&#8217;s position are rarely, if ever, obstructed, while those that oppose 
</p>
<p>the Government&#8217;s position are at much greater risk for suppression. This is true generally, 
</p>
<p>but particularly in the context of natural resource exploitation.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur holds the view that as long as such an assembly is peaceful, 
</p>
<p>States have the obligation to facilitate the gathering whether or not authorities agree with 
</p>
<p>the content of the message. Any interference with such peaceful assemblies, including 
</p>
<p>dispersal, should meet the strict tests of necessity and proportionality stipulated in 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the guarantees provided by international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards relate only to assemblies that are peaceful (see A/HRC/20/27, 
</p>
<p>para. 25). When violent incidents occur within otherwise peaceful assemblies, authorities 
</p>
<p>have a duty to distinguish between peaceful and non-peaceful demonstrators, take measures 
</p>
<p>to de-escalate tensions and hold the violent individuals &#8212; not the organizers &#8212; to account 
</p>
<p>for their actions. The potential for violence is not an excuse to interfere with or disperse 
</p>
<p>otherwise peaceful assemblies. This principle is all the more important because violence in 
</p>
<p>the course of peaceful protests may be instigated to justify the dispersal of a protest.

<p>42. In countries experiencing social conflict over natural resource exploitation, 
</p>
<p>individuals who exercise their right to freedom of peaceful assembly are frequently framed 
</p>
<p>as &#8220;inciting&#8221; communities to resist and disrupt &#8220;development projects&#8221;. Peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and association rights are not seen as a legitimate vehicle to express concerns, but as 
</p>
<p>deliberate attempts to undermine the State&#8217;s efforts to promote economic growth and 
</p>
<p>development. Those who oppose natural resource exploitation activities are labelled as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;anti-development&#8221; or &#8220;enemies of the State&#8221;. Attacks are also used as an intimidation 
</p>
<p>tactic to force communities to accept exploitation projects. 
</p>
<p>43. It is particularly reprehensible when the vilification and stigmatization comes from 
</p>
<p>the highest government authorities, as this sends a clear message to other officials that it is 
</p>
<p>acceptable to perpetuate the intimidation and harassment of activists and defenders. 
</p>
<p>Negative images of activists and human rights defenders are exacerbated when the media 
</p>
<p>picks up on the portrayals and publishes them.  
</p>
<p>44. Negative perceptions of the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly are 
</p>
<p>also manifested through the increasing harassment, intimidation and criminalization of 
</p>
<p>activities by environmental, land rights and other activists and groups that advocate for the 
</p>
<p>effective consultation and participation of affected communities in decisions affecting 
</p>
<p>them. They are charged with crimes that often carry severe sentences, such as sabotage and 
</p>
<p>terrorism. In Chile, the Mapuche indigenous peoples, who have long protested over the loss 
</p>
<p>of their lands and territory, were charged (though eventually acquitted) under the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>anti-terrorism law; legitimate protest had thus been equated with criminal offences (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/21/47/Add.3, case CHL 1/2011, and A/HRC/19/44, case CHL 1/2011). In the 
</p>
<p>Philippines, penalties have been imposed under the Penal Code for &#8220;grave coercion&#8221;, an 
</p>
<p>offence defined as using violence to prevent another person from doing something that is 
</p>
<p>not unlawful or compelling the person to do something against their will.19 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed that peaceful protestors who obstruct mining company employees 
</p>
<p>and equipment are often charged with grave coercion. Civil society organizations in Canada 
</p>
<p>have expressed concern about the definition of &#8220;activities that undermine the security of 
</p>
<p>Canada&#8221; contained in the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act proposed in Bill C-
</p>
<p>51 (Anti-Terrorism Act) and the potential for the authorities to interfere with legitimate 
</p>
<p>peaceful protests that they define as &#8220;undermining&#8221; security.20 The Australian State of 
</p>
<p>Tasmania in November 2014 enacted the Workplaces (Protection from Protestors) Act 
</p>
<p>2014, which makes it a criminal offence to participate in a protest that may obstruct or 
</p>
<p>prevent a business activity or access to a business premises (see also A/HRC/28/85, case 
</p>
<p>AUS 3/2014).  
</p>
<p>45. Violations are perpetrated in many resource-rich countries where authorities and 
</p>
<p>others rely on criminalization to intimidate communities into giving up their land for 
</p>
<p>industry. In Brazil, confrontations between non-indigenous farmers and indigenous groups 
</p>
<p>have led to criminal prosecution of the latter for occupying lands as a form of protests (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.2, para. 49). The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>has reported that the Government of Argentina had responded to protests from indigenous 
</p>
<p>groups opposing evictions or other projects by prosecuting those involved (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/21/47/Add.2, paras. 51, 56 and 57). In Ecuador, the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights has expressed concern about the criminal investigations and 
</p>
<p>convictions of indigenous leaders protesting against legislative proposals concerning water 
</p>
<p>management and development projects (see E/C.12/ECU/CO/3, para. 10).

<p>46. Furthermore, perceived leaders of movements or protests are often subjected to 
</p>
<p>particularly egregious violations of their rights, such as disappearances and arbitrary 
</p>
<p>killings in an effort by States and corporations to intimidate and thus disrupt organized 
</p>
<p>efforts to resist exploitation activities. In Orissa, India, anti-mining campaigners have been 
</p>
<p>killed, and 42 women defenders at the forefront of demonstrations against dams were jailed 
</p>
<p>for protesting (see A/HRC/19/55/Add.1, para. 76). 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur has received numerous reports concerning violations of the 
</p>
<p>rights of human rights defenders, activists and community members who exercised their 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly in the context of natural resource exploitation. Civil 
</p>
<p>society activists in countries such as Colombia (A/HRC/28/85, case COL 7/2014), the 
</p>
<p>Philippines (A/HRC/27/72, case PHL 2/2014) and Thailand (A/HRC/24/21, case THA 
</p>
<p>3/2013), to name a few, have paid with their lives for leading advocacy campaigns against 
</p>
<p>natural resource exploitation operations. According to the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights defenders, human rights defenders working on extractive and the 
</p>
<p>construction and development projects in the Americas were the subject of most 
</p>
<p>communications to her and faced the highest risk of death as a result of their human rights 
</p>
<p>activities (see A/HRC/19/55, para. 71). In South Africa, over 30 miners at the Marikana 
</p>
<p>Mine were shot and killed by police during a strike, although the workers&#8217; action was not 
</p>
<p>entirely peaceful (see A/HRC/22/67 and Corrs.1 and 2, ZAF cases 3/2012). In Guatemala, 
</p>
<p>where agriculture provides the main livelihood for the majority of the population, 
</p>
<p>competition between landowners, farmers, indigenous communities and their associations 
</p>
<p>and large-scale commercial agricultural and mining projects has resulted in the 
</p>
<p>criminalization of social movements and their claims (see A/HRC/26/29/Add.1, paras. 193&#8211;
</p>
<p>199, and A/HRC/10/12, para. 34&#8211;35). 
</p>
<p>48. It is worth emphasizing that peaceful protests are typically a measure of last resort, 
</p>
<p>when scope for effective engagement with the authorities or businesses is otherwise limited. 
</p>
<p>In some cases, communities may have gone through consultation processes only to find 
</p>
<p>them, from their perspective, improperly conducted, compromised, corrupt or otherwise 
</p>
<p>unsatisfactory. In other cases, agreements reached between the parties may not be not 
</p>
<p>adhered to. For example in Myanmar, protests against the Monywa Copper Project were 
</p>
<p>allegedly sparked in 2012 when the corporation involved in the mining operations reneged 
</p>
<p>on an agreement with affected villagers to halt operations pending negotiations with them. 
</p>
<p>Police later moved in to disperse the peaceful protest camps using inordinate force (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/64, para. 28). A failure by a company to abide by a contract signed with the 
</p>
<p>owners of community territory in La Sierrita de Galeana in Mexico also resulted in a 
</p>
<p>peaceful protest that was violently dispersed, allegedly under the instructions of company 
</p>
<p>officials.21 
</p>
<p>49. Unfortunately, despite their potential for mitigating the underlying reasons for many 
</p>
<p>peaceful protests in the context of natural resource exploitation, consultation mechanisms 
</p>
<p>are often overlooked or employed inadequately. International human rights law and 
</p>
<p>standards mandate that free, prior and informed consent is a prerequisite for the exploitation 
</p>
<p>of natural resources in areas owned by indigenous peoples. As recommended in the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, due diligence, including conducted 
</p>
<p>through human rights impact assessments before the start of the project, is key for ensuring 
</p>
<p>that exploitation activities do not violate the rights of affected communities. 
</p>
<p>50. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the launch by Colombia of new 
</p>
<p>public policy guidelines on human rights and business in July 2014.22 The guidelines are

<p>being promoted as a way to guarantee that business operations are conducted in accordance 
</p>
<p>with human rights. He similarly welcomes information from the Government of Costa Rica 
</p>
<p>that indicates that the country&#8217;s overarching legal norms regulating commercial agreements 
</p>
<p>guarantee the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.23 Chile has recently 
</p>
<p>assembled an interministerial commission responsible for reviewing and aligning 
</p>
<p>regulations governing the General Consultation Process and the Environmental Impact 
</p>
<p>Evaluation System. This action was a direct consequence of criticism levelled at existing 
</p>
<p>indigenous participation mechanisms by the National Institute of Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Centre of Diego Portales University.24 
</p>
<p>51. The freedom to assemble peacefully is required in order for consultations among 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to be convened. The ability to peacefully assemble is impeded in environments 
</p>
<p>where insecurity and conflict prevails.. The neutrality of the consultations needs to be 
</p>
<p>maintained throughout the process. For consent to be free, prior and informed, consultations 
</p>
<p>should be conducted in an environment free of intimidation or fear, meaning that meetings 
</p>
<p>should be free from infiltration by security organs, surveillance and attendance by 
</p>
<p>uniformed or armed law enforcement agents. A level playing field should be ensured for all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to have free access to relevant information and assurances that their grievances 
</p>
<p>will be heard.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur notes that requirements to obtain prior authorization before 
</p>
<p>gatherings related to the exploitation of natural resources &#8212; such as information sessions, 
</p>
<p>consultations, public hearings and the like &#8212; not only infringe on the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly, they also impede the right of affected communities to access 
</p>
<p>information and participate in decision-making. In Uganda, non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations working on oil issues are reportedly required by authorities to seek 
</p>
<p>permission, in particular from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development before they 
</p>
<p>can meet with grassroots communities, although the authorities have made efforts to 
</p>
<p>remedy this situation.25  
</p>
<p>53. Peaceful assemblies whose focus is on natural resource exploitation may also attract 
</p>
<p>increased attention from law enforcement officers, with some groups alleging that they are 
</p>
<p>under greater scrutiny. In Canada, for example, civil society sources claim that First 
</p>
<p>Nations communities and environmental groups &#8220;have been under a special program of 
</p>
<p>government surveillance, and the information was shared among security agencies, 
</p>
<p>government departments and industry about groups that oppose resource development 
</p>
<p>projects&#8221;.26 
</p>
<p>54. An issue of significant concern to the Special Rapporteur is the use of private 
</p>
<p>military and security companies to protect the property and facilities of corporations 
</p>
<p>engaged in natural resource exploitation. These companies may be contracted by the 
</p>
<p>corporations or, as in the case of Equatorial Guinea, by the Government (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/18/32/Add.2, para. 46). Companies may also have contracts with Governments to 
</p>
<p>have members of the police force seconded to them, as in Somalia (Puntland) (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/24/45/Add.2, para. 24).  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed by the latitude afforded to corporations and 
</p>
<p>private military and security companies in relation to policing, and often suppressing, 
</p>
<p>peaceful protests. He echoes the grave concerns expressed by other special procedures

<p>mandate holders about these companies suppressing legitimate advocacy activity, 
</p>
<p>particularly social protest, and their attacks on human rights defenders (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.4, para. 71, and A/HRC/19/55, para. 63). In his view, the potential for 
</p>
<p>violations of rights, including to peaceful assembly and association rights, is particularly 
</p>
<p>high when law enforcement responsibilities are ceded to private actors, who are 
</p>
<p>accountable to their clients rather than to the public. Private security companies have also 
</p>
<p>been known to receive concessions to exploit natural resources in exchange for their 
</p>
<p>services, further blurring the interests and relationships between the actors (see A/61/341, 
</p>
<p>para. 74).  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the primary responsibility for ensuring public 
</p>
<p>security, law and order for the benefit of all within a State&#8217;s boundaries lies with the 
</p>
<p>Government of that State. The State should also regulate, control and monitor the activities 
</p>
<p>of private security firms, including those contracted in the natural resource exploitation 
</p>
<p>sector, and hold them accountable when they breach the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Challenges to the right to freedom of association  
</b></p>
<p>57. Associations involved in environmental protection, or community mobilization 
</p>
<p>against natural resource exploitation activities, or generally any activities that are perceived 
</p>
<p>as a threat to natural resource exploitation operations, face heightened risks of restrictions 
</p>
<p>of their rights. Associations are a vehicle for people to join their voices together on an issue 
</p>
<p>of common concern, thus amplifying their grievances. Associations also gather together or 
</p>
<p>facilitate access to resources, such as funding, skills, knowledge and solidarity. This 
</p>
<p>aggregation brings increased power and, when this power is deployed to oppose natural 
</p>
<p>resource exploitation activities, it can be threatening to those with financial stakes in the 
</p>
<p>projects. It is thus not surprising that States and corporations may use a variety of measures 
</p>
<p>to interfere with the right to freedom of association.  
</p>
<p>58. Restrictive laws, for example, are used to target organizations working on issues that 
</p>
<p>the authorities find sensitive. Emblematic of this approach is the use by Ecuador of 
</p>
<p>Executive Decree No. 16 to close the Pachamama Foundation, which had worked 
</p>
<p>peacefully and legitimately for 18 years to defend human rights, especially the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples in the Amazon (A/HRC/26/21 and ECU 4/2013). 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur has on many occasions emphasized that the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of association applies to informal associations and does not require that a group be 
</p>
<p>registered. If a registration regime is to be established, he favours a &#8220;notification&#8221; regime 
</p>
<p>for the establishment of associations rather than &#8220;authorization&#8221;. A notification system has 
</p>
<p>a particular resonance in the context of natural resource exploitation, where lobbying and 
</p>
<p>advocacy is often done through social movements that may not have a formal 
</p>
<p>organizational structure. Authorities and companies may be less inclined to engage with 
</p>
<p>these movements because of their informal nature and may in fact accuse them of being 
</p>
<p>illegal for being unregistered.  
</p>
<p>60. The ability of associations to participate in consultation procedures, such as 
</p>
<p>environmental and social impact assessments, should not be predicated on onerous 
</p>
<p>conditions, including registration requirements, membership or activities stipulated in their 
</p>
<p>charter or statutes. The Special Rapporteur notes efforts made by Austria and Romania to 
</p>
<p>ensure community engagement during impact assessment processes and Armenia to ensure </p>


<p>access to environmental information by the public.27 He emphasizes that concerned 
</p>
<p>community groups should not be subjected to unreasonable requirements, such as minimum 
</p>
<p>membership numbers, in order for their concerns to be heard and taken on board. A 
</p>
<p>reasonable demonstration of interest in the impact of the exploitation activities should be 
</p>
<p>sufficient for associations and groups to present their views in consultation procedures.  
</p>
<p>61. Similarly, a group&#8217;s formal registration or recognition by authorities should not be 
</p>
<p>required in order for associations to challenge decision-making processes related to 
</p>
<p>environmental issues or natural resource exploitation. Recognition should not confer 
</p>
<p>advantages that would not be available to unregistered or unrecognized groups. In 
</p>
<p>particular, recognition or non-recognition should not be used as a basis for authorizing or 
</p>
<p>restricting scrutiny by associations of the natural resource exploitation industry. 
</p>
<p>Associations should be free to engage in monitoring activities and to have access to 
</p>
<p>information without undue interference by authorities, and be empowered with the ability to 
</p>
<p>influence decision making processes. 
</p>
<p>62. Governments also place restrictions on access to foreign funding to curtail the 
</p>
<p>activities of associations engaged in environmental protection work, which often focuses on 
</p>
<p>natural resource exploitation activities. In India, for example, the Government in 2014 
</p>
<p>blocked funding from foreign sources to Greenpeace India, although the High Court 
</p>
<p>ultimately ordered the release of funds.28 In some States where the environment for 
</p>
<p>fundraising by civil society organizations is generally restrictive, there have been efforts to 
</p>
<p>limit restrictions on access to funding for groups working specifically on natural resource 
</p>
<p>exploitation. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative has called on the 
</p>
<p>Government of Azerbaijan, for example, to ensure that civil society representatives 
</p>
<p>involved in the Initiative are able to access their bank accounts and can register new 
</p>
<p>grants.29  
</p>
<p>63. Some States may also target members of civil society based on their foreign 
</p>
<p>citizenship. In 2015, the Government of Cambodia, for example, refused to renew the 
</p>
<p>residence permit of a Spanish environmental activist who was working with the local 
</p>
<p>organization Mother Nature to halt a controversial hydroelectric project in the Areng 
</p>
<p>valley.30 The activist was later deported. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that 
</p>
<p>nationality is not a proper basis for limiting the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>of association (see A/HRC/26/29, para. 25). 
</p>
<p>64. Individual human rights defenders and associations may also be subject to attacks, 
</p>
<p>stigmatization, intimidation, surveillance, travel bans, and risk the suspension of their 
</p>
<p>activities or even dissolution of the organization when they speak out against natural 
</p>
<p>resource exploitation. The organization Publish What You Pay Uganda reported, for 
</p>
<p>example, that they had had their equipment confiscated for nearly two months after trying 
</p>
<p>to screen a documentary on lessons that could be learned from other resource-rich 
</p>
<p>countries.31

<p>65. As previously mentioned, the &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; may result in weakened labour 
</p>
<p>standards, in violation of the right to freedom of association for workers in the natural 
</p>
<p>resource exploitation industry. In several countries, Governments have amended labour 
</p>
<p>laws, weakening labour standards and making it harder for workers to unionize, collectively 
</p>
<p>bargain and strike. In Kazakhstan, a recently enacted law on trade unions mandates 
</p>
<p>compulsory affiliation of all trade unions to a federative body, denying trade unions the 
</p>
<p>option to choose whether to be so affiliated or not (see A/HRC/29/25/Add.2).  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur agrees with ILO that it constitutes a violation of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association when authorities and employers actively interfere with the 
</p>
<p>operations of unions. Such interference includes refusing to recognize elected trade union 
</p>
<p>officials, tampering with elections, forming their own competing unions and denying union 
</p>
<p>members access to premises to conduct meetings. The ability of unions to hold meetings on 
</p>
<p>their premises without prior authorization or interference and to choose their own 
</p>
<p>representatives are essential elements of the right to freedom of association.32 Certain 
</p>
<p>employment practices are also a concern, particularly where they reduce workers&#8217; ability to 
</p>
<p>organize or collectively bargain. The use of short-term contracts and precarious terms of 
</p>
<p>employment for workers in extractive industries, for example, denies workers job security 
</p>
<p>and the confidence to advocate for unionization and other rights.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>An environment that allows for the robust exercise of the rights to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful assembly and of association is essential in ensuring that natural resource 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation is fair, transparent and accountable and benefits citizens. These rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage access to information, public participation and free, prior and informed 
</b></p>
<p><b>consent and also highlight the gaps in the enjoyment of other rights related to land 
</b></p>
<p><b>tenure, the environment and self-determination. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the more consultation on any particular exploitation issue, the better. He also wishes 
</b></p>
<p><b>to highlight that the benefits of such consultation </b>&#8212;<b> and the improved planning that 
</b></p>
<p><b>results from extensive consultation </b>&#8212;<b> can be immense for society at large. One 
</b></p>
<p><b>example is the Government Pension Fund Global of Norway, which was set up in 1990 
</b></p>
<p><b>to hold surplus wealth produced by Norwegian petroleum income.</b>33<b> It is now the 
</b></p>
<p><b>largest sovereign wealth fund in the world.</b>34<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>States bear the primary responsibility for promoting and protecting peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and association rights. They must implement and strengthen mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>that enable them discharge this duty. One major problem with </b>States&#8217; current<b> legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>frameworks, however, is a lack of proper enforcement mechanisms at both the 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic and international levels. Without such mechanisms, accountability will be, at 
</b></p>
<p><b>best, sporadic and irregular.

<p>69. <b>A significant gap in ensuring that assembly and association rights are 
</b></p>
<p><b>guaranteed in the context of natural resource extraction is created by the lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>binding norms for corporations, which are key actors in natural resource exploitation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A growing number of large businesses wield far more power, resources and influence 
</b></p>
<p><b>than many States. A shrinking number of corporations dominate vast sectors of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>global economy. Despite this, the primary responsibility for ensuring the exercise of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights remains with States. This situation must evolve to meet the reality of 
</b></p>
<p>today&#8217;s world. Domestic and inte<b>rnational law should impose binding obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>upon corporations to guarantee that their activities, including resource exploitation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>comply with internationally accepted human rights standards.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The significance of civil society as a stakeholder in the context of natural 
</b></p>
<p><b>resource exploitation is underestimated, misperceived and often denied by both States 
</b></p>
<p><b>and businesses. This is symptomatic of a growing disregard for a plurality of views, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly those which champion non-economic values over economic ones. Such 
</b></p>
<p><b>disregard is counterproductive and divisive, and is likely contributing to an erosion of 
</b></p>
<p>confidence in the world&#8217;s prevailing economic system. It is thus in the interest of both 
</p>
<p><b>States and corporations to recognize actions by civil society groups both in support of 
</b></p>
<p><b>and against the entire decision-making chain in natural resource governance, as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate exercise by these individuals and groups of their rights to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful assembly and of association.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In that regard, the Special Rapporteur reiterates recommendations made in 
</b></p>
<p><b>previous reports to the extent applicable in this context, and makes the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. States 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States: 
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>Ensure that they meet their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights in accordance with international human rights law, including by 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraging the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights; recognize the relevance of realizing the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and of association in the context of natural resource exploitation in their laws, policies

<p><b>and practice; strengthen the legal framework that guides these exploitation activities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by guaranteeing substantive rights to land tenure, labour and environment 
</b></p>
<p><b>with special attention to marginalized groups; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>Create an enabling environment in which civil society can access 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant information, participate in decision-making and express opinions freely, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through peaceful assemblies, without threats of prosecution or other harm 
</b></p>
<p><b>for legitimate opposition; ensure that cases of violations of human rights, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful assembly and association rights, are promptly and impartially investigated 
</b></p>
<p><b>and those responsible for the violations are held to account; 
</b></p>
<p>(c) <b>Take appropriate measures to meet extraterritorial obligations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly by providing access to remedy for victims of violations of the rights to

<p><b>penalties for conduct by corporations that violates human rights abroad; 
</b></p>
<p>(iii) <b>Ensuring that trade and other agreements on investment in natural

</b></p>
<p><b>for affected individuals and groups; 
</b></p>
<p>(iv)<b> Consider the elaboration of an international legally binding instrument 
</b></p>
<p><b>on human rights standards for businesses, as proposed by the Human Rights

<p><b>Council in its resolution 26/9, and ensure that these standards apply to 
</b></p>
<p><b>businesses working domestically as well as internationally; 
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> Develop, in consultation with the private sector and civil society, binding

<p><b>these initiatives; 
</b></p>
<p>(f)<b> Ensure the provision of adequate security and public order management

<p><b> B. Corporations 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that corporations:

</b></p>
<p><b>in their natural resource exploitation activities, including the rights to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful assembly and of association;

<p>(b) <b>Adhere to the principle to </b>&#8220;<b>do no harm</b>&#8221;<b>, by avoiding causing or 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributing to violations of peaceful assembly and association rights and preventing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and mitigating violations linked to business relationships; corporations should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>insist that States uphold peaceful assembly and association rights; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Implement the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by, 
</b></p>
<p><b>among other things, making policy commitments to respect peaceful assembly and

</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of existing multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as the Extractive

<p><b>participating corporations should strengthen their role in respecting the rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in the framework of these initiatives;

<p>(e) <b>Provide avenues for compensation and other redress in the event of 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>groups affected by natural resource exploitation activities. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that civil society: 
</b></p>
<p>(a)<b> Strengthen knowledge of local, national, regional and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislative framework regulating the protection of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>Strengthen research, monitoring and documentation capacity of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of peaceful assembly and association rights in the context of natural 
</b></p>
<p><b>resource exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Increase and enhance engagement and participation in multi-
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholder initiatives, through which civil society has the opportunity to engage in 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making on natural resource governance; 
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> Continue to advocate for binding norms to ensure compliance by 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporations to internationally agreed human rights standards.;

<p><b>origin to raise awareness of violations and coordinate advocacy for accountability. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Other actors 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that financial institutions (international 
</b></p>
<p><b>and national) ensure that their investment choices do not encourage or support the 
</b></p>
<p><b>violation of peaceful assembly and association rights. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>He recommends that national human rights institutions consider increased 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation, research, monitoring and documentation of violations of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and association rights and providing avenues for redress where feasible. </b></p>
<p>77. <b>He recommends that consumers and corporate shareholders consider the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights record of companies when purchasing products or company shares, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that those purchases do not encourage or support the violation of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and association rights. The Special Rapporteur also encourages 
</b></p>
<p><b>shareholders and consumers to join with others in publicizing the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>rationale behind their purchase and investment choices.
