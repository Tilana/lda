<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to its resolution 25/10, the Human Rights Council held a panel discussion, 
</p>
<p>on 23 September 2014, at its twenty-seventh session, on accelerating global efforts to end 
</p>
<p>violence against children, with a particular focus on how to better prevent violence and 
</p>
<p>protect children as a global priority and cross-cutting concern, and to share best practices 
</p>
<p>and lessons learned in that regard. In resolution 25/10, the Council also requested the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner to prepare a summary report on the discussions of the panel, and to submit it 
</p>
<p>to the Council before its twenty-eighth session. The present report was prepared pursuant to 
</p>
<p>that request. 
</p>
<p>2. The panel discussion was chaired by the President of the Human Rights Council and 
</p>
<p>moderated by the Associate Director of Child Protection, Programme Division, of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), Susan Bissell. It was opened by the Director of 
</p>
<p>the Research and Right to Development Division of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The panel comprised the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, Marta Santos Pais; 
</p>
<p>the Ombudsman on the Rights of the Child of the Russian Federation, Pavel Astakhov; the 
</p>
<p>Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and Chairperson of the 
</p>
<p>African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, Benyam Dawit 
</p>
<p>Mezmur; Fatiha Hadj Salah, medical doctor; Jorge Freyre, of the Latin American and 
</p>
<p>Caribbean Movement for Children; and the Director of Children Protection, Save the 
</p>
<p>Children &#8211; Liberia, Laila Khondkar. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening statement by the Director of the Research and Right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to Development Division 
</b></p>
<p>3. In her opening statement, the Director of the Research and Right to Development 
</p>
<p>Division of OHCHR, Jane Connors, stated that violence against children could take many 
</p>
<p>forms: physical brutality; sexual abuse, including rape; torture; inhuman and degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment such as acid attacks; forced and child marriage; killings in the name of family 
</p>
<p>&#8220;honour&#8221;; trafficking; forced begging; bonded labour; emotional violence; and neglect. 
</p>
<p>Very often, the forms of violence overlapped, although the most common form of violence 
</p>
<p>that children endured was corporal punishment. Far too often, these phenomena were 
</p>
<p>invisible. Violence against children tended to be accepted as inevitable, treated with 
</p>
<p>indifference or condoned. Although there were insufficient data on the subject, it was 
</p>
<p>estimated that, annually, between 500 million and 1.5 billion children experience violence.  
</p>
<p>4. Violence against children was never justifiable and was entirely preventable. 
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it occurred in every country in the world, and crossed the boundaries of race, 
</p>
<p>class, religion and culture. In violation of human rights norms, particularly the Convention 
</p>
<p>of the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto, children were victims of 
</p>
<p>violence in multiple settings, including their homes, schools and care and justice 
</p>
<p>institutions. They were also at risk of being subjected to violence in their communities, in 
</p>
<p>places where they worked or in cyberspace. 
</p>
<p>5. Since the release of the report of the independent expert for the United Nations study 
</p>
<p>on violence against children on the rights of the child in 2006,1 the need to prioritize the 
</p>
<p>protection of children from violence had been increasingly recognized at the international, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/61/299. </p>


<p>regional and national levels. There was a better understanding of how and why children 
</p>
<p>were exposed to violence, and programmes had been developed in many countries to ensure 
</p>
<p>the protection of children. Despite these advances, however, progress had been slow. There 
</p>
<p>had been insufficient investment, in particular in relation to prevention and family support, 
</p>
<p>as well as in research and data collection. Many laws were not effectively enforced, and 
</p>
<p>national strategies were often underresourced and lacked coordination. 
</p>
<p>6. Ms. Connors stressed that violence against children was a complex, 
</p>
<p>multidimensional phenomenon, and combating it required the sustained cooperation of 
</p>
<p>many different actors. Public health, criminal justice, social services, education, human 
</p>
<p>rights organizations, media and businesses &#8211; all had to work together with decision-makers 
</p>
<p>at every level of society. A multifaceted response also comprised the acknowledgement of 
</p>
<p>the primary role of the family in the upbringing and development of the child, and the 
</p>
<p>obligation of the State to support parents and caregivers in that role. States had to prioritize 
</p>
<p>prevention, including by raising awareness of the need to change attitudes that condone or 
</p>
<p>normalize violence against children. 
</p>
<p>7. Ms. Connors emphasized that action was also required at the international level to 
</p>
<p>combat violence against children &#8211; a major threat to global development, and a substantive 
</p>
<p>barrier to the realization of the Millennium Development Goals. While the primary victims 
</p>
<p>of violence against children are the children themselves, it also had negative consequences 
</p>
<p>for the wider community and the national economy. It was an obstacle to the achievement 
</p>
<p>of gender equality, and was closely interconnected with deprivation, poor health and poor 
</p>
<p>school performance. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Contributions of the panel 
</b></p>
<p>8. In her introductory remarks as panel moderator, the Associate Director of Child 
</p>
<p>Protection, of the Programme Division of UNICEF, Susan Bissell, stated that violence 
</p>
<p>against children was not only a matter of global importance but also an issue relevant to 
</p>
<p>each and every State. She shared statistics released in the 2014 UNICEF report &#8220;Hidden in 
</p>
<p>Plain Sight&#8221;: in 2012 alone, 95,000 children and adolescents under the age of 20 were killed 
</p>
<p>&#8211; almost one in five of all homicide victims that year; almost one quarter of girls aged 15 to 
</p>
<p>19 worldwide (almost 70 million) had reported being victims of some form of physical 
</p>
<p>violence since age 15; and around 120 million girls under the age of 20 (about one in 10) 
</p>
<p>had been subjected to forced sexual intercourse or other forced sexual acts at some point in 
</p>
<p>their lives.  
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Bissell stated that, although the figures might seem discouraging, violence 
</p>
<p>against children was not inevitable and it was possible to end it. Political commitment to 
</p>
<p>address violence against children had never been greater, including as the international 
</p>
<p>community embarked on discussions on the post-2015 development agenda. Research had 
</p>
<p>also brought a better understanding of effective strategies to prevent and respond to the 
</p>
<p>different forms of violence that children faced.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, 
</p>
<p>Marta Santos Pais, stated that, while the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child was being commemorated and its achievements duly celebrated, work 
</p>
<p>still needed to be done. Violence against children was a challenge that continued to 
</p>
<p>compromise the rights of children around the world, and had to be addressed urgently. She 
</p>
<p>also stressed, however, that there was currently a crucial opportunity to make a change for 
</p>
<p>the better, in particular in the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Representative&#8217;s global survey on violence against children, entitled 
</p>
<p><i>Toward a World Free from Violence</i>, had been informed by reports from more than 100 </p>


<p>countries in all regions, showed that strategic changes had been made in law, policy and 
</p>
<p>practice, but had also shed light on gaps and areas of concern. It showed that the human 
</p>
<p>rights foundation of the violence prevention agenda has been widened, and that efforts at 
</p>
<p>the regional level had been consolidated. The Special Representative emphasized that 
</p>
<p>violence against children had been prioritized in the political agenda of regional 
</p>
<p>organizations and institutions around the world, and important commitments and 
</p>
<p>declarations had been adopted by Governments in all regions. While noting the importance 
</p>
<p>of these commitments, however, she stressed that they were only meaningful when 
</p>
<p>effectively implemented. The survey had also showed that changes had been made at the 
</p>
<p>national level: almost 90 countries had indeed elaborated time-bound and comprehensive 
</p>
<p>agendas to prevent and eliminate violence against children. Despite these advances, 
</p>
<p>however, only 8 per cent of the world&#8217;s children had legal protection from violence. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Representative pointed out that many challenges remained, and that the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 global development agenda represented a unique opportunity in this context, 
</p>
<p>given that it was likely that violence against children would be included as a core target and 
</p>
<p>as a cross-cutting concern in the different goals. This was important, because violence 
</p>
<p>against children generated costs of trillions of dollars every year. She stressed the 
</p>
<p>importance of preserving the eradication of violence against children as a distinct target and 
</p>
<p>as a cross-cutting concern, noting that children had indicated that they considered this a key 
</p>
<p>issue during the global consultations held in preparation for the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>agenda. It was fundamental that children were engaged in both: the development of the 
</p>
<p>agenda, and the way future progress was evaluated. 
</p>
<p>13. The Ombudsman for the Rights of the Child of the Russian Federation, Pavel 
</p>
<p>Astakhov, described the national programme of the Russian Federation on preventing 
</p>
<p>violence against children and rehabilitating victims, and how it aimed at incorporating new 
</p>
<p>technology as part of its strategy. Regional programmes on preventing and detecting cases 
</p>
<p>of violence at an early stage had been set up, and the Ministry of Education had developed 
</p>
<p>methodological recommendations on violence prevention for relevant regional authorities, 
</p>
<p>containing guidance on the registration and investigation of complaints made by children to 
</p>
<p>guarantee that the victims had access to consultation and could be reintegrated. The federal 
</p>
<p>law on education provided for free medical or social assistance for underage victims, 
</p>
<p>including psychological counselling for children and their parents, and assistance for 
</p>
<p>witnesses. Mediation services had also been developed to address family disputes, in 
</p>
<p>particular in the case of underprivileged families and their children. 
</p>
<p>14. According to the legislation of the Russian Federation, violence against children 
</p>
<p>could lead to life imprisonment, and children were presumed to be &#8220;helpless&#8221; until the age 
</p>
<p>of 12 years. Sanctions for criminal liability for using children in pornography had become 
</p>
<p>tougher. The Ombudsman expressed concern about Russian children being subjected to 
</p>
<p>violence when adopted abroad; a monitoring group had been set up to investigate this 
</p>
<p>phenomenon. Concern was also expressed regarding violence against children in armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, and the lack of assistance available to children and families attempting to leave 
</p>
<p>dangerous situations. In such situations, children might not be provided with the necessary 
</p>
<p>educational and medical services, and facilities with children present could be attacked. The 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman called upon the international community to protect children in such situations 
</p>
<p>in accordance with international law. 
</p>
<p>15. The Vice-chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and Chairperson 
</p>
<p>of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, Benyam 
</p>
<p>Dawit Mezmur, stated that, although Africa was a diverse continent, the response to 
</p>
<p>violence against children faced similar challenges in many African countries. No country 
</p>
<p>could claim to have implemented fully the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the 
</p>
<p>African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. The Committee on the Rights of </p>


<p>the Child devoted much time to discussing violence against children in its dialogue with 
</p>
<p>States parties. Prevention should be prioritized; the aim should be to move away from 
</p>
<p>reporting what happens to reporting before it happens. Mr. Mezmur stressed that human 
</p>
<p>rights education was central for effective prevention &#8211; when children were aware of their 
</p>
<p>rights, they were empowered. Violence should be banned in all settings, using a child 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach that protected both girls and boys, and should include not only 
</p>
<p>physical violence, but psychological and social violence as well. The role of birth 
</p>
<p>registration in protecting children could not be over-emphasized, and any registration 
</p>
<p>system should reflect the reality on the ground, taking into account local geographical, 
</p>
<p>cultural and political factors. Although civil society had an important role to play in 
</p>
<p>preventing violence against children, States had the primary responsibility in this area.  
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Mezmur highlighted the connection between children&#8217;s rights and the business 
</p>
<p>sector. Even though Africa was booming, economic development should not come at the 
</p>
<p>expense of violence against children. Political will was the key to moving forward. States 
</p>
<p>should take important steps, such as ratifying international instruments and making 
</p>
<p>commitments to end conflict, but also smaller steps, such as cooperating with United 
</p>
<p>Nations human rights treaty bodies and providing information when requested. 
</p>
<p>17. Fatiha Hadj Salah, a medical doctor from Algeria, stated that the decision to convene 
</p>
<p>the panel discussion reflected the need to ensure that prevention and protection were 
</p>
<p>priorities &#8211; children had an absolute right to freedom from violence, and if the right was not 
</p>
<p>upheld, the consequences for the child&#8217;s health could be disastrous. Despite the progress 
</p>
<p>made by those involved in protecting children in the United Nations system, detecting, 
</p>
<p>assessing and caring for children who experience violence remained difficult. Nonetheless, 
</p>
<p>the direct effects of ill-treatment could be detected by those in contact with children, 
</p>
<p>including those working in health care, and social workers, teachers and police officers. 
</p>
<p>They had privileged access to children and their families, and had a vital role to play in 
</p>
<p>detecting, supporting and taking steps early on. Inter-sectoral cooperation was essential in 
</p>
<p>order to identify risk factors, and multidisciplinary teams were needed to address violence 
</p>
<p>against children fully. All persons working with children should be trained to detect ill-
</p>
<p>treatment. Children with disabilities deserved special attention, given that they were 
</p>
<p>particularly vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>18. Dr. Hadj Salah stated that health-care workers were often faced with situations 
</p>
<p>where, while there was no certainty of ill-treatment, evidence was visible in what children 
</p>
<p>said: children must be heeded. Risk factors should be identified within families, such as 
</p>
<p>prior ill-treatment and emotional or psychological factors. More research in this area was 
</p>
<p>however needed, and partnerships should be developed with national and international 
</p>
<p>teams and with expert networks to conduct further investigation in to the causes of ill-
</p>
<p>treatment. Awareness-raising was also crucial: children, families and the wider public 
</p>
<p>should be aware that violence can be prevented. 
</p>
<p>19. Jorge Freyre, of the Latin American and Caribbean Movement for Children, stated 
</p>
<p>that Latin America was the most violent region in the world, with children and adolescents 
</p>
<p>suffering as a result. Members of the Movement for Children worked with States, civil 
</p>
<p>society and groups of children, as well as with regional human rights bodies, to combat 
</p>
<p>violence against children. Subregional mappings of the current legislative framework, 
</p>
<p>policies, monitoring systems and practices at the national level had been undertaken, and 
</p>
<p>best practices and successful cases have been highlighted. The events organized in each 
</p>
<p>subregion had led to a declaration of commitments by States and a subregional roadmap 
</p>
<p>and national roadmaps.   
</p>
<p>20. The Director of Children Protection, Save the Children &#8211; Liberia, Laila Khondkar, 
</p>
<p>spoke about the lessons learned from the participation of children in the prevention of 
</p>
<p>violence. The Convention on the Rights of the Child placed an obligation on States to </p>


<p>respect the right of children to express their views, as individuals and as a group, in all 
</p>
<p>matters of concern to them, and to take their views seriously. In many regions of the world, 
</p>
<p>however, children had traditionally not been deemed to have the experience, knowledge or 
</p>
<p>understanding necessary to be directly involved in contributing to major decisions affecting 
</p>
<p>their lives. Since the Convention was adopted 25 years earlier, thousands of initiatives in all 
</p>
<p>regions of the world had created space for children and young people to begin to influence 
</p>
<p>the laws, policies, services and decisions that affected their lives. They demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>they had their own unique perspectives and expertise regarding the challenges they faced 
</p>
<p>and the best strategies for resolving them, and that when provided with the opportunity, 
</p>
<p>information and support, could and did make a significant contribution to decisions 
</p>
<p>affecting their lives. The participation of children could therefore enhance the quality of 
</p>
<p>decision-making and have positive outcomes for the realization of their rights. Although 
</p>
<p>adults commonly underestimated children&#8217;s capacities, children wanted greater control over 
</p>
<p>the issues that affect them. Reports suggested that participation improved children&#8217;s skills, 
</p>
<p>confidence and self-esteem. 
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Khondkar emphasized that participation led to better protection. Passive 
</p>
<p>children could be abused by adults with impunity more easily. Providing children with 
</p>
<p>information, encouraging them to articulate their concerns and introducing safe and 
</p>
<p>accessible mechanisms for challenging violence and abuse were key strategies for 
</p>
<p>providing effective protection. Participation continued, however, to be impeded by long-
</p>
<p>standing practices and attitudes, as well as by political and economic barriers. In addition, 
</p>
<p>while many children found it difficult to make their voices heard, some groups of children, 
</p>
<p>including younger children, girls, children with disabilities, working children or those out 
</p>
<p>of school, children from indigenous or minority communities, and poorer children, faced 
</p>
<p>additional hurdles. States had enact legislation that recognized, promoted and respected the 
</p>
<p>right of girls and boys to express themselves freely and to ensure that their views were 
</p>
<p>given due weight, in accordance with their age and maturity. They had to establish and 
</p>
<p>resource permanent structures at the national and local levels to consult with children when 
</p>
<p>developing, implementing and monitoring laws, policies and programmes that affected 
</p>
<p>them. States should ensure that professionals, parents and teachers know how to involve 
</p>
<p>children meaningfully, and that this was done within a permanent structure, not on an ad 
</p>
<p>hoc basis. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p>22. During the plenary discussion, delegations from Algeria, Austria, Burkina Faso, 
</p>
<p>Costa Rica (on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States), Croatia, 
</p>
<p>Ethiopia (on behalf of the African Group), the European Union, India, the Islamic Republic 
</p>
<p>of Iran, Lithuania, Mexico, Montenegro, Paraguay, the Philippines (on behalf of the 
</p>
<p>Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Spain, Sweden (on behalf of the Nordic States), 
</p>
<p>the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Timor-Leste (on behalf of Portuguese-speaking 
</p>
<p>countries), Togo, Tunisia, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates (on behalf of the Arab 
</p>
<p>Group), the National Human Rights Institution of Ukraine, Save the Children International 
</p>
<p>(in a joint statement), the British Humanist Association, the World Organisation against 
</p>
<p>Torture (in a joint statement with Defence for Children International) and the International 
</p>
<p>Institute for Non-Aligned Studies took the floor.  
</p>
<p><b> A. General remarks on violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>23. Several delegations stressed the fact that violence was both a cause and consequence 
</p>
<p>of social exclusion and discrimination: it marked children&#8217;s inequality and powerlessness. It </p>


<p>stemmed from social and economic inequalities and educational systems. Poverty, lack of 
</p>
<p>livelihood opportunities and illiteracy remained root causes that compounded the 
</p>
<p>vulnerability of families and children to violence. Delegations pointed to the importance of 
</p>
<p>providing employment opportunities and addressing widespread poverty and 
</p>
<p>underdevelopment. 
</p>
<p>24. Reference was made to a growing body of scientific evidence demonstrating that 
</p>
<p>exposure to violence and stress, especially at a very young age, provoked irreversible brain 
</p>
<p>damage in children. Delegations referred to the huge costs of violence against children. 
</p>
<p>However, the shortage of reliable data remained a major obstacle to capturing fully the 
</p>
<p>extent of violence against children. 
</p>
<p>25. Delegations emphasized that strong political commitment was needed, and pointed 
</p>
<p>out the importance of sharing good practices with a view to inspiring actions that strengthen 
</p>
<p>and complement mechanisms set up at the national level. Investing time and resources into 
</p>
<p>eradicating violence against children in all settings was considered essential to create a 
</p>
<p>foundation for a society that protects the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prevention of violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>26. Many delegations highlighted the importance of prevention, pointing out that 
</p>
<p>violence could be prevented. To do so, strategies should concentrate on causes rather than 
</p>
<p>consequences, and invest in all contexts in which children live, play and learn. In 
</p>
<p>conjunction with appropriate budgeting, staff should be trained, particularly in education, 
</p>
<p>health and justice. A multisectoral approach was advocated, including exchange of 
</p>
<p>information between those involved in children&#8217;s lives, and protocols and guidelines for 
</p>
<p>professionals working with children. Cross-border cooperation was also mentioned as an 
</p>
<p>important tool, particularly in cases concerning issues of transnational child protection. 
</p>
<p>27. It was noted that effective protection from violence was only possible by taking an 
</p>
<p>integrated approach. In doing so, States should raise awareness, break the silence regarding 
</p>
<p>violence against children and challenge the social norms that justify it. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation of family, society and the State 
</b></p>
<p>28. Several delegations focused on the role of the family, society and the State in 
</p>
<p>protecting children from violence. They pointed out that a legal ban on violence against 
</p>
<p>children was needed, and that to be able to achieve real implementation, must involve broad 
</p>
<p>segments of society and engage all relevant actors in seeking sustainable change. Changing 
</p>
<p>attitudes of lawmakers, parents, teachers and other adults dealing with children was a key 
</p>
<p>issue. 
</p>
<p>29. Delegations noted the primary role of the family in the upbringing and development 
</p>
<p>of the child, recalling that the well-being of the child was closely tied to that of the family. 
</p>
<p>The State should, as a matter of priority, provide information and support to families and 
</p>
<p>caregivers in their role of bringing up children. The role of the education system and its 
</p>
<p>ability to shape the minds of young people to their benefit or detriment was also 
</p>
<p>highlighted. Children should not be taught to accept violence as a means of imposing their 
</p>
<p>values and judgements on others. Bullying in schools as a manifestation of peer-to-peer 
</p>
<p>violence was also raised, as was the need for international initiatives to counter it. 
</p>
<p>30. Many delegations drew attention to the role of the international community in 
</p>
<p>stopping violence against children, and the fact that progress remained scattered and slow 
</p>
<p>was an indictment of the international human rights system. States called upon the Human </p>


<p>Rights Council to be more involved in current and future efforts in this area, and for it to be 
</p>
<p>a matter of priority in the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Empowerment of children 
</b></p>
<p>31. The importance of empowering children in ending violence against them was 
</p>
<p>discussed by many delegations. Children should be made aware of their rights and have 
</p>
<p>access to mechanisms to protect themselves. Impunity against perpetrators of violence 
</p>
<p>against children should be combated, and independent, and child-friendly complaint 
</p>
<p>mechanisms should be established. 
</p>
<p>32. Some delegations pointed out the positive effect of developing and deploying 
</p>
<p>suitable methods for implanting the child&#8217;s right to be heard in processes, which were 
</p>
<p>crucial for their lives and well-being. The need for standardized, child-friendly hearing 
</p>
<p>procedures was also stressed, as was the need to effectively listen to children, provide 
</p>
<p>anonymous and confidential reporting and work with them to identify and apply solutions 
</p>
<p>to eradicate violence. 
</p>
<p>33. Helplines and interactive webpages were mentioned as examples of good practice to 
</p>
<p>provide children with information on their rights, the ability to report abuse and to offer 
</p>
<p>professional help and support. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Children in situations of particular risk 
</b></p>
<p>34. Various delegations referred to children in situations of particular risk of violence. 
</p>
<p>These included children in areas of conflict, which could expose children to the risk of 
</p>
<p>kidnapping, trafficking, torture or death, as well as the deprivation of medical care. 
</p>
<p>Children in street situations were also mentioned by several States, which had put in place 
</p>
<p>programmes to assist them. The commercialization of witch-hunting, exorcisms and 
</p>
<p>deliverances was also raised as a concern, with one delegation reporting that it had 
</p>
<p>contributed to the spread of violence against children in many communities, which in turn 
</p>
<p>undermined broader efforts to combat violence against children. 
</p>
<p>35. Children deprived of their liberty were also mentioned as being at a higher risk of 
</p>
<p>violence than others. Children deprived of their liberty were particularly vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>physical, psychological and sexual violence. The need to ensure effective monitoring and 
</p>
<p>regular access to justice institutions by independent bodies empowered to conduct 
</p>
<p>unannounced visits, and interviews with children and staff, was raised. Serious concern in 
</p>
<p>relation to the ongoing trend of inhuman sentences for crimes committed by individuals 
</p>
<p>under the age of 18 years was expressed, including the death penalty and life imprisonment, 
</p>
<p>as well as cases of juvenile torture and ill-treatment of children in police custody. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Concluding remarks and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>36.<b> In her concluding remarks and responses to the discussion, Dr. Hadj Salah 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasized that violence against children was a pressing issue throughout the world, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and prevention was a key to its elimination. It was important to mobilize all 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders, including national and international entities, to assess the extent of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>problem in order to decide how to address it. Legal instruments were crucial to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ending violence and alleviating the consequences, while there was also a need to build 
</b></p>
<p><b>a culture of non-violence. In relation to violence at school, teachers had to be made 
</b></p>
<p><b>aware of the seriousness of corporal punishment and the effect of humiliation as a </b></p>


<p><b>form of punishment. Children should be encouraged to report their concerns and 
</b></p>
<p><b>worries. 
</b></p>
<p>37.<b> With regard to children in situations of conflict, the Ombudsman on the Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Child of the Russian Federation, Mr. Astakhov, emphasized that the need to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect children should be seen as more important that any political agenda. Children 
</b></p>
<p><b>whose parents had been killed must be offered aid and provided with humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>38.<b> Mr. Freyre</b> <b>of the Latin American and Caribbean Movement for Children 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasized the importance of prevention as well. In Latin America and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Caribbean, corporal punishment was one of the most pervasive forms of violence, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>there should be a legal framework preventing such treatment. In the past 18 months, 
</b></p>
<p><b>six States had adopted legislation in this regard. It now had to be implemented, 
</b></p>
<p><b>together with a shift in cultural attitudes to stop corporal punishment and physical 
</b></p>
<p><b>humiliation. Investment in children was also vital so that programmes could be 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented and children could develop and flourish. Policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>aimed at combating violence against children should be implemented in an integrated, 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-discriminatory and universal way. He referred to the third Optional Protocol of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Convention on the Rights of the Child, on a communications procedure, as an 
</b></p>
<p><b>important mechanism to give a voice to children. 
</b></p>
<p>39.<b> Ms. Khondkar</b> <b>of Save the Children </b>&#8211;<b> Liberia discussed the inclusion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against children in the post-2015 development agenda, and called upon the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council to become a strong advocate in this regard. Inclusion in this 
</b></p>
<p><b>agenda would ensure focused investment, commitment and results in all countries. 
</b></p>
<p><b>More than 12,000 children had been consulted regarding their views on the agenda, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and they had come back with a clear vision of a world without violence. At the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national level, political commitment was needed to combat the problem, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>regular data collection and the involvement of all ministries relating to children, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the most relevant ministry playing a coordinating role. Families should be supported, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by developing parenting skills to learn positive ways to discipline children. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Men and boys should also be involved in reducing violence against children and 
</b></p>
<p><b>women. Awareness should be raised about gender stereotyping, which began at a very 
</b></p>
<p><b>early stage.  
</b></p>
<p>40.<b> Mr. Mezmur,</b> <b>the Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Child and Chairperson of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Welfare of the Child, emphasized that any solution to violence against children should 
</b></p>
<p><b>combine affordability, cost-effectiveness and sustainability with non-discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability, participation and impact. The importance of regional bodies in ending 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against children could not be overemphasized, and the importance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional relationships and collaboration should also be noted. Political will was 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed to overcome violence against children, including by accepting the universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>periodic review recommendations on this topic and adopting legislation on 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibition, but also by ensuring that budget cuts did not impede the realization of 
</b></p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>41.<b> Remedies and accountability were vital. The ratification of the third Optional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child should continue, as should 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness-raising and supporting families in preventing violence. Violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>children should be a key issue in the post-2015 development agenda, and children 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be involved in its development. Mr. Mezmur concluded that it took a village to 
</b></p>
<p><b>raise a child, but a global village to raise a child free from violence. </b></p>


<p>42.<b> The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Children stated that one important lesson from the Millennium Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p><b>was that countries suffering from violence lagged behind in terms of child mortality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>school attendance, health and other indicators. This situation could be turned around. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violence was one of the key concerns expressed by all, and was included as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>systematic concern in all reports developed in the lead-up to the post-2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>development agenda. The Human Rights Council should keep it at the centre of its 
</b></p>
<p><b>debate and as a cross-cutting issue. Violence against children should also continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be raised during the universal periodic review process.  
</b></p>
<p>43.<b> In order to eradicate violence against children, acceptance of and passivity 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards violence had to be overcome. A clear strategy and political will were required. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Better data and research to understand the impact on children and development were 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed to implement such a strategy. Children had to be empowered so that, instead 
</b></p>
<p><b>of being just the victims of violence, they could become the actors in initiatives to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent it as well. Eliminating violence against children was a global effort; it could 
</b></p>
<p><b>not be solved by the intervention of a few. All should join hands to build a world 
</b></p>
<p><b>where violence had no place. 
</b></p>
<p>44.<b> The moderator thanked Algeria for bringing the issue of violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>children before the Human Rights Council. She summarized the main points made 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the panel discussion and debate: 
</b></p>
<p>&#61623; <b>The underlying causes and effects of violence against children must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessed in order to combat it successfully 
</b></p>
<p>&#61623; <b>Legal frameworks play an important part in social change, but 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional practices and culture often have an impact on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization </b>of children&#8217;s rights and must be addressed<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#61623; <b>Solutions should be tailored to individual situations rather than involve a 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;one<b>-size-fits-all</b>&#8221;<b> approach 
</b></p>
<p>&#61623; <b>Birth registration must be addressed as an urgent concern, in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>make children visible 
</b></p>
<p>&#61623; <b>Violence against children must be central to the post-2015 development 
</b></p>
<p><b>agenda 
</b></p>
<p>&#61623; <b>The Human Rights Council must keep the issue of violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>children high on its agenda and support the mobilization of necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
