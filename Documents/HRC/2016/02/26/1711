</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Human Rights 
Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> also Human Rights Council resolution 6/13 of 28 September 2007 and all 
subsequent Council resolutions on the Social Forum, Council resolution 6/15 of 28 
September 2007 and all subsequent Council resolutions on the Forum on Minority Issues, 
and Council resolution 17/4 of 16 June 2011 and all subsequent Council resolutions on the 
Forum on Business and Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, play an 
important role at the national, regional and international levels in the promotion and 
protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the insufficiency of funding for the Social Forum, the Forum on Minority 
Issues and the Forum on Business and Human Rights to ensure broad participation, 
particularly from relevant parts of civil society that may not be able to finance their own 
travel, 
</p>
<p>  
 &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its twenty-fourth session (A/HRC/24/2), Part One.  
</p>

<p>1. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to establish a special fund for the 
participation of civil society and other relevant stakeholders in the Social Forum, the Forum 
on Minority Issues and the Forum on Business and Human Rights, to be administered by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in accordance with 
the financial regulations and rules of the General Assembly, which would be used to 
support the participation of civil society representatives and other relevant stakeholders in 
the annual meetings of the Social Forum, the Forum on Minority Issues and the Forum on 
Business and Human Rights in accordance with the mandates of these forums, and requests 
the Office of the High Commissioner to report thereon; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Decides</i> that the Special Fund for the Participation of Civil Society in the 
Social Forum, the Forum on Minority Issues and the Forum on Business and Human Rights 
should aim to facilitate the broadest possible participation of civil society representatives 
and other relevant stakeholders, and to give priority to the participation of local or national-
level non-governmental organizations active in the relevant fields, with particular attention 
being paid to participants from least developed countries, and that the resources of the 
Special Fund should be utilized in such a manner as to ensure equal or adequate levels of 
support for each of the forums; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> States to support the participation of civil society and other 
relevant stakeholders in the Social Forum, the Forum on Minority Issues and the Forum on 
Business and Human Rights and, to that end, to make voluntary contributions to the Special 
Fund; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Encourages</i> intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and 
other private or public entities to make voluntary contributions to the Special Fund.&#8221;
