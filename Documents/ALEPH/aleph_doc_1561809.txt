Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements
FormCap Corp.
March 31, 2014
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 - CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring 
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at March 31, 2014, and for all periods presented herein, have been made.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included 
in the Company's December 31, 2013 audited financial statements. The results of operations for the periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the 
operating results for the full years.
NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States  of  America  and  are  stated  in  US  dollars. 
Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use 
of estimates which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Reclassification of Financial Statement Accounts
Certain amounts in the condensed financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the March 31, 2014 condensed financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates 
and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the 
reportable amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Development Stage Company
The  Company  is  considered  to  be  in  the  development  stage  as  defined  in  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC)  915  “Development  Stage  Entities.” The  Company  is 
devoting substantially all of its efforts to development of business plans.
Basic Loss Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during 
the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or 
equity. There were no dilutive or potentially dilutive instruments outstanding as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
Stock Issued in Exchange for Services
The valuation of common stock issued in exchange for services is valued at an estimated fair market value as determined by the most readily determinable value of either the 
stock or services exchanged. Values of the stock are based upon other sales and issuances of the Company’s common stock within the same general time period.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash in bank 
deposit accounts which at times may exceed federally insured limits of $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses related to this concentration of risk. Deposits 
did not exceed insured limits during three months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013.
Financial Instruments
For  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable,  accrued  liabilities,  current  portion  of  long-term  debt  and  long-term  debt,  the  carrying  amounts  of  these  financial  instruments 
approximates their fair value. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from 
these financial instruments.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company translates foreign currency transactions and balances to its reporting currency, United States Dollars, in accordance with ASC 830 “Foreign Currency Matters”. 
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the year. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at 
the exchange rate prevailing when the assets were acquired or the liabilities assumed. Revenue and expenses are translated at the rate approximating the rate of exchange on the 
transaction date. All exchange gains and losses are included in the determination of net income (loss) for the year.
Income Taxes
The Company applies ASC 740, which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. The asset and liability method requires that the current or deferred 
tax consequences of all events recognized in the financial statements are measured by applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to determine the amount of taxes payable or 
refundable currently or in future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when 
it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recovered.
The Company adopted ASC 740, at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. This interpretation requires recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-
than-not” approach,  requiring  the  recognition  and  measurement  of  uncertain  tax  positions.  The  adoption  of  ASC  740  had  no  material  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial 
statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Except  for  rules  and  interpretive  releases  of  the  SEC  under  authority  of  federal  securities  laws  and  a  limited  number  of  grandfathered  standards,  the  FASB  Accounting 
Standards Codification™ (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the 
aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN
The  Company's  financial  statements  are  prepared  using  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States  of  America  applicable  to  a  going  concern  which 
contemplates  the  realization  of  assets  and  liquidation  of  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  Company  has  not  yet  established  an  ongoing  source  of  revenues 
sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company 
obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.
In  order  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  the  Company  will  need,  among  other  things,  additional  capital  resources.  Management's  plan  is  to  obtain  such  resources  for  the 
Company  by  obtaining  capital  from  management  and  significant  shareholders  sufficient  to  meet  its  minimal  operating  expenses  and  seeking  equity  and/or  debt  financing. 
However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
The  ability  of  the  Company  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  is  dependent  upon  its  ability  to  successfully  accomplish  the  plans  described  in  the  preceding  paragraph  and 
eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if 
the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 4 – PROMISSORY NOTE RECEIVABLE
On June 3, 2013 the Company advanced the sum of $11,194 ($11,500 Canadian Dollars) to an unrelated Canadian company. The loan is secured by a promissory note which 
matures on December 31, 2014. On November 30, 2013 the borrower company repaid $1,928 ($2,000 Canadian Dollars). As at March 31, 2014, the borrower company owed 
the Company $8,638 ($9,500 Canadian Dollars).
The promissory note is non-interest bearing until maturity and bears interest at 3% per annum thereafter. The Promissory note will become due and payable if the borrower 
receives financing totalling $5,000,000 in aggregate prior to the maturity date. The promissory note is convertible into common shares of the company either in whole or in part 
at the option of the Company.
NOTE 5 – EXPLORATION PROPERTY LEASE
On November 19, 2013 the Company executed a Definitive Agreement with Kerr Energy Group and Keta Oil & Gas LLC (Kerr and Keta) both incorporated in Kansas.
Pursuant  to the  terms  of  the  Agreement  the  Company  agreed to acquire  up to  2,400  acres  in  Cowley  County,  Kansas at a cost  not exceed  $200 per acre. In  addition, the 
Company agreed to issue Kerr and Keta a total of 200,000 Rule 144 shares of the common stock of FormCap.
The Company will own 100% of the Leases (80% net revenue to FormCap; 20% freehold royalty), and will be the operator. The Company will have the option to purchase 
additional leases in Cowley County from Kerr and Keta under an Area of Mutual Interest, the terms of which are set forth in the Agreement. FormCap is required to drill one 
test well in each of the first two years of the lease term in order to maintain its interest in the Leases.
During January 2014, Ironridge Global IV, Ltd. ("Ironridge") purchased from Kerr and Keta the Company’s obligation in the aggregate amount of $671,938.90 (the "Claim 
Amount"). Subsequently, the Company offered to settle the Claim Amount by the issuance of unrestricted and fully tradable shares of the Company's common stock. Ironridge 
accepted the Company's settlement offer, subject to a hearing on the fairness of the settlement terms. On February 21, 2014, the Company, Ironridge and the CEO of the 
Company entered into a Stipulation Order for the settlement on the terms agreed on by Ironridge and the Company. On February 21, 2014, a California Superior Court for the 
County of Los Angeles (the "State Court") held a hearing on the fairness of the Company's settlement offer to Ironridge. Pursuant to the court order issued by the State Court on 
February 21, 2014, the shares of the Company's common stock will be deemed issued in settlement of the claims (subject to certain adjustments based on the future trading 
value of the stock) when delivered to Ironridge. On February 24, 2014 the Company's transfer agent delivered to Ironridge 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. 
The shares issued to Ironridge are freely tradable and exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and the California Corporations Code. The number of shares to 
be issued to Ironridge is subject to adjustment based trading price of the Company's stock such that the value of the shares is sufficient to cover the Claim Amount, a 10% agent 
fee amount and Ironridge's reasonable legal fees and expenses ( the "Final Amount"). Under the Stipulation Order, Ironridge may not be the beneficial owner of more than 
9.99% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock until the Final Amount is paid. Further Ironridge has agreed not to exercise any voting rights of the shares issued 
to it nor influence or cause any change in control of the Company.

Overview
The Company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The Company is currently in the development stage.
On September 30, 2013 the Company executed a Definitive Agreement with: Kerr Energy Group and Keta Oil & Gas LLC (Kerr and Keta) both incorporated in Wichita, 
Kansas.
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement the Company paid Kerr and Keta a non-refundable deposit in the amount of $25,000 (the “Deposit”) to be applied to the purchase price 
of oil leases to be purchased by Formcap, in Cowley County Kansas. The Company will also issue Kerr and Keta a total of 200,000 Rule 144 shares of FormCap.
In addition, the Company agreed to pay Kerr and Keta two hundred dollars ($200.00) per acre for up to 1,500 acres of Leases, at total cost not to exceed $300,000 within 30 
days of execution of the Agreement, subject to final due diligence by the Company. The Company will own 100% of the Leases (80% net revenue to FormCap; 20% freehold 
royalty), and will be the operator. The Company will have the option to purchase additional leases in Cowley County from Kerr and Keta under an Area of Mutual Interest, the 
terms of which are set forth in the Agreement. FormCap is required to drill one well in each of the first two years of the lease term to maintain its interest in the Leases.
The Company will also have the option to participate in the drilling of up to six exploration or development wells on lands currently owned by Keta and Kerr under terms set 
out in the agreement.
On October 28, 2013 the Company, and Kerr and Keta agreed to extend the closing date for the purchase of the oil exploration leases to January 15, 2014. The Company is to 
pay Kerr and Keta $50,000 on or before November 15, 2013, $50,000 on or before December 15 2013 and the remaining balance to a maximum of $200,000 by January 14, 
2014. These funds to be held in trust and applied toward the acquisition purchase price payable on January 15, 2014. In addition, the Company has agreed to issue 200,000 Rule 
144 shares in the company to Kerr and Keta.
On November 7, 2013 the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 200,000 Rule 144 shares to Kerr and Keta.
During January 2014, Ironridge Global IV, Ltd. ("Ironridge") purchased from Kerr and Keta the Company’s obligation in the aggregate amount of $671,938.90 (the "Claim 
Amount"). Subsequently, the Company offered to settle the Claim Amount by the issuance of unrestricted and fully tradable shares of the Company's common stock. Ironridge 
accepted the Company's settlement offer, subject to a hearing on the fairness of the settlement terms. On February 21, 2014, the Company, Ironridge and the CEO of the 
Company entered into a Stipulation Order for the settlement on the terms agreed on by Ironridge and the Company. On February 21, 2014, a California Superior Court for the 
County of Los Angeles (the "State Court") held a hearing on the fairness of the Company's settlement offer to Ironridge. Pursuant to the court order issued by the State Court on 
February 21, 2014, the shares of the Company's common stock will be deemed issued in settlement of the claims (subject to certain adjustments based on the future trading 
value of the stock) when delivered to Ironridge. On February 24, 2014 the Company's transfer agent delivered to Ironridge 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. 
The shares issued to Ironridge are freely tradable and exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and the California Corporations Code. The number of shares to 
be issued to Ironridge is subject to adjustment based trading price of the Company's stock such that the value of the shares is sufficient to cover the Claim Amount, a 10% agent 
fee amount and Ironridge's reasonable legal fees and expenses ( the "Final Amount"). Under the Stipulation Order, Ironridge may not be the beneficial owner of more than 
9.99% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock until the Final Amount is paid. Further Ironridge has agreed not to exercise any voting rights of the shares issued 
to it nor influence or cause any change in control of the Company.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design 
and operation of our Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, being March 31, 2014. This evaluation was 
carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Company's management, including our President, Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer. 
Based upon that evaluation, our President, Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as 
of the end of the period covered by this report due to the material weaknesses described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in our 
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

carried out our evaluation. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our 
Company's reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
