Judgment on Assessment of Costs

INTRODUCTION 
1.      
The civil action No HBC 655 of 1998 was filed on 21st December, 1998. The 1st Plaintiff in that case was David Gilmore and the second and third Plaintiffs were Fiji Water LLC and Natural Waters of Viti Ltd, respectively. The Defendant in the said case was Janusz Kubs. In the statement of claim, allegation against J.Kubs was breach of a restraint of trade clause and also sought injunctive relief against him. The said defendant filed the second amended counter claim for economic duress and damages. Mama'O Kubs who was the wife of Janus Kubs filed Civil Action No. HBC 239 of 2003 against David Gilmore and Fiji Water LLC and Natural Waters of Viti Limited for economic duress and for damages. 

2.      
Upon an application, by consent of the parties the court on 15th October,2003, the court inter alia made following orders

a.      
The action HBC 239 of 2003 be tried at the same time as the said Action No HBC 655 of 1998.

b.      
The Plaintiffs in Action HBC655 of 1998 and Defendants in Action HBC 239 of 2003 be referred to as the Plaintiffs in the proceedings and the Defendants in Action 655 of 1998 and the Plaintiffs in Action 239of 2003 be referred to as Defendants in the proceedings.

c.      
The order for consolidation made previously, on summons issued on 29th September, 2003, set aside.(emphasis added)

3.      
So, it was erroneous to state in paragraph 3.1 of Plaintiff's written submission that the proceedings were consolidated. In fact the order for consolidation was made, but before it was sealed and executed, the order was set aside and by consent of the parties and it was decided to try the two actions separately but at the same time in terms of the Order 4 rule 9 of the High Court Rules of 1988. In Supreme Court Practice (White Book) 1999 p314/9/2

 ''&&&.
 Where consolidation must be refused for one reason or another an order will often be made that one action shall follow the other in the same list and be heard before the same Judge (or the same Judge and jury). In this way common witnesses are saved the expense of two attendances, and the Judge will be in a position to try the action in such order as may be convenient or even a the same time. Consolidated actions may be deconsolidated (Lewis v Daily Telegraph (No2) [1964] 2 Q.B. 601, C.A.)"

4.      
In this case the two actions were not consolidated but was ordered to tried at the same time and this is possible in terms of Order 4 rule 9 (1) of the High Court Rules of 1988. At the assessment and also in the written submission this was not revealed and it seemed both parties presumed that the actions were consolidated at the time of the hearing.

5.      
On 23rd February, 2005 the solicitors for the Plaintiff wrote a letter 'without prejudice save as to costs' informing that the statement of claim in Civil Action No HBC655 of 1998 would be withdrawn on the instructions of their clients. It was withdrawn, but I could not find any sealed order or compliance of Order 21 of High Court Rules 1988. In the written submissions filed both parties did not address this issue. If a party to an action withdraws a claim without leave of the court Order 62 rule 5 (2) is applicable, but in this assessment there is no application by the Defendant under said provision.

6.      
Again the Plaintiff's solicitors had written letters indicating that they would be making an application to withdraw claim against Mr. J. Kubs in Civil Action No 655 of 1998 at the commencement of trial. 

7.      
After proceeding with hearing, on the counter claim a request was made to have split trials, in terms of Order 33 rule 4 of the High Court Rules of 1988 by the Plaintiffs. Despite the objections from the Defendants, the court allowed the said application to hear the issue of liability of the Plaintiffs without considering the evidence on the assessment of the damages. It should be noted that this decision to have split trials had benefited the Defendants and their costs were reduced as a result of this.

8.      
The Defendants (J.Kubs and M. Kubs) failed to establish the economic duress by the Plaintiffs, and costs awarded against Plaintiffs.

9.      
 At the conclusion it was held in the judgment 

 'In the end the Court finds the claim by Janusz and Mama O Kubs for economic duress against the Plaintiffs do not arise, and are also dismissed .
 
Costs to the Plaintiffs to be taxed if not agreed.'

10.     
There was no agreement between the parties as to the costs. The Plaintiff had submitted a documents comprising of 6 volumes of documents for a claim of $236,144.38. Both parties agreed this matter to be determined by written submissions, as all the documentary evidence were submitted to the court for assessment of the costs. Parties were given an opportunity to make oral submissions. 

11.     
The costs awarded by the court was not indemnity costs and the Plaintiffs are entitled only for taxed costs from the Defendants. The counter claim Civil Action in HBC 655 of 1998 and claim of the Civil Action No HBC 239 of 2003 were tried together for liability and both claims were dismissed simultaneously as quoted in the judgment. Hence, the liability of the costs of the said trials which were conducted simultaneously should be joint and or several. As the two trials were conducted at the same time by consent of all the parties the issue of cost needs to be joint and several as there was no agreement to the contrary by the Defendants at that time or any time during the hearing. The parties consented to conduct the two actions simultaneously, hence the separate taxing of each action is not pragmatic and both became liable for costs jointly and or severally in the absence of any such order to the contrary. The manner in which the assessment done was also not conducive to make separate assessments for two actions. These issues were not raised in the written submissions as both parties were under misapprehension that the actions were consolidated at the hearing.

12.     
Order 62 Rule 12(3) state that even if the court had not indicated the basis of taxation, then the taxation should be done on the standard basis. Taxation needed to be done in terms of the Gazette No 20 of 7th July, 2006. Appendix 4 of the High Court Rules was revoked and a fresh Scale of Costs  Standard Basis was introduced. Order 62 rule 13 deals with the taxation on standard basis.
13.     
According to Order 62 rule 12(1) 'On taxation of costs on the standard basis there shall be allowed a reasonable amount in respect of all costs reasonably incurred and any doubts which the taxing officer may have as to whether the costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount shall be resolved in favour of the paying party'. (emphasis added)

14.     
The approach is two prone. First the court needs to consider each claim whether it is reasonable or not and then if it is a reasonable claim the court needs to assess the reasonable amount. The two prone process is made easier by the schedule found in the Appendix 4 as the amounts and steps stated there can be considered as reasonable claims and then the court has to decide whether it should be allowed lower or higher scale. This schedule was made in terms of Order 62 rule 13(3) of the High Court Rules of 1988 and it states as follows

 '(3) the bill of costs shall consist of such items specified in Appendix 4 as may be appropriate, set out in chronological order; each such item (other than an item relating only to time spent in travelling and waiting) may include an allowance for general care and conduct having regard to such of the circumstances referred to in paragraph (2) above as may be relevant to that item.'(emphasis added)

15.     
The burden of proof in taxation of costs claims as to the reasonableness are fairly and squarely with the party claiming costs and any doubt as to reasonableness of claim and amount, needs to be resolved in favour of the paying party (i.e the Defendants).

16.     
The bill of costs needs to be in chronological order. Unfortunately the voluminous documents produced in 5 volumes were not set out in chronological order similarly the bill of costs was also not in chronological order. The result was that the bill of costs contained several repeated claims for the same professional services. Whether it was deliberate or inadvertent act cannot be stated with certainty. If it was a mistake at least when the Defendant had indicated certain double claims, those should have been withdrawn and action of prudence would require such course considering the large volume of material submitted for taxation (e.g. Vol. 5 deals with 2005 claims whereas Vol. 4 ends with 2006 claims).

17.     
 Though I am inclined to direct the Plaintiffs' solicitors to re-submit the bill of cost in chronological order in compliance with the High Court Rules, I shall not do so considering that there should be end to this litigation and further delay in this assessment cannot be justified, but this had made the assessment much more difficult and time consuming. An act of prudence would have saved time and money for all.

18.     
According to the Appendix 4 each item of cost needs to be scaled either under lower scale or higher scale. In the determination of the scale the factors that needed to be considered are found in Order 62 rule 13. I do not wish to repeat all the factors in the said provision. The cause of action for the Plaintiff was based on a clause relating to restraint of trade, but this was withdrawn at the trial. When the Plaintiffs realized the strength of their claim, but lot of water had gone under the bridge by that time. The Plaintiffs should not be allowed to claim costs for the withdrawn claim, which proceeded up to the date of hearing.

19.     
The claims that proceeded to hearing were based on the alleged economic duress by the Plaintiffs, that resulted the transfer of the Defendants' stake in the ventures to the Plaintiffs. When the 'Calder Bank offer' was made, the Plaintiffs indicated the strength of the alleged claims for economic duress and suggested a withdrawal of that by the Defendants.

20.     
This was a matter that a reasonably skilled solicitor with a reasonable knowledge could have conducted, but considering the nature of the applications before High Court, I would consider this matter on higher scale considering the importance of the action. It is also important to note, though the matter is taxed at higher scale, ipso facto, it is not a reason to spend excessively, by engaging an overseas counsel, knowing the strength of the claim and also counter claims of the Defendants.

21.     
 At the same time since the only issue at the hearing was the alleged 'economic duress' it was not a complex matter and by no means justified in extravagant expenses claimed in taxation. The Plaintiffs knew that the claims for economic duress were doomed to fail, from the start and had indicated this early to the Defendants.

22.     
The Plaintiff has made a Calderbank offer informing withdrawal of their claim and also indicated to the Defendants the unsustainability of economic duress against the Plaintiffs. So, the Plaintiffs knew that the trial was a hopeless or doomed to fail and in the circumstances it was not reasonable to allow unnecessary and extravagant costs in the taxation of costs.

23.     
As admitted by the solicitors for the Plaintiffs, there were two senior partners of law firm, and one other junior solicitor of the law firm, involved and costs regarding the travel and other associated costs for an overseas counsel, cannot be considered reasonable under the circumstances. I have decided that all the expenses of overseas counsel was not reasonably incurred in the circumstances of this taxation.

24.     
It is not reasonable for the Plaintiffs to claim for the costs involved in claim for restraint of trade and injunction in Civil Action HBC 655 of 1998, in this taxation. This point was not raised by the Defendants' counsel either in oral or written submissions.

25.     
 Prior to the withdrawal of the Plaintiffs' claim at the hearing, the said costs claimed included, costs incurred in for the withdrawn claim against J. Kubs. It was withdrawn only at the trial and all costs up to that time were inclusive of costs for the withdrawn claim. The exact date of withdrawal was not clear but it was in 2005 as there were communications to intending withdrawal.

26.     
 Till second amended counter claim was filed by J. Kubs on 17th November, 2003 there was no counter claim for economic duress and all the costs incurred by the Plaintiffs only related to withdrawn claims for restraint and injunction against J. Kubs and they should be excluded in taxation. This issue was again not raised at the assessment by the counsel for Defendants, but it is unreasonable to allow such costs against the Defendants.

27.     
In this assessment the documents prior to 2004 were not produced on the basis that they were not available with the solicitors to prepare a bill of costs. At the oral hearing Mr. Ronald Sing who appeared for the Plaintiffs considered this as a substantial concession, and Ms Marie Chang who appeared for the Defendant also thought so, but the Plaintiffs could not claim costs till 17th November, 2003 as the costs involved were entirely incurred for the claim that Plaintiffs withdrew, the Plaintiffs were very fortunate not to get a cost order in favour of the Defendants at the time of the withdrawal of their claim, in 2005.

28.     
General rule in costing is that cost follows the event. Since there was no order as to cost in favour of either party at the time of the said withdrawal, cost incurred in the said withdrawn claim should be excluded in any form of costing. It is even illogical to think that the court had granted taxed cost to the party that withdrew the action.

29.     
Even though counsel for the Defendant did not submit, there was an issue of cost relating to the withdrawn claim. When the claims were made this cost was included in all the professional dealings till it was withdrawn at the trial. So from 17th November, 2003 till the withdrawal of Plaintiffs' claim against J. Kubs, all the costs for professional services were not entirely costs associated with Defendants claims which were dismissed and costs awarded. When taxation of costs the emphasis is on the 'reasonableness' and the discretion of the court needs to be exercised accordingly. In the circumstances it is not reasonable to allow costs incurred in the withdrawn claim in the taxation for the parties that withdrew the claim.

30.     
Next issue is how to apportion costs incurred for withdrawn claim. A reasonable apportionment needs to be deducted. Considering the circumstances of the case I will allow a discount of 25% from the costs incurred up to the withdrawal of the Plaintiffs' claim against the Defendant as the costs incurred for withdrawn claim.

31.     
I have assessed a cost of $1770 up to 2005 (up to item 147 below in the schedule). This costs included the costs for withdrawn action as stated above and for that I deduct 25% and allowed taxed cost is $1327.50.The costs after withdrawal of Plaintiffs' claim is fully allocated to the Defendant and assessed at $4,310 details of the said claims are found in the schedule below.

CONCLUSION

33.     
The two actions were not consolidated but tried simultaneously and costs cannot be separated, all parties agreed for this method at trial The Plaintiffs' claim for breach of restraint and damages could not proceed to hearing due to lack of evidence, and there were communications to that effect. If that was the only issue the Defendant would have obtained substantial sum from the Plaintiffs. The Defendant, J. Kubs filed a second amended counterclaim for economic duress and his ex-wife filed a separate action for the economic duress. The Plaintiff knew that these claims were doomed to fail as much as the Plaintiff's claim for alleged breach of contract by J. Kubs. The Plaintiffs timely withdrawal of their claim after realizing the strength of their claim saved costs for them. They also realized the Defendants' claims for economic duress could not succeed. The Plaintiffs had even offered $100,000 to the Defendants, if they were willing to withdraw their claims, but this offer was turned down. So, the actions proceeded to hearing on counterclaim of economic duress in HBC 655 of 1998 and claim for economic duress by M. Kubs in HBC 239 of 2003. At the hearing a split trial was ordered despite the objections from the Defendants. The court held that Defendants had failed to establish liability for claims against Plaintiffs for economic duress. Tax Costs ordered against Defendants. In the taxation all reasonable claims are allowed and for that claims reasonable amounts are taxed. The Plaintiff withdrew his claims against the Defendant, nearly 7 years from the time of institution of HBC 655 of 1998. Up to the time of withdrawal reasonable cost allowed was 75% of the taxed costs up to that time as they included costs for withdrawn action. This cost after discount was $1327.50 up to trial and all the taxation after that was assessed at $4,310.00. The total taxed costs is $5,637.50. The delay in this taxation is regretted. The claim for costs was not chronological as required in Order 62 rule 13(3). In the circumstances, I shall not award costs for this taxation. For avoidance of any doubts this matter should be considered as a decision of the Master of High Court.

FINAL ORDERS
a.      
The costs is taxed at $5,637.50

Dated at Suva this 20th day of June, 2014.
