</b></p>
<p><b>against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</b></p>
<p><b>related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all its previous resolutions on the comprehensive follow-up to the World 
</p>
<p>Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance 
</p>
<p>and the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the General Assembly resolutions in this regard, and emphasizing the 
</p>
<p>imperative need for their full and effective implementation,  
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> that many years have lapsed since the adoption of the Durban 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action, and regretting in this regard that its objectives have 
</p>
<p>not been met, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned also</i>, in the above context, at the increasing incidents of racially 
</p>
<p>motivated hatred in all its forms and manifestations, some of which have taken violent 
</p>
<p>forms with concomitant racial profiling,  
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the importance of removing legal obstacles and eliminating 
</p>
<p>discriminatory practices that hamper individuals and groups of individuals from 
</p>
<p>participating fully in the public and political life of the countries in which they live, 
</p>
<p>including the lack of the exercise of their full citizenship rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the adoption of the programme of activities for the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the International Decade for People of African Descent;<footnote name="1">See General Assembly resolution 69/16. 
</footnote>  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Invites</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in his 
</p>
<p>capacity as coordinator of the Decade, to submit an update on his activities in the follow-up 
</p>
<p>to the implementation of the programme of activities within the framework of the Decade 
</p>
<p>to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-first session; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet done so, and consistent with paragraph 
</p>
<p>75 of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, to consider<b> </b>withdrawing their 
</p>
<p>reservations on article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination and articles 18, 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, as these reservations are contrary to the objects and purposes of these core 
</p>
<p>instruments;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> all States to end posturing and denialism about the existence of 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  
</p>
<p>5. <i>Underscores</i> the importance of political will and commitment to eliminate all 
</p>
<p>forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Underlines</i> in the above context the primacy of maintaining a racial equality 
</p>
<p>index under the custodianship of the High Commissioner;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action to commence 
</p>
<p>preparations for the commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and to present a report thereon to the 
</p>
<p>Council at its thirty-first session;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Requests</i> the General Assembly, in view of the fifteenth anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, to dedicate a theme on its 
</p>
<p>full and effective implementation, including the universal ratification of the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the withdrawal of 
</p>
<p>reservations to article 4 of the Convention, the submission of declarations to article 14 of 
</p>
<p>the Convention and the development of national action plans exclusively dedicated to the 
</p>
<p>total eradication of all scourges of racism at the high-level segment of the seventy-first 
</p>
<p>session of the General Assembly;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Invites</i> Member States, the United Nations system and all relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations, to intensify their efforts for
