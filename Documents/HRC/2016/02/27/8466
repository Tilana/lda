<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth session from 24 
January to 4 February 2011. The review of Oman was held at the fifth meeting on 26 
January 2011. The delegation of Oman was headed by the Minister Responsible for Foreign 
Affairs, Yusef bin Alawi bin Abdulla. At its ninth meeting held on 28 January 2011, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Oman. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Oman: Burkina Faso, Jordan and Spain. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Oman: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/OMN/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/OMN/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/OMN/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, 
Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom was transmitted 
to Oman through the troika. These questions are available on the UPR extranet. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5.  Oman expressed its gratitude and appreciation to OHCHR, the members of the 
Working Group and the troika for the efficient work they had undertaken in preparing the 
review session.  
</p>
<p>6. Oman noted that it had accorded priority to human welfare ever since the country&#8217;s 
great renaissance in 1970 under the enlightened leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos 
bin Said. 
</p>
<p>7. The Council of Ministers of Oman had set up a ministerial committee to oversee the 
drafting of the national report. The committee was expected to continue its work in the 
future, monitoring the outcome of the review and following up on it within the Sultanate&#8217;s 
human rights system. Oman reaffirmed at workshops held with civil society the importance 
of their involvement in the review process by submitting direct reports to OHCHR, 
providing input for the national report and, in the longer term, playing a role in monitoring 
the review&#8217;s recommendations at the national level.  
</p>
<p>8. The Oman Basic Law promulgated in 1996 laid down the basic principles and 
criteria of human dignity and freedom, equal rights and equality of opportunity for all 
without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>9. The preparation of the report for the review coincided with the celebrations for the 
fortieth anniversary of modern Oman. This occasion was a motivating factor to work hard 
to produce an objective account of achievements in terms of legislation, institutions and </p>


<p>policies aimed at guaranteeing a high living standard, human dignity and freedom. It had 
also motivated the Sultanate to identify areas in which a greater effort was required to fully 
achieve its aspirations and ambitions. 
</p>
<p>10.  In the past four decades, Oman had been laying solid foundations for a modern State 
based on citizenship, institution-building, the rule of law, justice and equality, as well as the 
cultural and civilizational values of Omani society.  
</p>
<p>11. Oman had ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its two 
Optional Protocols; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (CEDAW); and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). 
Oman was working to prepare its reports to the relevant treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>12. Oman intended to consider signing additional treaties and review some of its 
reservations to articles of the treaties it has ratified. Oman announced that it had decided to 
withdraw four of its reservations to CRC and to limit the scope of its fifth and final 
reservation. Oman expressed its appreciation to the expertise of the different United 
Nations treaty bodies for their recommendations and the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children.  
</p>
<p>13. The legislative and institutional developments provided evidence of the fact that  
Oman had succeeded, in a relatively brief period of time, in establishing the requisite legal 
structure at the national level to embed human rights principles in its national legislation 
and its institutions.  
</p>
<p>14. Oman provided quantitative indicators of the advances made in the last four decades 
in the areas of education, health services, average life expectancy and average infant 
mortality. These achievements had resulted in being ranked as the first country in the world 
in terms of the pace of progress achieved in the areas of health and education, according to 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) <i>2010 Human Development Report</i>.  
</p>
<p>15.  The Omani Government had taken major steps, at the very highest level, to 
encourage women to pursue educational opportunities, join both public and private sector 
employment and become involved in all social and economic fields. Omani women 
occupied ministerial positions in the Government and senior management posts in business 
firms, serving in some cases as chief executive officer. With a view to supporting and 
consolidating these advances, 17 October of each year had been declared Omani Women&#8217;s 
Day.  
</p>
<p>16. His Majesty the Sultan, in his address on the occasion of the opening of the second 
session of the Consultative Council (Majlis el-Shura) in 1994, had called on &#8220;Omani 
women everywhere, in villages and towns, in urban areas and in the countryside, on the 
plains and in the mountains, to rally their forces and contribute to economic and social 
development, each according to her individual abilities, potential, expertise, skills and 
position in society&#8221;, adding that &#8220;the homeland needed all citizens to join forces in the 
onward march towards progress, growth, stability and prosperity&#8221;, and that women played a 
vital role in society. 
</p>
<p>17. Oman had updated its legislation and adopted numerous measures aimed at 
protecting the rights of the various components of the labour force. The Ministry of Labour, 
in coordination with representatives of the private sector and the trade unions, was keen to 
take advantage, on an ongoing basis, of the expertise of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) so that it could take additional steps to update legal provisions and to 
implement best practices in order to safeguard the rights of employers and employees. 
</p>
<p>18. Oman had enacted the Law on Combating Human Trafficking and set up a national 
committee to prepare reports, draw up national plans, make recommendations and take the </p>


<p>necessary steps to counteract the growing global phenomenon of human trafficking and 
address certain undesirable practices in both sending and receiving countries concerning the 
exploitation of workers for the purposes of human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>19. Oman had established the National Human Rights Commission to perform oversight 
and assessment tasks and monitor the human rights situation on the ground. Oman had 
already made a commitment to ensure that it was functioning is in accordance with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights<b> </b>(Paris Principles).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. Oman had taken major steps forward and made extraordinary progress over the past 
40 years by promoting awareness, enacting laws and building institutions aimed at 
achieving the best possible outcome. The goal of consolidating the national human rights 
system constituted an ongoing task for Oman. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the interactive dialogue, 51 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations thanked Oman for its constructive participation, openness and willingness to 
cooperate in the universal periodic review process and acknowledged Omani efforts in the 
promotion and protection of human rights. Active dialogue with civil society during the 
preparation of the national report was positively noted. Additional statements which could 
not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time constraints have been posted 
on the Extranet of the universal periodic review where available.1 Recommendations made 
during the dialogue can be found in chapter II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>22. Qatar noted that over the past few decades Oman had succeeded in establishing a 
well-developed legal system for the protection of human rights, and that the main 
provisions in this regard were contained in the Basic Law. Oman had also created an 
institutional framework, including the National Human Rights Commission. The right to 
development, and particularly human development, were at the centre of national policies. 
This had enabled Oman to realize social and economic rights, in particular for women and 
children, and in the areas of health and education. 
</p>
<p>23. Saudi Arabia highlighted major developments which had taken place in Oman over 
the past few decades and had led to a better protection and promotion of human rights, both 
at the legal and the institutional level. Saudi Arabia particularly commended achievements 
in the area of education and in spreading a human rights culture in the different segments of 
Omani society.  
</p>
<p>24. The United Arab Emirates commended the integration of fundamental human rights 
principles in the Omani Constitution and legislation, in line with international instruments. 
It also appreciated the achievements in the economic, social and cultural fields, noting that, 
according to UNDP, Oman ranked among the top ten countries internationally with regard 
to the pace of progress in education and health in the past few decades. The United Arab 
Emirates also commented on the importance placed by Oman on combating human 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>25. Bahrain noted that Oman had adopted a number of policies to promote human rights, 
in particular the right to education and women&#8217;s rights, and commended that education was 
provided free of charge for all citizens.  Awareness-raising on human rights was part of the 
general education and the work of the media. Bahrain also highlighted the importance given 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Afghanistan, Djibouti, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Nicaragua, Palestine, Somalia.  </p>


<p>to the advancement of women, citing examples of high-level posts occupied by women in 
Government and legislative bodies. 
</p>
<p>26. Algeria commended the attention devoted by Oman to the problem of human 
trafficking and the right to development. It also highlighted achievements in the areas of 
health and education and with regard to the rights of women, children and migrant workers. 
Algeria also noted the role of Oman at the international level in taking initiatives related to 
road safety and the fighting of disease. Algeria further drew attention to the voluntary 
pledges into which Oman had entered in its report. 
</p>
<p>27. Kuwait highlighted achievements in the promotion and protection of human rights 
over the past 40 years, in particular the right to development, including human 
development.  During that period, schools had been built throughout the country, literacy 
programmes had been implemented and Oman University had been established. Kuwait 
further drew attention to the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, 
which worked to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>28. Turkey welcomed the promulgation of the Basic Law and the establishment of the 
National Human Rights Commission. It appreciated efforts to prevent misconduct against 
expatriate workers and protect their rights. It noted efforts to provide equal opportunities 
and develop an open society, and the launching of an electronic voting system facilitating 
universal suffrage for the Consultative (Majlis el-Shura) elections next October.  
</p>
<p>29. Morocco noted that Oman had a comprehensive legal framework strengthened by 
accession to the major international human rights instruments and that it had made strong 
efforts in consolidating cooperation with the international institutions. It also highlighted 
the role of civil society in the development process, and the attention paid to the rights of 
women and their participation in public life, as well as the tolerant approach in interacting 
with a large number of migrant workers from different countries and cultures. 
</p>
<p>30. Egypt highlighted the priority given by Oman to building an effective institutional 
framework comprising the National Human Rights Commission and the National 
Committee for Combating Human Trafficking. Egypt commended Omani efforts in fighting 
human trafficking and assisting victims.  It appreciated efforts undertaken to protect the 
rights of women and children as well as persons with disabilities. It welcomed the accession 
by Oman to a number of human rights instruments, such as CRC and its optional protocols, 
and the fact that Oman was studying the possibility of acceding to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). 
</p>
<p>31. Iraq noted that Oman had acceded to a number of international human rights 
instruments, and that their principles and provisions were reflected in Omani legislation, 
including with regard to the separation of powers, the rule of law, the independence of the 
judiciary, and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. Iraq also highlighted efforts to 
fight human trafficking as well as the fact that Oman had acceded to the Arab Charter on 
Human Rights. Iraq appreciated Omani achievements in the health sector and in the area of 
child rights, and its ratification of CRPD. 
</p>
<p>32. Azerbaijan welcomed measures taken to prevent human trafficking and assist 
victims. It noted that the recent <i>Human Development Report</i> had placed Oman among the 
world&#8217;s 10 leading countries regarding progress made over the past decades in education, 
health and other public sectors. It commended steps encouraging women to participate fully 
and equally in all spheres of life, amendments to the Law on Passports, the protection of 
women in labour relations and the establishment of consultative centres for women. It 
welcomed the establishment of the National Committee concerned with follow-up and 
implementation of CRC.  </p>


<p>33. Mauritania noted that Oman had taken major steps with regard to the promotion and 
protection of human rights and expressed its appreciation for Omani achievements and its 
continuing efforts in that regard. Mauritania was confident that Oman would continue on 
that path, with due regard to the values and customs which suited Omani society. 
</p>
<p>34. India acknowledged progress regarding women and children, and in the areas of 
health and education. It noted the significant reduction of infant and under-5 mortality rates 
and the increase in elected representation in Government. Efforts made to establish a legal 
infrastructure included the National Human Rights Commission and the National 
Committee for Combating Human Trafficking. While noting measures in favour of 
domestic servants and temporary workers, India encouraged Oman to consider bringing 
them within the scope of the Labour Law, thereby ensuring their basic rights.  
</p>
<p>35. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted the establishment of the National Human Rights 
Commission, the National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking and the National 
Committee for following up the implementation of CRC. It noted the outstanding progress 
of Oman in health, employment, welfare and education sectors. The Islamic Republic of 
Iran further noted effective measures for the promotion and protection of the persons with 
disabilities including the consultative centres for women, families and marriage guidance.  
</p>
<p>36. Canada noted the establishment of the National Committee for Combating Human 
Trafficking and legislation regarding the rights of domestic migrant workers, and the care 
provided for persons with disabilities. It noted several challenges, including legislation 
limiting freedom of expression, particularly the Internet and the press, prevalence of 
discrimination and the lack of mechanisms of protection against domestic violence and 
forced marriage. The judiciary, though independent, remained subordinate to the executive 
and subject to its influence.  
</p>
<p>37. Sri Lanka highlighted progress in relation to women and children and in the fields of 
health and education. It noted that the Civil Service Law of 2004 guaranteed equal rights 
and duties for public sector employees without gender discrimination for both citizens and 
non-citizens. It welcomed the new Labour Law, which defined terms and conditions for 
expatriate workers in the private sector, and encouraged Oman to bring domestic workers 
under this law. It welcomed the signature by Oman of the memoranda of understanding 
with countries that supply labour and encouraged it to further strengthen implementation of 
this Ministerial Decision.  
</p>
<p>38. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela highlighted that the World Health 
Organization had listed Oman among the leading countries of the world in providing 
comprehensive primary health care and in terms of the effectiveness of the whole health 
system financed by the Government of up to 80 per cent.  It also noted an increase in 
average life expectancy and a significant drop in the mortality rate. Concerning treatment of 
non-communicable diseases Oman guaranteed free health care from basic care through to 
tertiary health care, including rehabilitation and social inclusion.  
</p>
<p>39. Oman responded to questions and enquiries of Member States made during the 
interactive dialogue, noting that its legislation guaranteed the rights of all, in accordance 
with the Basic Law, and provided equality for all citizens before the law, while prohibiting 
discrimination between them. Omani legislation did not allow violence against women, 
guaranteed respect for women&#8217;s dignity and forbade behaviour which was not acceptable in 
Omani society, noting that such acts of violence were punishable under the Criminal Code 
and that appropriate remedies existed in the courts. Sexual harassment was also punishable 
under the appropriate provisions of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>40. It was also noted that there was no discrimination with regard to political 
participation of women, who had the right to nominate themselves to be elected to the </p>


<p>Consultative Council (Majlis el-Shura). Women participated in political life as members of 
the Cabinet and the State Office. 
</p>
<p>41. Oman stressed that it had been a State party to CRC since 1996 and to the two 
optional protocols since 2004. Oman had established a committee to oversee the 
implementation of the Convention and its optional protocol, and was drafting a law on the 
rights of children that would guarantee the protection of all rights of children and the 
provision of services thereto, including children born out of wedlock.  
</p>
<p>42. Oman noted that it had collected data on cases of disabilities, through the population 
censuses of 2003 and 2010. The 2008 Law on the Rights of the Disabled provided many 
rights, including the right to employment at a minimum quota of 1 per cent in the 
government administrative sector and 2 per cent in the private sector in enterprises with a 
number of employees exceeding 50 persons. Oman had 33 non-governmental centres 
working on a voluntary base and supported by the Government in order to provide the daily 
services to those with disabilities. Oman hoped to establish more centres of that type. 
</p>
<p>43. Under the Basic Law, school education was free of charge for all children living in 
Oman. This had also contributed to enrolment rates of over 90 per cent in primary schools, 
over 80 per cent at the preparatory level and almost 80 per cent in secondary schools.  
</p>
<p>44. Oman noted that it paid special attention to the education of children with 
disabilities and that there were three specialized schools, for the visually impaired, the deaf 
and the mute. Specialized teachers helped these children to attain better integration in the 
community. A national plan for the integration of children with disabilities in the public 
schools had been adopted in early 2000.  
</p>
<p>45. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea underlined the achievements of Oman 
in areas such as education and health. As recognized by UNDP, Oman was one of the 
world&#8217;s leading countries regarding progress made in education and health in recent 
decades. It noted that constant efforts were being made in the area of women&#8217;s 
empowerment, as demonstrated by increased numbers of women in major public posts.  
</p>
<p>46. France noted with satisfaction measures taken to promote human rights, particularly 
the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission. Acknowledging significant 
efforts to improve women&#8217;s status, France noted continued gender inequality regarding the 
ability to pass on citizenship, and the vulnerability of women and children to domestic 
violence. It also noted restrictions of the freedom of association and the freedom of 
expression, referring to censorship of newspapers and publications deemed politically or 
culturally offensive.  
</p>
<p>47. Spain acknowledged efforts made and urged Oman to continue consolidating the 
legal framework for the protection and promotion of human rights. It congratulated Oman 
on its determination to reach the second millennium development goal regarding the right 
to free education for all citizens and reduce the level of illiteracy in the country.  
</p>
<p>48. Jordan noted that Oman had made considerable progress in the area of economic, 
social and cultural rights for instance, in particular in the areas of health and education. 
Jordan also appreciated progress in the area of civil and political rights, including with 
regard to the freedom of expression and opinion and related developments in the legislative 
framework concerning the media. 
</p>
<p>49. Slovenia noted the progress of Oman in the areas of juvenile justice, forced labour, 
human rights education and human trafficking, and the fast decline in under-5 mortality. 
While commending the number of voluntary pledges, it noted a number of challenges in the 
area of civil and political rights, including discrimination and violence against women, and 
regarding the rights of children and migrant workers.   </p>


<p>50. Yemen expressed it&#8217;s appreciation for the progress made by Oman in a relatively 
short period in the human rights area. It noted that Oman had built the necessary legal 
framework to implement human rights principles at the national level, especially with 
regard to the rights of women and children. Yemen welcomed that Oman had made such 
progress based on the preservation of the specificities and social values of Oman, while 
benefiting from the experience and best practices of others.  
</p>
<p>51. Indonesia noted increased efforts to make human rights awareness a core part of the 
national education system. It noted that human trafficking was becoming a significant 
challenge for the Sultanate and commended Omani efforts to tackle this issue with the 
seriousness it deserved. Indonesia shared concerns voiced by various stakeholders that the 
National Human Rights Commission was not yet accredited by the International 
Coordinating Committee (ICC).   
</p>
<p>52. Lebanon noted that Oman had taken major steps towards the promotion of human 
rights with the creation of the National Human Rights Commission and the committee to 
combat human trafficking. In recent years, Oman had made concrete achievements in 
different areas related to economic, social and cultural rights. Lebanon particularly 
commended initiatives for the empowerment of Omani women and the promotion of their 
participation in the Consultative Council (Majlis el-Shura) and in the economic sphere.   
</p>
<p>53. Libyan Arab Jamahiriya commended the achievements regarding, inter alia, the 
rights to health and education, the right to work, and the freedom of opinion and 
expression. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya also appreciated the efforts made by the National 
Human Rights Commission in raising awareness concerning human rights in all regions of 
the country. It further welcomed the lifting of reservations to CRC.  
</p>
<p>54. Malaysia commended Oman for major strides particularly in the area of legislative 
reform and socio-economic development, including increased investment in education, 
health, training and social services, and for its proactive stance in advancing the rights of 
women and children. It welcomed the intention of Oman to withdraw its reservations to 
CRC and noted its seriousness in addressing the scourge of human trafficking and issues 
related to migrant workers.   
</p>
<p>55. Singapore commended Oman for its support for the rights of women, children of 
ethnic minorities and the disabled. It also noted that the high ranking of Oman in the <i>2010 
Human Development Report</i> as a testament to the great strides that the nation had made in 
social development and economic progress, leading to significant improvement in 
healthcare and education. It noted that fighting terrorism was one of the main challenges 
today and that Oman had made tremendous achievements in this respect.  
</p>
<p>56. Bangladesh noted Oman&#8217;s economic growth and efforts in the area of governance 
and free education and health care. It further noted measures to reduce gender disparity, 
including in educational levels, as well as the increased life expectancy. Bangladesh 
welcomed the existence of an administrative court, a functioning human rights institution 
and guarantees for the enjoyment of religious rights. It noted that the National Committee 
for Combating Human Trafficking provided safeguards against trafficking and forced 
labour. It commended efforts regarding the welfare of expatriate workers and the 
constitutional recognition of the family as basis of society.  
</p>
<p>57. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was pleased to note the 
confirmation concerning the lifting of reservations to CRC. It welcomed the work in 
combating discrimination against women, including the designation of an official Omani 
Women&#8217;s day, and Oman&#8217;s ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. The United Kingdom was concerned that some aspects of the domestic law 
still allowed for discrimination against women and migrant workers. It encouraged Oman to 
address concerns by the Committee of the Rights of the Child during the preparation of the </p>


<p>new Draft Law of the Child. The United Kingdom strongly encouraged Oman to sign both 
CAT and its Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p>58. Oman noted that freedom of expression and opinion were guaranteed for all. The 
press and other media were devoted to the development of the country as a whole.  This is 
why Oman had been ranked nineteenth in the world according to the global report on 
information development for 2009&#8211;2010. The number of newspapers, magazines and 
periodicals had increased to over 80. The private sector had started creating private radio 
and television stations. There was also a continuing increase in the number of Internet sites 
that offer services in full freedom and transparency. Oman asserted that no person was 
imprisoned for expressing an opinion as long as certain principles and rules were respected. 
Oman continually worked on aligning its legislation with ratified instruments.   
</p>
<p>59. On the question regarding granting citizenship to children as a way to prevent 
statelessness, the law provided that Omani citizenship is granted to the child of an Omani 
women if the father is with unknown citizenship, but that the child takes the citizenship of 
the father, whether he is Omani or not, if the father is of a known citizenship.   
</p>
<p>60. Chad noted with satisfaction the importance Oman accorded to the review, which 
allowed States, at regular intervals, to analyse their progress made in the protection of 
human rights owing to the comments and recommendations of other States.   
</p>
<p>61. Brazil welcomed the improvements in life expectancy, mortality and literacy rates. It 
commended Oman for its substantial voluntary pledges, including with regard to accession 
to international instruments and the withdrawal of reservations. It noted that the situation 
faced by migrant workers was still of concern. The sponsorship system made them 
vulnerable to abuse and mistreatment, including trafficking. Domestic workers were 
particularly vulnerable. The situation of women still required improvements, particularly in 
the rules on marriage, divorce and child custody. Children born out of wedlock still faced 
serious vulnerabilities.  
</p>
<p>62. The Philippines acknowledged the legal infrastructure of Oman and its progress in 
the area of health development, including comprehensive primary health-care services. It 
welcomed efforts to increase women&#8217;s involvement and participation in public life, and 
noted the inclusion of human rights concepts in primary school curricula. It commended the 
drop in infant mortality rates, the prohibition of child labour and the establishment of a 
national committee concerned with following-up the implementation of CRC. It welcomed 
measures adopted to safeguard the rights of domestic workers and to address human 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p>63. Pakistan was pleased to note that the <i>2010 Human Development Report</i> listed Oman 
among the countries that had made the greatest progress in recent decades in education, 
health and other sectors. It also noted progress in empowering women in the educational 
and economic spheres. Their participation in all fields needed to be encouraged. It also 
noted that the rapid pace of economic development had attracted a large number of foreign 
workers and that a number of legal and administrative measures had been taken to improve 
their living and working conditions. 
</p>
<p>64. Sudan noted achievements in the area of child rights and the judicial system, and 
rapid progress towards comprehensive development in all areas, including health, education 
and living standards. Within the framework of its development efforts, Oman had also 
addressed poverty and unemployment. 
</p>
<p>65. The Syrian Arab Republic appreciated the sincerity of Oman in promoting human 
rights, including the right to development, and reinforcing the national human rights 
framework. The Syrian Arab Republic also highlighted the values of peace, tolerance and 
justice in the collective culture of the Omani people, noting that Oman accorded the highest </p>


<p>priority and respect to human dignity. These values and principles provided a solid basis for 
the promotion and protection of human rights. The Syrian Arab Republic noted that Oman 
had acceded to a large number of human rights instruments and that it pursued constructive 
cooperation with different human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>66. Sweden welcomed the ratification by Oman of CEDAW, but noted that women 
continued facing discrimination in law and practice, regarding their personal status and 
employment and their subordination to male guardians. It noted the existence of the death 
penalty. Concerning the freedom of expression, Sweden expressed concerns at arbitrary 
arrests and restrictions by law and practice. Noting that homosexuality was illegal and 
punished according to sharia law, it inquired how LGBT rights could be safeguarded.   
</p>
<p>67. Slovakia commended, inter alia, legislative measures strengthening the legal 
protection for children, the bill for the care and rehabilitation of persons with disabilities, 
and the Law on Combating Human Trafficking. Slovakia was concerned that the Press and 
Publication Law allowed the censoring of publications. It was particularly concerned about 
reports of harassment of journalists and writers for criticizing Government policies in 
recent years. It noted that women continued to face inequality in areas such as marriage, 
divorce, inheritance, child custody and employment.    
</p>
<p>68. Uzbekistan underlined the Omani constitutional human rights protection and the 
special attention it attached to the rights to health, education and work. Uzbekistan 
welcomed in particular the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission as an 
independent institution fostering cooperation with civil society. Noting efforts to combat 
human trafficking, it inquired about results of implementing the Law on Combating Human 
Trafficking and the work of the National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>69. Chile highlighted Omani efforts in human rights and urged the Government to 
continue to consolidate the legal framework for the effective promotion and protection of 
human rights. It congratulated Oman on its determination to reach the second millennium 
development goal concerning free education, and to reduce the illiteracy rate.  
</p>
<p>70. The United States of America commended the progress of Oman in the areas of 
education, public health and workers&#8217; rights, particularly the increase of schools and 
elementary school enrolment rates. Increased spending on health services and awareness 
campaigns had led to greater life expectancy and reduced infant mortality rates. It noted 
that migrant workers could join unions, and that women were protected from dismissal for 
reasons of sickness, pregnancy or childbirth. It remained concerned that Omani women 
married to non-nationals could not pass their citizenship to their children, and at the 
prevalence of human trafficking. It also noted inequalities with regard to the work 
conditions of non-Omani workers, especially the lack of a legal minimum wage and work 
hour limits.   
</p>
<p>71. Oman noted that, during a very short period of time, it had established legal 
structures for the protection of workers rights in conformity with international standards.  
Oman had adopted the new Labour Law in 2003, providing equal rights for all workers. 
</p>
<p>72. Oman commented on the protection of domestic workers, and noted that regulations 
to combat trafficking in persons required recruitment agencies to comply with all 
regulations of the countries of origin of workers, to maintain a registry with information on 
the workers brought to Oman and to conclude a model contract with the employer to protect 
the workers and their rights.  
</p>
<p>73. The Labour Law did not make a distinction between Omani and migrant workers. 
Oman respected the rights of workers, including those temporarily employed. Oman had 
committed itself voluntarily to review a number of labour-related laws, taking account of 
ILO Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, as a prelude to adopting the necessary measures. Oman </p>


<p>had also established a hotline to receive complaints from workers whose rights were 
infringed, so that necessary action could be taken.  
</p>
<p>74. Oman further noted that it attached great importance to combating all crimes, 
including trafficking in persons as a contemporary form of slavery, committed by the 
exploiting persons belonging to vulnerable groups, particularly children, youths and girls.  
An amendment had been introduced to the Labour Law in order to bring it in conformity 
with the Law on Combating Human Trafficking.   
</p>
<p>75. Oman focused on raising general awareness about trafficking in persons, with a 
focus on victims. In that regard, the National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking 
in persons had produced about two million leaflets in seven different languages that were 
distributed to all target groups, in addition to posting on websites and dissemination 
through other media. Oman highlighted its efforts in monitoring trafficking activities and 
prosecuting perpetrators of trafficking in persons.   
</p>
<p>76. Oman had an integrated network of information based on international, regional and 
national cooperation and coordination, with an exchange of information with the 
International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), and the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime and other relevant agencies. The Omani strategy to combat trafficking in 
persons also focused on the rehabilitation and reintegration of victims. Oman was 
committed to combating trafficking in persons by reinforcing existing measures and 
working on raising awareness and encouraging victims to report any actions that could fall 
under the Law on Combating Human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>77. Cuba noted significant progress in education, health, fighting trafficking and rights 
of persons with disabilities. It highlighted universal access to quality education, progress in 
the health system, advances regarding the rights of women and children, and that Oman 
was prepared to strengthen participation of women in the workforce and economic fields. It 
welcomed efforts aimed at the enrolment of girls in specialized courses and professional 
training. Significant progress had been made with regard to migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>78. Norway acknowledged the efforts and results of Oman in improving the human 
rights situation. It noted that active participation of civil society was essential to a 
meaningful universal periodic review process, and that despite freedom of speech by law, 
freedom of expression remained curtailed in practice.  
</p>
<p>79. Italy appreciated the measures for advancing equality of women and expressed its 
confidence that de facto discrimination, especially in relation to marriage, divorce, 
inheritance and child custody, would be corrected in the future. Italy noted that no 
executions had been carried out in Oman since 2001. It noted that the amended 2009 Press 
and Publication Law further tightened existing restrictions and extended criminal liability to 
persons operating communication facilities. 
</p>
<p>80. Argentina noted the progress which Oman had made in reducing child mortality of 
children below the age of 5, which had been particularly highlighted by the World Health 
Organization.  
</p>
<p>81. Nigeria encouraged Oman to continue implementing programmes and policies 
initiated to fully guarantee the rights of its citizens. It observed that Oman was party to a 
number of core international human rights instruments, and encouraged it to consider 
signing or acceding to international human rights instruments such as the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families (ICRMW).  
</p>
<p>82. Poland noted that freedom of expression remained limited in Oman. It expressed 
concerns over the Press and Publication Law which allowed the censoring of publications </p>


<p>perceived as politically, culturally or sexually offensive. It inquired about measures to stop 
harassment of journalists and writers for criticizing Government policies or public services.  
</p>
<p>83. Nepal highlighted the significant progress by Oman in different fields concerning 
economic, social and cultural rights, particularly in relation to women and children, and in 
the fields of health and education. It noted that Oman occupied a dignified rank in the 
global human development index. It highlighted efforts towards establishing the National 
Human Rights Commission and the National Committee for Combating Human 
Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>84. Germany commended Oman for the establishment of the National Human Rights 
Commission and sought its views regarding a future ICC accreditation. It noted that while 
the Labour Code affirmed the equality of all workers, this applied to citizens only. 
Germany enquired about Omani plans to grant civil rights to non-citizens, particularly 
expatriate workers.  
</p>
<p>85. Australia welcomed progress particularly in economic, social and cultural rights. It 
was nonetheless concerned that inequality between men and women was enshrined in 
Omani law. It appreciated the initiative to raise the minimum working age from 13 to 15 
years old, as part of efforts to end child labour. Australia was concerned that access to 
education was restricted to girls. It was also concerned by new measures further restricting 
freedom of opinion and expression. Australia remained concerned that capital punishment 
was a part of Omani law.  
</p>
<p>86. China appreciated the establishment by Oman of a national legal infrastructure and 
the incorporation of human rights principles in its law and institutions. It noted the 
promulgation of the law on combating human trafficking and the establishment of a related 
national committee. China commended the Omani progress in education and public health 
as noted by UNDP and its active role in the global initiative on road safety. It hoped the 
international community would respect Oman for its traditions and customs as an Islamic 
country. 
</p>
<p>87. In closing remarks, Oman noted that it was considering the possibility of acceding to 
ICCPR and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). 
Oman would be regularly reviewing the conventions it had already acceded to in order to 
consider the removal of reservations made to them. Oman confirmed its decision to 
withdraw four of its reservations to CRC and to limit the scope of its fifth and final 
reservation.  Oman was going to train more people at the national level and increase 
capacity building in order to prepare for the accession to additional international human 
rights treaties.  
</p>
<p>88. Oman indicated that it would ensure coordination in the follow-up to UPR among all 
human rights stakeholders, including the national human rights institution and civil society, 
to evaluate the outcome of the review and to develop national plans and relevant human 
rights legislations.
