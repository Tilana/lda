DIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued)
o  The transfer of the Shares to MUI on exercise of either the Put Option or the Call Option is in full and final 
satisfaction of all outstanding amounts under the Loan Facility Agreement, which is currently $3.5m, as 
amended as set out below.
Loan Facility Agreement
Amendments to the Loan Facility Agreement made during the year are as follows:
•
•
•
Loan Amount: The parties have agreed to increase the loan facility from $3.5 million to $4.0 million. To date $3.475 
million has been advanced to AusAsia.  Any further advances will be made at MUI’s discretion for costs associated 
with the tenements.
Term: The terms has been extended to 15 December 2014.  If the options are not exercised or if the conditions 
contemplated under the Put and Call Option are not approved by the Company’s shareholders prior to the expiry of 
the term, then all funds lent to AusAsia under the Loan Facility Agreement will become due and repayable to the 
Company.
Interest Rate: The loan is interest free, provided that full repayment of the funds lent is made prior to the expiry of 
the term. Default interest accrues at a rate of 12% per annum.
•  Security: The Company has been granted the following security:
o  Charge over the assets of JEMS and AusAsia;
o  Corporate guarantee of JEMS; and
o  Personal guarantee of Mr Domenic Martino.
Financial Position  
The net assets of the Company have decreased by $48,858 from 30 June 2013 to $3,105,823 as at 30 June 2014.
Operating Results for the Period  
The  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income  shows  a  net  loss  attributable  to  members  of  $518,858 
(2013: loss $552,588).
Significant Changes in State of Affairs  
There were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the Company during the financial year.
Significant Events after the Reporting Date  
As announced on ASX in July 2014, MUI has been reviewing options to develop the coal tenements held by JEMS and, 
given sustained depressed market conditions for coal and their effect particularly on the junior coal sector, MUI has explored 
a number of alternatives to maximise the value of the call option.
MUI has since year end agreed binding terms with AusAsia to relinquish MUI’s call option to purchase JEMS and for the 
repayment of MUI’s loan to AusAsia as follows:
1. AusAsia will pay MUI:
•
a non-refundable cash payment of $1,200,000 via instalments by 5 December 2014 ($160,000 of which was 
received in June 2014); and
•
$4,800,000 in cash by 15 December 2015.
2. MUI will release its security upon receipt of the last of the above payments.
3. On payment of the $1,200,000, the expiry date of the call option will extend to 15 December 2015. In addition, the Loan 
Facility Agreement will also extend to 15 December 2015.
4. Should the transaction not complete by 15 December 2015 with the payment of $4,800,000, AusAsia will relinquish 30% 
of the shares in JEMS to a third party nominated by AusAsia and MUI will retain its option to acquire 70% of the shares in 
JEMS. In  this event  the security  as mentioned above  will continue (except to  the extent of  the 30%  of shares  in JEMS 
transferred to the party nominated by AusAsia).
Likely Developments and Future Results  
With the completion of the transaction noted above with AusAsia, MUI  will assess further opportunities for the Company.   
The  Company  continues  to  explore  opportunities  for  its  film  library,  with  discussions  taking  place  with  parties  who  can 
develop its potential for digital platforms, with a view to generating value from the asset.
Environmental Regulation and Performance  
The Company was not subject to any environmental regulations or licences during the financial year.
Indemnification and Insurance of Officers and Auditors  
During the year, the Company paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring the directors of the Company (as named 
above), the company secretary, Ms L Martino and any related body corporate against a liability incurred as such against a 
director or secretary to the extent permitted by the Corporations Act 2001.  The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of 
the nature of the liability and the amount of the premium.
The Company has not otherwise, during or since the end of the reporting period, except to the extent permitted by law,

REMUNERATION REPORT (Audited)
This  report  outlines  the  remuneration  arrangements  in  place  for  the  directors  and  executives  of  the  Company.  The 
following persons acted as directors during or since the end of the financial year:
Mr J Bell
Mr P Silva
Mr D Martino
Director (executive)
Director (non-executive)
Director (non-executive) – appointed 19 December 2013
Mr M Zeltzer 
 
The previous remuneration report was passed at the Company’s 2013 Annual General Meeting held on 27 November 
2013. There were no comments provided by shareholders in respect of the previous remuneration report.
Director (non-executive) – resigned 19 December 2013
Remuneration Philosophy
The  performance  of  the  Company  depends  upon  the  quality  of  the  directors  and  executives.    The  philosophy  of  the 
Company in determining remuneration levels is to:
•
• 
 
•
set competitive remuneration packages to attract and retain high calibre employees; 
 
link executive rewards to shareholder value creation; and
establish appropriate, demanding performance hurdles for variable executive remuneration.
The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the 
directors.
The  Board  of  Directors  assesses  the  appropriateness  of  the  nature  and  amount  of  remuneration  of  directors  on  a 
periodic  basis  by  reference  to  relevant  employment  market  conditions  with  an  overall  objective  of  ensuring  maximum 
stakeholder  benefit  from  the  retention  of  a  high  quality  Board  and  executive  team.    A  remuneration  consultant  has  not 
been engaged by the Company to provide recommendations in respect of remuneration, given the size of the entity and its 
structure.
Non-executive Director Remuneration
The Board seeks to set aggregate remuneration at a level that provides the Company with the ability to attract and retain 
directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost that is acceptable to shareholders.
The ASX Listing Rules specify that the aggregate remuneration of non-executive directors shall be determined from time 
to time by a general meeting. The last determination was at the Annual General Meeting held on 8 December 2009 when 
shareholders approved an aggregate remuneration of $300,000 per year.
The amount of aggregate remuneration sought to be approved by shareholders and the manner in which it is apportioned 
amongst directors is reviewed periodically.  The Board considers fees paid to non-executive directors of comparable 
companies when undertaking the annual review process.
Each director receives a fee for being a director of the Company. In addition, the directors received options as part of their 
remuneration and as an incentive.  The directors considered it prudent to conserve the Company’s limited working capital 
rather than increasing director fees, and the issue of non-performance options to directors aligns them with shareholder 
objectives.
The remuneration of non-executive directors for the period ended 30 June 2014 is detailed in the ensuing pages.
Executive Remuneration
Remuneration of the executive director is based on fees approved by the Board of Directors and is set at levels to reflect 
market conditions and encourage the continued services of the director.
The remuneration of the executive director for the period ended 30 June 2014 is detailed in the ensuing pages.  
 
There were no employment contracts in place during the financial year.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The  Board  of  Directors  of  MUI  Corporation  Limited  is  responsible  for  the  corporate  governance  of  the  Company.  The 
Board  guides  and monitors  the  business  and  affairs  of  the Company  on  behalf  of the shareholders  by  whom  they  are 
elected and to whom they are accountable.
To  ensure  that  the  Board  is  well  equipped  to  discharge  its  responsibilities,  it  has  established  guidelines  and 
accountability as the basis for the administration of corporate governance.
Corporate Governance Disclosures
The  Board  is  committed  to  corporate  governance  and  to  the  extent  that  they  are  applicable  to  the  Company  have 
followed the “Principles of Good Corporate Governance and Best Practice Recommendations” issued by the Australian 
Securities Exchange (“ASX”) Corporate Governance Council.  
 
In summary, at the date of this report the Company departs from the Guidelines in five (5) key areas:
•
•
•
•
•
The  Board  does  not  comprise  a  majority  of  independent  director  as  the  management  of  the  business  (given  its 
current nature and size) remains with the Board. Therefore the Board cannot be independent of the management 
decisions it makes.
The  Company  does  not  have  a separate  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee.  The full Board attends  to the 
matters  normally  attended  to  by  a  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee.  Remuneration  levels  are  set  by  the 
Company in accordance with industry standards to attract suitable qualified and experienced Directors.
The  Company  does  not  have  a  separate  Audit  Committee.  The  Company  is  not  of  a  size  that  justifies  having 
separate committees. Matters typically dealt with by the Audit Committee are dealt with by the Board.
The Company does not have a full time Chief Financial Officer at the present but the Board intends to appoint an 
appropriate executive when it is justified by the size and nature of the business. In the meantime the Board satisfies 
itself, assisted by the Company Secretary that there are appropriate reporting systems and controls in place.
The Company has not established a policy concerning diversity.  The Board is highly aware of the positive impacts 
that diversity may bring to an organisation and continues to assess all staff and board appointments on their merits 
with consideration to diversity.
Role of the Board
The key responsibilities of the Board include:
Appointing, evaluating, rewarding and if necessary the removal of Directors;
Development of corporate objectives and strategy;
Monitoring  actual  performance  against  defined  performance  expectations  and  reviewing  operating  information  to 
understand at all times the state of the health of the Company;
Overseeing  the  management  of  business  risks,  safety  and  occupational  health,  environmental  issues  and 
community development;
Satisfying itself that the financial statements of the Company fairly and accurately set out the financial position and 
financial performance of the Company for the period under review;
Satisfying itself that there are appropriate reporting systems and controls in place to assure the Board that proper 
operational,  financial,  compliance,  risk  management  and  internal  control  process  are  in  place  and  functioning 
appropriately, approving and monitoring financial and other reporting;
Assuring itself that appropriate audit arrangements are in place;
Ensuring  that  the  Company  acts  legally  and  responsibly  on  all  matters  and assuring  itself  that  the  Company  has 
adopted, and that the Company’s practice is consistent with, a number of guidelines, being:
- 
- 
-
Directors and Executive Officers Code of Conduct;  
Dealings in Securities; and  
Reporting and Dealing with Unethical Practices.
Reporting to and advising shareholders.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued) 
 
Structure of the Board
Directors of  the  Company are  considered to  be independent  when  they are independent of management and  free  from 
any  business  or  other  relationship  that  could  materially  interfere  with  or  could  reasonably  be  perceived  to  materially 
interfere with the exercise of their unfettered and independent judgment.  
 
An independent director is a non-executive director (i.e. is not a member of management) and:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
is not a substantial shareholder of the Company or an officer of, or otherwise associated directly with, a substantial 
shareholder of the Company;
within the last three years has not been employed in an executive capacity by the Company or its subsidiaries, or 
been a director after ceasing to hold any such employment;
is not a principal or employee of a professional adviser to the Company or its subsidiaries whose billings exceed a 
material amount of the adviser's total revenue;
is not a significant supplier or customer of the Company or its subsidiaries, or an officer of or otherwise associated 
directly or indirectly with a significant supplier or customer. A significant supplier is defined as one whose revenues 
from the Company are a material amount of the supplier's total revenue. A significant customer is one whose 
amounts payable to the Company are a material amount of the customer's total operating costs;
has  no  material  contractual  relationship  with  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries  other  than  as  a  director  of  the 
Company;
has not served on the Board for a period which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with 
the director's ability to act in the best interests of the Company; and
is free from any interest and any business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, 
materially interfere with the director's ability to act in the best interests of the Company.
In  accordance  with  the  definition  of  independence  above,  none  of  the  directors  of  the  Company  are  considered  to  be 
independent  as  they  currently  manage  the  Company  (given  the  size  and  nature  of  the  business),  despite  all  other 
requirements being met.
There  are  procedures  in  place,  agreed  by  the  Board,  to  enable  the  Directors  in  furtherance  of  their  duties  to  seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The term in office held by each director is as follows:
Name 
J Bell 
P Silva 
D Martino
Term 
2 years, 7 months 
2 years, 7 months 
6 months
When a Board vacancy exists, through whatever cause, or where it is considered that the Board would benefit from the 
service of a new director with particular skills, the Board will document the process behind a recommendation for a 
candidate or panel of candidates with the appropriate expertise.  
 
The Board then appoints the most suitable candidate who must stand for election at the next general meeting of 
shareholders.  
 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee
The Board has not established a formal Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The full Board attends to the matters 
normally attended to by a Remuneration and Nomination Committee. Remuneration levels are set by the Company in 
accordance with industry standards to attract suitable qualified and experienced Directors.  
 
For  full  discussion  of  the  Company’s  remuneration  philosophy  and  framework  and  the  remuneration  received  by 
Directors and executives in the current period please refer to the Remuneration Report, which is contained within the 
Directors’ Report.  
 
There is no scheme to provide retirement benefits to Non-Executive Directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (continued)
The Board is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation, arrangements and performance of Directors for the 
Directors themselves.  
 
Audit and Risk Management Committee
The Board has not established an Audit and Risk Management Committee.  The full Board attends to the matters normally 
attended to by such a Committee.
The  Board  acknowledges  that  the  when  the  size  and  nature  of  the  Company  warrants  an  Audit  and  Risk 
Management Committee that the Committee will operate under a Charter approved by the Board.  It is the Board’s 
responsibility  to  ensure  that an  effective  internal  control  framework  exists  within  the  Company.    This  includes  internal 
controls  to  deal  with  both  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  significant  business  processes,  the  safeguarding  of 
assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records, and the reliability of financial information as well as non-financial 
considerations such as the benchmarking of key performance indicators.
The  Board  will  delegate  responsibility  for  establishing  and  maintaining  a  framework  of  internal  control  and  ethical 
standards to the Audit and Risk Management Committee as and when it is formed.
The Company’s Policy is to appoint external auditors who clearly demonstrate independence. The performance of the 
external auditor is reviewed annually by the Board. The Corporations Act provides a policy of rotating the audit partner at 
least every 5 years.  
 
Risk Management
The Company takes a proactive approach to Risk Management. The Board is responsible for ensuring that risks, and also 
opportunities, are identified on a timely basis and that the Company’s objectives and activities are aligned with the risks 
and opportunities identified by the Board.
In addition to the fact that the Company is not of a size and nature to warrant a separate committee, the Board believes 
that  it  is  crucial  for  all  Board  members  to  be  a  part  of  this  process,  and  as  such  has  not  established  a  separate  risk 
management committee.
The Board has a number of mechanisms in place to ensure that management’s objectives and activities are aligned with 
the  risks  identified  by  the  Board,  including  implementation  of  Board  approved  operating  plans  and  budgets  and  Board 
monitoring  of  progress  against  these  budgets,  including  the  establishment  and  monitoring  of  performance  indicators  of 
both a financial and non-financial nature.

MUI CORPORATION LIMITED
20                                                                           ANNUAL REPORT 30 June 2014
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2014
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Basis of Preparation
These  financial  statements  are  general  purpose  financial  statements,  that  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
Australian  Accounting  Standards,  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations,  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the 
Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001.
The  financial  statements  have  also  been  prepared  on  an  accruals  basis  and  are  based  on  historical  costs  which 
apply the going concern assumption.
The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars.
MUI Corporation Limited (the “Company”) is a for-profit listed Public Company, incorporated in Australia.
(b)   Statement of Compliance
The financial report was authorised for issue on the day of the Directors’ Report.
The financial report complies with Australian Accounting Standards (“AASB’s”). Compliance with AASB’s ensures that 
the  financial  report,  comprising  the  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto,  complies  with  International  Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
(c)  Going Concern
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, notwithstanding the fact that for the year ended 
30  June  2014  the  company  generated  a  loss  after  tax  of  $518,858  and  incurred  net  cash  outflows  from  operations  of 
$431,973.  As at 30 June 2014 the company had available cash reserves of $242,810.
The Company anticipates receiving consideration in accordance with the agreement entered in to with AusAsia Energy Pty 
Ltd (“AusAsia”) for the repayment of MUI Corporation Limited’s (“MUI’s”) loan to AusAsia and the relinquishment of MUI’s 
option to  purchase JEMS  (the  “MUI  Agreement”) (refer  Note  18).    The directors believe  that completion  will  take place, 
given AusAsia has entered in to an agreement to sell JEMS to a third party (subject to completion of the MUI Agreement). 
Due diligence on the third party indicates they have adequate resources in order to complete the transaction. 
 
For the 12 months from the date of this report, the Directors have determined that MUI is a going concern based upon a 
cash  flow  budget  prepared  by  management.    This  cash  flow  budget  incorporates  a  control  of  costs,  as  and  where 
appropriate, including the potential to place payments on hold as well as no long term leases, commitments or employee 
contracts.  MUI has, at its discretion, the ability to convert the convertible note held by the Company to equity and the ability 
to exercise the Company’s security relating to the AusAsia Energy Pty Ltd loan and liquidate the asset, thereby creating a 
cash  in  flow.    The  Company  also  has  the  ability  of  a  listed  entity  to  raise  capital  in  the  public  capital  market.  Lastly,  the 
Company has the support of a director that will ensure it has adequate working capital for at least 12 months from the date 
of this report. 
 
For these reasons, the Directors believe that the assumption of a going concern basis in the preparation of these financial 
statements  is  appropriate.    The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  in  relation  to  the  recoverability  or 
classification of recorded assets or liabilities which might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a 
going concern.
(d)
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions about carrying values of 
assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  The  estimates  and  associated  assumptions  are 
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if it affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Assessment of Impairment of Financial Asset:  
As assessment is undertaken at the end of each reporting period as to whether a financial asset is impaired.  If there 
is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset measured at amortised cost has been incurred, the 
amount  of  the  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  and  the  present  value  of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest 
rate computed at initial recognition).  The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use 
of a provision account.  The amount of the loss shall be recognised in profit or loss.
As at balance date, the financial asset is not believed to be impaired given the security and guarantees that exist as 
set out in Note 7.
Convertible Notes:  
The  fair  value  of  convertible  notes  comprises  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  and  the  equity  residual  value.    The 
Company  has  recorded  convertible  notes  at  the  amount  of  money  advanced.  This is because, given the nature and 
size of the Company, the face value of the unsecured debt under the convertible note is the most reliable estimate of the 
fair value of the unsecured debt (i.e. there exists no market for debt of this nature to facilitate a fair value estimate).
MUI CORPORATION LIMITED
21                                                                           ANNUAL REPORT 30 June 2014
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2014 
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Equity-based Payment Transactions:  
The  Company  measures  the  cost  of  equity-settled  transactions  with  directors  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  of  the 
equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity based payment transactions would have no impact on the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting period but may impact profit or loss or equity.
(e)  Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits  will flow to the Company and the 
revenue  can  be  reliably  measured.  The  following  specific  recognition  criteria  must  also  be  met  before  revenue  is 
recognised:
Interest Income:  
Interest revenue is recognised on a time proportionate basis that takes into account the effective yield on the financial 
asset.
(f)  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash comprises cash at bank and on hand. Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  
 
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above.
(g)  Trade and Other Receivables
Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.  Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 
periods ranging from 15 days to 30 days. The Company currently has no trade receivables. 
 
Impairment of trade receivables is continually reviewed and those that are considered to be uncollectible are written off by 
reducing the carrying amount directly.  An allowance account is used when there is objective evidence that the Company 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms. Factors considered by the Company 
in making this determination include known significant financial difficulties of the debtor, review of financial information and 
significant  delinquency  in  making  contractual  payments  to  the  Company.  The  impairment  allowance  is  set  equal  to  the 
difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted 
at  the  original  effective  interest  rate.  Where  receivables  are  short-term  discounting  is  not  applied  in  determining  the 
allowance.  
 
The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within other expenses. When 
a trade receivable for which an impairment allowance had been recognised becomes uncollectible in a subsequent period, 
it  is  written  off  against  the  allowance  account.  Subsequent  recoveries  of  amounts  previously  written  off  are  credited 
against other expenses in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income.
(h)
Income Tax
The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current year’s taxable income (loss) based on 
the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge (benefit) is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
end of the reporting period.  Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in 
which  applicable  tax  regulation  is  subject  to  interpretation.    It  establishes  provisions  where  appropriate  on  the 
basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the end of the reporting period between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except when the deferred income tax 
liability  arises  from  the  initial  recognition  of  goodwill  or  from  an  asset  or  liability  in  a transaction  that  is  not  a business 
combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets 
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except when 
the  deferred  income  tax  asset  relating  to  the  deductible  temporary  difference  arises  from  the  initial  recognition  of  an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

22                                                                           ANNUAL REPORT 30 June 2014
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2014 
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the 
asset  is  realised  or  the  liability  is  settled,  based  on  tax  rates  (and  tax  laws)  that  have  been  enacted  or  substantively 
enacted at the end of each reporting period.
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in profit or loss.
Deferred  tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  are  offset  only  if  a  legally  enforceable  right  exists  to  set  off  current  tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the 
same taxation authority.
(i)  Other Taxes
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
•
when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which 
case  the  GST  is  recognised  as  part  of  the  cost  of  acquisition  of  the  asset  or  as  part  of  the  expense  item  as 
applicable; and
•
receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or 
payables in the statement of financial position.
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows arising 
from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are classified as 
operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation 
authority.
(j)  Financial Instruments 
Initial Recognition and Measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. For financial assets, this is equivalent to the date that the Company commits itself to either the purchase or 
sale of the asset (i.e. trade date accounting is adopted).
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except where the instrument is classified 
“at fair value through profit or loss”, in which case transaction costs are expensed to profit or loss immediately. 
 
Classification and Subsequent Measurement
Financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value, amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, or 
cost. 
 
Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition less principal 
repayments and any reduction for impairment, and adjusted for any cumulative amortisation of the difference between that 
initial amount and the maturity amount calculated using the effective interest method. 
 
The  effective  interest  method  is  used  to  allocate  interest  income  or  interest  expense  over  the  relevant  period  and  is 
equivalent to the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts (including fees, transaction costs and other 
premiums  or  discounts)  through  the  expected  life  (or  when  this  cannot  be  reliably  predicted,  the  contractual  term)  of  the 
financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. Revisions to expected future net 
cash flows will necessitate an adjustment to the carrying value with a consequential recognition of an income or expense 
item in profit or loss. 
 
Fair  value  is  determined  based  on  current  bid  prices  for  all  quoted  investments.  Valuation  techniques  are  applied  to 
determine the fair value for all unlisted securities, including recent arm’s length transactions, reference to similar instruments 
and option pricing models. 
 
Loans and Receivables 
Loans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an 
active market and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
 
Loans and receivables are included in current assets, where they are expected to mature within 12 months after the end of 
the reporting period. 
 
Derecognition
Financial assets are derecognised where the contractual rights to receipt of cash flows expire or the asset is transferred to 
another party whereby the entity no longer has any significant continuing involvement in the risks and benefits associated 
with the asset. Financial  liabilities  are  derecognised  where  the related  obligations  are discharged,  cancelled or expired. 
The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair 
value of consideration paid, including the transfer of non-cash assets or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.
23                                                                           ANNUAL REPORT 30 June 2014

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2014 
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
(k)  Trade and Other Payables
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided 
to the Company prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to 
make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services.
(l)
Issued Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
(m)  Earnings / (loss) per Share
Basic earnings / (loss) per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude any 
costs of servicing equity (other than dividends), divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for 
any bonus element. 
  
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted for:
costs of servicing equity (other than dividends);
the  after  tax  effect  of  dividends  and  interest  associated  with  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares  that  have  been 
recognised as expenses;
other  non-discretionary  changes  in  revenues  or  expenses  during  the  period  that  would  result  from  the  dilution  of 
potential ordinary shares; and
divided  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares and  dilutive  potential ordinary  shares,  adjusted  for  any 
bonus element.

(n)  New Accounting Standards for Application in Future Periods
The Company has adopted all of the new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board (the AASB) that are relevant to their operations and effective for the current reporting period.  
 
The adoption of all the new and revised standards and interpretations has not resulted in any changes to the Company’s 
accounting  policies  and  has  no  effect  on  the  amounts  reported  for  the  current  or  prior  periods.    The  new  and  revised 
accounting  standards  and  interpretations  have  not  had  a  material  impact  and  not  resulted  in  changes  to  the  Company’s 
presentation of, or disclosure in its financial statements.

During  March  2014,  the  Call  Option  Deed  (“Call  Option”)  to  acquire  all  the  issued  capital  of  AusAsia  Energy  Pty  Ltd 
(“AusAsia”), and its 100% owned subsidiary Jems Exploration Pty Ltd (“JEMS”) was terminated and replaced with a Put 
and Call Option. JEMS holds the exploration rights over coal mining tenements in Queensland.  To secure the Call Option, 
the Company had paid a $50,000 option fee.  The fee has been written off this year, on the basis that this first Call Option 
has been terminated.
The Put and Call Option entitles MUI to purchase the shares of JEMS for nil cash consideration, but in full satisfaction of 
the loan outstanding from AusAsia to MUI.  The expiry date of the Put and Call Option is 15 December 2014.
The Company has also amended its Loan Facility Agreement providing a secured loan to AusAsia Energy Pty Ltd to fund

capital structure in response to changes in these risks and in the market.  These responses include the management of 
debt levels, distributions to shareholders and share issues.

Under the underwriting agreement in respect of the Rights Issue completed in December 2012, the Company was to 
issue  50  million  options  to  the  underwriter.  The  cost  associated  with  these  options  was  fully  vested  into  the  2013 
financial  year  accounts  ($18,351).    On  4  December  2013,  the  Company  issued  the  50  million  options  to  the 
underwriter.  The terms of these options are an expiry date of 3 December 2016 and an exercise price of 0.1 cents.
Under the underwriting agreement entered in to in September 2013, the underwriter is entitled to 37,313,433 options 
(with an exercise price of 0.01 cents and expiry date 3 years from the date of issue) on the placement of 500 million
shares made on 31 January 2014.  These options are yet to be issued, but the associated expense of $13,433 has 
been accrued in the accounts.
The fair value of each option when granted was determined as 0.036 cents per option. These values were calculated
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model applying the following inputs:
Share Price:
Exercise Price:
Expected share price volatility:
Vesting date:

Comparable company volatility has been the basis for determining expected share price volatility as it is assumed that 
this is indicative of future movements.

forecast cash flows and only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions.

Mr Domenic Martino was appointed a director on 19 December 2013:
1)  Mr Martino is a director of AusAsia Energy Pty Ltd (“AusAsia”) and JEMS Exploration Pty Ltd.  As at 30 June 2014, 
AusAsia  owed  the  Company  $3,475,062  on  the  terms  as  set  out  in  Note  7.    The  loan  is  interest  free  provided  full

company  that  owns  four  Exploration  Permits  for  Coal  in  Queensland  from  AusAsia  Energy  Pty  Ltd  (“AusAsia”).  
Further information concerning this transaction is in Note 7.
2)  Mr  Martino’s  son  is  the  sole  director  of  Transaction  Services  Pty  Ltd,  a  company  that  provides  MUI  with  company 
secretarial, accounting, office rental and administrative services.  The amount payable to Transaction Services Pty Ltd 
since Mr Martino’s appointment to the end of the financial year totalled $107,201.  As at 30 June 2014, nil amount 
was owing to Transaction Services Pty Ltd; and
3)  Mr  Martino’s  son  is  the  sole  director  of  Minimum  Risk  Pty  Ltd,  a  company  that  provides  MUI  with  underwriting 
services.    The  latest  underwriting  agreement  was  entered  in  to  in  September  2013  (prior  to  Minimum  Risk  Pty  Ltd 
being a related party), entitling Minimum Risk Pty Ltd to an underwriting fee equal to 6% of the amount raised plus 
options.  In January 2014, $500,000 was raised under this underwriting agreement, creating an amount payable to

financial  year  accounts  ($18,351).    On  4  December  2013,  the  Company  issued  the  50  million  options  to  the 
underwriter.  The terms of these options are an expiry date of 3 December 2016 and an exercise price of 0.1 cents.
17.   COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS
There are no capital or lease commitments and no contingent liabilities.
18.   EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE
As announced on ASX in July 2014, MUI has been reviewing options to develop the coal tenements held by JEMS and, 
given  sustained  depressed  market  conditions  for  coal  and  their  effect  particularly  on  the  junior  coal  sector,  MUI  has 
explored a number of alternatives to maximise the value of the call option.
MUI has since year end agreed binding terms with AusAsia to relinquish MUI’s call option to purchase JEMS and for the 
repayment of MUI’s loan to AusAsia as follows:
1. AusAsia will pay MUI:
o
a non-refundable cash payment of $1,200,000 via instalments by 5 December 2014 ($160,000 of which was 
received in June 2014); and
o
$4,800,000 in cash by 15 December 2015.
2. MUI will release its security upon receipt of the last of the above payments.
3. On payment of the $1,200,000, the expiry date of the call option will extend to 15 December 2015. In addition, the Loan 
Facility Agreement (refer Note 7) will also extend to 15 December 2015.
4. Should the transaction not complete by 15 December 2015 with the payment of $4,800,000 (assuming the $1,200,000 
has been paid), AusAsia will relinquish 30% of the shares in JEMS to a third party nominated by AusAsia and MUI will 
retain its option to acquire 70% of the shares in JEMS. In this event the security as mentioned above will continue (except 
to the extent of the 30% of shares in JEMS transferred to the party nominated by AusAsia).
