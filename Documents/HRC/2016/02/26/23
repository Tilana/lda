<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/36, the Human Rights Council established the Expert Mechanism

<p>on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a subsidiary body to assist the Council in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of its mandate by providing it with thematic expertise on the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, as requested by the Council. In the resolution, the Council established 
</p>
<p>that the thematic expertise would focus mainly on studies and research-based advice, and 
</p>
<p>that the Expert Mechanism may suggest proposals to the Council for its consideration and 
</p>
<p>approval. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Adoption of studies, reports and proposals

<p>indicated in paragraph 7 of the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples; </p>


<p> (d) Also proposes to the Human Rights Council that it encourage States to follow 
</p>
<p>up on paragraph 10 of the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples, in which they committed themselves to working with indigenous peoples to 
</p>
<p>disaggregate data, as appropriate, or conduct surveys and to utilizing holistic indicators of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; well-being to address the situation and needs of indigenous peoples

</p>
<p><b> B. Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Expert Mechanism had before it the provisional agenda and annotations thereto 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/EMRIP/2015/1 and Add.1), as prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the study on the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of the rights of indigenous peoples with respect to their cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>16. The Expert Mechanism also had before it the following conference room papers: the 
</p>
<p>updated draft report summarizing the responses to the questionnaire seeking the views of 
</p>
<p>States and indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures 
</p>
<p>and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Indigenous Peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2015/CRP.1); the report of the open-ended 
</p>
<p>meeting of indigenous peoples on the follow-up to the World Conference on Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2015/CRP.2); the submission from the monitoring mechanism 
</p>
<p>regarding the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples in Aotearoa/New Zealand (A/HRC/EMRIP/2015/CRP.3); the 
</p>
<p>compilation of calls to action issued by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of

</p>
<p>Games (A/HRC/EMRIP/2015/CRP.5). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>17. Mr. Deterville, the outgoing Chair-Rapporteur of the Expert Mechanism, opened the 
</p>
<p>eighth session of the Expert Mechanism and welcomed the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights and the President of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>18. The High Commissioner for Human Rights welcomed all participants and 
</p>
<p>highlighted some key recent and future events that would have a significant bearing on the </p>


<p>rights of indigenous peoples, including the Special Summit on Sustainable Development. 
</p>
<p>Several challenges affected indigenous peoples, including the denial of their right to self-
</p>
<p>determination, discrimination in education and access to justice and exclusion from public 
</p>
<p>life, all of which led to chronic marginalization. Extractive industries and industrial-scale 
</p>
<p>agriculture had led to violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their lands, their right to a 
</p>
<p>clean environment, and free, prior and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>19. The High Commissioner reminded participants of the commitments made by States 
</p>
<p>at the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, highlighting some positive developments, 
</p>
<p>such as the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, but noting that 
</p>
<p>few States had followed up on the commitment to develop action plans to implement the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He cited examples of his Office&#8217;s work in 
</p>
<p>advancing the rights of indigenous peoples, focusing on capacity-building, protection and 
</p>
<p>support for activists defending the rights of indigenous peoples. He closed by referring to 
</p>
<p>the review of the mandate of the Expert Mechanism, emphasizing that the review must be 
</p>
<p>coupled with a commitment to follow up on recommendations, together with indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. 
</p>
<p>20. In his opening statement, the President of the Human Rights Council recognized the 
</p>
<p>work of the Expert Mechanism and noted that its studies and advice had been well received 
</p>
<p>by the Council and had contributed positively to the efforts to further the protection of the 
</p>
<p>rights of indigenous peoples. He was grateful to the Expert Mechanism for the study to be 
</p>
<p>presented at the current session. The Council attached great importance to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including within the framework 
</p>
<p>of the universal periodic review. Emphasizing that the Council was ready to undertake the 
</p>
<p>review of the mandate of the Expert Mechanism, as requested in the outcome document of 
</p>
<p>the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, he hoped that the process would result in a 
</p>
<p>more robust mandate for the Expert Mechanism. He also emphasized the importance of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in relevant United Nations processes and forums. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Election of officers 
</b></p>
<p>21. Mr. Deterville invited the members of the Expert Mechanism to nominate a Chair-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur and Vice-Chair-Rapporteur for its eighth session. Mr. Barume nominated 
</p>
<p>Mr. Tsykarev as Chair-Rapporteur, and International Chief Littlechild and Mr. Deterville as 
</p>
<p>Vice-Chairs-Rapporteurs. All three were then appointed by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>22. The Chair-Rapporteur, Mr. Tsykarev, thanked the other members of the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism for his election. He welcomed the new member of the Expert Mechanism, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Barume. 
</p>
<p>23. The Chair-Rapporteur highlighted the work of the Expert Mechanism since the last 
</p>
<p>session. That had included the study on the promotion and protection of the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples with respect to their cultural heritage. The study was informed by an 
</p>
<p>expert seminar jointly organized by the University of Lapland (Finland) and OHCHR. The 
</p>
<p>Chair-Rapporteur discussed the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s work on the questionnaire seeking the 
</p>
<p>views of States and indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate 
</p>
<p>measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>24. The Chair-Rapporteur then outlined the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s activities during the 
</p>
<p>year, including its participation in the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and in the 
</p>
<p>fourteenth session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. He drew 
</p>
<p>attention to the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s first intersessional meeting, which had been held at the 
</p>
<p>Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Canada in March 2015, and thanked the </p>


<p>Government of Canada for its support for that initiative. He provided an overview of the 
</p>
<p>agenda of the session and invited participants to contribute actively to the deliberations. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Expert Mechanism adopted the agenda and annotations thereto, containing the 
</p>
<p>programme of work of the eighth session.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Follow-up to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, 
including the review of the mandate of the 
Expert Mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>26. Mr. Deterville recalled that the General Assembly, in the outcome document of the 
</p>
<p>World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, invited the Human Rights Council, taking into 
</p>
<p>account the views of indigenous peoples, to review the mandates of its existing 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, in particular the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, with 
</p>
<p>a view to modifying and improving the Expert Mechanism so that it could more effectively 
</p>
<p>promote respect for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including by 
</p>
<p>better assisting Member States to monitor, evaluate and improve the achievement of the 
</p>
<p>ends of the Declaration (para. 28). 
</p>
<p>27. Mr. Deterville presented some preliminary ideas for the review of the mandate, 
</p>
<p>which had been agreed upon by the members of the Expert Mechanism, including the 
</p>
<p>following:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Expert Mechanism should remain a subsidiary body of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council and maintain some elements of its current mandate, including the provision 
</p>
<p>of thematic studies;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Expert Mechanism should play a stronger role in terms of facilitating the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration at the national and international levels. That 
</p>
<p>should include supporting States in the preparation of national strategies for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration and engaging with the private sector in order to 
</p>
<p>overcome obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Expert Mechanism should have an increased role in facilitating dialogue 
</p>
<p>between States and indigenous peoples to discuss issues of mutual concern. That 
</p>
<p>should also include engagement with regional organizations and national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Expert Mechanism should engage more actively with the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review, the special procedures and the human rights treaty bodies. That should 
</p>
<p>include assisting States to implement recommendations relating to indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples issued by those mechanisms and serving as a bridge between indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples and the United Nations human rights system; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Expert Mechanism should continue to collect and disseminate information on 
</p>
<p>good practices in the implementation of the Declaration, and issue general 
</p>
<p>comments regarding the provisions of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>28. The Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development reported on follow-up 
</p>
<p>to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. The Secretary-General was developing a 
</p>
<p>system-wide action plan, in collaboration with indigenous peoples, to ensure a coherent 
</p>
<p>approach to achieving the ends of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>Barriers to implementation did not necessarily relate to lack of coordination within the </p>


<p>United Nations system, but rather to issues such as lack of political will to implement the 
</p>
<p>rights of indigenous peoples, including land rights; lack of a common understanding of the 
</p>
<p>key terms in the Declaration and of the meaning and interpretation of the rights contained 
</p>
<p>therein; and lack of disaggregated data collection.  
</p>
<p>29. Referring to the commitment of States to consider ways to enable the participation 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives and institutions in meetings of relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations bodies on issues affecting them (outcome document, para. 33), he noted that good 
</p>
<p>practices were currently being reviewed. He recalled that the report of the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General on progress made in the implementation of the outcome document (A/70/84) 
</p>
<p>contained the proposal that the President of the General Assembly could appoint co-
</p>
<p>facilitators or advisers, including indigenous representatives, to lead an open-ended 
</p>
<p>consultation process on indigenous peoples&#8217; participation at the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, establishing links 
</p>
<p>between the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>agenda, suggested that the operationalization of the outcome document of the World 
</p>
<p>Conference was critical in ensuring that indigenous peoples were not left behind in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the new development goals. Echoing the concerns of many other 
</p>
<p>participants, the Special Rapporteur stated that formulating national action plans would be 
</p>
<p>key to implementing the commitments States had made in the outcome document. With 
</p>
<p>regard to the review of the mandate of the Expert Mechanism, she noted that there was 
</p>
<p>broad consensus among many State representatives on enhancing the capacity of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations mechanisms on indigenous peoples to advise States on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the outcome document of the World 
</p>
<p>Conference.  
</p>
<p>31. Representatives of States and indigenous peoples reaffirmed their strong support for 
</p>
<p>the contribution of the Expert Mechanism in improving the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>Many representatives supported the call for a strengthened mandate for the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism to improve further the rights of indigenous peoples. Specific recommendations 
</p>
<p>included broadening the mandate to include a function to monitor the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration that would promote and protect the rights enshrined therein and discourage 
</p>
<p>violations; preparing reports on the implementation of the Declaration; issuing general 
</p>
<p>comments and interpretations on the provisions of the Declaration; providing technical 
</p>
<p>assistance on implementation to States, indigenous peoples, the United Nations system and 
</p>
<p>the private sector; and collecting and disseminating information on good practices. Many 
</p>
<p>representatives recommended that any broadening of the mandate should not result in a 
</p>
<p>duplication of the mandates of either the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples or the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Securing additional financial 
</p>
<p>resources for the possible increased role of the Expert Mechanism was also considered 
</p>
<p>vital.  
</p>
<p>32. Significant emphasis was placed on States&#8217; commitment to take action to achieve the 
</p>
<p>ends of the Declaration at the national level, through legal, policy and administrative 
</p>
<p>measures, particularly national action plans and strategies. Positive examples were 
</p>
<p>provided, including budgetary reviews Governments had carried out to evaluate the policy, 
</p>
<p>administrative and legislative changes needed to implement the Declaration, and indigenous 
</p>
<p>forums that had been established at the national level to monitor implementation.  
</p>
<p>33. In addition to the review of the mandate of the Expert Mechanism several 
</p>
<p>participants commented on other aspects of follow-up to the World Conference, particularly 
</p>
<p>the participation of indigenous peoples in United Nations processes. Several indigenous 
</p>
<p>representatives supported the call for a new accreditation procedure to ensure the direct, 
</p>
<p>meaningful and effective participation of indigenous peoples, based on mutual respect and 
</p>
<p>partnerships between indigenous peoples and States, in accordance with article 18 of the </p>


<p>Declaration. Participants highlighted the need for selection criteria that differentiated 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples from civil society and academics.  
</p>
<p>34. It was also recommended that the Human Rights Council take up the invitation 
</p>
<p>contained in the outcome document to consider examining the causes and consequences of 
</p>
<p>violence against indigenous women and girls, including by holding a panel discussion on 
</p>
<p>the rights of indigenous women and by encouraging the Secretary-General to issue specific 
</p>
<p>recommendations for action to address that issue. Some participants highlighted the need to 
</p>
<p>be cognizant of the multiple forms of discrimination faced by indigenous persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and to ensure that indigenous persons with disabilities were always taken into 
</p>
<p>consideration by human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> V. </b>Panel discussion on indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights in 
<b>relation to business enterprises 
</b></p>
<p>35. Mr. Barume opened the panel discussion on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in relation to 
</p>
<p>business enterprises by welcoming participants and introducing the panellists. He drew 
</p>
<p>attention to the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s work on that subject, including the follow-up report on 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making, with a focus on 
</p>
<p>extractive industries (A/HRC/21/55).  
</p>
<p>36. The OHCHR Adviser on Business and Human Rights provided an overview of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. She discussed the historical background 
</p>
<p>to the Guiding Principles and its key elements: the State&#8217;s duty to protect human rights, the 
</p>
<p>corporate responsibility to respect human rights, and access to remedy for victims. She 
</p>
<p>provided examples of how both States and enterprises had implemented the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles. She highlighted opportunities for indigenous peoples within that process, 
</p>
<p>including the use of the framework for advocacy and policy development and indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; participation in national action plan processes. 
</p>
<p>37. Pavel Sulyandziga, a member of the Working Group on the issue of human rights 
</p>
<p>and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, emphasized the importance of 
</p>
<p>dialogue between all stakeholders: indigenous peoples, businesses and States. He discussed 
</p>
<p>the work of the Working Group in promoting the effective implementation of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights, including through the development of national 
</p>
<p>action plans, and urged indigenous peoples to use that instrument as a tool for the 
</p>
<p>protection of their rights at the national and international levels. He also drew attention to 
</p>
<p>the fact that, in its reports to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group had addressed the impact of business enterprises on the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. He emphasized the importance of free, prior and informed consent and 
</p>
<p>stressed that the implementation of the Guiding Principles should be informed by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He encouraged 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to participate in the Forum on Business and Human Rights, which 
</p>
<p>would take place in Geneva from 16 to 18 November 2015. He stressed that the 
</p>
<p>endorsement of national action plans on business and human rights could lead to national 
</p>
<p>discussions on human rights violations linked to business and could also become valuable 
</p>
<p>remedy tools.  
</p>
<p>38. Agnes Leina, a representative of the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating 
</p>
<p>Committee, provided a regional perspective from Africa, focusing on potential risks to 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples stemming from extractive industries and the Programme for 
</p>
<p>Infrastructure Development in Africa, supported by the African Development Bank, among 
</p>
<p>others. She emphasized the fact that, under the current development model in Africa, the 
</p>
<p>gains from extractive industry and infrastructure development tended to benefit a small </p>


<p>group of investors, while the losses, such as environmental damage, depletion of natural 
</p>
<p>resources and displacement of communities, were borne by society or the community as a 
</p>
<p>whole. She highlighted the importance of including all stakeholders when investment 
</p>
<p>decisions were made, including indigenous peoples, and of creating a climate of dialogue 
</p>
<p>between all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>39. Luis Vittor, a representative of the Coordinadora Andina de Organizaciones 
</p>
<p>Ind&#237;genas, also focused on the impact of extractive industries and infrastructure 
</p>
<p>megaprojects on the rights of indigenous peoples. Using two case studies from Latin 
</p>
<p>America, he illustrated how extractive industries could negatively impact the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to their lands, territories and resources, their right to health, cultural 
</p>
<p>rights and the right to determine their own priorities for development. He pointed out that 
</p>
<p>one of the main challenges faced by indigenous peoples with regard to extractive industries 
</p>
<p>was access to remedy. He emphasized that, while there were useful instruments, such as the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples, the implementation gap remained enormous, which was having dire 
</p>
<p>consequences for indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>40. Famark Hlawnching, the Chair of the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact, presented a 
</p>
<p>regional perspective from Asia. He stressed the importance of free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent, a principle that was often violated by business enterprises. He illustrated with 
</p>
<p>examples how infrastructure and extractive projects often resulted in forced evictions, 
</p>
<p>harassment of indigenous human rights defenders, and sometimes in enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances or extra-judicial killings. He pointed out that indigenous peoples faced 
</p>
<p>barriers in access to justice in relation to those situations owing to limited financial 
</p>
<p>resources, biased judicial systems and limited access to redress mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>41. Following the panel discussion, participants raised questions regarding possibilities 
</p>
<p>for indigenous communities to have meaningful dialogue with business corporations and 
</p>
<p>extractive industries. The panellists indicated that developing mechanisms for 
</p>
<p>implementing the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights at the national level 
</p>
<p>could be one of the ways of addressing indigenous peoples&#8217; concerns.  
</p>
<p>42. Statements from indigenous participants reflected a widespread pattern of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations against indigenous peoples, raising many of the concerns discussed by the 
</p>
<p>panellists, such as lack of free, prior and informed consent; lack of access to remedies; and 
</p>
<p>the negative impact of extractive industries on rights to lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p>They also highlighted the criminalization of protests by indigenous peoples as a growing 
</p>
<p>concern.  
</p>
<p>43. In view of the range of violations faced by indigenous peoples, some participants 
</p>
<p>considered a binding international instrument on business and human rights crucial for 
</p>
<p>providing remedies for affected communities.  
</p>
<p>44. Mr. Barume thanked all the panellists and participants for contributing to the 
</p>
<p>discussion. With specific reference to Africa, he pointed out that the historical and 
</p>
<p>persistent non-recognition of traditional land rights of African indigenous communities was 
</p>
<p>a contributing factor to indigenous peoples&#8217; particular vulnerability to transnational 
</p>
<p>corporations and other business enterprises. He indicated that stronger and legally protected 
</p>
<p>rights of indigenous peoples over their lands were critical to the implementation of free, 
</p>
<p>prior and informed consent. He drew a parallel with the recent landmark decision by the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of Belize, which had ruled in favour of Maya land rights, affirming 
</p>
<p>constitutional protection for their ancestral land rights and making explicit reference to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The ruling had affirmed 
</p>
<p>that the right to free, prior and informed consent was a fundamental tenet of traditional land </p>


<p>tenure before extractive operations were undertaken on the territory of the Maya 
</p>
<p>communities.  
</p>
<p>45. He indicated that national human rights institutions could be play a key role at the 
</p>
<p>national level in the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. He emphasized the need to engage chambers of commerce as relevant stakeholders 
</p>
<p>at the national level during discussions about business enterprises and human rights. 
</p>
<p>46. Mr. Tsykarev supported the establishment of national action plans on business and 
</p>
<p>human rights, which should include legislative efforts, codification and systematization of 
</p>
<p>national laws linked to indigenous peoples and business enterprises. Those efforts would 
</p>
<p>also facilitate the harmonization of legislation at all levels. He underlined the connections 
</p>
<p>between the cultural rights of indigenous peoples and the influence of industries, which was 
</p>
<p>highlighted in the study of the Expert Mechanism on the promotion and protection of the 
</p>
<p>rights of indigenous peoples with respect to their cultural heritage. He proposed making use 
</p>
<p>of the capacity of the Expert Mechanism to facilitate a sustainable process of consultation 
</p>
<p>between indigenous peoples, governments and businesses. He suggested organizing a side 
</p>
<p>event at the forthcoming Forum on Business and Human Rights on indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>human rights and business enterprises. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Post-20</b>15 development agenda and indigenous peoples&#8217; 
<b>rights 
</b></p>
<p>47. Mr. Mansayagan, opening the discussion, pointed out some of the gaps in the post-
</p>
<p>2015 development goals from the perspective of indigenous peoples. He stated that the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 development agenda would constitute the international community&#8217;s road map 
</p>
<p>for development in the forthcoming years. Referring to the conclusion of the panel 
</p>
<p>discussion during the seventh session of the Expert Mechanism, he outlined some key 
</p>
<p>elements, such as the need to fully integrate indigenous peoples&#8217; perspectives into the post-
</p>
<p>2015 development agenda; the need for indicators of well-being and sustainability instead 
</p>
<p>of purely economic indicators; and the need to recognize the right to free, prior and 
</p>
<p>informed consent. He highlighted the fact that, following a proposal from the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism, the Human Rights Council had encouraged States to give due consideration to 
</p>
<p>all the rights of indigenous peoples in the process of the elaboration of the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda and to take measures to ensure the participation of indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>and in particular indigenous youth, in national processes for the implementation of the new 
</p>
<p>development goals (Council resolution 27/13, para. 15). He expressed concern at the 
</p>
<p>absence of references to free, prior and informed consent in the final draft of the goals, and 
</p>
<p>at the fact that indigenous peoples were grouped together with other vulnerable sectors of 
</p>
<p>society. 
</p>
<p>48. Indigenous representatives regretted the fact that their concerns had been 
</p>
<p>inadequately reflected in the final draft of the sustainable development goals and the fact 
</p>
<p>that indigenous peoples were explicitly mentioned under only two targets (goal 2 and goal 
</p>
<p>4). The new development goals must reflect the concerns of indigenous peoples, in line 
</p>
<p>with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Some participants stated that 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions could be instrumental partners in ensuring that 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples participated in national-level plans and strategies for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the new goals. Participants commended the priority given to 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data in the post-2015 development goals and stressed the need to include 
</p>
<p>such data across all relevant indicators and targets of the 17 goals. </p>


<p><b> VII. Follow-up to thematic studies and advice 
</b></p>
<p>49. Mr. Mansayagan recalled the mandate of the Expert Mechanism and listed the 
</p>
<p>studies and advice it had issued previously. He recalled that the studies and advice were 
</p>
<p>intended to provide a better understanding of the provisions of the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to suggest specific action that States, indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>civil society, international organizations, national human rights institutions and others could 
</p>
<p>take in order to further its implementation. He noted that the studies of the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism placed special emphasis on the participation of indigenous peoples themselves 
</p>
<p>in decisions that affected them.  
</p>
<p>50. A representative of the Indigenous Persons with Disabilities Global Network 
</p>
<p>acknowledged the usefulness of the previous studies of the Expert Mechanism as guidance 
</p>
<p>tools for advocacy and policy development. The Network suggested that the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism consult indigenous persons with disabilities in the development of its future 
</p>
<p>studies and advice. 
</p>
<p>51. Mr. Tsykarev urged States to ensure that initiatives that had been identified as good 
</p>
<p>practices in previous studies of the Expert Mechanism were not weakened. He encouraged 
</p>
<p>both States and indigenous peoples to use the opportunity afforded by the agenda item to 
</p>
<p>keep the Expert Mechanism abreast of recent developments regarding the themes of its 
</p>
<p>previous studies. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Study and advice on the promotion and protection of the 
rights of indigenous peoples with respect to their cultural 
heritage 
</b></p>
<p>52. Mr. Tsykarev expressed his gratitude to the University of Lapland, which had, 
</p>
<p>jointly with OHCHR, organized an expert seminar on the topic of the study in February 
</p>
<p>2015. He thanked all the experts who had participated in the seminar for their valuable 
</p>
<p>contribution to the study and all the States, indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and national human rights institutions that had provided 
</p>
<p>submissions to the study. He gave a detailed overview of the study, focusing on the advice 
</p>
<p>with respect to cultural heritage that the Expert Mechanism had provided to States, 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, international organizations and museums. 
</p>
<p>53. The draft of the study was well received by representatives of State and indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. Participants commended the Expert Mechanism for highlighting the holistic and 
</p>
<p>intergenerational nature of cultural heritage, and emphasizing the links between cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage and lands, territories and resources. Indigenous representatives also welcomed the 
</p>
<p>emphasis placed on free, prior and informed consent in relation to cultural and natural 
</p>
<p>heritage. Given the alarming pace at which indigenous languages were being lost, several 
</p>
<p>participants drew attention to the need to preserve and promote indigenous languages 
</p>
<p>through effective mother tongue education programmes. Participants also requested the 
</p>
<p>Expert Mechanism to pay special attention to the need to revitalize the customary practices 
</p>
<p>and traditional governance systems of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>54. Many participants highlighted the fact that, in paragraph 27 of the outcome 
</p>
<p>document of the World Conference, States committed themselves to developing fair, 
</p>
<p>transparent and effective mechanisms for access to and repatriation of ceremonial objects 
</p>
<p>and human remains. During the discussion, indigenous representatives discussed several 
</p>
<p>cases in which they had been unable to recover ceremonial objects, human remains and 
</p>
<p>other articles related to their heritage from museums, collectors and other repositories. </p>


<p>55. Representatives of States recognized the importance of revitalizing and preserving 
</p>
<p>the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples and discussed many ongoing measures in their 
</p>
<p>respective countries. They highlighted specific legislative measures, support for education 
</p>
<p>in native/mother tongues, the establishment of institutions for promoting indigenous 
</p>
<p>cultures, budget allocations for the preservation of indigenous art and culture, along with 
</p>
<p>research and studies on the contribution of indigenous cultural heritage to mainstream 
</p>
<p>society. Similarly, national human rights institutions shared some exemplary action they 
</p>
<p>had taken to protect and promote indigenous peoples&#8217; right to cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>56. Mr. Barume remarked that Convention concerning the Protection of the World 
</p>
<p>Cultural and Natural Heritage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Organization (UNESCO) had huge potential to strengthen the protection of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; rights. However, in order for that to be put into practice, UNESCO and its World 
</p>
<p>Heritage Committee must align their policies and programmes with the international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards relating to indigenous peoples, including regional and national instruments. 
</p>
<p>He regretted the fact that the World Heritage Committee had declared World Heritage Sites 
</p>
<p>in many parts of the world in a manner that did not respect international standards that 
</p>
<p>safeguarded indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, particularly the principle of free, prior and 
</p>
<p>informed consent. To address that gap, he called upon UNESCO, the World Heritage 
</p>
<p>Committee and other relevant organizations to strengthen their knowledge on indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; rights through training and awareness-raising activities. He also called upon 
</p>
<p>Member States to evaluate and recognize the contribution that indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage made to national economies. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>57. International Chief Littlechild provided an overview of the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>work in the area of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
</p>
<p>including a review of the final summary of the responses to the questionnaire seeking the 
</p>
<p>views of States and indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate 
</p>
<p>measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the Declaration. He thanked 
</p>
<p>the staff of the Faculty of Law at the University of Manitoba for their assistance in 
</p>
<p>preparing the summary of the responses, and all the States and indigenous peoples who had 
</p>
<p>responded. He referred to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples as a significant step 
</p>
<p>forward for the recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples. He reminded States that the 
</p>
<p>outcome document of the World Conference was a reaffirmation of their support for the 
</p>
<p>Declaration and the commitments made therein.  
</p>
<p>58. Claire Charters, a member of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Fund for Indigenous Peoples, delivered a statement on behalf of the Board. She welcomed 
</p>
<p>the thirty-two beneficiaries of the Fund present at the session and thanked the Member 
</p>
<p>States that had contributed to the Fund. She highlighted the fact that 2015 marked the 
</p>
<p>thirtieth anniversary of the Fund and that over the course of the 30 years, the Fund had 
</p>
<p>supported the participation of 2,000 representatives at United Nations meetings. She 
</p>
<p>pointed out the achievements of the beneficiaries of the Voluntary Fund and provided an 
</p>
<p>overview of the Board of Trustees&#8217; activities in 2014-2015. She concluded by encouraging 
</p>
<p>all Governments to consider supporting the work of the Fund. 
</p>
<p>59. Many participants noted that, while there had been significant progress, indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples remained among the most marginalized groups in many parts of the world. The 
</p>
<p>systematic violation of the rights enshrined in the Declaration was ongoing and pervasive. 
</p>
<p>A variety of obstacles and barriers to the implementation of the Declaration were identified 
</p>
<p>by participants. They included the lack of political will and financial resources to </p>


<p>implement indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, misunderstandings regarding key terms in the 
</p>
<p>Declaration, inconsistencies between State legislation and the Declaration, &#8220;rights 
</p>
<p>ritualism&#8221; on the part of some States, a lack of awareness and a lack of capacity among 
</p>
<p>relevant sectors of society. Furthermore, the refusal to recognize the status of some 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples had led to systematic violations of their human rights, in particular 
</p>
<p>rights to lands, territories and resources, identity, culture and self-determination.  
</p>
<p>60. In addition, participants identified an urgent need for States to intensify their efforts 
</p>
<p>to achieve the ends of the Declaration and implement the rights contained therein, including 
</p>
<p>the principle of free, prior and informed consent; lands, territories and resources rights; 
</p>
<p>treaty rights; self-determination; cultural rights; and the right to participate in decision-
</p>
<p>making. 
</p>
<p>61. It was emphasized that, in order to halt violations of the human rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples and achieve the ends of the Declaration, the outcome document of the World 
</p>
<p>Conference on Indigenous Peoples should be used as a guide for action and the realization 
</p>
<p>of the rights of indigenous peoples. Importantly, it was noted that through the adoption of 
</p>
<p>the outcome document, specifically paragraphs 3 and 4, States reaffirmed their solemn 
</p>
<p>commitment to the rights contained in the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>62. Megan Davis, the Chair of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, highlighted 
</p>
<p>forthcoming events and processes which would impact indigenous peoples and the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration. They included: deliberations concerning the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development goals; the third International Conference on Financing for Development; the 
</p>
<p>twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
</p>
<p>Convention on Climate Change; negotiations at the World Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>Organization concerning traditional cultural expressions and traditional knowledge; the 
</p>
<p>revision of the World Bank social and economic safeguards; and, of particular relevance in 
</p>
<p>the light of the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s recent study on cultural heritage, the World Heritage 
</p>
<p>Committee&#8217;s review of its operational guidelines on the nomination of World Heritage 
</p>
<p>Sites.  
</p>
<p>63. On the issue of the involvement of indigenous peoples in such events, many 
</p>
<p>participants advocated for the creation of a specific accreditation system for indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; governing institutions. Participants stated that a unique accreditation mechanism 
</p>
<p>would work to implement the right of indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making, 
</p>
<p>and recognize the unique status of indigenous peoples&#8217; governing institutions. The 
</p>
<p>mechanism should be governed by flexible modalities that took into account the unique 
</p>
<p>circumstances of indigenous peoples globally. 
</p>
<p>64. Many participants emphasized that States should create national action plans for the 
</p>
<p>achievement of the ends of the Declaration in partnership with indigenous peoples and 
</p>
<p>consistent with the rights of the Declaration. The national action plans should incorporate 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising programmes to promote widespread understanding of the Declaration, 
</p>
<p>including through the media. It was also recommended that the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>should require States to report on the arrangements for national action plans and other 
</p>
<p>measures to implement the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>65. Many participants noted that regional and national human rights institutions played 
</p>
<p>an important role in the monitoring, protection and implementation of the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. There was one example of indigenous peoples themselves taking steps 
</p>
<p>at the national level to monitor the implementation of the Declaration. The Monitoring 
</p>
<p>Mechanism of the National Iwi Chairs Forum from New Zealand/Aotearoa, which made its 
</p>
<p>inaugural statement at the eighth session of the Expert Mechanism, provided a report on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration in New Zealand/Aotearoa 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/EMRIP/2015/CRP.3). </p>


<p>66. Many participants emphasized that increasing international tourism had often led to 
</p>
<p>the violations of the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands, territories and resources, 
</p>
<p>sacred sites and cultural locations, the right to self-determination and the right to determine 
</p>
<p>their own development. Similarly, many participants discussed the negative effects of 
</p>
<p>militarization, particularly acts of violence against and extra-judicial killings of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples and the violations of their rights relating to traditional lands, territories and 
</p>
<p>resources. They highlighted how militarization and development often combined to feed 
</p>
<p>into serious and systematic violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> X.  Proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Chair-Rapporteur invited observers to share their recommendations regarding 
</p>
<p>the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s proposals to the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>68. Some participants provided suggested themes for future studies of the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism, including links between militarization, development and the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and a study focusing on mechanisms for redress, remedies, restitution 
</p>
<p>and repatriation in conformity with articles 11, 27, 28 and 40 of the Declaration. Other 
</p>
<p>suggested themes included the ways in which national human rights institutions could aid 
</p>
<p>in the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples; human rights violations 
</p>
<p>impacting indigenous peoples in the field of tourism; and genocide and indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>69. There were some general proposals, including that the Expert Mechanism, through 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council, should encourage treaty bodies and the Working Group on the 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review to scrutinize the reports and human rights records of States in 
</p>
<p>order to address rights ritualism effectively. That should include ensuring that States claims 
</p>
<p>were systematically compared to the concerns raised by indigenous peoples and civil 
</p>
<p>society. 
</p>
<p>70. The Chair-Rapporteur suggested that the Expert Mechanism could examine actions 
</p>
<p>and policies of financial institutions that had negative impacts on indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Consultation on the United Nations system-wide action plan 
to ensure a coherent approach to achieving the ends of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>71. The eighth session provided the time for a consultation with States and indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples on the United Nations system-wide action plan to ensure a coherent approach to 
</p>
<p>achieving the ends of the Declaration, as called for in paragraph 31 of the outcome 
</p>
<p>document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. The consultation was facilitated 
</p>
<p>by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, in cooperation with the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>72. A number of Member States expressed their support for the development of the 
</p>
<p>action plan. Indigenous representatives, while also supportive of the development of the 
</p>
<p>action plan, raised a number of concerns, including the need to catalogue and disseminate 
</p>
<p>good practices of United Nations entities in relation to indigenous peoples and the need to 
</p>
<p>address violence against indigenous women. They also stressed the importance of United 
</p>
<p>Nations entities working more closely with indigenous peoples, consulting them and 
</p>
<p>identifying specific focal points or offices that work on indigenous peoples&#8217; issues.  
</p>
<p>73. A number of speakers said that, although the action plan was to be developed within 
</p>
<p>existing resources, that would constitute a major challenge to its implementation. The </p>


<p>Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples noted that a number of United 
</p>
<p>Nations entities had already developed specific policies on engagement with indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples, as a good practice that other entities could follow. However, she also noted that 
</p>
<p>there were limited financial and human resources dedicated to indigenous peoples&#8217; issues 
</p>
<p>within the United Nations system, and those resources were often difficult to measure. 
</p>
<p>74. The consultation served as a useful forum to clarify the following elements of the 
</p>
<p>action plan: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The action plan will focus on a limited number of clearly identifiable actions that the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system will undertake within the next two years. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; According to the outcome document, the action plan is to be developed within 
</p>
<p>existing resources. No financial resources have yet been committed to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the action plan. A possible element of the action plan may 
</p>
<p>involve concerted fundraising efforts for projects, programmes and mechanisms that 
</p>
<p>deal specifically with indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is a general agreement that one of the major obstacles to the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is a general lack of 
</p>
<p>awareness of the Declaration among all stakeholders. Consequently, awareness-
</p>
<p>raising and advocacy will be an important element of the action plan. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is important to ensure coherence between the normative work at headquarters and 
</p>
<p>the programmatic work at the country level. To this effect, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Group Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Issues were adopted on 1 
</p>
<p>February 2008. Those Guidelines are a valuable tool and the action plan will take 
</p>
<p>advantage of this as well as other existing mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is important to strengthen the capacities of indigenous peoples to help ensure the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The action plan should also invigorate efforts to strengthen the capacities of United 
</p>
<p>Nations staff to work on issues related to indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> XII. Adoption of reports, studies and proposals 
</b></p>
<p>75. At the last meeting of its eighth session, the Expert Mechanism adopted its study 
</p>
<p>and advice on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples with respect 
</p>
<p>to their cultural heritage, including through their participation in political and public life, 
</p>
<p>and the report summarizing the responses to the questionnaire seeking the views of States 
</p>
<p>and indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures and 
</p>
<p>implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Indigenous Peoples. All proposals were adopted by consensus by the members of 
</p>
<p>the Expert Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>76. The members of the Expert Mechanism also adopted the provisional agenda of the 
</p>
<p>ninth session (see annex II).
