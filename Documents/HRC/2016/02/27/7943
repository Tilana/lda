<p> The Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights carried out a mission 
to the Republic of Namibia from 1 to 8 October 2012, in accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolutions 8/11 and 17/13. In the present report she presents her findings and 
recommendations regarding the protection and promotion of the rights of people living in 
poverty and social exclusion in Namibia. 
</p>
<p> The report recognizes the immense levels of inequality that existed at independence 
as a legacy of colonial rule. While acknowledging the compounded challenges faced by 
Namibia &#8211; including limited institutional capacity, and the fact that Namibia has one of the 
world&#8217;s lowest population densities &#8211; it concludes that progress has not been fast enough. 
There are still unacceptable levels of inequality along the lines of gender, race, region, 
ethnicity and class. 
</p>
<p> The report provides specific recommendations to ensure that policies and 
programmes reach the poorest of the poor, enabling them to enjoy their human rights on an 
equal basis with the rest of the population.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, 
Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda, documents the findings of her mission to Namibia from 1 to 8 
October 2012. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur collected first-hand information that 
provided an overview of the human rights situation of people living in extreme poverty in 
order to conduct a human rights-based analysis of key public policies relating to poverty 
alleviation, development and social protection. The Special Rapporteur met with various 
government authorities, including the Prime Minister and representatives of the Ministries 
of Foreign Affairs, Labor and Social Welfare, Finance, Agriculture, Water and Forestry, 
Justice, and Home Affairs and Immigration. She also met with representatives of the 
National Planning Commission, the Social Security Commission, the Anti-Corruption 
Commission, the Ombudsman Office and with local authorities in Kavango (Rundu). 
</p>
<p>2. In addition, she also held meetings with representatives from international 
organizations, donors, civil society and grass roots organizations. She visited and met with 
communities living in poverty in the Omaheke, Kavango, Khomas and Karas regions. The 
main sources of the data included in the report are official documents of the Government of 
Namibia and United Nations agencies.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses her gratitude to the Government of Namibia for 
its full cooperation during her mission. She also extends her thanks to the office of the 
United Nations Resident Coordinator in Namibia for providing support both before and 
during the visit. She is especially grateful to all those who met with her and shared their 
personal experiences of living in extreme poverty and social exclusion in Namibia.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p>4. In 1990 Namibia emerged as an independent country, inheriting as legacies of 
colonial rule huge disparities in income, land distribution, participation in the labour market 
and access to services. Since independence, Namibia has enjoyed political stability and 
steady economic growth, achieving the status of a middle-income country.  
</p>
<p>5. While the Gross Domestic Product has increased considerably, the poorest sectors of 
Namibian society have not benefited equally; the benefits of economic growth have not 
trickled down to the poor. According to official estimates, 29 per cent of the population live 
below the poverty line and 15.3 per cent are severely poor.1 When assessing vulnerability to 
poverty, most recent estimates indicate that almost half the population is at risk of falling 
into poverty.2 
</p>
<p>6. Although during the past two decades subsequent Governments have recognized the 
need to address endemic inequality, there has been little progress since independence and 
Namibia remains one of the most unequal countries in the world.3 Poverty is particularly 
widespread in rural communities, where 62 per cent of Namibians reside. People living in

</p>
<p>rural areas are twice as likely to be poor compared to those in urban areas and the incidence 
of severe poverty in rural areas is almost three times higher than in urban areas.4 
</p>
<p>7. Despite considerable budgetary investment towards public services over the years,5 
the accessibility and quality of public services essential for the enjoyment of rights such as 
health and education remains questionable for a large percentage of the population, 
particularly those living in rural areas and those belonging to marginalized groups (such as 
people living with HIV/AIDS, persons with disabilities and minority language groups). The 
limited access to services in rural areas is particularly disconcerting, as poverty in Namibia 
correlates positively with distance to facilities and access to services.6 
</p>
<p>8. While acknowledging the compounded challenges faced by Namibia &#8211; including the 
problematic legacies of apartheid and the fact that Namibia has one of the world&#8217;s lowest 
population densities &#8211; much more can be done to comply with obligations in respect of 
economic, social and cultural rights. In particular, given the country&#8217;s rich natural 
</p>
<p>resources, the State must ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential 
levels of enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Constitution of the Republic of Namibia (1990) enshrines in chapter 3 a list of 
&#8220;Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms&#8221;. However, this Bill of Rights includes mainly 
civil and political rights. Economic, social and cultural rights are referred to in Chapter 11 
as &#8220;Principles of State Policy&#8221; (Art. 95) and are not justiciable.   
</p>
<p>10. Nonetheless, as a State party to the core United Nations Human Rights treaties, such 
as the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on 
the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child  and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Namibia 
is under the obligation to ensure the realization of several economic social and cultural 
rights for all Namibians, without discrimination of any kind. 
</p>
<p>11. While Namibia has a monist approach to the domestication of international treaties 
(art. 144 of the Constitution), this has not been translated into practice. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that without legislative transposition the realization of human 
rights remains incomplete and depends on legal interpretation by the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>12. In addition to its constitutional and international obligations, Namibia has adopted a 
robust legal framework for the protection of rights that includes the Racial Discrimination 
Prohibition Act, Affirmative Action (Employment) Act, Married Persons Equality Act and 
Combating of Domestic Violence Act, Social Security Act and Education Act. However the 
Special Rapporteur observes that there are huge gaps between laws and policies and their 
implementation and monitoring. The challenges in implementation are major obstacles in 
the enjoyment of rights by the Namibian population. 
</p>
<p>13. The Constitution and legislation also establish important institutions for the 
protection of rights. Prominently, the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate allegations 
concerning the violations of fundamental human rights and to protect, promote and enhance 
respect for human rights in the country. While the Ombudsman Office enjoys an &#8220;A&#8221; status 
accreditation by the International Coordination Committee of National Human Rights

</b></p>
<p>Institutions, concerns have been raised with regard to the low number of human rights 
complaints received, its limited presence outside the capital and the low level of 
compliance by the Government with its recommendations. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the initiative of the Ombudsman to develop a Human Rights Action Plan. 
Nonetheless, she is concerned that the mandate of the Ombusdman to investigate human 
rights violations only refers to rights contained in the Namibian Bill of Rights, which 
exclude most economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>14. The Anti-Corruption Commission, established in 2006,7 is an independent and 
impartial body empowered to receive, initiate and investigate allegations of corruption. 
While Namibia has adopted anti-corruption legislation and has ratified several regional and 
international anti-corruption instruments, reports received by the Special Rapporteur 
indicate that corruption is on the rise in Namibia. Moreover, there is a gap in the legislative 
framework with regard to access to information, protection of whistle-blowers, and 
transparency and accountability of the public sector, particularly in relation to the interface 
between the Government and the private sector.  
</p>
<p>15. The development vision and strategies have been incorporated into the country&#8217;s 
long-term vision: &#8220;Vision 2030&#8221; (2004) and the Fourth National Development Plan (NDP4) 
(2012/2013 to 2016/2017). The development strategies have been aligned to the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and acknowledge the State&#8217;s 
commitment to uphold the Constitution, good governance and the strengthening of human 
rights.8 However, the Government&#8217;s implementation of these strategies is not succeeding in 
reversing the ever-widening gap between rich and poor in Namibia. During her mission the 
Special Rapporteur identified implementation gaps in almost all aspects of poverty 
reduction and development strategies. The absence of time-bound benchmarks, effective 
accountability and monitoring mechanisms, and a substantial skills gap in service provision 
have resulted in inefficient government spending, limited implementation and 
unsatisfactory results in the key areas for the enjoyment of rights such as education, health, 
housing and land reform and social protection strategies, which are analysed in the 
following sections.  
</p>
<p>16. Despite several positive initiatives (such as the consultation on the Child Protection 
Bill and the Participatory Poverty Assessment (2003-2006)), Namibia has not put in place 
the necessary structures to facilitate participation by people living in poverty in decision-
making processes for the monitoring of the implementation of public policies and 
programmes. Meaningful participation of people living in poverty in Namibia is also 
hampered by the concentration of decision-making and resources in the capital. Despite the 
fact that Namibia has been undergoing a decentralization policy since 1998, this process 
has been slow and limited.9 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Groups particularly vulnerable to poverty 
</b></p>
<p>17. Although poverty is widespread, several groups are particularly vulnerable to 
poverty and social exclusion. The subsections below summarize the human rights concerns 
regarding some of these groups.

</p>
<p>18. Despite the fact that indigenous groups are particularly vulnerable to poverty in 
Namibia, in the spirit of coordination and collaboration between human right mechanisms, 
this section does not provide an analysis of their situation and should be complemented 
with the report of the Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Peoples (A/HRC/24/41/Add.1), 
who also visited the country in 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Women 
</b></p>
<p>19. Namibia provides robust legal protection for women through its Constitution and 
legislation10 and the National Gender Policy provides mechanisms and guidelines for all 
relevant stakeholders to facilitate gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment in 
implementing developmental policies and programmes.  
</p>
<p>20. Despite the positive institutional and legal framework, women in Namibia continue 
to be economically and socially marginalized. Women are 1.23 times more likely to be poor 
than men and they are disproportionately affected by unemployment, HIV/AIDS and lack 
of access to land.11 A combination of several structural causes, including legislation, macro-
economic policies and discriminatory cultural practices is limiting women&#8217;s entitlements in 
terms of access to land, credit facilities and public services, as well as their participation in 
public life. In addition their economic marginalization is perpetuated and they are prevented 
from enjoying their human rights on an equal footing with Namibian men. 
</p>
<p>21. In many spheres of life, and especially under customary law, women are still subject 
to unequal treatment due to traditional attitudes and gender stereotyping.  The Communal 
Land Reform Act (2002), which aimed to increase women&#8217;s access to communal land, has 
had a positive impact by repealing previously discriminatory customary practice which 
prevented widows from remaining on communal land allocated to their deceased husbands. 
However the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, according to information received, the 
implementation of the Act in rural areas is limited, hampering its effectiveness. Moreover, 
the Act failed to address the issue of &#8220;property grabbing&#8221;, i.e. the removal of moveable 
assets that belonged to the deceased husband, which limits the ability of women to make 
productive use of the land.12 Equally concerning is that, despite the great number of women 
married under customary law, the Equal Marriage Act does not apply to customary 
marriage.   
</p>
<p>22. Evidence suggests that the neglect of women&#8217;s rights has continued despite more 
than two decades of independence, with maternal mortality remaining exceptionally high 
and with virtually no progress in this regard.13 Inequitable access to health services as well 
as the HIV epidemic have played a part in the virtual doubling of maternal mortality from 
271 in 2000 to 449 in 2006/7.14 This is a tragic and totally preventable reality.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the insufficient coverage of 
basic emergency obstetric care facilities, especially in the northern regions of Namibia.15

<p>Although Namibia has made tremendous progress towards ensuring that all mothers receive 
good antenatal care and have skilled birth attendants, access to postnatal care remains more 
limited, particularly in rural areas.16  
</p>
<p>24. Considering that complications of abortion is the second most important cause (20.7 
per cent) of maternal mortality, the limited legalization of abortion and the complicated 
administrative process for obtaining approval for abortion are extremely concerning, 
particularly as this disproportionately affects poor women. The Special Rapporteur calls on 
the Government to address the fact that when women are forced to undertake illegal 
interventions, they face an increased risk of maternal mortality.17 The criminalization of 
abortion has also been linked to the increasing phenomenon of infanticide and baby 
dumping,18 making it an urgent priority for the State to reassess its policy, ensuring that the 
right to life of all women, without discrimination of any kind, is protected. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is also alarmed by incidents of forced sterilization of women 
who are HIV positive.19 Poor women are particularly at risk of unwanted medical 
intervention, given that they have less access to information and legal recourse. During her 
visit the Special Rapporteur met with three women whose cases of forced sterilization have 
recently been brought before the courts. She was disturbed by the fact that the Government 
has appealed the case on the basis of a technicality, especially given that the main 
motivation of these women is for the Government to take active measures to stop the 
generalized practice of forced sterilization of women.   
</p>
<p>26. The socio-economic inequality of women and girls and some negative cultural 
practices are at the root of widespread gender-based violence in Namibia, which is a grave 
and persisting human rights concern.  Poverty is both a contributing factor to, and a result 
of, gender-based violence. Women&#8217;s lower economic status and lack of economic 
autonomy create relationships of dependence and increase their vulnerability to abusive 
relationships, poverty, social exclusion and disempowerment.  
</p>
<p>27. While Namibia has put in place a strong legal framework to address the various 
forms of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation,20 ineffective implementation 
prevents Namibian women from enjoying their rights to life, security of person, and bodily 
integrity. Studies indicate that many female victims of violence experience continuing 
problems when turning to the police, including unsympathetic police attitudes, slow 
response times, failure to follow up on complaints, and inadequate investigations.21  
</p>
<p>28. There are currently 15 Women and Child Protection Units, intended as specialized 
police units, which can provide sensitive responses to gender-based violence. However, 
these units suffer from training shortcomings, frequent transfer of personnel, lack of 
adequate transport, lack of support and supervision for staff, staff shortages and lack of 
adequate facilities and equipment. There are currently only a few temporary shelters and 
places of safety in the country and risk assessments are not undertaken at an early stage. 
The implementation of the Combating of Domestic Violence Act 2003 has also

<p>encountered administrative difficulties. Significant problems have been identified with the 
processes of application for and serving of Protection Orders as well as compliance with 
their provisions.22 
</p>
<p>29. Economic dependency on men and discriminatory cultural practices lead to high 
rates of adolescent pregnancies (15 per cent of women aged 15-19). Adolescent pregnancies 
are strongly correlated with a mother&#8217;s educational attainment, household wealth and 
regional location.23 Teenage pregnancy in turn leads to early school dropouts and reinforces 
a vicious cycle of economic and social disempowerment. Despite this disturbing trend, 
counselling on reproductive health issues is often not available for adolescents and youth. It 
is reported that the measures taken by the Government have been insufficient to address the 
problem. For example, the uptake of the Health Promoting School Initiative implemented 
by the Ministry of Health and Social Services has been uneven and weak.24 
</p>
<p><b> B. Children 
</b></p>
<p>30. Namibia has a relatively youthful population, with 37.2 per cent of the population 
under 15 years of age and only 6.6 per cent over 60.25 It is therefore of grave concern that 
children are disproportionately affected by poverty and malnutrition. About 34.4 per cent of 
children in Namibia live in poverty26 and households with children are 77 per cent more 
likely to be poor compared to households without children.27 When assessing the 
multidimensional aspects of poverty (such as material deprivation and lack of access to 
basic utilities), poverty is even more widespread.   
</p>
<p>31. Child poverty undermines the capacity of children to survive, develop and thrive and 
impedes the realization of their human rights, particularly the right to survival and 
development (see Convention on the Rights of the Child, art. 6). Poverty prevents children 
from enjoying equal opportunities and undermines family and community environments, 
leaving children vulnerable to exploitation, violence and discrimination. Poverty in 
childhood is also a root cause of poverty in adulthood. 
</p>
<p>32. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) has estimated that up to 40 per cent 
of children are undernourished to some degree, and moderate or severe stunting appears to 
have increased in recent years. Children&#8217;s nutrition status is directly linked to the health and 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic situation of the mother as well as to geography.28 Malnutrition is a 
significant cause of child mortality and Namibia is not on track to achieve Millennium

problems, including the 2010 Road Map for Acceleration of the Reduction of Maternal and 
Neonatal Mortality, A Promise Renewed, the scaling up of the Anti-Retroviral Treatment 
and Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV programmes and the School 
Feeding Programme.  
</p>
<p>34. Violence against children remains widespread, including sexual violence. Four out 
of ten rape cases involve the rape of a child and over 25 per cent of children under 12 have 
been forced to have sexual intercourse.30 The response of the legal and child protection 
system, in particular in cases of sexual violence against children, remains inadequate. 
Improvements are necessary in a variety of areas, from the availability and functioning of 
the Women and Child Protection Units, to the number of social workers, public awareness 
raising and police training. </p>
<p>35. Under its human rights obligations, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, Namibia has the obligation to protect and promote the rights of all children in its 
territory, without discrimination of any kind and irrespective of the sex, race, national 
origin, ethnicity or other status of the child or their parent. Despite significant budgetary 
investment,31 considerable gaps remain in both coverage and quality of basic services for 
children, with large socio-economic and geographical variations in access and significant 
challenges in quality. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur witnessed serious gaps in 
basic public service provision for poor children, children living in rural areas, non-
registered children, children with disabilities, children living with HIV/AIDS, orphans and 
children born to non-Namibian parents 
</p>
<p>36. The situation of orphans is particularly concerning. Namibia has a large growing 
number of orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs), mainly as a result of the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic.32  The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that Namibia has developed a system of 
alternative care and seeks, as far as possible, to keep a child within his or her social context, 
before options of removal to a residential facility or for adoption are considered. However, 
problems occur in coordination of services, training and support of staff. Lack of trained 
social workers, heavy workloads and time-consuming administrative tasks impact on the 
effectiveness and quality of services provided to orphans and vulnerable children. Facilities 
for children in need, such as places of safety or children&#8217;s homes are also in short supply.33 
</p>
<p>37. Every child has the right to a legal identity, as laid out in the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and stated in the Namibian Constitution. Without a birth certificate, 
children encounter difficulties in enrolling in school, receiving health care or child welfare 
grants. To ensure that children enjoy their rights, it is vital to register children at birth.  In 
2007 only around two-thirds of children had their births registered, with the poorest 
children almost half as likely to have been registered compared with children from the 
richest quintile.

</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur welcomes recent progress made by the Government towards 
ensuring universalization of birth registration. However, further efforts are needed to ensure 
that the poorest children, including those living in the most isolated areas, are registered. 
Furthermore, the Birth Marriage and Death Registration Act of 1963, which regulates birth 
registration, is outdated and inadequate. It should be modified as a matter of priority with 
the aim of facilitating the registration of children.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned with the status of orphan children 
born in Namibia to parents of Angolan origin. Many of these children are not registered at 
birth and have no proof of parentage and therefore are at risk of statelessness as they cannot 
demonstrate that they are Namibian or have acquired Angolan or another nationality by 
descent. These children are unable to receive any benefits or access public services. She 
notes that the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness establishes a range of 
standards to prevent statelessness at birth and later in life; thus it is of central importance to 
full enjoyment of every child&#8217;s right to acquire a nationality under the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the progress made in the drafting of the Child 
Care and Protection Bill and the extensive public consultation process undertaken. The Bill 
will provide mechanisms for the care and protection of Namibian children which are sorely 
lacking today, such as the recognition of kinship care and child-headed households, the 
regulation of alternative care, and protection of children against trafficking abuse and 
exploitation. Nonetheless, she regrets that the Bill has yet to be adopted. The enacting of 
this long-awaited Bill will be a crucial step towards securing children&#8217;s rights in Namibia.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Persons with disabilities   
</b></p>
<p>41. According to the information available, approximately 5 per cent of Namibians live 
with a disability and the majority of persons with disabilities live in rural areas. They have 
significantly less access to education, employment opportunities, information, health 
facilities and transport and are disproportionately impacted by poverty. Unemployment is 
higher among persons with disabilities,34 who are more highly represented amongst unpaid 
family workers and the self-employed, are underrepresented amongst the private and public 
sectors and have lower incomes.35  
</p>
<p>42. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that Namibia has ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol, it has not 
done enough to implement it in practice. Moreover, it has not yet submitted its first report 
to its supervisory body. The 1997 National Disability Policy has not been amended 
following the ratification of the Convention, and its implementation has been partial. There 
is a lack of coordination amongst the Ministries with responsibility for the design, 
implementation and evaluation of disability services. The National Disability Council was 
only appointed in 2008 and reportedly is not receiving the necessary budget for its 
operations.   
</p>
<p>43. Moreover, there is a lack of updated and disaggregated data on the characteristics 
and needs of this section of the population, thus preventing public policies from effectively 
reaching and addressing the needs of persons with disabilities. While the legal system 
addresses some issues of discrimination against persons with disabilities, particularly in the

<p>workplace,36 the regulatory framework remains inadequate and the existing legislation is 
not effectively implemented. A major concern is the limited access for persons with 
disabilities to public buildings, public transport and information, in contravention of the 
obligations assumed under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (art. 
9). Moreover, the negative attitudes of the community towards people with disabilities are 
an additional barrier preventing persons with disabilities from enjoying their human rights 
on an equal footing with the rest of society. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about reports that, according to 
unofficial estimates, as many as 50 per cent of children with disabilities never attend 
primary education.37  There are currently only nine schools in Namibia specializing in 
children with disabilities, seven of which are based in Windhoek, and the integration of 
children with disabilities in regular schools is hampered by a lack of accessible facilities 
and inadequate teacher training.38 While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the recently 
drafted National Inclusive Education Policy, currently pending adoption by the Cabinet, she 
calls on the State to take immediate measures to ensure access to education for children 
with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>45. Namibia is to be commended for putting in place a social grant system for persons 
with disabilities. However, as indicated below, the grant consistently fails to reach the 
majority of beneficiaries39 and the value of the grant remains too low to meet their needs.  
</p>
<p><b> D. People living with HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>46. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is the most pressing health issue in Namibia, which is one 
of the 10 countries most affected by HIV/AIDS in the world.40 HIV prevalence contributes 
to the high maternal mortality rate, as well as infant and child mortality. The epidemic has a 
disproportionate impact on women, and poor women are particularly vulnerable to HIV 
infection.41 Women&#8217;s economic marginalization forces them to depend on men and 
increases the likelihood of involvement in transactional and inter-generational sex, both of 
which are key drivers of the epidemic.42   
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the significant programmes implemented to 
alleviate the epidemic, such as the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission and Anti-
Retroviral Therapy programmes, which achieved high levels of coverage and positive 
impact. She also welcomes the newly adopted National Strategic Framework for HIV and 
AIDS 2010/11-2015/16, which sets ambitious new universal access targets and prioritizes 
HIV prevention.

</p>
<p>48. Nevertheless, the scale-up and effectiveness of the national response is hindered by 
the weak institutional setup and functioning of multisectoral coordination mechanisms 
within the Ministry of Health and Social Services and among civil society organizations, 
private sector and development partners. Moreover, the voice of people living with 
HIV/AIDS is not adequately incorporated in national, regional and local coordination and 
oversight mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>49. Namibia has put in place a strong legislative framework and policies to deal with 
stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. However, according to 
information received, implementation of such policies falls short and people living with 
HIV/AIDS continue to face stigma and discrimination in their communities, workplaces 
and when accessing public services. The Special Rapporteur received disturbing 
testimonies of stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV by health workers 
in clinics and hospitals and of failure to respect their right to privacy. She also received 
information on high levels of unemployment among people living with HIV/AIDS, 
including those who had lost their jobs due to their HIV/AIDS status.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Sex workers  
</b></p>
<p>50. The criminalization of sex work in Namibia lies at the foundation of a climate of 
stigma, discrimination and violence surrounding sex work. During her visit, the Special 
Rapporteur heard testimonies from sex workers of recurring police abuse and high levels of 
violence, including the confiscation of condoms, arbitrary detention and rape. Such abuse 
severely compromises sex workers&#8217; personal safety as well as their right to equal protection 
of the law. Moreover, it creates a climate of impunity that fosters further violence and 
discrimination against sex workers in the community at large.  
</p>
<p>51. Stigma, discrimination and violence often discourage sex workers from accessing 
public services, particularly health care, thereby violating their rights as well as hampering 
efforts to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS.43  It also discourages them from seeking justice 
and redress when their rights are violated. The discrimination that they suffer is also often 
evident in other spheres such as education and employment. 
</p>
<p>52. Particularly concerning is the lack of access by sex workers to comprehensive sexual 
and reproductive health services, including access to safe and legal abortion.44 
</p>
<p>53. Due to these multifaceted human rights violations, sex workers remain 
disproportionately affected by HIV.45 The Special Rapporteur welcomes the National 
Strategic Framework for HIV and AIDS 2010/11-2015/16, which identifies sex workers as 
a priority; however, the information on the extent of sex work in Namibia and the needs and 
challenges faced by sex workers remains limited. There are no national guidelines for 
effective, rights-based programming for this sector of the population. In line with its human 
rights obligations, Namibia is obliged to provide all persons equal and effective protection 
of the law and take measures to prevent and combat indirect systemic discrimination on the 
form of legal rules, policies, practices or predominant cultural attitudes in either the public

<p>or private sector which create relative disadvantages for some groups in the enjoyment of 
their rights.46 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges in the realization of specific rights by people 
living in poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>54. Education is a human right and a vehicle for empowerment, by which economically 
and socially marginalized groups, particularly children, can lift themselves out of poverty 
and obtain the means to participate fully in their local communities and broader economic 
and public life. This is clearly illustrated in Namibia, where poverty is declining alongside 
an increase in educational attainment.47 
</p>
<p>55. The Constitution of Namibia (article 20) and the Education Act of 2001 guarantee 
the right of every citizen in Namibia to free compulsory primary education. Since 
independence, Namibia has achieved impressive results in primary school enrolment rates 
and is on track to achieve Millennium Development Goal 2 by 2015.48 Namibia is also to be 
commended for the significant and consistent levels of investment in the education sector 
since independence. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, despite the 
significant investment in education, the education system remains of poor quality and lags 
behind in international rankings. Investment has not translated into good quality education 
for all, a fundamental element of the right to education.49 While low educational outcomes 
are in part a legacy of the colonial era, independent Namibia has not managed to address 
these weaknesses significantly in the last two decades. 
</p>
<p>56. The inequitable distribution of wealth and income mirrors inequalities in education. 
Urban children from relatively wealthy and well-educated families are performing better at 
primary school and therefore achieving greater access to secondary school and subsequent 
economic opportunities than children from rural, remote and less well-off families.50 
Several factors, such as distance from schools in rural areas, lack of available and 
affordable transportation, and costs of uniform and materials, often impede access to 
education and contribute to significant dropout rates and low educational outcomes, 
particularly for the poorest and most marginalized children.  
</p>
<p>57. Despite the fact that the Government has identified the lack of infrastructure and 
qualified teachers as barriers to improving the quality of education,51 severe gaps in school 
infrastructure and availability of schooling materials persist. Many schools, particularly in 
disadvantaged areas, are in a bad state, lacking sanitation facilities, equipment and

</p>
<p>materials.52 According to information received, education outcomes are additionally 
hampered by an insufficient teacher-student ratio and poor teacher training. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the limited implementation of the 
Language Policy for schools.53 The lack of teachers and teaching materials in minority 
languages means that marginalized groups, such as the San, are not able to receive 
instruction in their mother tongue,54 in contravention of international human rights 
principles.55 The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Ministry of Education&#8217;s recent pledge56 
to supply textbooks to all Namibian children by the end of 2013. However, she stresses the 
importance of ensuring that textbooks are available in minority languages.  
</p>
<p>59. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur expressed particular concern with regard to 
the negative impact of the School Development Fund (SDF) scheme on the enjoyment of 
the right to education. Therefore, she welcomes a recent decision by the Ministry of 
Education to eliminate the SDF and its commitment to providing schools with the necessary 
fund from State budget. This is indeed a very positive development. Nonetheless, she 
stresses that the elimination of the SDF is not sufficient in itself to enable the most 
disadvantaged children to enjoy their right to quality education, and that to this end 
comprehensive measures must be taken.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>60. In recent years, Namibia has made a substantive investment in public health. The 
improvement of public health outcomes is a core component of the country&#8217;s development 
</p>
<p>strategy and in the 2012/13 national budget the health sector received the second largest 
share of the budget.57 The Government has also recently scaled up institutions and 
programmes to address maternal, infant, and under-five mortality rate, as well as the 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS.58   
</p>
<p>61. However, Namibia continues to face significant public health challenges, 
particularly a high maternal and infant mortality ratio and prevalence of communicable 
diseases, in particular HIV and tuberculosis. Life expectancy and maternal mortality are at 
the same levels as at independence.59 
</p>
<p>62. The enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of health varies 
considerably depending on socio-economic status and geographic location. Stark 
inequalities exist between rich and poor in access to health services. For example, 98 per 
cent of births of the wealthiest 20 per cent of the population are attended by skilled health 
personnel by comparison with 60 per cent for the poorest 20 per cent. Under-5 mortality is

<p>also substantively lower in the wealthiest 20 per cent.60 The persistent inequalities in access 
to and quality of health services between regions and socio-economic groups are 
particularly disturbing. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the limited accessibility and affordability 
of health services61 due to the policy of imposing &#8220;user fees&#8221; in the public health-care 
system. While health user fees are seemingly low (between 4-8 Namibia dollars), for the 
poorest segments of the population the payment of even the smallest user fee poses an 
insurmountable barrier to accessing health-care services, especially as this cost comes on 
top of transportation and other indirect costs that they have to bear to reach health centres. 
Although a waiver system exists, it is inconsistently implemented and poor people 
(including people living with HIV/AIDS) are often stigmatized or refused adequate 
treatment on the basis of their inability to pay the fees. Given the regressive nature of the 
user fee system, abolishing it may be a direct way to increase access to health services for 
the most disadvantaged segments of society and to diminish the existing inequalities in 
health service provision.  
</p>
<p>64. The inequality in the enjoyment of the right to health is also reflected in the severe 
gaps in institutional capacity as well as the shortage of skilled health-care professionals, 
particularly in rural by comparison with urban areas.62 There is a disproportionately large 
number of health-care facilities and health workers in urban areas as compared to rural 
areas (76 per cent of doctors work in urban areas as compared to 24 per cent in rural areas). 
There is also a significant misdistribution of health human resources between private and 
public health services.63 Substantial differences in geographical distances to medical 
facilities exist between urban and rural areas, and transport costs to health-care services 
have been identified as a major limiting factor for low-income and poor people in accessing 
health services.64  
</p>
<p>65. Information received by the Special Rapporteur also suggests that health-care 
personnel often lack appropriate training, discriminate against vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups such as persons living with HIV/AIDS and sex workers, and that 
there are no effective accountability mechanisms when they fail to respect the rights of 
patients, such as the right to informed consent and confidentiality or to address dishonest or 
unlawful practices such as a high level of absenteeism and requests for illegal payments. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about information received on the 
obstacles that particular groups such as prisoners and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual 
(LGBT) persons encounter in accessing condoms, a situation that is hampering their 
enjoyment of their right to health.

</p>
<p><b> C. Right to adequate housing and access to land 
</b></p>
<p>67. Given that most Namibians live in rural areas65  and depend on subsistence farming, 
access to land is a precondition for poverty reduction. While acknowledging that at 
independence Namibia had massive levels of land dispossession affecting the black 
majority, the Special Rapporteur notes that land reform has been a slow and ineffective 
processes and the criteria for selection of beneficiaries has been unclear and complicated. 
While the Affirmative Action Loan Scheme provides financial support to buy farms, lack of 
farming skills and shortage of capital has resulted in reduced productivity.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the need to support the poor by improving 
access to land is articulated in several official documents; however, the allocation of land 
seems not to have been among the Government&#8217;s priorities in poverty alleviation efforts.66 
</p>
<p>69. Since independence the Government has implemented several housing programmes 
(e.g. Build Together Programme), and has set up institutions to facilitate further 
development of affordable housing (e.g. National Housing Enterprise). A National Housing 
Policy has been in place since 1991 and was reviewed and updated in 2009. Despite these 
notable policies and programmes, implementation has been slow and ineffective. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Government&#8217;s housing delivery has failed to keep 
</p>
<p>up with demand and that housing delivery has actually substantially declined in recent 
years, while the housing deficit is at an all-time high, with an estimated backlog of over 
80,000 houses.67  Moreover, housing provision has failed to reach the poorest segments of 
society as the housing provided by Government initiatives is usually too expensive for most 
Namibians. Affordability of housing is one of the core elements of the right to adequate 
housing, which the State is failing to comply with.68  
</p>
<p>70. One of the key challenges in housing delivery in Namibia is the lack of available 
serviced land,69 which is both slowing down the process of housing delivery and pushing up 
prices of serviced land. The limited availability of serviced land is mainly due to a lengthy 
and outdated approval process for proclamation, surveying, subdivision and registration of 
land, limited financial capacity and a lack of surveyors and other qualified personnel at 
local levels.   
</p>
<p>71. The housing deficit, together with the limited access to land and the increased 
urbanization process, has resulted in the expansion of informal settlements in urban areas. 
The majority of the urban poor in Namibia are now living in 235 informal settlements 
where over 120,000 households reside.70 During her visit, the Special Rapporteur visited 
several informal settlements, in Windhoek and Keetmanshoop, where she witnessed the 
acutely precarious situation of one quarter of the Namibian population. The residents of 
informal settlements are forced to live in overcrowded shacks built with corrugated iron or 
plastic, without adequate protection against the weather, insufficient access to electricity

public services.   
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent adoption of the Flexible Land Tenure 
Act to enable poor households to secure tenure. However, security of tenure is only one 
aspect of the right to adequate housing. In order to address the issue of informal settlements 
and national housing shortage, the broader aspects of the right to adequate housing need to 
be addressed in a holistic and coordinated manner. These include issues of affordability, 
accessibility, location, habitability, security of tenure and availability of adequate public 
services and employment opportunities.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to work 
</b></p>
<p>73. Recent economic growth has not translated into job opportunities for the majority of 
the population, particularly the young. Unemployment rates have increased for the past two 
decades, reaching a startling level of 51.2 per cent by 2008.71  
</p>
<p>74. The impact of unemployment is also very unequal. While it remains high across the 
whole country, the situation is particularly grave in rural areas, where almost half of the 
population is unemployed, as compared to less than a third of the urban population.72 
Unemployment also disproportionately affects women, youth73 and persons with 
disabilities.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment of the Government to directly 
tackle the unemployment crises. Nonetheless, she remains concerned about the ability of 
the recently adopted Targeted Intervention Program for Employment and Economic 
Growth (TIPEEG) to ensure the creation of sustainable decent work for all. Despite 
extensive budget allocation to the programme, it has already encountered implementation 
problems due to institutional and capacity constraints.74 Moreover, most of its 
implementation to date has concentrated on infrastructure development through public 
works programmes. These programmes are likely to generate only a limited number of 
sustainable jobs and will not address the needs of the unskilled labour force and subsistence 
farmers. She is also concerned at reports which suggest that the programme was not 
designed with the participation of its intended beneficiaries and does not address the 
specific challenges to employment faced by women, despite the fact that women&#8217;s 
unemployment rates exceed those of their male counterparts in almost all age groups.  
</p>
<p>76. In line with its human rights obligations, Namibia not only has the obligation to take 
specific measures to expand opportunities for persons living in poverty to find decent work 
in the formal labour market, including through vocational guidance and training and skills 
development opportunities, but also to ensure that all workers are paid a wage sufficient to 
enable them and their families to have access to an adequate standard of living and enjoy 
just and favourable working conditions. To achieve this end, it is necessary to establish an

<p>appropriate legal framework including minimum wage legislation, as well as sufficiently 
resourced labour inspectors.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to social security 
</b></p>
<p>77. Namibia stands out as being one of the few African countries providing non-
contributory social grants for some of the most vulnerable segments of society such as older 
persons, persons with disabilities and orphans. Over the past decade it has considerably 
expanded the social grant system, both in terms of coverage and value.75 Undoubtedly, the 
social security system has a substantive impact on reducing poverty in Namibia.76  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur particularly welcomes the universal non-contributory old 
age grant, which not only enables compliance with human rights obligations towards older 
persons, but is also having a positive impact on child poverty.77  
</p>
<p>79. Despite these major achievements, due to problems in the design and 
implementation of the social protection system, some of those most in need of social 
protection have been consistently excluded from receiving the benefits that they are entitled 
to. Additional measures to improve the design and implementation of the non-contributory 
system and to remove barriers that prevent the poorest and most marginalized sectors of 
society from enjoying their right to social security must be taken as a matter of priority.78 
</p>
<p>80. According to information available, eligible persons cannot access State grants 
because of a myriad of barriers, such as lack of information, geographical distance from 
registration offices or distribution centres and administrative barriers. The Special 
Rapporteur is particularly concerned by the fact that some documentation requirements, 
such as birth and death certificates, hospital certification of disability and cumbersome 
application processes are excluding many of those who are most in need.79   
</p>
<p>81. A lack of coordination and the fragmentation of the social protection system are also 
limiting its impact and preventing the most vulnerable from accessing it. Moreover, this 
unnecessarily increases administrative costs that could be better used to expand coverage. 
Problems with the identification and targeting of eligible beneficiaries are also a cause for 
concern as many people living in extreme poverty are not reached through the existing 
programmes. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the negative impact of 
the means testing methodology applied in some of the grants, with the result that the 
poorest sector of society is not being reached. The limited coverage of the grant for persons 
with disabilities is also a cause for concern. According to official estimates the grants only 
reach 22 per cent of eligible beneficiaries.80    
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the limited targeted approach of the 
child welfare grant system. As the grant is designed to benefit only orphans, children with 
disabilities and children in foster care, it has been ineffective in addressing the high level of 
</p>
<p>  
 75  For example the coverage of grants for orphans and vulnerable children has expanded more than 
</p>
<p>tenfold from 2002 to 2010 &#8211; Ministry of Finance, Government Accountability Report 2010-2011. 
 76  In the absence of any grants, the child poverty rate would be 61.9 per cent instead of 38.9 per cent &#8211;

<p>poverty and vulnerability among children in the country. While child welfare grants provide 
essential support for orphans and some vulnerable children, the broader group of extremely 
poor children cared for by impoverished parents is excluded. The social protection system 
should cover equally all children living in poor households.81 
</p>
<p>83. Information received about the significant delays in the implementation of the Foster 
Care Grant are also concerning.82 The cumbersome application and approval process as 
well as social services staff constraints are disproportionately impacting the most 
marginalized families. Given that the majority of orphans are cared for within their 
extended families, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative to simplify the process, 
as integrated into the draft Child Care and Protection Bill and calls for its immediate 
implementation.  
</p>
<p>84. The low levels of the grants available should also be revised. In most cases, the grant 
is too low to enable beneficiaries to cover basic needs and enjoy a minimum standard of 
living. The level of most of the grants has declined due to inflation as they have not been 
adjusted in line with increasing costs of living. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the Government is aware of some these 
problems and is considering ways to effectively tackle them. In this regard, she welcomes 
the commitment made in NDP4 for a universal child grant that would progressively include 
all children. A universal child grant will ensure that all children are provided with equal 
protection against poverty and vulnerability and will significantly contribute to closing 
equality gaps between children.  
</p>
<p>86. She also calls on the Government to assess the positive impacts of the Basic Income 
Grant pilot that has been implemented in the Otjivero settlement for the past three years. 
During her visit, the Special Rapporteur visited the Otjivero community, where she 
witnessed the positive outcomes of the Basic Income Grant in reducing poverty, improving 
access to health and education, diminishing crime and increasing social cohesion. She 
commends the efforts of Namibian civil society organizations in initiating and 
implementing this project and calls on the Government to study the viability of extending a 
Basic Income Grant throughout the country.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Obligations of international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>87. In terms of economic growth Namibia now enjoys the status of a middle income 
country. As a result, aid flows have continued to decline in recent years and several 
bilateral donors have stopped their activity in the country. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that the high level of inequality and the 
substantive institutional and capacity challenges in Namibia necessitate continued support 
from the international community, particularly with regard to capacity-building and skills 
development.  
</p>
<p>89. Moreover, in the face of limited resources, donors should strengthen coordination, in 
the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and ensure that the Government of 
Namibia has ownership and leadership in the development process.

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and final recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Recognizing the immense levels of inequality that existed at independence as a 
legacy of colonial rule, and the compounded challenges faced by Namibia </b>&#8211;<b> including 
</b></p>
<p>the fact that Namibia has one of the world&#8217;s lowest population densities &#8211;<b> the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur notes that since independence, progress in the reduction of inequality has 
</b></p>
<p><b>not been fast enough and unacceptable levels of inequality persist along the lines of 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender, race, region, ethnicity and class.  While a number of poverty reduction goals 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been reached (such as an increase in primary and secondary school enrolment), 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappointing outcomes in some key policies are disproportionately impacting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of rights by the poorest segments of the population.   
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The report includes recommendations in each of its sections, but the Special 
Rapporteur would like to especially urge Namibia to take the following steps to
