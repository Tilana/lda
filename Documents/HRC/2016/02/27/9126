</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,

</p>
<p> <i>Bearing</i> <i>in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights on the adverse 
effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the 
enjoyment of human rights, in particular resolutions 1995/81 of 8 March 1995, 2004/17 of 
16 April 2004 and 2005/15 of 14 April 2005,

public participation and the right to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the international community must treat all human rights in a fair and equal 
manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations 
Human Rights Council and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of 
the Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall 
discharge his/her duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly</i> <i>condemns</i> the dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes that 
have a negative impact on human rights; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation</i> the work undertaken by the Special Rapporteur on

relevant United Nations bodies, organizations and the secretariats of relevant international 
conventions, a global, multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems and new 
trends of, and solutions to, the adverse effects of the trafficking and dumping of toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes on human rights, in particular in developing countries, as well as 
in those sharing borders with developed countries, with a view to making concrete 
recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control, reduce and eradicate these 
phenomena; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur, in accordance with his mandate, to include in his 
report to the Council comprehensive information on: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The adverse effects on the full enjoyment of human rights, including in particular

<p> (<i>e</i>) The human rights implications of waste-recycling programmes, the transfer of 
polluting industries, industrial activities and technologies from developed to developing 
countries and their new trends, including e-waste and the dismantling of ships; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The question of ambiguities in international instruments that allow the movement

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reiterates</i> its call to the Secretary-General to continue to make all necessary

</p>
<p><i>22nd meeting 
24 September 2008 
</i></p>
<p>Adopted without a vote. 
</p>
<p><b>9/2.  Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Council on the issue of human rights and international solidarity, including Commission 
resolution 2005/55 and Council resolutions 6/3 and 7/5, and taking note of the reports presented 
by the independent expert on human rights and international solidarity, in particular his latest one 
(A/HRC/9/10), 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights should be 
conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
and of international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in June 1993, 
States pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of 
obstacles to development, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states that 
sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing countries and, as a 
complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective international cooperation is essential 
in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive 
development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account</i> that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually 
and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of 
the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p> <i>Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, friendly 
relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political systems, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the widening gap between the economically developed and developing 
countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the international 
community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its capacities, to 
make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process of 
globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities and 
individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several countries, 
particularly the least developed and the African countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and 
agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a massive 
loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for 
vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated to official 
development assistance, and recalling the pledge of the industrialized countries to allocate 
0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance, and recognizing 
the need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of developing 
countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community 
with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and 
sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity to establish new, equitable and global links of partnership and 
intergenerational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital 
component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the right to 
development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their responsibilities 
towards future generations, and that a better world is possible for present and future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of State 
and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of the fundamental value of 
solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges 
must be managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve 
help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world problems 
through increased international cooperation, to create such conditions as will ensure that the 
needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the past, and to 
hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their development 
endeavours and for the promotion of conditions conducive to the full realization of all human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for States, and 
that it shall be implemented without any conditionality, and on the basis of mutual respect, in full 
compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular 
respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national priorities; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely interrelated with the 
fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the United Nations 
human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing challenges of 
international cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the independent 
expert in his mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by him and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the independent expert to visit their 
countries, to enable him to fulfil his mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a draft 
declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and in further 
developing guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting 
this right, by addressing, inter alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its realization; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all major 
United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic and social 
fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, other 
relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the discharge of his 
mandate; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests </i>the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to prepare inputs to 
contribute to the elaboration of the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity, and to the further development of guidelines, standards, norms and 
principles with a view to promoting and protecting this right; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to submit a report on the implementation of the 
present resolution to the Council at its twelfth session; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to continue its examination of this issue at its twelfth session under agenda 
item 3.

</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>its resolution 4/4 of 30 March 2007 and recalling all Commission on

<p><b>9/4.  Human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Council and the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> its resolution 6/7 of 28 September 2007 and Assembly resolution 62/162 of 
18 December 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the report of the Secretary-General on this issue (A/HRC/9/2), 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing </i>that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to international law, 
international humanitarian law, the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles 
governing peaceful relations among States, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of all 
human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures in the field of 
human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the final document of the Fourteenth Conference of Heads of State or 
Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in September 2006 in Havana and the final 
document of the Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Teheran in 
July 2008, at which the high dignitaries of the Member States agreed to oppose and condemn 
these measures or laws and their continued application, to persevere with efforts to effectively 
reverse them and urged other States to do likewise, as called for by the General Assembly and 
other United Nations organs, and to request States applying these measures or laws to revoke 
them fully and immediately, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 to 
25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with 
international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations 
among States and impedes the full realization of all human rights, and also severely threatens the 
freedom of trade, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the 
General Assembly, the Council, the Commission on Human Rights and at United Nations 
conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms of 
international law and the Charter of the United Nations, unilateral coercive measures continue to 
be promulgated, implemented and enforced, inter alia, by resorting to war and militarism, with 
all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating 
additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under 
the jurisdiction of other States, 
<i> Reaffirming </i>that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the implementation of 
the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Urges </i>all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive measures not in 
accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the 
United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, in 
particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade 
relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments, in particular the 
right of individuals and peoples to development; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects </i>to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in addition, 
threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member States neither to 
recognize these measures nor apply them, and to take effective administrative or legislative 
measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or effects of unilateral 
coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns </i>the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain powers of 
such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, particularly against 
developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from exercising their right to 
decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and social systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates its call </i>upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 
the principles of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, the declarations of the 
United Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions and to commit themselves to 
their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to 
which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such measures; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by virtue of 
which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and 
cultural development; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recalls </i>that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 
the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 
24 October 1970, and according to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States proclaimed by the Assembly in its 
resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32, no State may use or </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce another State in 
order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from 
it advantages of any kind; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms </i>that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be used as 
tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their 
own means of subsistence and development; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines </i>the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles 
to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this regard, calls 
upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the 
extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the principles of free trade and 
hamper the development of developing countries, as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group 
of Experts on the Right to Development in its report on its second session (E/CN.4/1998/29); 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Rejects </i>all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with extraterritorial 
application which are not in conformity with international law; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recognizes </i>that the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the World 
Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly urged States to 
avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the information society; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Invites </i>all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Council in the 
field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due attention, within the scope of their 
respective mandates, to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Decides </i>to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral coercive 
measures in its task concerning the implementation of the right to development; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in discharging her 
functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, to pay due attention and 
give urgent consideration to the present resolution; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all States 
Members of the United Nations and to seek their views and information on the implications and 
negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations, and to submit a report 
thereon to the Council at its twelfth session; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Decides </i>to examine this question, on a priority basis, as appropriate, in accordance 
with its annual programme of work under the same agenda item.

entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in 
particular with regard to race, colour or national origin, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and the 
General Assembly on the protection of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the provisions concerning migrants contained in the outcome documents of 
all major United Nations conferences and summits, 
<i> Considering</i> that every State must ensure the protection of human rights of all individuals 
within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction, without discrimination of any kind, including in 
particular on the basis of national origin, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the judgment of the International Court of Justice of 27 June 2001 and advisory 
opinions OC 16/99 of 1 October 1999 and OC 18/03 of 17 September 2003, issued by the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights, on the right to information on consular assistance in the 
framework of the guarantees of the due process of law and on the juridical condition and rights 
of undocumented migrants, respectively, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the judgment of the International Court of Justice of 31 March 2004 in the 
case of <i>Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of America)</i> and recalling 
the obligations of States reaffirmed therein, as well as in the subsequent rulings of the 
International Court of Justice following that judgment, 
<i> Concerned</i> at the large and growing number of migrants, especially women and children, 
who attempt to cross international borders without the required travel documents, which places 
them in a particularly vulnerable situation, and recognizing the obligation of States to respect the 
human rights of those migrants, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the increasing participation of women in international migration movements, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> at the manifestations of violence, racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and other forms of intolerance and inhuman and degrading treatment against 
migrants, especially women and children, in different parts of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, held 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/208 of 23 December 2003, in New York on 14 and 
15 September 2006, for the purpose of discussing the multidimensional aspects of international 
migration and development, which recognized the relationship between international migration, 
development and human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the adoption of resolution 62/270 by the General Assembly on the Global Forum on 
Migration and Development in which, inter alia, the Assembly recognizes that exchanges of 
information and expertise, consultation and closer cooperation between the Global Forum on 
Migration and Development and the United Nations could have a positive impact, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the role of migrants in positive interaction, particularly in social and cultural 
fields between the countries of migration, and their contribution to the promotion of international 
ties, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving 
societies and their communities of origin and committing to ensure dignified, humane treatment 
with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human rights of 
migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows have increased in the globalized 
economy and take place in a context of new security concerns, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including those that 
refer to the orderly management of migration, should promote holistic approaches that take into 
account the causes and consequences of the phenomenon, the full respect of human rights and 
the fundamental freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved </i>to ensure respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in 
this regard: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Strongly condemns the manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the stereotypes often applied to them, 
and urges States to apply existing laws when xenophobic or intolerant acts or manifestations or 
expressions against migrants occur, in order to eradicate impunity for those who commit 
xenophobic and racist acts; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Requests States to effectively promote and protect the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of all migrants, especially those of women and children, regardless of their 
immigration status, in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
international instruments to which they are party;

<p> (<i>c</i>) Expresses concern at legislation and measures adopted by some States that may 
restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and reaffirms that, when

international human rights law, in order to ensure full respect for the human rights of  
migrants; 
</p>

</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Calls upon States that have not done so to consider signing and ratifying or acceding 
to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families as a matter of priority, and requests the Secretary-General to 
continue his efforts to promote and to raise awareness of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the duty of States to effectively promote and protect the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially those of women and children, regardless of

international instruments to which they are party, and therefore: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Urges all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and 
detention of migrants and to take actions to prevent and punish any form of illegal deprivation of 
liberty of migrants by individuals or groups; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Takes note with appreciation of States that have successfully implemented 
alternative measures to detention for undocumented migrants and requests the Special

 <p> 
</p>

national borders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Reaffirms emphatically the duty of States parties to ensure full respect for and 
observance of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, particularly with regard to the right 
of foreign nationals, regardless of their immigration status, to communicate with a consular 
official of their own State in the case of detention, and the obligation of the State in whose 
territory the detention occurs to inform the foreign national of that right; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Requests all States, in conformity with national legislation and applicable 
international legal instruments to which they are party, to prosecute violations of labour law

</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Encourages all States to remove unlawful obstacles that may prevent the safe, 
unrestricted and expeditious transfer of earnings, assets and pensions of migrants to their country 
of origin or to any other countries, in conformity with applicable legislation, and to consider, as 
appropriate, measures to solve other problems that may impede such transfers; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) Welcomes the adoption by the World Health Organization of its 
resolution WHA61.17 on the health of migrants, and calls upon States to take it into account as a 
measure for the progressive realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest

</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) Recalls that the Universal Declaration on Human Rights recognizes that everyone 
has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the 
fundamental rights granted to him or her; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Emphasizes</i> the importance of protecting vulnerable groups, and in this regard: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Welcomes the immigration programmes, adopted by some countries, that allow 
migrants to integrate fully into the host countries, facilitate family reunification and promote a 
harmonious and tolerant environment, and encourages States to consider the possibility of 
adopting that type of programme; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Encourages all States to apply a gender perspective in developing international 
migration policies and programmes in order to adopt the necessary measures to better protect 
women and girls against dangers and abuse during migration; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Calls upon States to protect the human rights of migrant children, given their

migrant children access to education; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Urges States to ensure that repatriation mechanisms allow for the identification and

</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Encourages States that have not yet done so to enact domestic legislation and to take 
further effective measures to combat and prosecute international trafficking and smuggling of 
migrants, and to protect and assist the victims of violence and trauma in such processes, and also 
encourages States parties to implement fully their obligations under the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the two additional Protocols thereto; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation in the 
protection of the human rights of migrants, and therefore: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Requests all States, international organizations and relevant stakeholders to take into 
account in their policies and initiatives on migration issues the global character of the migratory 
phenomenon and to give the necessary relevance to international, regional and bilateral 
cooperation in this field, with a view to addressing, in a comprehensive manner, its causes and 
consequences and granting priority to the protection of human rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Encourages States to consider participating in international and regional dialogues on 
migration that include sending and receiving countries, as well as countries of transit, and invites

human rights as a step to address the multidimensional nature of international migration; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Requests Member States, the United Nations system, international organizations, 
civil society and all relevant stakeholders, especially the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, to ensure that the 
perspective of the human rights of migrants is included among the priority issues in the 
ongoing discussions on international migration and development in the United Nations system, 
bearing in mind the discussions of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and 
Development; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to examine ways and means of 
overcoming obstacles to the full and effective protection of the human rights of migrants, 
including national and international efforts to combat the trafficking of persons and smuggling of 
migrants, in order to achieve a better comprehension of the phenomena and to avoid practices 
that could violate the human rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this question at a future session in conformity 
with its annual programme of work.

</p>
<p><b>9/6. Follow-up to the seventh special session of the Human Rights 
Council on the negative impact of the worsening of the world 
food crisis on the realization of the right to food for all 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions and decisions on the right to food adopted in the 
framework of the United Nations, in particular Council resolution S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the first Millennium 
Development Goal of eradicating hunger and extreme poverty by 2015, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the outcome of the High-level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges 
of Climate Change and Bioenergy, held from 3 to 5 June 2008, in Rome, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to act to ensure that the human rights perspective is taken into account at the 
national, regional and international levels in measures to address the current world food crisis, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the holding of the panel discussion entitled &#8220;The human right to food and the 
global food crisis: root causes and responses&#8221;, held in New York, on 29 August 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the task force established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the 
Secretary-General to continue his efforts in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the complex character of the current global food crisis, as a combination of 
several major factors, both structural and conjunctural, also impacted negatively by, inter alia, 
environmental degradation, drought and desertification, global climate change, natural disasters 
and the lack of the necessary technology, and recognizing also that a strong commitment from 
national Governments and the international community as a whole is required to confront the 
major threats to food security, 
 1. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food (A/HRC/9/23), and takes note of his recommendations; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses</i> grave concern at the fact that the current world food crisis still seriously 
undermines the realization of the right to food for all, and especially for one sixth of the world 
population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, suffering from hunger, 
malnutrition and food insecurity; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Encourages</i> States to mainstream the human rights perspective in building and 
reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to adequate food for all, which 
could include, inter alia, the mapping of the food insecure, the adoption of relevant legislation 
and policies with a right to food framework, the establishment of mechanisms to ensure 
accountability so that rights-holders are able to claim their right to food, and the establishment of 
mechanisms and processes which ensure participation of rights-holders, particularly the most 
vulnerable, in the design and monitoring of such legislation and policies; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also</i> <i>encourages </i>all States to invest or promote investment in agriculture and rural 
infrastructure in a manner that empowers the most vulnerable and affected by the current crisis in 
order to ensure their realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, 
relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all necessary measures 
to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to 
consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of 
the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such 
a policy or measure; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> that States have a primary obligation to make their best efforts to meet the 
vital food needs of their own populations, especially of vulnerable groups and households, such 
as by enhancing programmes to combat mother-child malnutrition, and to increase local 
production for this purpose, while the international community should provide, through a 
coordinated response and upon request, support for national and regional efforts by providing the 
necessary assistance for increasing food production, particularly through agricultural 
development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food 
aid, with a special focus on the gender-sensitive dimension; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security a human rights perspective 
and the need for the realization of the right to food for all; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue the promotion of the 
right to food and the follow-up to the current world food crisis in all relevant forums, especially 
in the framework of the United Nations and all the relevant international organizations and 
agencies of the United Nations system, in order to contribute to identifying means to implement 
the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also requests </i>the Special Rapporteur to report on the implementation of the present 
resolution to the Council at its twelfth session, including on the progress made and obstacles

</b></p>
<p> At the 22nd meeting, on 24 September 2008, the President of the Council read out the 
following statement: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. The Human Rights Council welcomes recent political developments in Haiti, marked 
by the formation and installation of a new Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council commends the reaffirmation by the Haitian authorities of their 
commitments and their determination to improve living conditions for Haitians, with a 
special emphasis on respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>3. The Council notes with satisfaction the cooperation between the Haitian National 
Police and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in curbing violence, crime and 
banditry. 
</p>
<p>4. The Council welcomes the adoption of the regulations on the judiciary and the new 
Act on the High Council of the Judiciary, as well as the reopening of the Judicial Training 
College. It encourages the authorities to continue their efforts, in particular as regards 
reinforcing inspection units within the police and justice systems, eliminating prolonged 
pretrial detention, introducing a legal aid scheme and strengthening the Office of Citizen 
Protection. 
</p>
<p>5. The Council thanks the outgoing independent expert for his important contribution to 
consolidating the rule of law in Haiti through his judicious recommendations, in particular 
with regard to judicial reform. 
</p><p>6. The Council is deeply concerned at the deterioration of Haitians&#8217; standard of living 
and quality of life in recent months, partly as a result of the serious economic crisis and 
acute food shortage. It deplores the heavy loss of life and material damage caused by the 
consecutive passage of hurricanes Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike. 
</p>
<p>7. The Council is aware of the many obstacles to development in Haiti and the 
difficulties encountered by its leaders in daily governance. It recognizes that full 
enjoyment of human rights - civil and political, economic, social and cultural - is a factor 
of peace, stability and progress in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>8. The Council strongly encourages the international community as a whole, and in 
particular international donors, friendly countries and United Nations specialized agencies, 
to step up their cooperation with the constituted authorities of Haiti for the full realization 
of human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The Council welcomes the Haitian authorities&#8217; request to extend the mission of the 
independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti to September 2010 and 
decides to support that request. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. The Council also welcomes the appointment of Michel Forst as independent expert 
on the situation of human rights in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>11. The Council invites the new expert to continue the work undertaken and to carry out 
his mission by bringing his experience and expertise to bear and contributing to the 
cause of human rights in Haiti, with a particular emphasis on economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The Council also invites the new expert to undertake a mission to Haiti in the near 
future and report to it each year in accordance with its programme of work. It encourages 
the Haitian authorities to cooperate with the new independent expert.&#8221;

<p>ANNEX II 
</p>
<p><b>Administrative and programme budget implications of Council 
resolutions, decisions and President&#8217;s statements 
</b></p>
<p><b>9/1. Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of 
the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products 
and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 3 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.3 (adopted as resolution 9/1), the Council 
decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement 
and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights for a 
further period of three years. 
</p>
<p>2. In paragraph 8, the Council reiterated its call to the Secretary-General to continue to make 
all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully 
and, in particular: 
</p>
<p> (a) To provide him with adequate financial and human resources, including 
administrative support; 
</p>
<p> (b) To provide him with the necessary specialized expertise to enable him to carry out 
his mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> (c) To facilitate his consultations with specialized institutions and agencies, in particular 
with the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organization, with a 
view to improving the provision by such institutions and agencies of technical assistance to 
Governments that request it and appropriate assistance to victims. 
</p>
<p>3. In paragraph 9, the Council stressed the need to ensure adequate financial, technical and 
human resources to the Special Rapporteur for the effective fulfilment of his mandate. 
</p>
<p>4. It is estimated that a total amount of $58,400 per year would be required to implement the 
activities called for in paragraphs 3 and 8, as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Travel of the Special Rapporteur for consultations/to attend the annual meeting of 
special procedures and to present a report to the Council and for two field missions per year 
($40,900); 
</p>
<p> (b) Travel of staff to accompany the Special Rapporteur during field missions ($10,500); 
</p>
<p> (c) Local transportation, security, communication and other miscellaneous expenses 
during field missions ($7,000). 
</p>
<p>5. The requirements to implement the activities of the mandate for 2009 have been included 
in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Since the period for renewal of the 
mandate extends into the biennium 2010-2011, the requirements related to that period will be </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>considered in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. 
No additional appropriations would be required as a result of the adoption of the draft  
decision. 
</p>
<p>6. With regard to paragraph 9, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, the 
most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the role 
of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>9/2.  Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>7. In paragraphs 6, 7, 9 and 10 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.7 (adopted as resolution 9/2), 
the Council requested: 
</p>
<p> (a) All States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international organizations and 
non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the independent expert in his 
mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by him and to give serious consideration 
to responding favourably to the requests of the independent expert to visit their countries, to 
enable him to fulfil his mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p> (b) The independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a draft declaration 
on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and in further developing 
guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting this right, by 
addressing, inter alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its realization; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to prepare inputs to contribute to 
the elaboration of the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international 
solidarity and to the further development of guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a 
view to promoting and protecting this right; 
</p>
<p> (d) The independent expert to submit a report on the implementation of the resolution to 
the Council at its twelfth session. 
</p>
<p>8. The implementation of paragraphs 6, 7 and 10 would be met by provisions included in the 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, under section 23 (Human Rights), in support of 
the independent expert. Additional appropriations would therefore not be required. 
</p>
<p>9. With regard to paragraph 9, it is estimated that additional requirements to implement the 
activities would amount to $33,500, which would provide for (a) a consultant to assist the 
Advisory Committee in the preparation of inputs to contribute to the elaboration of the draft 
declaration; and (b) for travel for two working days to present the working paper at the annual 
meeting of the Human rights Council Advisory Committee. These requirements have not been 
included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. Although the additional requirements to implement paragraph 9 have not been included in 
the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, all efforts will be made to meet them within 
the provisions provided, under section 23 (Human Rights). No additional appropriations will be 
required as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p><b>9/3.  The right to development 
</b></p>
<p>11. In subparagraphs 2 (b), (e), (f) and (g) of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.12 (adopted as 
resolution 9/3), the Council decided: 
</p>
<p> (a) To endorse the workplan for the task force for the period 2008-2010, outlined in 
paragraph 43 of the report of the ninth session of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development, which would ensure that the criteria for the periodic evaluation of global 
partnerships, as identified in Millennium Development Goal 8, to be submitted by the task force 
to the Working Group at its eleventh session in 2010, is extended to other components of 
Millennium Development Goal 8; 
</p>
<p> (b) To renew the mandate of the Working Group until it completed the tasks entrusted to 
it by the Council in its resolution 4/4, and that the Working Group should convene annual 
sessions of five working days and submit its reports to the Council; 
</p>
<p> (c) To renew also the mandate of the high-level task force on the implementation of the 
right to development, established within the framework of the Working Group, until the eleventh 
session of the Working Group in 2010, and that the task force would convene annual sessions of 
seven working days and submit its reports to the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> (d) To request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to continue to take all necessary measures and allocate necessary resources for the 
effective implementation of the resolution&#184; taking into account the needs for the effective 
implementation of the workplan referred to in paragraph 1 (a) above. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to subparagraphs 2 (e) and 2 (f), additional requirements would not arise. 
The resources estimated at $417,200 to cover the meetings of the Working Group  
(five work days per year) and the task force (seven work days per year) have been provided in 
the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Since the period for renewal of the mandates 
extends into the biennium 2010-2011, the requirements for servicing the meetings during that 
period will be considered in the context of the preparation of the proposed programme budget for 
the biennium 2010-2011. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding subparagraph 2 (b), additional requirements would arise under section 23 
(Human Rights), in the total amount of $235,800, to implement the mandate. No provisions have 
been made under the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 to cover general temporary 
assistance to provide secretarial support to the task force, consultants to prepare various studies 
and for various technical missions required in implementation of subparagraph 2 (b). All 
efforts will be made for the estimated requirements of $235,800 to be met from available 
resources under section 23. No additional appropriation would therefore be required for the 
biennium 2008-2009 as a result of adoption of the resolution. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to subparagraph 2 (g), attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, the 
most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role 
of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>9/7.  Human rights and indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>15. In paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.17 (adopted as resolution 9/7), 
the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Requested the expert mechanism on the rights of indigenous peoples to identify 
proposals and to suggest them by consensus to the Council, for its consideration in 2009; 
</p>
<p> (b) Also requested the expert mechanism and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people to assist the Preparatory 
Committee by undertaking a review and submitting recommendations as contributions to the 
outcome of the Durban Review Conference; 
</p>
<p> (c) Further requested the expert mechanism to prepare a study on<b> </b>lessons learned and 
challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education and to 
conclude it in 2009; 
</p>
<p> (d) Requested the expert mechanism on the rights of indigenous peoples to seek input 
from relevant stakeholders, including from indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, Member States, 
relevant international and regional organizations, OHCHR, national human rights institutions 
and civil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations, for the preparation of 
their work. 
</p>
<p>16. The implementation of paragraphs 3, 4 and 6 would be met by provisions included in the 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, under section 23 (Human Rights), in support of 
the expert mechanism. Additional appropriations would therefore not be required. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to paragraph 5, it is estimated that additional requirements to implement the 
activities would amount to $38,900. The requirements, which would provide for general 
temporary assistance at the P-3 level for three months to undertake relevant research and 
analysis in contribution to the study, have not been included in the programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009.  
</p>
<p>18. Although the additional requirements to implement paragraph 5 have not been included in 
the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, all efforts will be made for them to be met 
within the provisions provided, under section 23. No additional appropriations would therefore 
be required as a result of the adoption of the resolution. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>9/9.  Protection of the human rights of civilians in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>19. In paragraphs 8 and 9 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.21 (orally revised and adopted as 
resolution 9/9), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Invited OHCHR to convene, within existing resources, an expert consultation, open 
to the participation of Governments, regional organizations, relevant United Nations bodies 
and civil society organizations, and in consultation with the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, on the issue of protecting the human rights of civilians in armed conflict, requested 
OHCHR to report the outcome of this consultation, in the form of a summary of discussions on 
the above-mentioned issue, to the Council at its eleventh session; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to elaborate a 
comprehensive study, drawing upon the work previously undertaken by the Subcommission on 
the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, and bearing in mind the outcome of the above 
mentioned expert consultation, and inputs received from all relevant stakeholders, with a view to 
identify mechanisms, modalities, procedures, and methods for enhancing the protection of 
human rights of civilians in armed conflicts, and present concrete recommendations thereon for 
consideration by the Council at its thirteenth session.<b>a</b> 
</p>
<p>20. The requirements to implement the activities called for in paragraph 9 would amount 
to $92,300. These requirements for the mandate have not been included in the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Additional appropriations would therefore be 
required as a result of the adoption of the resolution. 
</p>
<p>21. As the Council invites OHCHR to convene an expert consultation within existing 
resources, there are no financial implications regarding potential activities under paragraph 8, 
which will be implemented only if the necessary resources are available. 
</p>
<p>22. With regard to paragraph 8, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, the 
most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the role 
of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>a
</b>  Paragraph 9 was subsequently orally revised by the sponsors of the draft resolution. In the 
</p>
<p>revised version, the Council decided &#8220;to continue consideration of this question at its eleventh 
session [&#8230;] on the basis of the outcome of the consultation referred to in paragraph 8 above, 
with a view to consider requesting the Advisory Committee [&#8230;] to elaborate a study with 
potential recommendations on the protection of the human rights of civilians in armed conflict&#8221; 
(A/HRC/9/23, resolution 9/9). Consequently, the budgetary implications originally envisioned in 
the draft text are no longer relevant. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>9/11.  Right to the truth 
</b></p>
<p>23. In paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.23 (adopted as resolution 9/11), 
the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Requested OHCHR to prepare a comprehensive study, to be presented to the Council 
at its twelfth session, on best practices for the effective implementation of this right, including, in 
particular, practices relating to archives and records concerning gross violations of human rights 
with a view to create guidelines on protecting archives and records concerning gross human 
rights violations, and programmes for the protection of witnesses and other persons involved in 
trials connected with such violations; 
</p>
<p> (b) Also requested OHCHR to prepare a report, to be presented to the Council at its 
fifteenth session, on the use of forensic experts in case of gross violations of human rights with a 
view to identifying trends and best practices in this regard; 
</p>
<p> (c) Decided to convene a panel to discuss issues related to the resolution at its 
thirteenth session. 
</p>
<p>24. The implementation of paragraph 7 would be met by provisions included in the programme 
budget for the biennium 2008-2009, under section 23 (Human Rights), in<b> </b>relation to the 
preparation of the study. No additional appropriations would therefore be required. 
</p>
<p>25. A total of $108,900 for the biennium 2010-2011 would be required in implementation of 
paragraph 9, which is considered a new activity for (a) travel and daily subsistence allowance for 
five experts for a one-day panel discussion ($29,700); and (b) conference services to be provided 
to organize the one-day panel discussion ($79,200) as follows: 
</p>
<p> United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and  
   Economic and Social Council Affairs  
   and Conference Management 
</p>
<p>78 500 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human Rights 29 700 
Section 28E, Administration, Geneva 700 
 Total 108 900 
</p>
<p>26. The requirements to implement the activities called for in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the 
resolution would be considered in the context of the preparation of the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2010-2011, since the thirteenth and fifteenth sessions of the Council are 
scheduled to be held in 2010. No additional appropriations would be required as a result of the 
adoption of the resolution. </p>

<p><b>9/14.  Mandate of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent 
</b></p>
<p>27. In paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.24 (adopted as resolution 9/14), 
the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Requested OHCHR to compile a series of best practices in areas such as access to 
housing, education, health, employment and institutional and legal frameworks pertaining to 
Africans and people of African descent; 
</p>
<p> (b) Decided to extend the mandate of the Working Group of Experts on People of 
African Descent for three years with the mandate to meet for two sessions of five working days 
each in closed and public meetings: 
</p>
<p>(i) To study the problems of racial discrimination faced by people of African

need for close collaboration with international and development institutions 
and the specialized agencies of the United Nations system to promote the 
human rights of people of African descent, through, inter alia, the following 
activities: 
</p>
<p>a. Improving the human rights situation of people of African descent by 
devoting special attention to their needs through, inter alia, the 
preparation of specific programmes of action;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>b.<b> </b>Designing special projects, in collaboration with people of African 
descent, to support their initiatives at the community level and to 
facilitate the exchange of information and technical know-how between 
these populations and experts in these areas; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>c. Liaising<b> </b>with financial and developmental institutional and operational 
programmes and specialised agencies of the United Nations, with a view 
to contribute to the development programmes intended for people of 
African descent allocating additional investments to health systems, 
education, housing, electricity, drinking water and environmental control 
measures and promoting equal opportunities in employment, as well as 
other affirmative or positive measures and strategies, within the human 
rights framework; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the Working Group to submit reports on progress in the elaboration of its 
mandate to the Council; 
</p>
<p> (d) Urged the High Commissioner to take measures within the framework of the World

including by highlighting the plight of victims and initiating consultations with various 
international sporting and other organizations, enabling them to contribute to the struggle against 
racism and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>28. A total of $788,400 would be required for the biennium 2008-2009 to implement the 
activities arising from the terms of paragraphs 8 (excluding para. 8 (f) (ii)), 9 and 10 to provide 
for (a) travel and daily subsistence allowance ($255,200); and (b) conference services to 
organize two meetings of five days each per year ($533,200), as follows: 
</p>
<p> United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and  
   Economic and Social Council Affairs  
   and Conference Management 
</p>
<p>519 200 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human Rights 255 200 
Section 28E, Administration 14 000 
 Total 788 400 
</p>
<p>29. Provisions of $788,400 have already been included under the programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009 to cover activities related to two sessions per year and other related official 
missions. 
</p>
<p>30. The implementation of paragraphs 7 and 8 (f) (ii) would require an amount of $42,000 for 
consultancies for 2009 that have not been included under the programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009. Although this amount has not been included in the programme budget for 
the biennium 2008-2009, all efforts will be made to accommodate the requirements within the 
approved appropriations for the biennium 2008-2009 under section 23 (Human Rights). 
No additional appropriations would therefore be required as a result of the adoption of the 
resolution. 
</p>
<p>31. Since the period for the renewal of the mandate extends into the biennium 2010-2011, the 
requirements for that period will be considered in the context of the preparation of the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. </p>

<p><b>9/15.  Advisory services and technical assistance for Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p>32. In paragraph 9 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.16 (orally revised and adopted as 
resolution 9/15), the Council decided to extend by one year the special procedure on the situation 
of human rights in Cambodia through the appointment of a special rapporteur to carry out the 
functions of the former Special Representative to the Secretary-General, and requested the 
Special Rapporteur to report on the implementation of his/her mandate to the Council at its 
twelfth session and to engage in a constructive manner with the Government of Cambodia for the 
further improvement of the situation of human rights in the country.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>33. The activities called for by the Council in paragraph 9 would require $53,200. The 
requirements of the mandate for 2009 would provide for:

<p>34. The requirements for the mandate of the former Special Representative have been included

the Special Rapporteur; no additional appropriations would therefore be required as a result of 
the adoption of the resolution.  
</p>
<p><b>9/17.  Situation of human rights in the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>35. In paragraphs 15, 18 and 19 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.2 (orally revised and adopted as 
resolution 9/17), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to extend for one year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Sudan, in accordance with Council resolution 6/34; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Special Rapporteur to further ensure the effective follow-up and to 
foster the implementation of the remaining recommendations identified by the Group of Experts 
through an open and constructive dialogue with the Government of the Sudan, and to include 
information in that regard in her next report; 
</p>
<p> (c) Also requested the Special Rapporteur to present to the Council her outstanding 
annual report at its tenth session and her following report at its twelfth session. 
</p>
<p>36. A total amount of $51,300 per year would be required to implement the activities called for 
in paragraphs 15, 18 and 19, to provide for (a) travel of the Special Rapporteur; (b) travel of staff 
to accompany the Special Rapporteur during field missions; and (c) local transportation, security, 
communication and other miscellaneous expenses during field missions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>37. The requirements to implement the mandate of the Special Rapporteur have been included 
under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. No 
additional appropriations would therefore be required as a result of the adoption of the 
resolution. 
</p>
<p><b>9/18. Follow-up to resolution S-3/1: human rights violations emanating from  
Israeli military incursions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and 
the shelling of Beit Hanoun 
</b></p>
<p>38. In paragraphs 2 and 3 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.8 (orally revised and adopted as 
resolution 9/18), the Council:  
</p>
<p> (a) Endorsed the recommendations of the fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun 
contained in its report, and called upon all concerned parties to ensure their full and immediate 
implementation; 
</p>
<p> (b) Recommended that the General Assembly should consider the report with the 
participation of the members of the mission. 
</p>
<p>39. Requirements to implement the activities called for by the Council would amount 
to $25,100, to provide for the travel of two experts, one assistant to expert and one OHCHR 
staff member. The requirements have not been included in the programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009. 
</p>
<p>40. Although the additional requirements to implement the activities have not been included in 
the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, all efforts will be made to accommodate the 
requirements within the provisions provided, under section 23 (Human Rights). No additional 
appropriations would therefore be required as a result of the adoption of the resolution. 
</p>
<p><b>9/19.  Advisory services and technical assistance to Burundi 
</b></p>
<p>41. In paragraphs 7 and 8 of draft resolution A/HRC/9/L.18 (orally revised and adopted as 
resolution 9/19), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Invited the independent expert to continue to assist the Government of Burundi in its 
efforts to improve the situation of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the independent expert to report to it at its twelfth session.<b>b</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>b
</b>  Both paragraphs were subsequently orally revised by the sponsor. In the revised version, the 
</p>
<p>Council requested OHCHR, &#8220;through its presence in Burundi, to continue its activities and 
technical assistance programmes in consultation with the Burundi authorities&#8221;; decided &#8220;to 
extend the mandate of the independent expert until an independent national human rights 
commission has been established&#8221;; invited the independent expert &#8220;to report on his activities to 
the Council at the session following the establishment of the above-mentioned commission&#8221;; and 
invited OHCHR &#8220;to report to the Council at its twelfth session on the progress achieved in the 
situation of human rights in Burundi and on its activities in the country, and to make 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. To implement the activities called for by the Council, $48,800 would be required to 
provide for (a) travel of the independent expert for consultations/to attend the annual meeting of 
special procedures and to present a report to the Council and for two field missions per year; 
(b) travel of staff to accompany the independent expert during field missions; (c) local 
transportation, communication, supplies and other miscellaneous expenses during field missions. 
The requirements have been included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. No 
additional appropriations would be required as a result of the adoption of the resolution. 
</p>
<p><b>9/101.  Missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>43. In draft decision A/HRC/9/L.5 (adopted as decision 9/101), the Council requested the 
Advisory Committee to prepare a study on the best practices in the matter of missing persons and 
to submit that study to the Council at its twelfth session. 
</p>
<p>44. An estimated amount of $92,300 would be required to provide for general temporary 
assistance at the P-4 level for six months for research related to the activities called for by the 
Council in its decision. 
</p>
<p>45. The $92,300 required to implement the activities have not been included under section 23 
of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Additional resources are however not 
requested at this time, as the Secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be 
redeployed to meet the requirements within the appropriations approved for section 23 for the 
biennium 2008-2009. 
</p>
<p>46. When the General Assembly reviews the question of the revised estimates resulting from 
decisions taken by the Council at its ninth session, it is anticipated that the Secretariat will be in a 
position to inform the Assembly on how the additional requirements could be met. 
</p>
<p><b>PRST/9/1.  Situation of human rights in Haiti 
</b></p>
<p>47. In paragraphs 9, 11 and 12 of draft President&#8217;s statement A/HRC/9/L.9 (adopted as 
President&#8217;s statement PRST/9/1), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Welcomed and confirmed the decision of the Haitian authorities to request the 
continuation of the mission of independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti until 
September 2010; 
</p>
<p> (b) Invited the new expert to continue the work undertaken and to carry out his mission 
by bringing his experience and expertise to bear and contributing to the human rights cause in 
Haiti, with a particular focus on economic social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>recommendations on suitable independent mechanisms necessary for the promotion and 
protection of human rights in Burundi&#8221; (A/HRC/9/28, resolution 9/19, paras. 7-10). 
Consequently, the budgetary implications originally envisioned in the draft text are no longer 
relevant. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Also invited the new expert to undertake a mission to Haiti in the near future and to 
present his reports to the Council on an annual basis. 
</p>
<p>48. The requirements to implement the activities called for in paragraphs 9, 11, and 12 would 
amount to $52,700 per year, to provide for: 
</p>
<p> (a) Travel of the expert for consultations/to attend the annual meeting of special 
procedures and to present a report to the Council, and for two official missions per year to

<p> (b) Travel of staff to accompany the expert during field missions ($16,900); 
</p>
<p> (c) Local transportation, communication, supplies and other miscellaneous expenses 
during field missions ($7,000). 
</p>
<p>49. The requirements for 2009 have been included in the programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009. Since the period for renewal of the mandate extends into the 
biennium 2010-2011, the requirements related to that period will be considered in the context of 
the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. No additional appropriations 
would therefore be required as a result of the adoption of the statement. </p>
