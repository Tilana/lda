<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Geneva Conventions of 
12 August 1949 and the Protocols Additional thereto of 1977, and other relevant instruments of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as well as the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> article 32 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 
relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, which recognizes the right 
of families to know the fate of their relatives, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> that article 33 of Additional Protocol I provides that the parties to an armed 
conflict shall search for the persons who have been reported missing, as soon as circumstances 
permit, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/177 of 
20 December 2006, in which article 24 (2) sets out the right of victims to know the truth 
regarding the circumstances of the enforced disappearance, the progress and results of the 
investigation and the fate of the disappeared person, and sets forth State party obligations to take 
appropriate measures in this regard, and the preamble that reaffirms the right to freedom to seek, 
receive and impart information to that end,  
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/66, Council 
decision 2/105 and resolution 9/11 on the right to the truth, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking also into account</i> Council resolution 10/26 of 27 March 2009 on forensic genetics 
and human rights, in which the Council recognized the importance of the utilization of forensic 
genetics to deal with the issue of impunity within the framework of investigations related to 
gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the right to the truth (E/CN.4/2006/91, A/HRC/5/7) and its significant 
conclusions related to the right to know the truth about gross violations of human rights and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law, </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging also</i> the report of the Office of the High Commissioner on the right to the 
truth (A/HRC/12/19) and its conclusions regarding the importance of the protection of witnesses 
within the framework of criminal procedures related to gross human rights violations and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law, as well as on issues related to the elaboration and 
management of archives systems to guarantee the effective implementation of the right to the 
</p>
<p>truth,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that adequate steps to identify victims should also be taken in situations not 
amounting to armed conflict, especially in cases of massive or systematic violations of human 
rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through 
action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II) and taking note with 
appreciation of the updated version of those principles (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1),  
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers has 
recognized the right to the truth, its scope and implementation (E/CN.4/2006/52), and also that 
the Human Rights Committee and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances (E/CN.4/1999/62) have recognized the right of the victims of gross violations of 
human rights and the right of their relatives to the truth about the events that have taken place, 
including the identification of the perpetrators of the facts that gave rise to such violations,  
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> in cases of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law the need to study the interrelationship between the right to the 
truth and the right to access to justice, the right to obtain effective remedy and reparation and 
other relevant human rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the importance for the international community to endeavour to recognize the 
right of victims of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law, and their families and society as a whole, to know the truth regarding such 
violations, to the fullest extent practicable, in particular, the identity of the perpetrators, the 
causes and facts of such violations, and the circumstances under which they occurred,  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Stressing also</i> that it is important for States to provide appropriate and effective 
mechanisms for society as a whole and, in particular, for relatives of the victims, to know the 
truth regarding gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that a specific right to the truth may be characterized differently in some legal 
systems as the right to know or the right to be informed or freedom of information,  
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the public and individuals are entitled to have access, to the fullest extent 
practicable, to information regarding the actions and decision-making processes of their 
Government, within the framework of each State&#8217;s domestic legal system,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of preserving historic memory related to gross human rights 
violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law through the conservation of 
archives and other documents related to those violations,  
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that States should preserve archives and other evidence concerning gross 
violations of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law to facilitate 
knowledge of such violations, to investigate allegations and to provide victims with access to an 
effective remedy in accordance with international law,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of respecting and ensuring the right to the truth so as to 
contribute to ending impunity and to promote and protect human rights;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes</i> the establishment in several States of specific judicial mechanisms and 
other non-judicial mechanisms, such as truth and reconciliation commissions, that complement 
the justice system, to investigate violations of human rights and violations of international 
humanitarian law, and appreciates the elaboration and publication of the reports and decisions of 
these bodies;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Encourages</i> the States concerned to disseminate, implement and monitor 
implementation of the recommendations of non-judicial mechanisms such as truth and 
reconciliation commissions, and provide information regarding compliance with the decisions of 
judicial mechanisms;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> other States to consider establishing specific judicial mechanisms and, 
where appropriate, truth and reconciliation commissions to complement the justice system, in 
order to investigate and address gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> States to provide requesting States the necessary and appropriate 
assistance regarding the right to the truth by means of, among other actions, technical 
cooperation and exchange of information concerning administrative, legislative and judicial and 
non-judicial measures, as well as experiences and best practices that have as a purpose the 
protection, promotion and implementation of this right, including practices regarding the 
protection of witnesses and the preservation and management of archives; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also encourages</i> States to design programmes and other measures to protect 
witnesses and individuals who cooperate with judicial bodies and mechanisms of a quasi-judicial 
or non-judicial nature, such as human rights commissions and truth commissions; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Welcomes</i> the fact that 81 States have signed and 13 States have ratified the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and 
encourages all States that have not yet signed, ratified or acceded to the Convention to consider 
doing so, in order to allow its entry into force as soon as possible; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
prepare a report, to be presented to the Council at its fifteenth session, on the basis of 
information, including from States, on programmes and other measures for the protection of 
witnesses implemented within the framework of criminal procedures related to gross violations 
of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law, with a view to 
determine the need to develop common standards and promote best practices that would serve as 
guidelines to States in protecting witnesses and others concerned with providing cooperation in 
trials for gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Invites</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to convene, within existing resources, 
a seminar, taking into account different experiences on the importance of the creation, 
organization and management of public systems of archives as a means to guarantee the right to </p>

 <p></p>
<p>the truth, with a view to study the need for guidelines on this issue, and also requests the Office 
to report on the outcome of the consultation, in the form of a summary of discussions on the 
above-mentioned issue, to the Council at its seventeenth session; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Invites</i> special rapporteurs and other mechanisms of the Council, in the framework of 
their mandates, to take into account, as appropriate, the issue of the right to the truth;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to consider this matter at its fifteenth session under the same agenda item, or 
at the corresponding session in conformity with its annual programme of work.
