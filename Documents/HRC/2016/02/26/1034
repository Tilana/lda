<p><i>Recognizing</i> that achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including 
</p>
<p>the Millennium Development Goals, requires effective policy coherence and coordination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that extreme poverty and hunger are one of the greatest global 
</p>
<p>threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for its 
</p>
<p>eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1, and therefore calling upon the 
</p>
<p>international community to contribute towards achieving that goal, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the imperative need for raising awareness of the progress made, still 
</p>
<p>existing difficulties and accelerating action towards the achievement of the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to 
</p>

</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> that the post-2015 development agenda will need to aim at 
</p>
<p>strengthening a new, more equitable and sustainable national and international order, as 
</p>
<p>well as the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the right to development should be central to the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the commitment declared by a number of United Nations specialized 
</p>
<p>agencies, funds and programmes and other international organizations to make the right to 
</p>
<p>development a reality for all, and in this regard, encouraging all relevant bodies of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system and other international organizations to mainstream the right to 
</p>
<p>development into their objectives, policies, programmes and operational activities, as well 
</p>

</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that Member States should cooperate with each other in ensuring 
</p>
<p>development and eliminating obstacles to development, that the international community 
</p>
<p>should promote effective international cooperation, in particular global partnership for 
</p>
<p>development, for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of 
</p>
<p>obstacles to development, and that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right 
</p>
<p>to development requires effective development policies at the national level, as well as 
</p>
<p>equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international 
</p>
<p>level,
