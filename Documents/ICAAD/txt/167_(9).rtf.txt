CRIMINAL JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL ACTION NO: HAC0011 OF 2002

STATE

-v-

ABARAMA MATACAGI

Counsel: Ms A. Prasad for State
Ms M. Chan for Accused

JUDGMENT

I have directed myself in accordance with my Summing Up. The unanimous opinions of the assessors is based on the facts of the case and on the basis that the contents of the confessions made to the police are inherently unreliable. I find no reason to disagree with their opinions.

The accused is acquitted on both counts accordingly.
