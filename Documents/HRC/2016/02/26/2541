</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 17/23 of 17 June 2011 and 
19/38 of 23 March 2012, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating </i>the commitment to ensure the effective enjoyment of all civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights for everyone, including the right to development, and 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>the obligation of all States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to 
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural 
wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international 
economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law, 
and that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization 
and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty 
eradication, the fight against hunger, and economic and sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i> Alarmed </i>at cases in which the proceeds of corruption-related crimes that involve 
vast quantities of assets, which may constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of 
States, the deprivation of which threatens the political stability and sustainable development 
of those States and has a negative impact on the application by States of the maximum 
available resources to the full realization of all human rights for all, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that the enjoyment of human rights, be they economic, social and 
cultural, or civil and political, in particular the right to development, is seriously 
undermined by corruption and the transfer of funds of illicit origin, which may endanger the 
stability and security of societies, undermine the values of democracy and morality and 
jeopardize social, economic and political development, especially when an inadequate 
national and international response leads to impunity, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the United Nations Convention against Corruption, underlining its central 
role in fostering international cooperation to facilitate the repatriation of the proceeds of 
corruption-related crimes, and stressing the need for universal adherence to the Convention 
and for its full implementation, as well as the full implementation of the resolutions and 
decisions of the Conference of the States Parties to the Convention, particularly those 
adopted at its fourth session,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the work carried out by different United Nations bodies, including 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as international and regional 
organizations, in preventing and combating all forms of corruption, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that supportive domestic legal systems are essential in preventing and 
combating corrupt practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin and in returning such 
assets, and recalling that the fight against all forms of corruption requires strong institutions 
at all levels, including at the local level, able to take efficient preventive and law 
enforcement measures consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, 
in particular chapters II and III thereof, 
</p>
<p><i> Appreciating </i>the continued efforts of the Conference of the States Parties to the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, through its various intergovernmental 
working groups, to oversee the review process of the implementation of the Convention, to 
advise on the provision of technical assistance for building institutional and human capacity 
in States parties for the prevention of corruption, and to enhance international cooperation, 
including in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>the responsibilities of requesting and requested States in the repatriation of 
funds of illicit origin, cognizant that countries of origin must seek repatriation as part of 
their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full 
realization of all human rights for all, including the right to development, address human 
rights violations and combat impunity, and that recipient countries, on the other hand, have 
a  duty  to  assist  and  facilitate  repatriation as  part of their  obligation of international 
cooperation and assistance under chapters IV and V of the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption and in the field of human rights, and in line with the commitment made </p>


<p>at the 2005 World Summit and the 2010 High-level Plenary Meeting of the General 
Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals to make the fight against corruption a 
priority at all levels and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>at the difficulties, in particular the practical difficulties, that both 
requested and requesting States face in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, taking into 
account the particular importance of the recovery of stolen assets for sustainable 
development and stability, and noting the difficulties of providing information establishing 
a link between the proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in 
the requesting State, which in many cases may be difficult to prove, bearing in mind that 
everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until 
proven guilty according to law, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the progress made towards the implementation of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption<i>, </i>while recognizing that States continue to face challenges in 
recovering funds of illicit origin owing to, inter alia, differences in legal systems, the 
complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, lack of familiarity with 
the mutual legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow 
of funds of illicit origin, and noting the particular challenges in recovering them in cases 
involving individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions and 
their family members and close associates, and recognizing also that legal difficulties are 
often exacerbated by factual and institutional obstacles, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with  serious concern </i>that, as highlighted in the interim report by the 
Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial 
obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights,1 despite the scarcity of available public data, most illicit financial 
outflows are from developing countries and that, despite increased efforts by the 
international community to curb the flow of illicit funds, recent studies indicate that such 
flows grew in real terms by an annual average of 8.6 per cent, exceeding the average rate of 
economic growth in developing countries, over the period 2001 to 2010, and they estimate 
that developing countries lost between 783 billion United States dollars and 1,138 billion 
United States dollars in illicit financial outflows in 2010, while,<b> </b>as indicated in the 
comprehensive study prepared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the 
countries of origin on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular economic, social and 
cultural rights,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/19/42 and Corr.1. </footnote> only around 2 per cent of the estimated funds of illicit origin annually 
leaving the developing world are repatriated to their countries of origin, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the particular concern of developing countries and countries with economies 
in transition regarding the return of assets of illicit origin derived from corruption, in 
particular to countries from which they originated, consistent with the principles of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular chapter V thereto, so as to 
enable countries to design and fund development projects in accordance with their national 
priorities in view of the importance that such assets can have to their sustainable 
development, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that the illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging 
to democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law, and stressing that any 
resource that the State is deprived of because of corruption has potentially the same 
negative effect, regardless of whether it is exported or domestically retained, 
</p>

<p> 1. <i>Takes note with appreciation </i>of the comprehensive study prepared the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the interim report by the Independent 
Expert1 on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of 
States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural 
rights;1 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon </i>all States that have not yet acceded to the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption to consider doing so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Asserts </i>the urgent need to repatriate illicit funds to the countries of origin 
without conditionalities, in accordance with the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption and in line with the commitments made at the 2005 World Summit and the 2010  
High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development 
Goals to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to curb the illicit 
transfer of funds, and urges all States to step up their efforts to trace, freeze and recover 
those funds; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Acknowledges </i>the importance of compliance with international human rights 
law in relation to the repatriation of funds of illicit origin through, inter alia, promoting 
human rights-based policy coherence in the deliberations and actions by States Members of 
the Human Rights Council and in the intergovernmental process of implementing the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Invites </i>the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption to consider ways of adopting a human rights-based approach in the 
implementation of the Convention, including when dealing with the repatriation of funds of 
illicit origin, and appreciates the continued efforts of the Open-ended Intergovernmental 
Working Group on Asset Recovery of the Conference to assist States parties in fulfilling 
their obligations under the Convention to prevent, detect and deter in a more effective 
manner the international transfer of funds of illicit origin and to strengthen international 
cooperation in asset recovery, bearing in mind that, regardless of the capacities, resources 
and willingness of the requesting State&#8217;s institutions and authorities, there is a victim 
</p>
<p>society that is suffering the consequences of the transfer of those funds; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes </i>the decision made at the fourth session of the Conference of the 
States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to convene open-ended 
intergovernmental expert meetings on international cooperation to advise and assist States 
with regard to extradition and mutual legal assistance, and notes with appreciation the 
Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative of the World Bank Group and the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime, and encourages coordination among existing initiatives; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>7. <i> Realizes</i> that, while illicit financial outflows from the least developed 
countries may account for only a small portion of all outflows of funds of illicit origin 
worldwide, they have a particularly negative impact on social development and the 
realization of social, economic and cultural rights in these countries, given the size of their 
economies, and expresses deep concern that such outflows, as estimated by the United 
Nations Development Programme, exceed the total official development assistance 
received by many of the least developed countries and in some cases surpass their debt 
service payments; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underscores</i> that the repatriation of funds of illicit origin would provide 
States that have undergone regime change  with further opportunity to improve the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights and to fulfil their obligation to meet the 
legitimate aspirations of their peoples; </p>


<p> 9. <i>Acknowledges</i> the important role that civil society can play in exposing 
corruption and drawing attention to the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of 
illicit origin on the rule of law and the realization of economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Welcomes</i> recent national initiatives to adopt anti-money-laundering 
legislation as an important step in the fight against corruption, and the willingness 
demonstrated by some States to cooperate in facilitating the repatriation of funds of illicit 
origin, andc<i>alls for</i> more robust regulations in this regard, including through the 
implementation of policies aimed at reducing the flow of funds of illicit origin, ensuring 
their repatriation and the provision of technical assistance to developing countries; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also</i> <i>calls for </i>further international cooperation, inter alia, through the United 
Nations system, in support of national, subregional and regional efforts to prevent and 
combat corrupt practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin, in accordance with the 
principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and, in this regard, 
encourages close cooperation at the national and international levels between anti-
corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and financial intelligence units; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Calls upon </i>all States requested to repatriate funds of illicit origin to fully 
uphold their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to 
curb the illicit transfer of funds, and to acknowledge that, in fulfilling their obligations in 
this regard under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, they also have a 
responsibility towards societies affected by corruption to make every effort to achieve the 
repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin in order to diminish the 
negative impact of non-repatriation, including  on  the  enjoyment of human rights, in 
particular economic, social and cultural rights in the countries of origin by, inter alia, 
lowering the barriers imposed on requiring jurisdictions at the tracing stage and enhancing 
cooperation in this regard between anti-corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and 
financial intelligence units, in particular taking into account the risks of dissipation of those 
funds, and, where appropriate, by delinking confiscation measures from a requirement of 
conviction in the country of origin; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Also calls upon </i>all States requesting the repatriation of funds of illicit origin 
to fully uphold their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels 
and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, and  to apply the principles of accountability, 
transparency and participation in the decision-making process regarding the allocation of 
repatriated funds to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in order to 
improve prevention and detection procedures, correct identified weaknesses or 
mismanagement, prevent impunity, provide effective remedies directed at creating 
conditions for avoiding new human rights violations and improve the overall administration 
of justice; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Reaffirms </i>that it is the obligation of the State to investigate and prosecute 
corruption, calls upon all States to strengthen criminal proceedings directed at freezing or 
restraining funds of illicit origin, and encourages requesting States to ensure that adequate 
national investigative procedures have been initiated and substantiated for the purpose of 
presenting mutual legal assistance requests and, in this context, encourages requested States 
to provide, information on legal frameworks and procedures to the requesting State; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Underlines </i>that there is also a corporate responsibility to comply with and 
respect all applicable laws and human rights, and a need for greater access to effective 
remedies by victims in order to realize effective prevention of, and remedy for, business- </p>


<p>related human rights harm, as set out in the guiding principles on business and human 
rights;<footnote name="3">A/HRC/17/31, annex. </footnote> 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Stresses </i>the need for transparency in financial institutions and effective due 
diligence measures to be applied by financial intermediaries, calls upon States to seek 
appropriate means in accordance with their international obligations to ensure the 
cooperation and responsiveness of financial institutions to foreign requests to freeze and 
recover funds of illicit origin and the provision of efficient mutual legal assistance regime 
to States requesting repatriation of those funds, and encourages the promotion of human 
and institutional capacity-building in that regard; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Requests </i>the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, to continue his efforts in preparing 
an in-depth study on the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to 
the countries of origin on the application by States of the maximum available resources to 
the full realization of all human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, 
with special attention paid to developing countries and countries with economies in 
transition burdened by foreign debt<b>,</b> as<b> </b>mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 
19/38 of 23 March 2012, and to present his study to the Council at its twenty-fifth session; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all 
necessary facilities and assistance, from within existing resources, to allow the Independent 
Expert to carry out the mandate set out in the present resolution in the manner he 
independently planned, including consultation and data research, as indicated in his report, 
and calls upon all relevant stakeholders, including States, and United Nations bodies and 
agencies, as well as other international and regional entities, to fully cooperate with him in 
this regard; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Further requests </i>the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the 
attention of all Member States and different forums dealing with the issue of the 
repatriation of funds of illicit origin within the United Nations system for consideration and 
necessary action and coordination as appropriate, particularly within the context of the 
Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption; 
</p>
<p> 20.<i> Decides </i>to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item.
