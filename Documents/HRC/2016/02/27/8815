<p>GE.10-10269 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report outlines progress achieved since the last report of the Secretary-
General submitted to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/10/54). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
accords priority to the establishment and strengthening of national human rights institutions 
(NHRIs) with due regard for the Principles Relating to the Status of National Institutions 
(the Paris Principles) adopted by the General Assembly (resolution 48/134, annex). 
OHCHR is also engaged in improving United Nations system-wide coordination on NHRIs, 
and supports their increased participation in the United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms. OHCHR encourages the sharing of good practices among NHRIs, supports 
the strengthening of their regional networks, and facilitates their access to United Nations 
country teams and other relevant partners. 
</p>
<p>3. During the reporting period, OHCHR continued to support the building of strong 
NHRIs and to increase the effectiveness of their regional coordinating bodies. Since 2008, 
the NHRI fellowship programme has hosted staff from A-status NHRIs from States such as 
Australia, El Salvador, the Republic of Korea and Togo. This programme has enabled the 
fellows to gain knowledge of and experience with the United Nations human rights system. 
It has also been beneficial for OHCHR, in terms of both substantive expertise and the 
consolidation of contacts with staff from national institutions. OHCHR has issued a new 
call for candidates for 2010. Through this programme, up to four staff members from 
NHRIs will be selected to work in the National Institutions and Regional Mechanisms 
Section of OHCHR for a period up to 12 months.  
</p>
<p>4. NHRIs compliant with the Paris Principles are essential to national human rights 
protection systems and are important counterparts for OHCHR. They can play a crucial role 
in promoting and monitoring the effective implementation of international human rights 
standards at the national level, a role which is increasingly recognized by the international 
community. This role was highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights at the opening of the Ninth International Ombudsman Institute World 
Conference in Stockholm in June 2009. The High Commissioner noted that NHRIs are 
central elements of a strong national human rights protection framework that also requires 
an independent judiciary, effective parliamentary oversight mechanisms, fair administration 
of justice, a dynamic civil society and free and responsible media. 
</p><p>5. Since 2003, OHCHR has maintained the National Human Rights Institutions Forum 
website (www.nhri.net). In June 2009, following cooperation with the Danish NHRI, 
OHCHR renewed a grant agreement with the Indian NHRI, responsible for the management 
of the website in cooperation with OHCHR since 2008. Efforts are being carried out in 
order to restyle and make it a more user-friendly and accessible tool. The website is linked 
to the web pages of OHCHR and NHRIs and includes information on the United Nations 
human rights system, on country and thematic issues and on the activities of the 
International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights (International Coordinating Committee).  
6. In July 2009, OHCHR released an outcome of the Survey on National Human 
Rights Institutions, which includes a report on the findings of a questionnaire launched with 
the aim of taking stock of the current state of such institutions. The analysis of responses </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10269 
</p>
<p>identified challenges and weaknesses experienced by NHRIs, a lack of adequate funding 
and a need for technical assistance related to organizational and resource management, 
knowledge of the international human rights system, relationships with public bodies and 
civil society, and the follow-up of NHRI recommendations by their respective 
Governments. The Survey provides a diagnostic of gaps and areas of assistance for action 
by OHCHR, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), donors and the 
regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs (for a summary of the recommendations, see annex 
IV). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Advisory services provided by the Office 
</b></p>
<p>7. OHCHR activities to strengthen the role of NHRIs at the country, regional and 
international level are carried out mainly through the National Institutions and Regional 
Mechanisms Section, which works in consultation with other parts of OHCHR, including 
field presences. OHCHR has continued to provide advice and assistance in the 
establishment and strengthening of institutions through its country and regional offices, 
human rights advisers and human rights components of United Nations peace missions, as 
well as through collaboration with other United Nations partners (including UNDP) and the 
regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs. 
</p>
<p>8. Technical cooperation programmes and agreements with a view to strengthening the 
capacity of NHRIs were conducted by OHCHR through its regional offices for Central 
Africa, Central Asia, East Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, Southern Africa, South-
East Asia, the Pacific and West Africa as well as through country offices, i.e. those of 
Nepal and Uganda. Cooperation has included training on monitoring, investigation and 
human rights reporting.  
</p>
<p>9. Tailored advice is provided on constitutional or legislative frameworks regarding the 
establishment of NHRIs, as well as on their nature, functions, powers and responsibilities. 
Comparative analysis, technical cooperation needs assessments, project formulation and 
evaluation missions are also undertaken to establish and strengthen the institutions&#8217; 
compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>10. During the reporting period, OHCHR provided advice to Afghanistan, Bahrain, 
Belize, Brazil, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Central African Republic, 
Chile, the Comoros, the Congo, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Finland, Georgia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Liberia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, 
Mongolia, Nauru, Nepal, the Netherlands, the Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan,

and discussed ways to strengthen those institutions to comply with the Paris Principles, 
including through OHCHR assistance. 
</p>
<p>49. The OHCHR Regional Office for West Africa is engaged in a process of developing 
the subregional network of NHRIs. Although formally created in 2006 in Banjul, the 
Gambia, the network is not yet operational. From 12 to 14 February 2009, OHCHR 
participated in a meeting organized by the Economic Community of West African States in 
Cotonou, Benin, and assisted in drafting the statute of the network. The statute was adopted 
in Banjul in October 2009, which resulted in the establishment of the network and the 
designation of its governing bodies. 
</p>

Conference was organized by OHCHR, the Advisory Council on Human Rights of 
Morocco, the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions and the Organisation 
Internationale de la Francophonie. The Conference adopted the Rabat Declaration, in which 
participants recognized the role of NHRIs in facilitating justice and peace and resolved to, 
among other things: (a) promote the interdependency of peace and justice; (b) raise 
awareness about international instruments on transitional justice; (c) facilitate national 
consultations for the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms; (d) ensure that such 
mechanisms are in compliance with international human rights standards and practices; (e)

techniques, facilitated by OHCHR and the Ombudsman of Ontario. 
</p>
<p>52. The meetings of the General Assembly and the Steering Committee of the Network 
of African National Human Rights Institutions were also held at the Conference in Rabat. 
The Moroccan NHRI was elected as the new Chairperson for the Network and the South 
African NHRI as the Vice-Chairperson. OHCHR will continue to provide technical and 
financial support to the secretariat of the Network. The Conference will be held in South 
Africa in 2011.

</b></p>
<p><b> III. Cooperation between United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>74. OHCHR has been supporting NHRI engagement with the Human Rights Council, in 
accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/74. Human Rights Council 
resolution 5/1 provides opportunities for institutions and their regional coordinating 
mechanisms to participate in the Human Rights Council and to engage with its various 
mechanisms. Institutions accredited with A status by the International Coordinating 
Committee, the Committee itself, and regional coordinating bodies speaking on behalf of 
A-status accredited institutions may participate and address the Council on all agenda 
items. They can also submit written statements, issue documentation (with a United Nations 
document symbol) and have separate seating arrangements at the Council sessions. 
</p><p>75. With regard to Council mechanisms, institutions have been given a clear and 
significant role by resolution 5/1, for example with regard to the universal periodic review, 
where their input is included in the stakeholders&#8217; report. OHCHR is assisting in the 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations concerning the 
establishment or strengthening of NHRIs, including supporting institutions in applying for 
International Coordinating Committee accreditation. 
</p>
<p>76. In 2009, 48 countries were reviewed under the universal periodic review. Of these, 
22 have an NHRI, 11 of which submitted information for the stakeholder&#8217;s report. Among 
them, nine hold A status and two, B status. The Network of National Institutions for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights of the Americas submitted two contributions 
regarding the universal periodic review of Chile and Uruguay.  
</p>
<p>77. In 2009, an average of 20 NHRIs participated in each of the Human Rights Council 
sessions. They were very active before and during the sessions, presenting statements, 
submitting written documentation, participating in general debates and interacting with the 
Special Rapporteurs.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>78. In 2009, 69 of the countries examined by treaty bodies had an NHRI. Of those 
institutions, 37 participated in the treaty body process, including by submitting alternative 
reports or attending the sessions. As an ongoing activity, OHCHR has systematically 
engaged with treaty bodies by providing expert analysis on NHRIs and their related 
activities. It also regularly updates a compilation of all treaty body concluding observations 
and recommendations that mention NHRIs (www.nhri.net), and sends the concluding 
observations to the institutions concerned.  
</p>
<p>79. On 26 October 2009, the International Coordinating Committee, with the 
International Disability Alliance and OHCHR, held a parallel event on cooperation between 
NHRIs and organizations of persons with disabilities in monitoring the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It was organized on the sidelines of the OHCHR 
consultations on national frameworks under the Convention. 
</p>
<p>80. The reports to the General Assembly of the Committee against Torture and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child have recognized the important role of NHRIs in their 
processes. The Human Rights Committee has a dedicated focal point for such institutions. 
In 2009, the secretariat of the Committee against Torture launched a website for NHRIs, 
with information on how to interact with it. </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10269 
</p>
<p><b> C. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>81. During the reporting period, a large number of NHRIs interacted with special 
procedures mandate holders and submitted to the Human Rights Council written 
contributions to complement the reports of special procedures mandate holders on country 
missions. 
</p>
<p>82. On 30 June 2009, as part of their 16th annual meeting, special procedures mandate 
holders, along with NHRIs and NGOs, held an interactive dialogue. The International 
Coordinating Committee representative in Geneva presented a statement on enhancing 
cooperation between NHRIs and such mandate holders, as part of the follow-up 
mechanisms developed by some special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>83. OHCHR regularly provides special procedures mandate holders with information 
concerning the work of NHRIs in the preparation of their country missions. Increasingly, 
such mandate holders look to institutions for assistance in ensuring that their 
recommendations are followed up at the national level. This is an important area of work 
for NHRIs and should be further encouraged. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Durban Review Conference  
</b></p>
<p>84. OHCHR supported NHRIs in participating actively in the Durban Review 
Conference, including by providing financial assistance to A-status institutions (with 
priority accorded to those from the least developed countries), developing an NHRI 
webpage on the official conference website, and working with the International 
Coordinating Committee working group on the Durban process. Representatives of 39 
NHRIs from all regions participated in the Conference. During a side event co-organized by 
OHCHR and the International Coordinating Committee to share best practices and key 
challenges, participants identified 14 priorities aimed at increasing their engagement against 
racism and related intolerance at the national, regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>85. NHRIs also identified a number of relevant follow-up activities: the establishment of 
focal points within institutions; the establishment of a network among focal points; and the 
sharing of good practices on the website www.nhri.net. OHCHR has allocated funding for 
specific follow-up activities, including supporting the South African Human Rights 
Commission. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Cooperation among the Office of the High Commissioner, 
United Nations agencies and programmes, and international 
and regional organizations on national human rights 
institutions

<p><b>  United Nations Development Programme 
</b></p>
<p>86. OHCHR and UNDP have increased the degree of cooperation on establishing and 
strengthening NHRIs, leading to an increasing range of activities, including an e-discussion 
on the United Nations Human Rights Policy Network (HuriTalk), joint technical 
cooperation projects, joint advocacy for the establishment of NHRIs, following up and 
building on universal periodic review and Subcommittee recommendations regarding 
institutions, joint capacity needs assessment and evaluation missions. In 2009, this range of 
activities has continued (see references throughout the present report).  </p>


<p>GE.10-10269 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>87. With UNDP and the NHRIs of Denmark, India, South Africa and Uganda, OHCHR 
developed a toolkit for United Nations country teams on how to support the establishment 
and consolidation of an NHRI. The toolkit was validated in Johannesburg in May 2009 by 
representatives of about 40 UNDP regional and country offices. It is expected that the 
toolkit will be officially launched by the High Commissioner and UNDP Administrator in 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>88. UNDP and OHCHR continued to cooperate on joint initiatives, such as supporting 
the capacity development of NHRIs in Asia and the Pacific, supporting the adoption of a 
document to assist institutions to implement a human rights-based approach to elections in 
the Arab region, and reinforcing the capacity of NHRIs from the Commonwealth of 
Independent States and Croatia to interact with the international human rights system.

Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, organized in May 2009. In 
September 2009, OHCHR participated in a workshop on implementation of treaty body 
decisions, through a presentation on the role of NHRIs in such implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Regional mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>96. OHCHR convened regional consultations on enhancing cooperation between 
regional and international mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
These consultations were held in November and December 2009 in Africa (Addis Ababa), 
in cooperation with the African Union; in the Americas (Washington, D.C.), in cooperation 
with the Organization of American States (OAS); and in Europe (Strasbourg, France), in 
cooperation with the Council of Europe. The purpose of the consultations was to share 
information on ways to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional 
human rights arrangements. Representatives of NHRIs participated in these consultations, 
where modalities of cooperation between the institutions and the regional arrangements 
were discussed.  
</p>
<p>97. On 4 June 2009, the General Assembly of the OAS adopted resolution AG/RES. 
2448 (XXXIX-O/09), in which it referred to the role of the International Coordinating 
Committee in accrediting national human rights institutions in conformity with the Paris 
Principles and resolved to use the list of institutions accredited by the Committee with &#8220;A&#8221; 
status as criteria to allow those institutions participation in OAS political bodies dealing 
with human rights-related issues. It provides for the modalities of NHRI participation, 
including the allocation of dedicated seats, the issuance of institution documents under their 
own classification and the possibility to make oral interventions. </p>


<p>GE.10-10269 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Round tables on thematic issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Transitional justice 
</b>98. In January 2009, OHCHR issued a guidance note on NHRIs and transitional justice, 
developed in consultation with experts and national institutions. It is to assist NHRIs in 
their engagement on transitional justice issues, describes challenges and opportunities, 
highlights applicable international standards, and makes recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Economic, social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>99. A side event to the twenty-second session of the International Coordinating 
Committee focused on NHRIs and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Panellists discussed the justiciability of economic, 
social and cultural rights and the role of NHRIs in implementing the Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>  Detention 
</b></p>
<p>100. NHRIs participated in a side event held during the twenty-second session of the 
International Coordinating Committee in March 2009, to share experience and initiatives on 
detention monitoring and contribute directly to a joint publication by Harvard University 
and OHCHR. The discussions focused on structural and policy issues in relation to 
detention monitoring.  
</p>
<p><b>  Torture prevention and the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment 
</b></p>
<p>101. NHRIs participated in a side event during the twenty-second session of the 
International Coordinating Committee to share experience in the implementation of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. The discussions showed that, while 
there is no set model for the creation of a national preventative mechanism, institutions 
have a significant role to play in relation to the implementation of the Optional Protocol, 
either by acting as national preventative mechanisms, coordinating the work of such 
mechanisms or interacting with the designated mechanism. The role of NHRIs at the 
international level (e.g., interactions with the Subcommittee on Prevention) was also noted.  
</p><p>102. In cooperation with the Association for the Prevention of Torture and the Asia-
Pacific Forum, OHCHR is currently finalizing the handbook for NHRIs on the prevention 
of torture, which will provide guidance, including through best practice from institutions 
acting as national preventative mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>  Human rights inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>103. In 2008 the Equality and Human Rights Commission of Great Britain launched a 
human rights inquiry aimed at assessing the progress in raising the awareness of human 
rights culture in the country. A parallel event was organized by OHCHR and the institution 
at the twelfth session of the Human Rights Council on 23 September 2009, to share the 
experience in conducting this inquiry.  </p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.10-10269 
</p>
<p><b>  The role of ombudsmen, mediators and national human rights 
institutions in the United Nations system of promotion and protection of 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p>104. With the support of their respective permanent missions in Geneva and OHCHR, the 
ombudsmen of Morocco and Sweden organized a parallel event during the twelfth session 
of the Human Rights Council in September 2009, on the role of the ombudsman, the 
mediator and national human rights institutions in the United Nations system of promotion 
and protection of human rights, as framed by General Assembly resolutions 63/169 and 
63/172.  
</p>
<p><b>  Business and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>105. On 6 October 2009, 30 representatives from NHRIs, NGOs and Member States met 
at a side event during the OHCHR consultation by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises. The side event, organized by the International Coordinating 
Committee in collaboration with OHCHR, was aimed at ensuring respect for international 
human rights standards at the corporate and business level. 
</p>
<p><b>  National human rights institutions as human rights defenders  
</b></p>
<p>106. On 6 and 7 November 2009, OHCHR, in collaboration with the NHRI of Morocco 
and the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions, organized a workshop 
aimed at strengthening the role of NHRIs as human rights defenders and protectors as well 
as at increasing participants&#8217; knowledge and understanding of international human rights 
standards protecting human rights defenders. The workshop, held in Rabat, was attended by 
representatives from institutions in Africa and the Special Rapporteur on human rights 
defenders. NHRIs shared best practices and highlighted challenges in conducting their 
mandates, including death threats, inadequate witness protection systems and the need to 
have more training in investigation techniques and monitoring. 
</p>
<p><b>  HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>107. OHCHR provided support to regional workshops on HIV/AIDS, in cooperation with 
the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the NHRIs of Denmark and 
Uganda. Regional workshops for NHRIs were held in Senegal (October 2009) and Peru 
(December 2009). Institutions were encouraged to ensure their greater involvement in 
national responses to HIV/AIDS, and the <i>Handbook on HIV and Human Rights for 
National Human Rights Institutions </i>was used as a tool.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b>108. <b>National human rights institutions compliant with the Paris Principles are key 
elements of a strong and effective national human rights protection system. They can 
help ensure the compliance of national laws and practices with international human 
rights norms; support governments to ensure their implementation; monitor and 
address at the national level core human rights concerns such as torture, arbitrary 
detention, human trafficking and human rights of migrants; support the work of 
human rights defenders; and contribute to eradicate all forms of discrimination.  </b></p>


<p>GE.10-10269 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Secretary-General encourages NHRIs to be strong pillars in the fight 
against impunity by ensuring the functioning of an effective justice system. They have 
a key role to play in relation to the administration of justice, including monitoring 
places of detention and working with law enforcement officers to promote the rule of 
law. NHRIs should strive to become an effective first port of call for victims of human 
rights violations, nationally.

<p>110. <b>The Secretary-General welcomes the adoption of the Rabat Declaration at the 
seventh Conference of African National Human Rights Institutions. The text is a 
testimony of the role of NHRIs in transitional justice in general as well as in 
facilitating and supporting the functioning of transitional justice mechanisms and 
processes, in order to ensure accountability, serve justice and achieve reconciliation 
and peace. NHRIs are encouraged to give due attention to the practical 
recommendations of the Declaration with respect to monitoring and establishing 
transitional justice mechanisms. 
</b>111. <b>The Secretary-General notes with appreciation the continuing work of the 
regional networks of NHRIs and encourages greater cooperation between the regional 
networks and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. He calls for 
NHRI cooperation with regional human rights mechanisms such as organs of the 
African Union, the Inter-American System and the European human rights 
mechanisms, and the development of regional human rights norms and jurisprudence. 
He recalls that regional human rights commissions and courts and NHRIs have a 
symbiotic relationship in the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The Secretary-General encourages NHRIs to continue to interact and 
cooperate with the United Nations human rights system and to advocate for the 
ratification and effective implementation of international human rights instruments. 
Since several new international human rights instruments, such as the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, give NHRIs a potential monitoring and implementation role, 
the Secretary-General encourages States parties to strengthen the mandate and 
capacity of NHRIs to enable them to fulfil this role effectively. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Secretary-General underlines the importance of the autonomy and 
independence of the ombudsmen, mediators and other NHRIs. The Secretary-General 
reiterates the call of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for greater 
cooperation between NHRIs and ombudsman institutions for the improvement of 
national human rights frameworks. He further encourages ombudsman institutions to 
comply with the Paris Principles, to strengthen their independence and increase their 
capacity to act as national protection mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The Secretary-General recognizes the active participation of NHRIs in the 
Durban Review Conference and welcomes the NHRI commitments to continue to 
support the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
The Secretary-General calls on States parties to continue to support NHRIs and other 
national stakeholders in the implementation of the outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference and action plans, including through legal reform at the national 
level.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Secretary-General reiterates the importance of the financial independence 
of NHRIs and autonomy for their effective performance, especially in times of 
financial crisis.  </b></p>

<p><b>  Draft notes on the Fifth Conference of the Arab National 
Human Rights Institutions on &#8220;Elections in the Arab World 
and their Impact on Human Rights&#8221;, Amman, Jordan, 
8&#8211;9 March 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Background 
</b></p>
<p> Under the patronage of H.E. Nader al-Dahabi, the Prime Minister of Jordan, a two-
day conference on the impact of elections on human rights in the Arab world was organized 
by the <b>National Center for Human Rights of Jordan (NCHRJ) </b>in cooperation with the 
<b>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) </b>in 
Amman, Jordan, from 8 to 9 March 2009. The Conference marked the fifth annual meeting 
of national human rights institutions (NHRIs) from the Arab Region. Between 70 and 80 
participants attended the sessions on both days, amongst whom were representatives of 
national human rights institutions (NHRIs) from Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia;<b>4</b> representatives of the 
countries which do not have NHRIs, such as Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, non-
governmental organizations from Jordan, Iraq and Bahrain, United Nations agencies such 
as OHCHR, UNESCO and UNDP, as well as international organizations such as the 
National Democratic Institute (NDI), amongst many others. 
 The Conference was opened with remarks from <b>His Excellency Dr. Adnan 
Badran</b>, President of the Board of Trustees of the NCHRJ, <b>Mr. Gianni Magazzeni</b>, 
OHCHR Coordinator of the National Institutions Unit, and <b>His Excellency Dr. Boutros 
Boutros Ghali</b>, President of the National Council for Human Rights in Egypt. The opening 
session was attended by the <b>Jordanian Prime Minister, H.E. Nader al-Dahabi</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>  Working sessions and discussion 
</b></p>
<p> The Conference was organized into seven working sessions, including a post-
Conference event on Israeli violations of human rights in Gaza presented by the 
Independent Commission for Human Rights of the Occupied Palestinian Territory<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p> Each session was dedicated to a particular topic related to the protection of human 
rights at times of elections. While the first day explored a wide range of themes on elections 
and human rights including international standards pertaining to the organization and 
conduct of free and fair elections, the second day focused more specifically on the role of 
NHRIs in promoting free and fair elections. Each session began with presentations of one to 
three speakers on the given topic. 
</p>
<p> Sufficient time was allocated at the end of the presentations for general discussion, 
questions and comments. The speakers included members of NHRIs, independent 
researchers, and international electoral experts. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 These institutions have both varying records of cooperation with United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>machinery and different levels of compliance with the international standards relating to national 
human rights institutions (&#8220;the Paris Principles&#8221;).  </p>


<p>GE.10-10269 <b>27 
</b></p>
<p> During the first session dedicated to the culture of elections and human rights in the 
Arab world, <b>Dr. Waleed Abdul Haai</b>, of NCHRJ, spoke of the effects of culture on the 
conduct of elections and protection of human rights during elections. He mentioned 
nationality laws and laws regulating the representation and voting rights of women as issues 
of concern that influence elections in the Arab world. The second presenter, <b>Mr. Michel 
Paternotre </b>of the Democracy Reporting International (DRI), reminded the participants of 
the international and regional standards, underlying in particular the importance of, inter 
alia, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, as well as a number of so-called soft law 
documents, such as various statements and the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR), which jointly prescribe in some detail the requirements necessary for the 
establishment of fair, free, transparent and democratic elections. 
</p>
<p> The ensuing debate revolved around the issue of culture as one of the determinants 
that shape the law, politics and consequently elections in the Arab-speaking world. 
</p>
<p> The second and the third sessions were dedicated to the fairness, transparency, and 
integrity of elections as a requirement for good governance and respect of human rights. 
</p>
<p> Following <b>Dr. Ali al-Sawi&#8217;s </b>presentation on legal guarantees for the protection of 
human rights during elections, <b>Mr. Mohammad Ojar</b>,<b> </b>of the Human Rights Advisory 
Council in Morocco, and <b>H.E. Ms. Asma Khader </b>of the NCHRJ, reflected on the linkages 
between elections and good governance, while noting the importance of the equality of 
inclusion and participation of women in the process of elections. <b>Ms. Khader </b>reiterated 
that democracy cannot exist without the participation and inclusion of women who, in some 
countries, constitute over 50 per cent of the overall population. In her presentation, she 
underlined the low percentages of women&#8217;s participation in high government positions in 
the Arab world. 
</p>
<p> The last session of the first day was dedicated to the review of standards for 
monitoring and evaluating elections, and the two speakers, <b>Mr. Michel Paternotre </b>of DRI 
and <b>Mr. Jonathan Stonestreet </b>of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(OSCE) shared their experiences in international elections monitoring the purpose of which 
is to assist the countries to identify gaps and areas in need of improvement. 
</p>
<p> The second day was entirely devoted to the work of NHRIs and their roles in times 
of elections, exploring, in particular, the necessity for establishing partnerships with the 
civil society organizations and the strengthening of democratic culture before, during and 
after the elections. 
</p>
<p> The second day thus commenced with discussion on ways to strengthen 
relationships and partnerships with non-governmental sector. The speakers, <b>Dr. Hussam 
Badrawi </b>of the National Council for Human Rights in Egypt and <b>Mr. Oraiab al-Rantawi 
</b>of Al-Quds Research Center. 
 Jordan, discussed the role of NHRIs as an intermediary and link between the civil 
society and the government and their ability to support the advancement of the civil society 
sector by promoting human rights culture, raising awareness on the necessity for elections 
monitoring and engaging in education and training activities on elections monitoring for 
civil society organizations. <b>Mr. al-Rantawi </b>noted that the role of NHRIs starts with the law 
on elections and the need to ensure that electoral laws conform to international standards. 
</p>
<p> During the sixth session dedicated to the role of NHRIs prior, during and after 
elections, the representatives of NHRIs of Morocco, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and 
Jordan shared their experiences pertaining to the engagement of their respective NHRIs in 
elections advocacy, monitoring and follow-up. <b>Mr. Abderrazak Rouwane </b>of Morocco 
described in some detail the organization and engagement of the Human Rights Advisory </p>


<p><b>28</b> GE.10-10269 
</p>
<p>Council in Moroccan elections monitoring. <b>Mrs. Randa Al-Siniora </b>of the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory described the immense difficulties faced by the Palestinian elections 
observers during parliamentary and presidential elections in the occupied territories due to 
the severe limitation in access and movement across numerous checkpoints. <b>Dr. Ali al-
Dabbas </b>of Jordan spoke of the engagement in advocacy (during and after the passing of the 
Jordanian electoral law) by the National Center for Human Rights and described the 
difficulties faced by the NCHRJ observers in terms of obtaining licenses and approval to 
access polling sites by Jordanian authorities. 
</p>
<p> OHCHR Regional Representative, <b>Mr. Fateh Azzam</b>,<b> </b>facilitated the last working 
session entitled &#8220;Next Steps for NHRIs: Identification of Challenges, Opportunities and the 
required Support: A Road-Map for the Future&#8221;. During the session, the speakers, His 
Excellency <b>Dr. Muhyieddeen Touq</b>,<b> </b>Commissioner General of the National Center for 
Human Rights of Jordan, and <b>Mr. Habib Sleem </b>of the Higher Committee on Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Tunisia (<i>Le Comit&#233; sup&#233;rieur des droits de l&#8217;homme 
et des libert&#233;s fondamentales</i>) summarized the discussions and findings of the past two 
days, reiterating the need for closer partnerships with the civil society organizations, 
advocacy for clear legislations, importance of having NHRIs not shy away from 
complicated and sensitive issues and the need for the NHRIs to complement the good work 
of the civil society. Following their presentations, representatives of other NHRIs presented 
their proposals for future action and follow-up, adopting, towards the end of the session, a 
series of recommendations, as well as a concept of a letter on the recommendations to be 
shared with the participants, Arab States and Arab regional organizations. The Conference 
was closed by brief remarks by <b>His Excellency Dr. Muhyieddeen Touq </b>and <b>Mr. Gianni 
Magazzeni </b>of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations and final points 
</b></p>
<p> The following points related to the role of NHRIs in connection with elections were 
agreed upon: 
</p>
<p> 1. To officially distribute the report and recommendations resulting from the 
Conference to the participants, States and regional Arab organizations; 
</p>
<p> 2. To engage the ICC of NHRIs and regional coordinating bodies and other civil 
society organizations in connection with NHRI role in elections; i.e. developing election 
laws and election procedures; 
</p>
<p> 3. Develop a database of NHRIs best practices and lessons learned in 
connection with elections; 
</p>
<p> 4. To ensure relevant international standards for the holding of free and fair 
elections are reflected in domestic laws and practices and ensure that governments are 
provided with the necessary assistance concerning the conditions for holding free and fair 
elections; 
</p>
<p> 5. To assist with the creation and development of independent electoral 
commissions; 
</p>
<p> 6. To monitor the human rights aspects of election before and during the 
elections in cooperation with independent national and international observers; 
</p>
<p> 7. To ensure follow-up action by the government and other State entities in 
connection with recommendations related to electorate laws and election procedures as well 
as those resulting from electoral observers missions; </p>

</b></p>
<p> 8. To take a public stand on the conduct of elections and their results and 
publicize these stands in different fora; 
</p>
<p> 9. To advocate the application of the principle of democratic change of 
government in conditions which respect the constitution; 
</p>
<p> 10. To ensure that adequate training of relevant international standards is 
provided to national actors and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p> The Conference has also adopted a letter which contains a set of recommendations 
regarding elections and democratic life, to be sent to the 21st Arab summit meeting which 
was due to be held in Doha, Qatar on 30 March 2009. Additionally, the Conference agreed 
to include a fixed agenda item under the title &#8220;review of implementations of previous 
recommendations&#8221; in the agenda of each conference. Consequently the NHRIs are 
requested to present a review of their implementation of the Amman conference in the next 
meeting in Morocco. 
</p>
<p> At the suggestion of the Moroccan representative, it was decided that the next, VI 
Conference of Arab NHRIs will be held in Morocco in 2010 on the theme of the role of 
NHRIs in strengthening the rule of law in the Arab region. The next Conference will also 
discuss the establishment of a so-called &#8220;troika&#8221;, i.e., a secretariat composed of three 
members that would assist with organization of future NHRIs conferences. </p>

<p><b>  Survey on national human rights institutions  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the recommendations of a questionnaire addressed to 
national human rights institutions worldwide 
</b></p>
<p><b> Recommendation:</b> OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors, 
should support NHRIs to prioritize advocacy with their government for the revision and 
strengthening of the legal framework of those NHRIs established by an executive 
instrument. Recommendations from United Nations treaty bodies, the SPMHs, and the UPR 
in the Human Rights Council, as well as the ICC Sub-Committee on Accreditation may all 
support the expansion of the mandate of NHRIs.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors, 
should support activities that explore and gather best practice on the types of legal 
provisions (e.g. membership criteria, appointment processes) ensure the governing body is 
effective and diverse in practice. Data on other mechanisms of ensuring pluralism within an 
institution, beyond the composition of its governing body, would also be useful.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, interested donors, should 
support NHRIs to prioritize advocacy with governments for the revision and strengthening 
of procedural requirements for the selection and appointment of members.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>as the ICC&#8217;s General Observations state that dismissal or forced 
resignation of a member may result in a review of the institution&#8217;s accreditation, 
strengthening legal requirements for dismissal (building on the best practice examples 
provided by respondents) should be a priority. OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and 
interested donors should support NHRIs in securing such legal requirements.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors, 
should prioritize activities to develop the capacity of NHRIs to effectively manage the 
relationship with their relevant government department, including in budget allocation. In 
addition, they could also prioritize continued advocacy with member States to ensure they 
meet their obligation to provide adequate resources.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors, 
should prioritize further training and capacity development for NHRI staff across all levels. 
They should also prioritize support for institutions to develop human resource plans to 
increase staff effectiveness, career development and diversity.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
prioritize support to institutions to improve their accessibility, with a particular focus on 
reaching out to vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
prioritize work with NHRIs, in the framework of the Nairobi Declaration, to effectively 
implement their core protection functions, particularly in detention monitoring. Follow-up 
research with NHRIs to collect best practice on collaboration and coordination with other 
visiting bodies is also important to explore, to address any potential protection gaps.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors, 
should prioritize further guidance to NHRIs in relation to their activities for human rights 
defenders, including by systematically collecting and disseminating examples of best </p>


<p>GE.10-10269 <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>practice. Capacity-building activities for NHRIs, particularly in Africa, to support human 
rights defenders (generally and in cases threat) should also be prioritized.  
<b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
prioritize support to institutions to develop strategies for follow-up where they do not exist 
and strengthen them where they do. Advocacy for strengthened legal frameworks that 
require the State to formally respond to institutions&#8217; recommendations is also another 
important medium- and long-term priority.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
consider providing support to NHRIs in this area, as well as developing mechanisms to 
encourage institutions to pool educational and research material.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
facilitate increased awareness raising for both NHRIs and NGOs on each others respective 
roles, for example through joint activities. Support for the strengthening of legal provisions 
that require NHRIs to establish formal relationships with civil society is also another 
important medium- and long-term priority (only 45 per cent of respondents indicated that 
their founding law contains such a provision).  
<b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
facilitate and assist NHRIs direct engagement with these organizations, thus also increasing 
the level of awareness about the work of NHRIs.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
consider extending support to institutions to overcome budgetary constraints to improve 
participation rates in ICC events. Respondents also made a number of valuable suggestions 
on how to enhance the benefits of ICC meetings, which OHCHR should work with the ICC 
and the RCCs to implement.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
facilitate capacity-building missions, encourage increased cooperation and provide 
opportunities for working experiences with regional networks. Comments from respondents 
particularly noted the educational value in these types of activities. To facilitate this, such 
bodies may consider supporting the establishment and strengthening of regional and 
subregional networks of NHRIs.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR should further consult with NHRIs on their 
experiences of working with the United Nations at the country level, as respondents did not 
generally comment on this in their responses. Collecting examples of best practice in 
relation to coordination and collaboration between NHRIs and field presences would also 
be valuable.  
</p>
<p><b> Recommendation: </b>OHCHR, UNDP, RCCs of NHRIs, and interested donors should 
prioritize continued training to NHRIs on the international human rights system. However, 
they should explore methods of doing so that are less resource-intensive for NHRIs and 
reach the broadest number of staff. This could include &#8220;train the trainers&#8221; workshops for 
identified focal points on international engagement and developing online or distance 
training materials.
