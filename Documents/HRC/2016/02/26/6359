<p><b>7/&#8230;  Prevention of genocide 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as well as other 
relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that the sixtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted on 9 December 1948 and succeeded by the 
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the next day, provides an important 
opportunity for the international community to draw the attention of all States to the significance 
of the Convention and to invite them to redouble their efforts for the prevention and punishment 
of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that the crime of genocide<b> </b>is recognized in the Convention as an odious 
scourge which has inflicted great losses on humanity and that further international cooperation is 
required for the effective functioning of mechanisms for the prevention, halting and punishment 
of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> about the occurrence in recent history of genocide, recognized as such 
by the international community, on the basis of and as defined in the 1948 Convention, and 
bearing in mind that massive, serious and systematic violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law might result in genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into consideration </i>that States parties to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of 
Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 have 
agreed that no statutory limitation shall apply to such crimes, including the crime of genocide, 
irrespective of the date of their commission, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> that impunity for such crimes encourages their occurrence and is a fundamental 
obstacle to the furtherance of cooperation among peoples and the promotion of international 
peace and security, and that fighting impunity for such crimes is an important factor in their 
prevention, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the significant progress made by the international community in the 
past 60 years, including within the United Nations system, in developing conceptual<b> </b>frameworks 
and relevant mechanisms and practices to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, thereby 
contributing to the effective implementation of the Convention, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, in which the 
Assembly declared genocide a crime under international law, and all subsequent resolutions 
within the United Nations system that have contributed to the establishment and development of 
the system of prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging with appreciation</i> that genocide is defined among the most serious crimes 
of concern to the international community as a whole in the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court,<b>1</b> and that the high number of ratifications of the Statute should help to increase 
accountability for the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the Council is mandated by the General Assembly to address situations of 
violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations, and to make 
recommendations thereon, and that it should also promote the effective coordination and 
mainstreaming of human rights within the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the important contribution of the United Nations human rights machinery to 
efforts towards preventing situations in which the crime of genocide could be committed, </p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> its full support for the mission of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General 
on the prevention of genocide, which bears significant potential for strengthening early warning 
mechanisms to prevent potential situations that could result in genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the reports of the Secretary-General submitted to the Council on the 
implementation of the Five-Point Action Plan and the activities of the Special Adviser,<b>2</b> as well 
as the continued interactive dialogue with the Special Adviser at both the third and current 
sessions of the Council, </p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms</i> the significance of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
the Crime of Genocide as an effective international instrument for the prevention and 
punishment of the crime of genocide; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  A/CONF.183/9. 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  E/CN.4/2006/84 and A/HRC/7/37. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 2.<i> Expresses its appreciation</i> to all States that have ratified or acceded to the 
Convention, and in particular to the States that have done so in the years following the adoption 
of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/62 of 20 April 2005; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Calls upon </i>States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Convention to consider 
doing so as a matter of high priority and, where necessary, to enact national legislation in 
conformity with the provisions of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Reiterates </i>the responsibility of each individual State to protect its population from 
genocide, which entails the prevention of<b> </b>such a crime, including incitement to it, through 
appropriate and necessary means; 
</p>
<p> 5.<b> </b><i>Recognizes</i> the need expressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 60/1 to 
continue consideration of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide and its 
implications, bearing in mind the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and 
international law, as well as the intention of the States, as reflected in that resolution, to commit 
themselves, as necessary and appropriate, to helping States build their capacity to protect their 
populations from genocide and to assisting those that are under stress before crises and conflicts 
break out; 
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Stresses</i> the importance of enhanced international cooperation, including through the 
United Nations system and through regional organizations, aimed at fostering the principles 
enshrined in the Convention; </p>
<p> 7.<i> Calls upon</i> all States, in seeking to address the failures that preceded past crimes of 
genocide and to deter future occurrences, to cooperate, including through the United Nations 
system, in consolidating the mechanisms that contribute to early detection and prevention of 
massive, serious and systematic violations of human rights, which if not halted, could lead to 
genocide; 
</p>
<p> 8.<i> Recognizes</i> the important role of the Secretary-General in ensuring prompt 
consideration of early warning or prevention cases, as mandated by Security Council 
resolution 1366 (2001) of 30 August 2001, and the functions of the Special Adviser, who, as </p>

 <p></p>
<p>outlined in his mandate, will, inter alia, collect existing information, in particular from within the 
United Nations system, on massive and serious violations of international<b> </b>human rights law and 
international humanitarian law of ethnic and racial origin that, if not prevented or halted, might 
lead to genocide, and liaise with the United Nations system on activities for the prevention of 
genocide and work to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to analyse and manage 
information relating to genocide or related crimes; 
</p>
<p> 9.<i> Welcomes</i> the decision of the Secretary-General to retain the mandate of the 
Special Adviser and to strengthen his office, and to assist his work through the Advisory 
Committee on the Prevention of Genocide; 
</p>
<p> 10.<i> Requests</i> all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Adviser in the 
performance of his work, to furnish all information requested and to react promptly to his urgent 
appeals; </p>
<p> 11. <i>Underlines</i> the special role of the United Nations human rights system, including of 
the Council, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
relevant special procedures and treaty bodies in addressing the challenge of collating 
information, and thereby contributing to a better understanding of complex situations and early 
warning signs; 
</p>
<p> 12.<i> Encourages</i> the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, the Special Adviser 
for the Responsibility to Protect and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to further 
enhance the systematic exchange of information between their offices and between the Special 
Adviser and all relevant special procedures, including those concerned with the promotion and 
protection of human rights of persons belonging to the groups as outlined in article II of the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; 
</p>
<p> 13.<i> Emphasizes </i>the importance, when addressing specific situations, of a prompt and 
comprehensive examination of multiple factors that constitute a risk of genocide, including legal 
factors, the identification of groups at risk, violations of human rights which might become </p>

 <p></p>
<p>massive or serious and other precipitating factors, such as the resurgence of genocidal behaviour 
or systematic discrimination, the prevalence of expressions of hate speech targeting persons 
belonging to national, ethnic, racial or religious groups, especially if they are uttered in the 
context of an actual or potential outbreak of violence; 
</p>
<p> 14.<i> Encourages</i> States to make use of appropriate international and regional forums to 
address the issue of prevention of genocide, including the preparatory process for the Review 
Conference on the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; 
</p>
<p> 15.<i> Encourages</i> Governments, in cooperation with international and<b> </b>regional 
organizations and civil society, to promote human rights education activities and disseminate 
knowledge of the principles of the Convention, paying particular attention to the principles of 
prevention, including, as appropriate,<b> </b>the two reports of the Secretary-General submitted to the 
Council and the list of possible warning signs that might lead to genocide;<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p> 16.<i> Requests</i> the High Commissioner for Human Rights to disseminate the reports of the 
Secretary-General submitted to the Council and the list of possible warning signs that might lead 
to genocide<b>3</b> as broadly as possible, including to field missions, and to share the reports with 
other relevant United Nations and international and regional organizations and agencies 
concerned with human rights, relief and humanitarian activities; 
</p>
<p> 17.<i> Invites </i>the High Commissioner, as a matter of high priority and in consultations with 
States, to elaborate and implement appropriate commemorative events to mark the sixtieth 
anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 
having also in mind the commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration 
on Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> 18.<i> Also invites</i> the High Commissioner, as part of the commemorative events, and as an 
important contribution to developing preventive strategies and institutions and supporting the 
activities of the Special Adviser, to organize within existing resources a seminar on the
