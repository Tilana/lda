<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 11/10, the Human Rights Council decided to establish the mandate 
</p>
<p>of the independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan. It also decided that 
</p>
<p>the independent expert would assume the mandate and responsibilities of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, as previously set out in Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 6/34, 6/35, 7/16 and 9/17. In its resolution 15/27, the Council extended the 
</p>
<p>mandate of the independent expert for a period of one year and requested him to report to 
</p>
<p>the Council at its eighteenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report covers the period from 1 September 2010 to 30 June 2011. In 
</p>
<p>compliance with the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council,1 a draft of the report has been shared with the Government of the Sudan 
</p>
<p>and the Government of South Sudan in order to provide them with an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>comment on the observations and findings of the independent expert.  
</p>
<p>3. The present report is based on information made available to the independent expert 
</p>
<p>during his visits to the Sudan, from 6 to 13 March 2011, and from 31 May to 8 June 2011, 
</p>
<p>as well as from information provided by the Government of the Sudan, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur 
</p>
<p>(UNAMID) and other sources, including United Nations agencies, funds and programmes 
</p>
<p>with operational competence in the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert wishes to thank the Government of the Sudan and the 
</p>
<p>Government of South Sudan, UNMIS, UNAMID, the United Nations agencies in the 
</p>
<p>Sudan, the diplomatic corps and members of civil society organizations for their 
</p>
<p>cooperation and invaluable assistance. 
</p>
<p>  
  1 Human Rights Council resolution 5/2, annex. </p>


<p><b> II.  Key developments in the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>5. In accordance with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the historic referendum on 
</p>
<p>the self-determination for South Sudan was held as scheduled on 9 January 2011. In the 
</p>
<p>lead-up to the referendum, a number of inflammatory remarks were made by State officials 
</p>
<p>concerning the fate of southerners in the North should the vote be in favour of secession. As 
</p>
<p>a result, thousands of southerners were compelled to relocate to the South for fear of being 
</p>
<p>targeted. A week before the referendum, however, the Government pledged to respect the 
</p>
<p>outcome of the referendum and to continue to contribute to the development of southern 
</p>
<p>Sudan as a new nation if it opted for separation. 
</p>
<p>6. On 2 February 2011, the South Sudan Referendum Commission announced the 
</p>
<p>official results of the referendum, confirming that more than 98 per cent of electors had 
</p>
<p>voted in favour of secession. On the same day, the President of the Sudan signed a decree 
</p>
<p>confirming his Government&#8217;s acceptance of the results. In spite of the outbreak of violence 
</p>
<p>in the border areas during the voting period, the overall process proceeded peacefully and 
</p>
<p>was acknowledged by the international community as free and credible, and a true 
</p>
<p>reflection of the will of the people of southern Sudan. 
</p>
<p>7. Following the referendum, the wave of public discontent with a number of 
</p>
<p>Governments in the Middle East and North Africa emboldened students, political activists 
</p>
<p>and human rights actors to demand political reforms and the formation of a broad-based 
</p>
<p>Government in Khartoum. The demonstrations were quelled by the Sudanese police and the 
</p>
<p>security forces. More than 70 people, including journalists and members of political 
</p>
<p>opposition groups, were arrested, some of them injured in the process. Many were released 
</p>
<p>shortly after their arrest without being charged. However, an unknown number were held in 
</p>
<p>custody long after the riots. According to United Nations reports, some of the detainees 
</p>
<p>were subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment while in custody.  </p>


<p>8. While the referendum was a milestone in the implementation of the Comprehensive 
</p>
<p>Peace Agreement, very little progress was made by either party to the Agreement to resolve 
</p>
<p>the remaining issues of it, including the Abyei referendum, border demarcation, 
</p>
<p>arrangements for citizenship, the sharing of wealth and debt between the two parties and 
</p>
<p>security arrangements. A separate referendum for the disputed region of Abyei was 
</p>
<p>scheduled to be held simultaneously with the southern Sudan referendum to decide whether 
</p>
<p>the region would join the new South or remain with the North. The referendum was 
</p>
<p>cancelled owing to the failure of the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement to 
</p>
<p>agree on key issues, such as voter eligibility and the composition of the referendum 
</p>
<p>commission. The delay in the holding of the referendum led to an escalation in violence 
</p>
<p>between the different ethnic groups in the region, as well as between the Sudan Armed 
</p>
<p>Forces (SAF) and the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army (SPLA), which culminated in the 
</p>
<p>seizure and occupation of Abyei by the SAF in May and the displacement of the town&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>entire population.  
</p>
<p>9. Violence also broke out in the key border State of Southern Kordofan between the 
</p>
<p>SAF and the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement, Northern Branch (SPLM-North) 
</p>
<p>following a disputed State election early in May 2011. The situation deteriorated 
</p>
<p>significantly amidst aerial bombardment by the SAF of SPLA positions in areas around the 
</p>
<p>State capital of Kadugli. The hostilities caused the displacement of more than 73,000 
</p>
<p>people. Humanitarian access to the areas affected by the violence continues to be denied by 
</p>
<p>the SAF, citing security concerns. 
</p>
<p>10. Since the referendum, hundreds of civilians have been killed as a result of inter-
</p>
<p>communal violence in South Sudan. In addition, fighting has also intensified between the 
</p>
<p>SPLA and rebel militia groups in the States of Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile, causing the 
</p>
<p>death of several hundred people and leading to the displacement of more than 30,000 
</p>
<p>civilians. The threats to civilians remain substantial and are likely to increase.  </p>


<p>11. Since December 2010, the security situation in Darfur has continued to deteriorate as 
</p>
<p>a result of intense fighting between Government forces and armed movements. Many 
</p>
<p>civilians have been displaced as a result of the fighting. UNAMID was unable to have 
</p>
<p>access to many areas affected by the fighting despite its mandate to protect civilians under 
</p>
<p>imminent threat of physical violence. Both Government and rebel authorities repeatedly 
</p>
<p>blocked peacekeepers and humanitarian agencies at various times from providing assistance 
</p>
<p>to vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>12. The Sudan was reviewed within the context of the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>mechanism of the Human Rights Council in May 2011. Some of the positive developments 
</p>
<p>noted in the presentation of the Government2 included the implementation of key aspects of 
</p>
<p>the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, such as the holding of general elections in 2010 
</p>
<p>and the successful conduct of the South Sudan referendum. In spite of these achievements, 
</p>
<p>a number of concerns and issues were raised by delegations during the review, including 
</p>
<p>continuing discriminatory laws against women, sexual and gender-based violence, 
</p>
<p>(prevalent in the conflict areas of Darfur and southern Sudan), media censorship and the 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrest of human rights defenders and journalists. More than 160 recommendations 
</p>
<p>ranging from the establishment of a national human rights commission compliant with the 
</p>
<p>Paris Principles to the reform of the State national security apparatus were proposed for 
</p>
<p>adoption by the Government of the Sudan.3 
</p>
<p>13. The Government of the Sudan suspended the operation of the Khartoum and Darfur 
</p>
<p>human rights forums, which had served as a useful mechanism for the exchange of 
</p>
<p>information and dialogue on human rights concerns among the Government, the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and international partners. The forums have not met since the previous report of the 
</p>
<p>independent expert to the Human Rights Council in September 2010. The Government has 
</p>
<p>stated that it is evaluating the effectiveness of the forums as a means of constructive 
</p>
<p>  
  2 A/HRC/WG.6/11/SDN/1. 
  3 A/HRC/18/16. </p>


<p>dialogue, and hopes to resume them shortly. In Darfur, while the establishment of human 
</p>
<p>rights subforums in North and West Darfur was welcomed as a positive step towards 
</p>
<p>cooperation between UNAMID and local authorities, only the West Darfur subforum has 
</p>
<p>operated successfully. The subforum in North Darfur has been repeatedly postponed.  
</p>
<p>14. On 19 October 2010, the United Nations, in conjunction with the Government of 
</p>
<p>South Sudan, the diplomatic community and civil society, launched the Southern Sudan 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Forum. The Forum will identify strategies to address human rights 
</p>
<p>challenges in Southern Sudan, including advocacy and support for capacity-building 
</p>
<p>activities. In its resolution 10/11, in which the Human Rights Council established the 
</p>
<p>mandate of the independent expert, the Council requested the mandate holder to engage 
</p>
<p>with the human rights forums in the Sudan.  
</p>
<p><b> III.  Northern Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Sudan has made some noteworthy progress in human rights promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection, including upholding political rights and freedoms during the South Sudan self-
</p>
<p>determination referendum. Although the pre-registration period was marked by threatening 
</p>
<p>political rhetoric and provocative statements made by officials of the ruling National 
</p>
<p>Congress Party against southerners living in the North, the overall referendum process was 
</p>
<p>hailed by the international community as a major achievement. Both the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Sudan and the Government of Southern Sudan made tremendous efforts to ensure a 
</p>
<p>peaceful and credible referendum process, the results of which were readily accepted. The 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan is also more engaged with the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, and participated effectively in the universal periodic review in May 2011.  
</p>
<p>16. In spite of the above-mentioned achievements, the Sudan continues to face daunting 
</p>
<p>human rights challenges in terms of securing basic fundamental rights, in particular the 
</p>
<p>right to liberty and security of person and the right to freedom of expression, and the 
</p>
<p>effective administration of justice. The Government has remained adamant that it will open </p>


<p>up more political space for the full realization of human rights. In spite of the goodwill 
</p>
<p>engendered by the successful conduct of the South Sudan referendum, there remains a lack 
</p>
<p>of meaningful and regular dialogue between the Government and civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>for the promotion and protection of human rights.   
</p>
<p>17. Cases of arbitrary arrest and detention by the National Security Service (NSS) 
</p>
<p>remained a major concern during the reporting period. The body continues to arrest and 
</p>
<p>detain people for prolonged periods without charge, and sometimes without the possibility 
</p>
<p>of family visits. There were also allegations of incommunicado detention, torture and other 
</p>
<p>forms of ill-treatment of detainees by the NSS. The independent expert&#8217;s repeated requests 
</p>
<p>to meet with the Director General of the NSS to discuss these concerns were declined 
</p>
<p>during both of his visits to the Sudan during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p>18. Between late October and early November 2010, a group of human rights activists 
</p>
<p>from Darfur affiliated with a radio station (Radio Dabanga) were arrested and held 
</p>
<p>incommunicado by the NSS. The detainees were not charged, provided with counsel or 
</p>
<p>given the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of their detention. Nine of the activists 
</p>
<p>were released between 13 and 21 January 2011, while five remained in custody. One of the 
</p>
<p>released activists told human rights monitors that he had been beaten by NSS agents during 
</p>
<p>interrogation sessions. On 13 February, four of the released activists were re-arrested. Six 
</p>
<p>of them are currently standing trial for various offences under the Criminal Act 1991, three 
</p>
<p>of which carry the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>19. Following the demonstration in January 2011 in Khartoum and other places in 
</p>
<p>Northern Sudan, UNMIS documented more than 100 arrests made by the NSS. Most of the 
</p>
<p>detainees were released the same day. More than 30, however, remained in detention until 
</p>
<p>the end of February without being charged. Many of them reported having been mistreated 
</p>
<p>while in NSS custody. During the same time,  a number of targeted arrests of journalists 
</p>
<p>and other persons working in the media were made. Six journalists working for local 
</p>
<p>newspapers were arrested by the NSS and one foreign news media journalist was arrested </p>


<p>by the police. They were all released without charge. A second wave of arrests was made 
</p>
<p>on 2 February, when the NSS detained eight journalists working with a newspaper affiliated 
</p>
<p>with the Sudan Communist Party, together with nine employees of the newspaper. While all 
</p>
<p>detainees were eventually released, some were kept for long periods without charge.  
</p>
<p>20. In mid-January 2011, Dr. Hassan al-Turabi, the leader of the opposition of the 
</p>
<p>Popular Congress Party, together with nine members of the Party was arrested by the NSS. 
</p>
<p>The arrests followed statements made by the Party leader that the Government could face a 
</p>
<p>popular uprising similar to the ones witnessed in some Arab countries if it continued to 
</p>
<p>resist calls for democratic reforms. All 10 men were released in May, but were never 
</p>
<p>charged with any offence. 
</p>
<p>21. On 14 December 2010, the NSS arrested a 60-year old man for his role in planning a 
</p>
<p>demonstration in Khartoum by a women&#8217;s group calling for an end to the discriminatory 
</p>
<p>use of public order laws. The man was held incommunicado and had no access to relatives 
</p>
<p>or a lawyer prior to being released. 
</p>
<p>22. Freedom of expression and assembly were subjected to restrictions throughout the 
</p>
<p>reporting period. A number of media organizations, non-governmental organizations and 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders reported increasing harassment and censorship, particularly by the 
</p>
<p>NSS. For example, on the night of 19 January 2011, NSS agents raided the premises of two 
</p>
<p>Khartoum newspapers, <i>Ajrass Al Hurriya</i> and <i>Al Sahafa</i>, and ordered editors not to 
</p>
<p>distribute their daily editions of the papers without NSS approval. The NSS intervention 
</p>
<p>interrupted the operation of the newspapers for two days. Another Khartoum newspaper, 
</p>
<p>the <i>Khartoum Monitor</i>, had its publication suspended on 22 and 23 December 2010 for 
</p>
<p>having published an article on the subject &#8220;HIV and religion&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>23. During his first visit to the Sudan in 2011 year, the independent expert was informed 
</p>
<p>that a Special Prosecutor has been appointed by the Minister for Justice to monitor 
</p>
<p>detentions made by the NSS. In spite of this, the independent expert remains concern about 
</p>
<p>the wide discretionary powers granted to the NSS. He notes the lack of judicial oversight </p>


<p>over arrests and detention and the current legal framework under which the NSS operates, 
</p>
<p>which does not fully encompass human rights principles and respect for the rule of law. The 
</p>
<p>2005 Interim National Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and freedom from 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrests and detention. In addition, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement explicitly 
</p>
<p>states that the national security mandate &#8220;shall be advisory and focused on information 
</p>
<p>gathering and analysis&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>25. On a positive note, more than 2,000 detainees convicted of minor crimes were 
</p>
<p>released from the Khartoum State penitentiary in August 2010 to avoid overcrowding, 
</p>
<p>pursuant to the recommendations made by the Human Rights Committee of the National 
</p>
<p>Assembly. The Committee visited the prisons and concluded that the overcrowding was due 
</p>
<p>to a large presence of prisoners convicted of minor crimes, including alcohol brewing. Most 
</p>
<p>offenders were from the South and had been unfairly subjected to the application of sharia 
</p>
<p>law, even though they were not Muslim.  
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Transitional areas 
</b></p>
<p><b>  A. Abyei 
</b></p>
<p>26. The future status of Abyei remains the greatest challenge to the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In accordance with the Agreement, the small oil-rich 
</p>
<p>territory of Abyei straddling the North-South border was scheduled to hold a referendum on 
</p>
<p>the same date as the referendum on South Sudan. Owing to disputes over voter eligibility 
</p>
<p>and the composition of the Abyei Referendum Commission, the Commission was never 
</p>
<p>formed and the vote was never held. The Agreement stipulates that voting rights should be 
</p>
<p>given to the Ngok Dinka and other &#8220;Sudanese residing in the area&#8221;. The Government in the 
</p>
<p>North demanded that members of the Misseriya nomadic tribe, who spend up to six months 
</p>
<p>of the year in Abyei, should be considered residents. During his second visit, the 
</p>
<p>independent expert met with leaders of the Misseriya community in Khartoum regarding </p>


<p>their grievances over migration rights in the Abyei territory. The SPLM, on the other hand, 
</p>
<p>holds the view that the Misseriya are only in Abyei for a short period of the year, and 
</p>
<p>should not be allowed to vote in the referendum.  
</p>
<p>27. Tensions began rising when it became clear that the Abyei referendum would not be 
</p>
<p>held as scheduled, and both the SAF and the SPLA increased their presence in the region in 
</p>
<p>anticipation of future clashes. In the run-up to the South Sudan referendum, fighting 
</p>
<p>erupted between Misseriya militias and the Abyei police in several locations in the region, 
</p>
<p>which resulted in casualties on both sides and the displacement of a large number of 
</p>
<p>civilians. Dialogue mediated by the United Nations resulted in the signing of two 
</p>
<p>agreements, in Kadugli on 13 and 17 January. The agreement provided for the disarming of 
</p>
<p>the feuding parties and allowed southerners returning from the North free movement 
</p>
<p>through Abyei, while guaranteeing the Misseriya limited grazing rights through the Abyei 
</p>
<p>corridor. The agreement also provided for the withdrawal of the Abyei police unit to be 
</p>
<p>replaced by two new battalions of joint integrated units  composed of SPLA and SAF 
</p>
<p>troops. While the parties committed to demilitarization, extensive military build-up by both 
</p>
<p>sides continued on the ground, leading to further clashes, including an attack on a SAF 
</p>
<p>convoy on 1 May, which reportedly killed 11 SAF soldiers. 
</p>
<p>28. On 19 May, a United Nations convoy escorting SAF joint integrated units was 
</p>
<p>ambushed by the SPLA in violation of the Kadugli agreement. Sudanese authorities 
</p>
<p>reported that at least 22 of its soldiers were killed in the attack. On 21 May, the SAF 
</p>
<p>retaliated by launching a full-scale aerial and ground offensive that culminated in the 
</p>
<p>seizure and occupation of Abyei. The attack involved the use of heavy artillery, tanks and 
</p>
<p>aircraft and the bombing of several villages in the area. Two UNMIS peacekeepers were 
</p>
<p>injured when several shells fired by the SAF landed at the Mission compound. Most town 
</p>
<p>residents managed to flee before the attack. An estimated 110,000 Abyei residents are 
</p>
<p>believed to have fled southwards to various parts of South Sudan, including Agok and 
</p>
<p>Turalei and other villages in Northern and Western Bahr el Ghazal, Unity and Warrap </p>


<p>States. The Government of the Sudan unilaterally dissolved the regional administrative 
</p>
<p>council and removed the head of the Abyei administration. It is alleged that Misseriya 
</p>
<p>tribesmen, with the support of SAF troops, invaded Abyei and burned and looted the town. 
</p>
<p>29. The attack on Abyei was accompanied by large-scale looting and burning of 
</p>
<p>property, including of assets of humanitarian agencies, and there were reports of 
</p>
<p>widespread human rights violations committed by the Misseriya and the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Popular Defense Forces (PDF), including killings, rape and other forms of inhumane and 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment. Owing to limited access, however, UNMIS was not able to verify 
</p>
<p>most of the reports. During his second visit to the Sudan in 2011, the independent expert 
</p>
<p>was able to visit the region, but his request to visit Abyei town itself was declined. He did, 
</p>
<p>however, manage to interview a group of Abyei residents, some of whom reported that they 
</p>
<p>had been severely beaten by PDF and Misseriya militia after being captured and placed in 
</p>
<p>SAF custody. Abyei town is now completely emptied of all its inhabitants, and all the 
</p>
<p>humanitarian organizations have pulled out.  
</p>
<p>30. On 20 June, the Government of the Sudan and the SPLM signed an agreement on 
</p>
<p>temporary arrangements for the administration and security of Abyei. The agreement 
</p>
<p>provides for the withdrawal of SAF and SPLA forces from Abyei and for the immediate 
</p>
<p>deployment of an interim security force composed of Ethiopian troops. The Security 
</p>
<p>Council endorsed the agreement and adopted resolution 1990 (2011), in which it 
</p>
<p>established the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) for a period of 
</p>
<p>six months. The mission is expected to monitor and verify the redeployment of armed 
</p>
<p>groups from the Abyei area, to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence 
</p>
<p>and to facilitate humanitarian access. </p>


<p><b>  B. Southern Kordofan 
</b></p>
<p>31. Southern Kordofan is a border State between North and southern Sudan. It is 
</p>
<p>populated largely by the Nuba, the Hawazma and Misseriya nomadic Arab tribes. Since the 
</p>
<p>end of the war, many of the Nuba have become strong supporters of the SPLA. 
</p>
<p>32. Under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, Southern Kordofan and neighbouring 
</p>
<p>Blue Nile States were expected to hold popular consultations to determine whether the 
</p>
<p>Agreement had met the aspirations of their citizens and to resolve any outstanding issues 
</p>
<p>related to its implementation. The popular consultation did not accommodate a right to self-
</p>
<p>determination for the two States. Rather, it offered the local communities the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>address their grievances and expectations for which they had taken up arms against the the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan and which had not been met by the Agreement. The two States 
</p>
<p>will remain part of the Sudan regardless of the consultation&#8217;s outcome, but they may retain 
</p>
<p>some autonomy. The Agreement left the popular consultation process relatively vague, both 
</p>
<p>in terms of content and of the processes to be used to guarantee the implementation of 
</p>
<p>outcomes. The popular consultation process was delayed in Southern Kordofan to allow the 
</p>
<p>conduct of State elections, which were not held during the 2010 nationwide elections owing 
</p>
<p>to disputes between the Agreement partners over census figures.   
</p>
<p>33. The Southern Kordofan gubernatorial and legislative elections were finally held 
</p>
<p>from 2 to 4 May 2011. Despite the tensions preceding the elections, the polling was 
</p>
<p>generally peaceful and was deemed credible by the Carter Center Observer Mission, the 
</p>
<p>only foreign organization to monitor the elections. However, on 10 May, prior to the 
</p>
<p>announcement of the results, the SPLM withdrew from the elections, citing irregularities 
</p>
<p>and alleging that the elections had been rigged. The final results announced by the National 
</p>
<p>Elections Commission on 15 May showed a narrow victory for the incumbent State 
</p>
<p>Governor, Ahmed Haroun. </p>


<p>34.  On 23 May, the President of the Sudan ordered the dismantling of the joint 
</p>
<p>integrated units in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States, and informed the SPLA that its 
</p>
<p>forces in the two States should either disarm or move south of the 1956 border.  
</p>
<p>35. On 5 June 2011, the SAF reportedly began blocking all major roads in and out of 
</p>
<p>Kadugli. Fighting then broke out between the SAF and the SPLA, with the SAF claiming 
</p>
<p>that the SPLA had instigated the fight by taking over a police station in an attempt to 
</p>
<p>procure arms. The SPLA in turn accused the SAF of attempting to forcibly disarm the 
</p>
<p>SPLA joint integrated units. On 8 June, the SAF began aerial bombardments and launched 
</p>
<p>ground offensives against SPLA positions in and around Kadugli, Talodi and other 
</p>
<p>neighbouring localities. The situation then deteriorated rapidly as the SAF intensified its 
</p>
<p>ground assaults in several areas including Kadugli, Dilling, Rashad, Heiban, Kauda, Um 
</p>
<p>Dorein and Talodi. Many of the civilians affected by the fighting took refuge in the Nuba 
</p>
<p>Mountains. Wounded civilians made their way to hospitals around Kadugli. Civilian 
</p>
<p>casualties were reported in Kadugli, Um Dorein, Um Serdeiba, Heiban, Kauda, Dilling and 
</p>
<p>Salara. It was also reported that civilians were trapped in some of the localities as a result of 
</p>
<p>roadblocks mounted by both the SAF and the SPLA. 
</p>
<p>36. The security situation has continued to deteriorate since 9 June 2011 as fighting 
</p>
<p>spread from Kadugli to other localities and the SAF persisted with more aerial 
</p>
<p>bombardments. Access to most of the areas affected by the violence has been virtually 
</p>
<p>impossible. The conflict has led to the massive displacement of civilians. According to 
</p>
<p>United Nations sources, at least 73,000 people have been displaced by the fighting. The 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan has restricted access to the affected areas citing security reasons, 
</p>
<p>and this has in turn prevented aid organizations from reaching those in need of assistance.  
</p>
<p>37. Since the fighting erupted, there have been allegations of serious human rights 
</p>
<p>violations committed by both parties, including extra-judicial killings targeted at the Nuba 
</p>
<p>people who are affiliated with the SPLA, house-to-house searches, arbitrary arrests and </p>


<p>detentions. Many of these allegations could not, however, be verified because of restricted 
</p>
<p>access to most parts of the State.  
</p>
<p>38.  It is reported that the daily aerial bombardments in several towns and villages 
</p>
<p>populated by the Nuba continue to cause significant loss of life and destruction of property. 
</p>
<p>The aerial bombardments are also reported to have affected the delivery of humanitarian 
</p>
<p>assistance, as some of the airstrips used by aid organizations have been destroyed.  
</p>
<p>39. There have also been allegations of abductions or the disappearance of civilians 
</p>
<p>targeting people along ethnic lines, and extrajudicial killings targeting the Nuba people, as 
</p>
<p>well as suspected supporters and affiliates of the SPLM/A, most of whom are from the 
</p>
<p>Nuba communities. Precise figures are unknown and unverified. It is also alleged that the 
</p>
<p>SAF has been engaged in arbitrary arrests and detention of persons suspected of being 
</p>
<p>supporters and affiliates of the SPLM/A.  
</p>
<p>40. Both the SPLA and the SAF are alleged to have laid anti-personnel land mines in 
</p>
<p>Kadugli and its surrounding areas, which have resulted in the death of civilians. A 
</p>
<p>preliminary report by the United Nations indicates that more than one third of Kadugli town 
</p>
<p>is riddled with either landmines or unexploded ordnance.  
</p>
<p>41. Throughout the conflict in Southern Kordofan, the SAF, the PDF and the Central 
</p>
<p>Reserve Police Forces have disregarded the UNMIS privileges and immunities set forth and 
</p>
<p>contained in the Status of Forces Agreement with the Government of the Sudan, as well as 
</p>
<p>international conventions on the status of the United Nations, its staff and assets to which 
</p>
<p>the Sudan is a signatory. On 7 June, an UNMIS national staff member fleeing the conflict 
</p>
<p>was reportedly shot in the leg by suspected PDF elements on his way to an UNMIS team 
</p>
<p>site. Seven UNMIS national staff members were arrested and detained immediately after 
</p>
<p>the outbreak of violence. . 
</p>
<p>42. The independent expert notes that, like in the case of Abyei, it has been difficult to 
</p>
<p>verify independently many of the allegations of human rights atrocities committed in 
</p>
<p>Southern Kordofan owing to restricted access to the State. The situation in Abyei and </p>


<p>Southern Kordofan require thorough investigation, and the Government must grant access 
</p>
<p>to human rights monitors and humanitarian workers.  
</p>
<p><b> V.  Southern Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>43. On 9 July 2011, South Sudan became a new State. Undoubtedly, it will be 
</p>
<p>confronted with enormous challenges, such as consolidating political stability, through the 
</p>
<p>continuation of democratic governance reforms and the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights. The Government will have to address many outstanding human rights issues, 
</p>
<p>including enhancing accountability and ending the pervasive culture of impunity and 
</p>
<p>violence in the region. There are also major concerns linked to the general lack of trained 
</p>
<p>security forces and law enforcement authorities, the persistence of inter-communal violence 
</p>
<p>and the weakness of State structures that underpins the persistent human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p>44. Inter-communal violence continues to cause loss of life and property across southern 
</p>
<p>Sudan. On 22 May 2011, a cattle raid by unidentified armed elements in Lafon County in 
</p>
<p>Eastern Equatoria State killed 17 children. On 2 May, UNMIS investigated allegations of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations following fighting between Dinka Gok and Dinka Agar tribes in 
</p>
<p>Rumbek, Lake State. A total of nine people, including four women, were reportedly killed 
</p>
<p>in the fighting. In Jonglei State, the traditional rivalry between Lou Nuer and Murle tribes 
</p>
<p>intensified in late April in Pibor County, claiming more lives. The County reported that 
</p>
<p>more than 60 people were killed when fighting broke out between the feuding tribes 
</p>
<p>between 18 and 20 April. An unverified number of children were reported missing after the 
</p>
<p>fighting. According to figures released by the State Security Committee, more that 1,000 
</p>
<p>lives were lost in the State through communal violence in the first three months of 2011. 
</p>
<p>Impunity and lack of accountability continues to fuel the cycle of violence. To date, the 
</p>
<p>Government has been unable to bring to justice any of the perpetrators of the numerous 
</p>
<p>crimes committed.  </p>


<p>45. Hundreds of civilians, including women and children, were killed in fighting 
</p>
<p>between the SPLA and rebel militia groups. Since the referendum in January 2011, UNMIS 
</p>
<p>has documented massive human rights violations committed in the context of this fighting. 
</p>
<p>The violence can be traced to events following the April 2010 elections, when several 
</p>
<p>former SPLA generals fell out with the movement over allegations of vote-rigging, formed 
</p>
<p>militia groups and launched armed rebellions against the SPLA. While a majority of the 
</p>
<p>casualties were soldiers on both sides, a substantial number of civilians has been targeted 
</p>
<p>and killed on suspicion of being affiliated with rebel militia groups. The SPLA and other 
</p>
<p>militia groups have committed human rights abuses, including the deliberate burning of 
</p>
<p>villages and indiscriminate killing of civilians, including women and children, looting and 
</p>
<p>rape and sexual violence against women. Between January and April 2011, UNMIS 
</p>
<p>reported that more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of civilians, were killed in the 
</p>
<p>fighting concentrated in the Greater Upper Nile region of Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity 
</p>
<p>State. Tens of thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their villages and many of 
</p>
<p>them remain inaccessible to humanitarian actors. 
</p>
<p>46. Systematic human rights abuses continue in an environment of impunity, with the 
</p>
<p>most frequent and worst abuses perpetrated by the security forces of Southern Sudan. There 
</p>
<p>have been numerous reports of human rights abuses by the SPLA, including extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions and cases of sexual and gender-based violence. During 
</p>
<p>the referendum, most of the human rights violations documented by UNMIS involved the 
</p>
<p>SPLA. Like the SPLA, the Southern Sudanese Police Service (SSPS) commits serious 
</p>
<p>human rights violations in its law enforcement operations. The SSPS remains ill-trained and 
</p>
<p>under-equipped, and consists of many former militia and ex SPLA members, many of 
</p>
<p>whom are illiterate and unqualified. In January 2011, an UNMIS investigation into the 
</p>
<p>operations of the only training centre for police in Southern Sudan, at Rajaf, near Juba, 
</p>
<p>uncovered allegations of serious human rights violations, including cases of extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>killing, torture, rape and inhumane and degrading treatment meted out to trainees. The 
</p>
<p>investigation also revealed a culture of training practices reflecting the guerrilla force </p>


<p>orientation of SPLA. On 8 April, the Government of Southern Sudan established a 
</p>
<p>committee to conduct credible investigation into the allegations. It is imperative that the 
</p>
<p>findings of the investigations be made public and the alleged perpetrators be brought 
</p>
<p>swiftly to justice.  
</p>
<p>47. In addition to the generalized insecurity and continuing violence, South Sudan 
</p>
<p>currently has very little capacity to dispense justice through the formal system. Weaknesses 
</p>
<p>in its law enforcement capacity and the acute shortage of qualified staff in the justice sector 
</p>
<p>have fuelled impunity for crimes. Illegal, prolonged and arbitrary detentions continue to be 
</p>
<p>a major concern. Large numbers of people are put in prolonged detention without mandated 
</p>
<p>legal warrants, very often in overcrowded and dilapidated cells. In Lake and Western Bahr 
</p>
<p>el Ghazal, UNMIS observed that more than half of pretrial detainees had been held without 
</p>
<p>the appropriate warrant extension. Despite the lack of due process, the criminal code of 
</p>
<p>South Sudan allows the application of the death penalty; executions have indeed been 
</p>
<p>carried out. In Malakal, Upper Nile, a prisoner was executed in October 2010 even though 
</p>
<p>prison authorities had confirmed that he was illiterate and he did not receive legal 
</p>
<p>representation during his trial. Of four prisoners executed in the State of Northern Bahr el 
</p>
<p>Ghazal in September 2010, only one was reported to have benefited from legal aid.  
</p>
<p>48. Concerns also remain about continuing human rights violations linked to 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women in SouthSudan. Sexual and gender-based violence, forced 
</p>
<p>marriages and abduction of women and children associated with inter-communal violence 
</p>
<p>remain widespread. Serious crimes against women are sometimes settled through the 
</p>
<p>traditional justice system, which very often applies discriminatory customary norms 
</p>
<p>focused more on reconciliation than on ensuring accountability. In Western Equatoria, a 
</p>
<p>man suspected of raping his two under-aged stepdaughters was released on bail after he 
</p>
<p>agreed to compensate the victims&#8217; family. Another man suspected of murdering his wife 
</p>
<p>was also released by the police after the families agreed to a settlement out of court. </p>


<p><b> VI.  Darfur 
</b></p>
<p>49. Some eight years into the conflict in Darfur, the political dynamics have changed 
</p>
<p>considerably and the overall violence associated with the insurgency and counter 
</p>
<p>insurgency has abated considerably. Nonetheless, the human rights situation remains a 
</p>
<p>cause of concern, with continuing fighting and breaches of human rights and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict. Hundreds of thousands of civilians continue 
</p>
<p>to suffer the effects of the armed conflict through direct attacks, displacement and limited 
</p>
<p>access to humanitarian assistance.  
</p>
<p>50. In December 2010, the security situation in Darfur deteriorated significantly as a 
</p>
<p>result of renewed fighting between Government forces and the armed movements. The 
</p>
<p>fighting followed strained relations between the Government and the Sudanese Liberation 
</p>
<p>Army (SLA) Minni Minawi  faction, the only rebel group to have signed a peace agreement 
</p>
<p>with the Government. Fighting between the SAF and the SLA Minni Minawi in Shangil 
</p>
<p>Tobaya and Dar el Salaam in North Darfur, and in Khor Abeche in South Darfur, began 
</p>
<p>early in December and continued throughout January and February 2011. Fighting also 
</p>
<p>broke out between the SAF and the Justice and Equality Movement around the same period 
</p>
<p>in Dar el Salaam. It continued intermittently and involved ground attacks by soldiers, 
</p>
<p>militia and rebels and aerial bombardments by the SAF.  
</p>
<p>51. Bombing of several villages in North Darfur, including in Um Shisha, Sortony and 
</p>
<p>Wadi Mura, were reported in February 2011. While it did not appear that civilians were 
</p>
<p>specifically targeted, close to 40,000 civilians were displaced from these clashes. More than 
</p>
<p>15,000 of them sought temporary shelter around a UNAMID team site in Khor Abeche, 
</p>
<p>where the Mission was providing limited assistance. The rest migrated northwards to the 
</p>
<p>Zamzam camp for internally displaced persons near El Fasher and to Tawila, north-west of 
</p>
<p>El Fasher. Fleeing the armed clashes, civilians who relocated to the camps for the displaced 
</p>
<p>continued to face insecurity, inadequate food and water supplies, and lack of basic rights 
</p>
<p>such as education, shelter and land. Many of the newly displaced have yet to receive any </p>


<p>full humanitarian assistance owing to a variety of reasons. Furthermore, the presence of 
</p>
<p>armed men around some of the camps severely restricted the movement and other rights of 
</p>
<p>camp residents.  
</p>
<p>52. Civilians also continued to be exposed to violence and abuses from attacks by rebel 
</p>
<p>groups and militia affiliated with the Government. On 2 September 2010, an unidentified 
</p>
<p>armed group attacked a market in the village of Tabarat, in North Darfur, killing more than 
</p>
<p>30 civilians. A UNAMID team dispatched to the area to assess the situation was prevented 
</p>
<p>from reaching the village by the SAF and an armed movement. In October, the Government 
</p>
<p>established a commission of inquiry to investigate the incident. The commission conducted 
</p>
<p>two visits to Tawila, but to date nobody has been held accountable for this incident. In 
</p>
<p>Shangil Tobaya, between 31 May and 3 June 2011, civilians were reportedly killed when 
</p>
<p>clashes erupted between members of a local Zaghawa community and an unidentified 
</p>
<p>militia group. An investigation by UNAMID confirmed that at least four people belonging 
</p>
<p>to the Zaghawa tribe were killed when they attempted to retrieve their stolen livestock from 
</p>
<p>the militia group. A commission of inquiry has been set up by the Governor of the State to 
</p>
<p>investigate the circumstances surrounding the fighting and the killings.  
</p>
<p>53. On a positive note, during the reporting period, a considerable decrease was 
</p>
<p>witnessed in inter-communal violence and targeted attacks on UNAMID and humanitarian 
</p>
<p>actors. This may be attributable to the Mission&#8217;s increasingly robust military and police 
</p>
<p>presence and the Government&#8217;s efforts to promote reconciliation between communities. 
</p>
<p>Three crew members of the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service, the last humanitarian 
</p>
<p>actors to be held in captivity, were released unharmed almost five months after being 
</p>
<p>kidnapped. There were, however, several serious incidents of attacks on UNAMID 
</p>
<p>peacekeepers and humanitarians, two of them resulting in fatalities. On 5 April 2011, a 
</p>
<p>UNAMID policewoman was killed in an ambush by unidentified gunmen near Kutum, in 
</p>
<p>North Darfur; and on 30 June, a UNAMID peacekeeper was shot and mortally wounded in 
</p>
<p>an ambush by unidentified gunmen in El Geneina, West Darfur. </p>


<p>54. The state of emergency in Darfur and the application of the NSS Act 2010 and the 
</p>
<p>Emergency and Public Safety Protection Act 1997 continue to curtail fundamental rights 
</p>
<p>and freedoms. Human rights violations, mainly by the NSS and Sudanese Military 
</p>
<p>Intelligence, continued to be committed with impunity. Perceived critics of the Government 
</p>
<p>were routinely arrested and kept in prolonged detention without judicial oversight, and 
</p>
<p>sometimes subjected to torture or ill-treatment. In October 2010, two internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons who took part in a meeting with a visiting Security Council delegation to the Abu 
</p>
<p>Shouk camp for displaced persons were arrested and detained by the NSS. They were 
</p>
<p>subsequently released but never charged with any offence. One of them was rearrested in 
</p>
<p>November, but released again. Two UNAMID staff members arrested in April and May 
</p>
<p>2011 in South and North Darfur were detained for several weeks, without being charged 
</p>
<p>with any offence. Again in North Darfur, four internally displaced persons detained in 
</p>
<p>connection with the killing of a community leader and his wife in the Abou Shok camp are 
</p>
<p>still in detention since being arrested in August 2009. 
</p>
<p>55. Sexual and gender-based violence remained a serious concern in Darfur in spite of 
</p>
<p>measures taken by the Government to address it. The persistent climate of impunity 
</p>
<p>continues to create an environment conducive to the perpetration of sexual violence. Many 
</p>
<p>incidents of sexual violence were not reported owing to fear of social stigma associated 
</p>
<p>with rape, fear of reprisal and the victims&#8217; lack of trust in the police to effectively 
</p>
<p>investigate and prosecute offenders. Furthermore, the police do not have the capacity to 
</p>
<p>follow up and investigate cases of sexual violence in areas under the control or influence of 
</p>
<p>armed groups. These challenges notwithstanding, the Government has taken a number of 
</p>
<p>positive steps to combat sexual and gender-based violence. In North Darfur, the authorities 
</p>
<p>have significantly increased the number of female police investigators, while in West and 
</p>
<p>South Darfur, female police investigators have recently been posted in family and child 
</p>
<p>protection units of the Police solely to handle cases of violence against women.  </p>


<p>56. The Darfur peace process continues to face significant challenges without the active 
</p>
<p>participation of some major armed movements. In May 2011, the Darfur mediation 
</p>
<p>successfully held an all-Darfur stakeholders conference aimed at drawing a broad 
</p>
<p>consensus on the challenges ahead and enhancing civil society participation in the peace 
</p>
<p>process.  The United Nations and the African Union have proposed that the Doha process 
</p>
<p>be concluded, and have invited all stakeholders to continue the peace process through a 
</p>
<p>Darfur-based political process. The new process, to be spearheaded by UNAMID, calls for 
</p>
<p>the establishment of an enabling environment necessary to protect the political and civil 
</p>
<p>rights of the participants. The Government has indicated its willingness to lift emergency 
</p>
<p>laws in effect in Darfur as a sign of its commitment to ensure the credibility of the process. 
</p>
<p>The Government, meanwhile announced early in March that it would proceed with its 
</p>
<p>decision to hold a referendum on the administrative status on Darfur, a move strongly 
</p>
<p>opposed by the armed movements. 
</p>
<p><b> VII.  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>57. The successful conduct of the South Sudan referendum was undoubtedly a 
</b></p>
<p><b>momentous achievement. The independent expert commends the Government of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan and the Government of South Sudan for the great efforts made to ensure a 
</b></p>
<p><b>credible and peaceful referendum process for the self-determination of South Sudan. 
</b></p>
<p><b>With the separation of South Sudan, the first challenge facing the Government of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan is to foster a culture of pluralism and tolerance and to move towards a more 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive, participatory and transparent democratic process, which will have a direct 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on human rights. The realization of fundamental rights and freedoms, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the freedom of expression and association, remains an enormous challenge 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the Sudan as it moves into a new era. In spite of the positive steps taken in the area 
</b></p>
<p><b>of law reform, there is growing concern about the pervasive presence of the national 
</b></p>
<p><b>security apparatus and its impact on the exercise of civil and political rights in the </b></p>


<p><b>country. Throughout the reporting period there were widespread allegations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitrary arrests and detention, torture and incommunicado detention perpetrated by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the NSS.   
</b></p>
<p><b>58. The independent expert would also like to point out the enormous challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>faced by South Sudan as it becomes as a new State on 9 July. The most urgent priority 
</b></p>
<p><b>is for the SPLM to accelerate the transition from a military movement to a responsible 
</b></p>
<p><b>and accountable Government that respects and protects the fundamental rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>people. The post-referendum violence, particularly in Upper Nile, Unity and Jonglei 
</b></p>
<p><b>States, and the systematic human rights abuses that continue to occur in an 
</b></p>
<p><b>environment of impunity remain grave issues. The threats facing civilians are 
</b></p>
<p><b>substantial and are likely to increase. Long-standing patterns of localized, inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>communal violence are likely to continue unless the Government of South Sudan takes 
</b></p>
<p><b>concrete measures to protect civilians and to address the widespread impunity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lack of accountability that continue to be the central cause of conflict in South Sudan.  
</b></p>
<p><b>59. The human rights situation in Darfur remains precarious, with continuing 
</b></p>
<p><b>fighting and breaches of human rights and international humanitarian law by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties to the conflict. Hundreds of thousands of civilians continue to suffer the effects 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the armed conflict through direct attacks, displacements and limited access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, the enjoyment of fundamental rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedoms in the region has to a large extent been suppressed by the combined effect of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the application of emergency and security laws.  
</b></p>
<p><b>60. The independent expert is deeply concerned about the situation in Southern 
</b></p>
<p><b>Kordofan and Abyei, which clearly demonstrates the need for immediate political 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue between the partners of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and a renewed 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment to address the outstanding issues facing the North and the South. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>Abyei, the independent expert noted with alarm the utter destruction of the town since 
</b></p>
<p><b>fighting broke out in May 2011. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and have </b></p>


<p><b>limited access to humanitarian assistance. In Southern Kordofan, where the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b>has deteriorated significantly since the outbreak of hostilities early in June, the main 
</b></p>
<p><b>concern is the welfare and security of the many civilians trapped in the fighting. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Furthermore, serious concerns remain about allegations of abductions, arrests, 
</b></p>
<p><b>detentions and executions of civilians. The scheduled withdrawal of UNMIS from 
</b></p>
<p><b>Northern Sudan after 9 July 2011 presents serious concerns, including continuing 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring of the situation and humanitarian access.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>61. The independent expert reiterates all previously unimplemented 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations, including those contained in his first report4 to the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council, and those made by his predecessor, the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights in the Sudan,5 and the group of experts on Darfur.6 In particular, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent expert makes the recommendations set out below. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  A. Government of the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p><b>62. The Government of the Sudan should continue the process of review of national 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws to conform with international human rights standards and take concrete 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to reform aspects of the current statutory framework that infringe on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercise of political and civil rights and freedoms. In particular, priority should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>given to withdrawing enforcement powers, including of arrest and detention for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>NSS, in line with the information-gathering and advisory role envisioned by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Comprehensive Peace Agreement. 
</b></p>
