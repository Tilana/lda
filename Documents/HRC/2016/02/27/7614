<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comments by the Government of Sri Lanka on the advance, 
unedited Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Human 
Rights of IDPs following his visit to Sri Lanka, 2-6 December 
2013 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. The Government of Sri Lanka thanks Dr. Chaloka Beyani, the Special Rapporteur on 
the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) for the visit undertaken to Sri 
Lanka from 2 to 6 December 2013, and for the draft, unedited version of his report on the 
visit shared with the Government of Sri Lanka.  The Government of Sri Lanka has 
implemented a comprehensive and coherent policy for the resettlement of IDPs since the 
end of the conflict in May 2009.  Detailed information in this regard is provided in the 
comments given below.  The Government&#8217;s policy on IDP resettlement is in line with 
accepted principles in achieving durable solutions of IDPs.  It also includes, inter alia, the 
implementation of all recommendations of the LLRC which have relevance to the 
resettlement of IDPs, through the National Plan of Action for the implementation of the 
LLRC.  The Government reiterates its commitment to continue with the provision of 
support for the resettlement of IDPs towards achievement of durable solutions. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. Para 3 - No persons who met with the SR on IDPs during his visit were threatened or 
intimidated at any point, and there have been no reports or complaints to that effect.  The 
SR himself acknowledges that the IDPs shared their experiences with him even in the 
presence of security and other officials.  Hence the comment contained in the Report that 
the Special Rapporteur 'would welcome assurances from the Government that persons, 
whether officials or private individuals, who contacted him in relation to his official visit 
pursuant to his mandate, will not as a result be intimidated, threatened, or prosecuted&#8217;, is 
unnecessary and unwarranted, and the Government would like to request that this sentence 
be deleted. Additionally, the Government extended unfettered access to the SR and 
facilitated all his meetings including interactions with civil society and field visits to the 
North.  This may be acknowledged in the Report. 
</p>
<p>3. Paras 6 and 31 - Sri Lanka takes note of the definition of durable solutions provided 
by the SR.  While he draws a distinction between durable solutions and relocation, the 
Government is of the view that resettlement of IDPs in their original habitats as well as 
development of livelihood support, can be clearly interpreted as provision of durable 
solutions, especially when perceived in the context of the comprehensive support provided 
by the Government to IDPs for safe return (including mine clearance), right to land and 
resolution of land issues, provision of housing, access to clean water and sanitation, 
reintegration, livelihood support and options, education and vocational training, healthcare, 
the right to vote, etc.  Therefore the assertion in the SR&#8217;s Report that recommendations with 
regard to durable solutions following national consultations have not been implemented is 
erroneous.  It may be noted Livelihood support is neither a new focus nor has it been 
neglected by the Government, and development in the livelihood sector is providing a 
durable solution to the IDPs. Focus on livelihood aspects of IDPs commenced with the 
early recovery phase of the resettlement in the early part of 2010, immediately after 
fulfilling the urgent humanitarian needs of the IDPs.  The main purpose of the early 
recovery phase was to enhance income generating activities for the IDPs, i.e. provision of 
support to immediately start agricultural activities through provision of equipment, seed 
paddy, fertilizer and other inputs after clearing cultivable paddy lands which were 
abandoned for a long time during the conflict period. This was followed by provision of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>livestock, mainly, poultry, goat rearing and cattle farming.  Major efforts were made to 
rehabilitate the fisheries sector which was almost devastated during the conflict.  Another 
aspect which was considered as a priority was to renovate all damaged minor tanks.  These 
activities have continued for at least two years and the outcome of these efforts were visible 
through the results achieved in each of the livelihood sectors, not only supporting individual 
family economies, but also contributing to the increase of provincial GDP of the national 
economy.   Of all the INGOs involved in providing humanitarian aspects, nearly 75 per cent 
were involved in livelihood activities.  At present, 31 out of 39 INGOs working in the 
Northern Province are exclusively supporting livelihood activities.  Development of 
infrastructure ie. roads, schools, water and sanitation, health and energy sectors have 
contributed largely to the enhancement of livelihood environment of all the IDPs.  
Development actors including bilateral and multilateral partners are involved in livelihood 
support in the reconciliation process in the North and the East, including for IDPs, returnees 
and relocated persons, in the provision of durable solutions.   
</p>
<p>4. Para 9 - With regard to the discrepancy in the figure of IDPs between the 
Government of Sri Lanka and international organizations, referred to in the Report, the 
Government wishes to note that it has already highlighted the need to address this 
discrepancy seriously, and to this end it has discussed this important issue on several 
occasions with the UNHCR and other international organizations both in Colombo and in 
Geneva.  
</p>
<p>In order to arrive at a consensus on the IDP figures, a series of meetings were conducted 
during January to March 2014 at the district level covering all districts in the Northern and 
Eastern provinces with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Resettlement, 
the Presidential Task Force for Resettlement, Development and Security of the Northern 
Province (PTF) and the UNHCR.  The objective of this exercise was to ascertain the ground 
reality of the IDP situation and to reconcile discrepancies.  The detailed discussions held 
with the District Secretaries, Divisional Secretaries and the Representatives of UNHCR in 
the respective areas, reveal the availability of 1,534 hitherto unreported IDP families 
consisting of 4,556 persons in the Northern and Eastern districts.  The district wise 
breakdown of the figure is given in Table below: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>District No. of families No. of Persons 
</b>Mullaitivu 60 164 
</p>
<p>Trincomalee 263 609 
Kilinochchi 100 296 
</p>
<p>Mannar 169 421 
Vavuniya 434 1413

<b>Total 1,534 4,556 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Source: Ministry of Resettlement, Sri Lanka, April 2014 
</i> 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the total number of IDP families in the Northern and Eastern provinces 
without any potential revision to the already published figures of IDPs in Jaffna district 
being taken into account, would be 8,237 families consisting of 26,919 persons. The final 
figure of IDP families, which may include any new IDPs in Jaffna will be finalized shortly 
with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. Annex I portrays the current situation of 
IDPs in the Northern and Eastern provinces. This demonstrates the action taken by the 
Government to address discrepancies in IDP figures.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>Additionally, the Permanent Representative for Sri Lanka to the UN in Geneva has also on 
several occasions discussed the need to address this discrepancy in IDP figures with the 
UNHCR, including at meetings with the High Commissioner for Refugees himself (on 25th 
January 2013 and more recently on 21st January 2014). Additionally, the Permanent 
Representative has discussed this issue with the UNHCR Representative in Sri Lanka 
during a visit of the latter to Geneva on 3rd February 2014. At these discussions, the 
UNHCR has assured Sri Lanka that this discrepancy is being addressed, and that the 
UNHCR is examining their own IDP figures in this regard. 
</p>
<p>There is therefore ongoing cooperation between the Government of Sri Lanka and the 
UNHCR in addressing the discrepancy in IDP figures as detailed above. The Government 
would therefore appreciate if this section is updated to reflect the action underway to 
address this issue to reconcile IDP figures more comprehensively. 
</p>
<p>5. Para 9 &#8211; The Report says &#8216;the SR visited a welfare centre in Jaffna where people 
have been displaced for 24 years, without electricity, water or sanitation.&#8217; This information 
is incorrect. The Ministry of Resettlement has confirmed that common water and sanitation 
facilities and electricity have been provided to all welfare centres in the Jaffna district. 
</p>
<p>6. Para 10 - With regard to protracted IDPs displaced due to expulsion by the LTTE 
from the North in 1990, the majority of whom are now living in Puttalam, it is incorrect to 
say that only a few of them live permanently in their areas of origin because they lost land 
documentation or because their land is occupied by the military or because some of them 
feel discriminated against by local authorities. There are in fact a range of reasons for some 
of this protracted category of IDPs to not live permanently in places of origin, including 
socio-economic issues related to their having lived for a long period in a place outside of 
their original habitat. A major problem is the landlessness of the extended Muslim families. 
During the period of almost 30 years of displacement, this community has expanded and 
dependent families require new lands. Having understood this problem, the Government has 
taken action to release nearly 3,200 acres of state lands to such families as an incentive for 
them to return to their original places. Additionally, when the resettlement process 
commenced, only the Muslim IDP families who volunteered to return were registered as 
having returned, and not the entirety of returnees. It may be further noted that the problem 
of dealing with land when the claimant has lost land documentation, is not singular to the 
North and the East, but is also applicable to any part of the country.  
</p>
<p>It is also incorrect to say that this category of protracted IDPs are discriminated against or 
are not &#8216;prioritised for assistance&#8217;, considering that (i) the Government has not and does not 
draw a distinction between old and new IDPs in provision of resettlement support, and (ii) 
the Government continues to specifically address the issues of this protracted category of 
IDPs, mainly Muslim IDPs, including within the framework of the LLRC NPoA. With 
regard to the claim that Muslim families in return areas are not being prioritized for 
assistance by local authorities, it should be noted that notwithstanding the requests made by 
the Government, I/NGOs as well as UN Agencies have opted to assist or prioritized their 
assistance to IDPs who were predominantly Tamil. The bulk of assistance granted to such 
Muslim families was from the Government and from some Arab countries. The situation 
remains the same even at present.  
</p>
<p>Additionally, 96 percent of demining is completed by the Government of Sri Lanka with a 
total area of 1,982 SqKm cleared as of March 2014 with a view to addressing resettlement 
issues. The significant and incremental progress made in demining by the Government has 
facilitated rapid resettlement.  
</p>
<p>The Government would appreciate if this section with reference to protracted IDPs is 
corrected to reflect facts accurately as detailed above.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>7. Para 10 &#8211; While the Report acknowledges the expulsion by the LTTE of the entire 
Muslim population of some 75,000 people from the Northern province in 1990, it may be 
noted that in fact it was the Sinhalese community of the Northern Province that was first 
expelled by the LTTE. In 1971, there were 20,402 Sinhalese residing in the Jaffna and 
Kilinochchi districts, all of whom fled their homes in 1978. In 1981, there were 3,948 
Sinhalese in Mullaitivu and 8,710 in Mannar. They were all expelled by the LTTE in the 
1980s. Altogether 35,000 Sinhalese were displaced from the Northern Province during the 
conflict.  
</p>
<p>8. Para 11 &#8211; While the SR says that &#8216;tens of thousands&#8217; among the 760,000 IDPs who 
have registered as having returned to areas of origin since April 2009, are &#8216;reported not to 
have reached durable solutions&#8217;, there are no specific instances or information cited to 
substantiate this point. This therefore remains a mere generalisation. The Government 
therefore requests that this reference be deleted.  
</p>
<p>9. Para 12 &#8211; The SR&#8217;s claim that among those registered as having returned are 
&#8216;thousands whose land remains closed for return, but whom the Government relocated in 
new villages in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Trincolamalee and Mullaitivu districts&#8217; 
does not comprehensively reflect the ground situation. It may be noted that relocation was 
resorted to in the case of some IDP returnees due to their original land being earmarked or 
already utilized for public purposes as in the case of similar acquisition of land in other 
parts of the country. It may be further noted that the number of relocated families is very 
small compared to the nearly 759,995 IDPs resettled between 2009 and 2013 in the 
Northern Province. For example, a total number of 252 families claim that they have been 
displaced from their original lands in Keppapilavu GN division in the Mullaitivu District. 
Considering the tactical and national security requirement, security forces were deployed in 
the lands of Keppapilavu GN Division after the humanitarian operation. Due to this reason, 
the above families were resettled in the Keppapilavu Model Village since 25 September 
</p><p>2012. However, out of the above 252 families, only 185 families have been able to prove 
their ownership of lands.  
</p>
<p>With regard to the SR&#8217;s claim that the original lands have been occupied by the military and 
it is unclear whether IDPs will receive compensation for their land, it should be noted that 
all relocated families have been provided with state land. Only the original lands of 185 
families have been occupied by the military. Although the balance 67 families have not 
been able to prove their ownership, steps were taken to provide lands in the Keppapilavu 
Model Village. Each resettled family has been provided with 40 perches land plot for the 
house. Land has also been released for cultivation. (MOD) The Government has also taken 
action to release 250 acres of land suitable for agriculture to be distributed among relocated 
families at &#188; acre per family.  
</p>
<p>With regard to the SR&#8217;s claim that there was little or no consultation prior to resettlement, it 
may be noted that the Government Agent in Mullaitivu visited the Transitional Welfare 
Villages at Menik Farm and conducted discussions with regard to provision of alternative 
lands for the above families. The community leaders were facilitated to visit the proposed 
lands prior to taking them to the area of resettlement. These families have agreed to occupy 
the proposed lands on condition that permanent houses, basic infrastructure facilities and 
alternative lands for cultivation would be provided, which has been done.  
</p>
<p>With regard to the claim that the village built by the military has permanent houses of 
standard size regardless of each family's size, it may be noted that the Ministry of 
Resettlement has designed spacious standard houses considering the size of the family, and 
only the construction component of the houses has been undertaken by the military. It may 
also be noted that apart from amenities such as electricity and water that are being provided 
to the village, facilities such as frequent mobile clinics, educational facilities, places of 
religious worship for Hindus and Christians and a market place have also been made </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6

</p>
<p>available. With regard to livelihood opportunities, a majority of villagers go for fishing in 
the Nanthikadal Lagoon located in the vicinity. A considerable number of villagers are 
employed as farmers, laborers and shop assistants. Some villagers run private boutiques 
within the village. Some are doing private businesses such as hiring tractors and three 
wheelers.  
</p>
<p>The Government requests that this section be appropriately amended with the information 
provided above.  
</p>
<p>10. Para 13 &#8211; The reference in the Report, which is attributed to international and 
national civil society representatives, that the ethnic Sinhalese people originating from the 
south of country were supported officially to settle in the North, is entirely without basis 
and erroneous. Such unsubstantiated claims are also made by parties with vested interest in 
order to politicize issues and in effect impede reconciliation between the two communities.   
</p>
<p>The SR himself makes reference to the eviction of the entire Muslim population, some 
75,000 people from the North, by the LTTE in 1990. Prior to this ethnic cleansing, in the 
early 1980s, this Muslim community as well as over 35,000 Sinhalese co-existed peacefully 
in the North of Sri Lanka. Today, over 51 percent of the population in Colombo city is non-
Sinhalese which is testimony to the fact that the people of Sri Lanka can freely choose 
where they want to live, and there are no efforts made to create mono-ethnic niches within 
the country. This is further substantiated by the fact that only 32 per cent of the Tamil 
population live in the North while the remainder live among other communities in the rest 
of the country.  
</p>
<p>The Government therefore requests that this erroneous reference be deleted from the 
Report.  
</p>
<p>11. Para 14 &#8211; The statement in the SR&#8217;s Report indicating that the Urban Development 
Authority (UDA) functioning under the Ministry of Defence has evicted hundreds of 
families from their homes in Colombo, and durable solutions were not provided for those 
who were displaced is not correct and is a misinterpretation of the resettlement programme 
implemented by the UDA.  
</p>
<p>The actual position is that the UDA has undertaken several projects in the city of Colombo 
with a view to developing it as the country&#8217;s commercial capital in line with the 
Government&#8217;s policy directives on urban development. The Government has implemented a 
programme to construct high-rise apartments targeting 65,000  housing units to be 
constructed to provide decent houses to low-income families living in underserved 
settlements scattered in the city of Colombo covering an area of nearly 900 acres. This is 
one of the strategic programmes underway to achieve the expected urban development in 
the city of Colombo among many other current rejuvenation projects. Under this 
programme, no families will be displaced and all families will be provided with permanent 
houses, while releasing a large acreage of underutilized lands for productive purposes in 
accordance with the Colombo Development Master Plan.  
</p>
<p>A Plan of Action is underway by the UDA for the construction of around 15,000 housing 
units in high-rise apartment with all necessary facilities and amenities. Under this scheme, 
the first housing complex was completed in December 2013 and was handed over to the 
respective families. The balance housing projects are at different stages of completion. This 
scheme is being carried out based on a proper resettlement plan. The objective of some 
families in having appealed to the Supreme Court is not to protest against the displacement 
from their present locations but to seek an assurance from the UDA to obtain housing units 
from the housing scheme of their preference. Since there was a slight delay in completing 
this particular housing scheme, the UDA has provided the families with monthly rent 
alternatives until the required houses are completed. Settlement in this regard was reached </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>by mutual consent with those families, and the UDA has assured them that they will be 
provided with decent permanent houses as agreed to in the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>It may be further noted that the project in the Colombo city is an urban development project 
to upgrade the social and economic conditions of the people, which is being conducted in 
accordance with statutes governing land acquisition and payment of compensation. The 
project will provide permanent houses to all displaced families. The prevailing legal system 
is sufficient for the general public to seek legal redress in relation to land acquisition. 
</p>
<p>The Government requests that the above information be accurately reflected in the Report.  
</p>
<p>12. Para 14 &#8211; The reference in the Report to 550 families having been displaced from 
land sold to an Indian private company to build apartments is also a misinterpretation of the 
correct position. The actual position is as follows:  
</p>
<p>The 550 families referred to in the Report were living in a block of land situated at 
Colombo 02 in the heart of the city of Colombo. It was one of the most overcrowded 
settlements with unsafe dilapidated slum houses and contained unhygienic health conditions 
without even the basic facilities and amenities. This particular land block has been 
fragmented over the years into smaller pieces of land, even broken into less than one perch 
of different sizes and different shapes without having proper access. As such, none of those 
families were able to develop or construct their houses due to the small plot sizes which 
were far below the permissible standard, and also due to unclear land titles. Under such 
circumstances, the occupants of this settlement were deprived of their rights to develop the 
properties and therefore the UDA&#8217;s intervention was essential to clear these bottlenecks and 
to provide them with decent houses with all necessary facilities and amenities as state 
intervention to solve their housing problem.  
</p>
<p>The UDA has planned to develop this particular low income settlement as a Public Private 
Partnership (PPP) Project with an Indian investor. The project was planned following the 
conduct of a series of community consultations and awareness programmes where it was 
mutually agreed to pay the families a monthly rental to vacate the premises temporarily for 
a two-year period to commence the construction of resettlement housing apartments for all 
the families. Fifty per cent of the dwelling units had a floor area of less than 300 Sq.ft. 
While the UDA has kept the minimum floor area as 400 Sq.ft. per unit, this particular 
scheme has provision for different types in different floor areas to cater to their varying 
requirements.  
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the UDA entered into agreements with the families guaranteeing their rights to 
get houses in required extent and quality, and for the UDA to acquire the said land block 
under the Land Acquisition Act for title clearance purposes. The families have agreed to 
renounce their rights to claim compensation for the respective land plots as they are 
provided with permanent houses with all facilities within two to three years in lieu of their 
individual properties. The investor company has to initially invest own funds to build the 
relocation apartments to the quality standard specified by the UDA. The balance land extent 
released through this process will be alienated to the investor on a conditional lease to 
develop high rise apartments and commercial uses based on a proper urban design layout 
with all facilities and amenities whereby the investor could recover his investment, while 
there will be a planned development with a multiple value addition to the properties of 
occupants. This strategy will pave the way to achieve a win-win situation for the occupants 
as well as the developer. The UDA will act as facilitator throughout the project. This 
concept was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 18 August 2012, and in pursuance of 
the matter, the respective families have been provided with monthly rental for them to find 
rental housing as per their wishes, thus enabling the UDA to clear the site for intended 
development work.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>The Case filed by a few families in the Supreme Court in this regard was not due to 
displacement or disagreement to this housing programme, but with the expectation of a 
guarantee that they should not be resettled outside the city of Colombo. This matter was 
clarified at the Supreme Court where the UDA has assured that those families will be 
provided with decent permanent houses of which the floor area will be more than that of 
their existing houses with all necessary facilities and amenities, on part of the same 
land/location. Also, out of 550 families less than 60 families claimed that the value of the 
houses being offered to them was less than their property value. The UDA agreed to assess 
their properties through the Government Chief Valuer and to give them the option to either 
accept compensation or accept alternative houses taking into account the actual value of the 
properties. The families have agreed to this proposal and the matter has been resolved.  
</p>
<p>The Government requests that the above information be accurately reflected in the Report.  
</p>
<p>13. Para 17 &#8211; The claim in the Report that little action has been taken to effectively 
implement LLRC's recommendations on IDP resettlement including creation of a uniform 
state policy aimed at resettlement, is erroneous, and no specific information is provided in 
the Report in support of this claim. The claim is also inherently contradictory as the very 
next paragraph (Para 18) makes reference to the National Plan of Action for the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights (NHRAP) having dedicated a whole section to the rights of 
IDPs. It may be noted that the NHRAP is co-terminus with the National Plan of Action for 
the implementation of the recommendations of the LLRC (LLRC NPOA) which was 
established in July 2012.  
</p>
<p>It may be noted that the LLRC&#8217;s entirety of recommendations on resettlement and 
reintegration of IDPs, including Muslim IDPs and Sinhalese families evicted from Jaffna 
and the rest of Northern Province, and provision of durable solutions is comprehensively 
addressed through the LLRC NPoA. The LLRC NPoA has two thematic sections dedicated 
to &#8216;land return and resettlement&#8217; and &#8216;restitution and compensatory relief&#8217;, both of which 
have relevance to the resettlement of IDPs. All 18 recommendations of the LLRC 
pertaining to the issues of IDPs, including land, housing, infrastructure and livelihood needs 
as well as their emotional and spiritual needs, are comprehensively addressed in the LLRC 
NPoA. Of these, 06 recommendations specifically refer to the rights and resettlement of 
Muslim IDPs, 01 Recommendation relates specifically to resettlement of Sinhalese families 
who were evicted from the Northern Province, and another Recommendation relates to 
resolution of land and livelihood issues of families who were displaced due to LTTE attacks 
in the former &#8220;Threatened Villages&#8221;. The relevant sections of the latest Progress Report of 
the LLRC NPoA of March 2014 is at Annex II to this response, giving detailed information 
on progress (LLRC NPoA website: http://www.llrcaction.gov.lk/).  
Additionally, land, being one of the most complex and sensitive residual issues of the 
conflict related to resettlement, continues to be comprehensively addressed by the 
Government. In line with the LLRC recommendations, the Land Commissioner General is 
implementing the Special Land Circular giving effect to Government&#8217;s land policy 
concerning &#8220;Return and Resettlement of Displaced Persons and Associated Programme&#8221; 
which provides for the granting of land to IDPs who had lost land, and legal ownership to 
those who have been resettled. In fact, the Government has taken a policy decision not to 
alienate new lands to landless people until the land problems of the affected people in the 
conflict affected areas are resolved. The LLRC NPoA monitors 14 Recommendations 
directly related to the implementation of this Special Land Circular, and considerable 
progress is being made by the Land Commissioner General in this regard. Land Ministry 
offices in the Northern and Eastern Provinces have been strengthened by inclusion of 
officers competent in land matters, while the Government has allocated Rs 400 M in the 
2014 Budget to implement the LLRC recommendations under the Special Circular. In 
March 2014 alone, 1,382 land requests have been received in the Northern Province, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>making a total of 153,126 requests to date, of which 26,746 have been resolved. In the 
Eastern Province, 763 land requests have been received in March 2014 (total of 14,576 to 
date) and 1,793 have been resolved thus far.  The Terms of Reference of the Fourth Land 
Commission are under preparation.  
</p>
<p>Taking the above into consideration, the Government would like to request that this section 
be corrected to reflect the very comprehensive and concrete action taken by the Government 
including via the LLRC NPoA to implement the LLRC&#8217;s recommendations on IDP 
resettlement, as well as in addressing the issue of IDP resettlement through a coherent, 
uniform policy.  
</p>
<p>14. Para 19 &#8211; The Report calls for revision of the Government&#8217;s Framework of 
Resettlement Policy which the SR criticizes as not being adequate, and indicates that it falls 
significantly short of both the goals of the NAPHR and of the comprehensive 2008 Draft 
IDP Bill. It may be noted that the Government&#8217;s &#8216;A Framework for Resettlement Policy&#8217; 
revised draft as of 6 November 2013 (please see LLRC NPoA website, 
http://www.llrcaction.gov.lk) outlines the framework for resettlement policy comprising the 
administrative, logistical, advisory, humanitarian and other forms of support available to 
IDPs, returnee refugees of legitimate Sri Lankan origin and resettled communities. The 
policy has been prepared taking into account the very special nature of the circumstances 
within which the displacements occurred and as to what kind of support and assistance are 
required by the persons concerned to counter the twin challenges of resettling and 
reintegrating within society and the economy while reinvigorating their already diminished 
social and economic potential. The Policy details the policy objectives, policy goals, basic 
principles, strategy, scope, resettlement options, assistance, resettlement of refugees, land 
and property rights, access to schooling and health care, gender equality and children&#8217;s 
rights, host community, auditing, training, international cooperation, psycho-social 
assistance, rights of IDPs and Returnee Refugees, profiling IDPs and Returnee Refugees, 
IDPs in protracted situations, policy implementation mechanism, review of policy and 
definitions. The Framework may be read in tandem with the LLRC NPoA and the NHRAP.   
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Resettlement is in the process of organizing broader consultations to 
finalise this draft Framework, as was indicated to the SR during the debriefing session of 
the Government of Sri Lanka presentation on 5 December 2013. The Government requests 
that reference to this ongoing consultation process be included in the Report.  
</p>
<p>15. Paras 21 and 22 - The criticisms in the Report that the Government resorted to 
deregistration of IDPs while they were still displaced is incorrect. It may be noted that 
registration with Government authorities as IDPs was undertaken solely for the purpose of 
providing them with the much needed assistance, including dry rations. Deregistration was 
undertaken based on a factual assessment, and as soon as IDPs report for resettlement, they 
are registered as returnees and given assistance. No sooner the person is resettled in his/her 
own land, the person&#8217;s identity is changed from IDP status to that of a resettled person. This 
method was adopted by the Government with a view to speeding up the resettlement 
process and without prejudice to provision of continued support to the resettled person to 
achieve durable solutions.  
</p>
<p>The statement in the Report that the closing of IDP camps has led to the deregistration of 
IDPs without ascertaining whether they had been able to return home, or still had specific 
displacement related needs, is also incorrect. All IDPs accommodated in major welfare 
centres in Menik Farm were resettled in their original habitats, while some have opted to 
stay with host families. Prior to the resettlement of the IDPs, they were taken to their 
original lands on a &#8220;Go and See&#8221; mission to show them that the area is cleared for 
resettlement and to ensure safety and confidence of the IDPs. On resettlement, they were 
looked after by the Divisional Secretaries, other local officials and the military until their 
basic needs were fulfilled and they were made comfortable.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>The Government requests that the errors in these two paragraphs be corrected.  
</p>
<p>16. Para 22 &#8211; The SR&#8217;s assertion that &#8216;tens of thousands of those who returned or were 
relocated&#8217; being in need of support to reach durable solutions is without basis and remains 
unsubstantiated (Please also refer to Government response under Paragraph 11 above). The 
Government has made every effort to provide those who were resettled with livelihood 
support, including commencement of agriculture, fisheries, as well as assistance provided 
for livelihood support through local banks. The Government has paid special attention to 
those whose livelihood are dependent on fisheries to ensure that they have access to their 
traditional means of livelihood. Fishermen who were unable to engage in their livelihood 
during the conflict have been able to recommence fishing activities since the end of the 
conflict, and are provided with livelihood and technical support. The Government has 
enhanced the infrastructure and support facilities for the fishing industry in the North and 
the East including with the support of bilateral and multilateral donors. The Government 
requests that this paragraph be modified to accurately reflect the ground situation.  
</p>
<p>17. Paras 23 and 24 &#8211; The Government takes due note of the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement that recognize that IDPs have the right to choose among three 
settlement options which if sustainable will lead to a durable solution that includes (i) return 
to their place of origin, (ii) integration in the area of displacement, or (iii) settlement in 
another part of the country. The IDP resettlement policy followed by the Government has 
adhered to the criteria, i..e,, the three resettlement option, stipulated in the Guiding 
Principles. No IDPs were forcibly resettled at any point.  The Government has had a 
comprehensive plan to achieve the &#8216;Five Rs&#8217;, namely, resettlement, rehabilitation, 
reintegration, reconstruction and reconciliation in the post-May 2009 period. This plan 
meets the criteria stipulated in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement referred to 
in the paragraph.   
</p>
<p>The Government also takes note of the definition of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee 
(IASC) Framework on Durable Solutions for IDPs that &#8216;a durable solution is achieved when 
internally displaced persons no longer have any specific assistance and protection needs that 
are linked to their displacement and can enjoy their human rights without discrimination on 
account of their displacement&#8217;. The Government agrees with this definition. In the nearly 5 
years since the end of the conflict in May 2009, the Government has incrementally shifted 
its focus from provision of humanitarian assistance to IDPs to provision of more durable 
solutions through a more development oriented focus. This is precisely why livelihood 
development of already resettled IDPs as well as IDPs to be resettled, their reintegration 
into society, schooling, education, and health needs, etc., are issues which continue to be 
addressed by the Government through reconciliation and development work.   
</p>
<p>Progress with regard to these development issues continue to be addressed through the 
LLRC NPoA (as detailed in the Progress Report of March 2014 at Annex II), as well as 
through the relevant line Ministries including the Ministries of Resettlement, Economic 
Development, Education, Health, etc. The Government has not begun to view IDP 
resettlement as a closed issue despite resettlement of the majority displaced by the conflict. 
While physical resettlement alone is not adequate, the Government is firmly of the view that 
provision of conditions for physical resettlement including provision of relevant 
infrastructure such as housing, schools, hospitals, as well as basic services are a prerequisite 
for the resettlement process. While much has been addressed and achieved, there are many 
challenges that remain and continue to be addressed by the Government, land issues being 
one such complex challenge.  
</p>
<p>We also note that the IASC Framework on Durable Solution has its focus on a situation of 
an &#8220;optimal level achievement&#8221; (100%) of IDP resettlement and reintegration into society. 
Such results cannot be practically achieved, let alone within a short period of five years, 
given the complicated nature of Sri Lanka&#8217;s post-conflict challenges. IASC also recognizes </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>that &#8220;a solution becomes durable only years, or even decades, after the physical movement 
to the place of origin or place of settlement has taken place, or the decision to locally 
integrate has been made&#8221;. In this context, it has to be accepted that even after all IDPs are 
resettled, durable solutions for some issues will come their way only after some time. In this 
context, Sri Lanka&#8217;s progress within the IASC framework deserves greater 
acknowledgement.  It is suggested that the Report includes acknowledgement of the 
Government&#8217;s policies on resettlement of IDPs, which are in line with internationally 
accepted principles in achieving durable solutions of IDPs.  
</p>
<p>18. Para 26 &#8211; The Government rejects the claim in the Report that some tens of 
thousands of IDPs who have returned or have been relocated in the Northern and Eastern 
provinces &#8216;live in very precarious conditions&#8217;. No specific information is provided to 
substantiate this assertion which is without basis and incorrect. In the absence of any 
evidence to substantiate this claim in the Report, the Government would like to request the 
SR to delete this erroneous reference.   
</p>
<p>19. Para 27 &#8211; The Report makes reference to a recent WFP survey which notes that 
nearly seven out of ten households in Vavuniya and Mullaitivu districts were food insecure 
and faced a rising level of debt in coping with the lack of livelihood opportunities. It may be 
noted that the reference details of this survey, which are given in the related Footnote 16 
refers to an article which appeared in &#8220;IRIN&#8221; magazine, a news service of the UN Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. However, the survey does not reflect the full 
picture of the situation as it had been carried out on a sample of 300 persons only. The 
article itself indicates that &#8220;This report does not necessarily reflect the views of the United 
Nations&#8221;. The Government requests that this reference therefore be deleted as it is 
misleading in the circumstances.  
</p>
<p>There were three stages in the Government&#8217;s policy in the provision of shelter for IDPs in a 
phased manner, which included the construction of (i) transitional shelters, (ii) semi-
permanent shelters, and (iii) permanent shelters. The provision of transitional shelters was 
considered only during the first few months of resettlement, and thereafter the focus was 
shifted to construction of semi-permanent shelters and then permanent houses. The semi-
permanent structure that was developed by the PTF in association with the IOM was later 
introduced as the IOM model, which consists of two rooms built on a plinth area of 200 
sq.ft. and possibly with a toilet. All donors accepted this model and provided support during 
the phase of provision of semi-permanent shelters. The Government then moved to the 
provision of permanent shelters or full-fledged housing to IDPs with a view to providing 
durable solutions. The Government&#8217;s achievements in the provision of houses to IDPs, 
which was carried out with some support from bilateral and multilateral donors, is indeed 
significant.  
</p>
<p>The statistics provided in the Report on housing built for IDP resettlement is not correct. 
The Government has built 206,686 houses for resettlement of IDPs in the Northern and the 
Eastern Provinces during the period 2004 to March 2014 at a cost of SL Rs. Mn. 54,588. 
This includes 49,488 houses built under the North East Housing Reconstruction Programme 
(NEHRP), 2,122 houses built under North East Community Restoration and Development 
Project (NECORD), 7,146 houses built to date under the Indian Housing Programme, as 
well as 24,529 houses built by INGO/NGOs.  
</p>
<p>The number of resettled families in Jaffna after 2009 is 31,188, for whom 22,826 new 
houses have been completed, and another 2,334 houses are being built, leaving 4,523 
houses to be built, making a total of 29,683 houses. This means 95 per cent of the resettled 
families in Jaffna district have been provided with permanent houses. Accordingly, in 
Mullaitivu district 40 per cent, in Mannar district 75 per cent, and in Kilinochchi district 52 
per cent of the resettled families have been provided with new permanent houses.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>As per the information gathered by the Government from District Secretaries, the total 
permanent shelter requirement among resettled families in the Northern and Eastern 
provinces in Sri Lanka stand at 70,886 units (additionally 25,093 damaged houses are 
required to be renovated), after taking into account what has been constructed, what is being 
built and committed to be built during the next three years. Currently 16,646 fully damaged 
houses are being reconstructed and 189 houses are being renovated. A significant 
proportion of houses have been built on &#8216;owner-driven&#8217; basis. The Government is further 
committed to reconstructing 11,061 fully damaged houses and renovating 3,095 partly 
damaged houses.  
</p>
<p>It may be noted from the above elaboration that addressing the housing needs of the IDPs 
has been a priority in the Government&#8217;s resettlement policy as well as the reconciliation 
process right from the inception. The Government continues to make every endeavor to 
address the housing needs of the remaining IDPs including with bilateral and multilateral 
support. The Government requests that this section be duly updated including with the 
housing figures duly corrected.  
</p>
<p>20. Para 28 &#8211; The claim in the Report that all humanitarian projects in the North require 
the approval of the PTF is incorrect. All projects in the Northern Province, as in the case of 
all the other provinces, require the approval of the Department of External Resources and 
the relevant line Ministry / Ministries. Additionally, the Report&#8217;s reference that the PTF 
&#8216;has rarely approved protection projects such as psycho-social support, legal assistance, 
family tracing and reunification&#8217; is incorrect. Every I/NGO or UN agency working on these 
areas are required to work with the respective Government institution / agency, and many 
have been working with the Ministry of Health and the Department of Probation and 
Childcare. The authorization for such projects does not come under the purview of the PTF, 
as detailed above. PTF coordinates support for such projects through the Government 
machinery. The Government requests that this error be duly corrected in the Report.  
</p>
<p>21. Para 30 &#8211; While the Government agrees that persisting regional disparities need to be 
addressed in the Government&#8217;s move towards achieving the MDGs, the Report refers to 
regional disparities being &#8216;most visible&#8217; in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, especially in 
access to health services, education facilities and employment opportunities&#8217;. While the 
Government has acknowledged the considerable development challenges in these two 
provinces as the former theatre of the conflict, education, health and provision of 
employment are areas where significant achievements have been recorded within a short 
period after the conflict. The recent Advanced Level examinations results, improved 
medical facilities &amp; hospitals, livelihood programmes, and contribution to the GDP are 
examples.  
</p>
<p>The Northern Province has recorded a Provincial GDP (PGDP) growth rate of 23.6 per cent 
in 2013 contributiing 4.3 per cent to the national economy up from 3.7 per cent in 2011, 
while the Eastern Province registered the second highest growth of 26.6 per cent in the 
PGDP with an increase in its GDP share to 6.9 per cent in 2013 from 5.8 per cent in 2011. 
(Hon MEA statement to HRC 25 in March 2014).   
The Government has restored the education system in the North and ensured equal access to 
education to the students of the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Education Department 
statistics reveal that there is an increasing trend by the school children in the Northern and 
Eastern Provinces to perform significantly better than other provinces at all island public 
examinations. This is reflected by the securing of the top and third slot in the last all island 
Advanced Level examination performance by students in the Northern and Eastern 
provinces respectively. All schools damaged during the conflict have been repaired and 
rehabilitated. The number of schools opened in the Northern Province has increased from 
840 (in 2010) to 982 (in 2012). The number of students has increased from 214,262 to 
255,106 and the number of teachers has increased from 12,205 to 14,826 during the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>corresponding period.  The Student/Trained teacher ratio of the Northern Province is 32 
whereas the corresponding national level figure is 31.   
</p>
<p>There are 6,820 &#8220;Sinhalese&#8221; schools, 2,223 &#8220;Tamil&#8221; schools, and 856 &#8220;Muslim&#8221; schools. 
There are 887 &#8216;&#8217;Tamil&#8217;&#8217; schools outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces (with 475 
&#8216;&#8217;Muslim&#8217;&#8217; schools). There is not a single &#8216;&#8217;Sinhalese&#8217;&#8217; school functioning in the three 
districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Killinochchi.   
</p>
<p>The highest success rate in performance of school candidates by Province (63.88%) at GCE 
Advanced Level 2013 has been recorded from the Northern Province. The Eastern Province 
is placed third, with a percentage of 60.72%. The highest success rate in performance of all 
candidates by Province (62.23%) has also been recorded from the Northern Province. The 
Eastern Province is placed fifth, with a percentage of 58.35%. The five districts in the 
Northern Province are in the first five places in the performance of school candidates by 
district, and a district in the Eastern Province is placed 6th in the list.   
</p>
<p>The Government has taken measures to ensure access to quality health care services to the 
people in the North. As of January 2014, there is one Teaching Hospital, 04 District General 
Hospitals, 07 District Base Hospitals, 57 Divisional Hospitals, 33 Primary Medical Care 
Units, 30 MOH Offices and 381 Clinic Centres in the Northern Province. In 2013, the 
Government opened a fully equipped new three story building complex in the Jaffna 
Teaching Hospital. The number of Curative Care Institutions and number of beds per 
population in the Northern Province (Population - 1,060,023) are 102 and 5,348, 
respectively. The corresponding figures in the Western province (Population - 5,837,294) 
are 149 and 20,955, respectively.   
</p>
<p>The unemployment rate in the Northern Province has declined from 6.1 per cent to 5.2 per 
cent, and in the Eastern Province from 15.5 per cent to 4.9 per cent in the period 2005 to 
</p><p>2012.   
</p>
<p>The Government has taken the initiative to establish a Vocational Training Centre (Sri 
Lanka-German Training Institute) in the Kilinochchi district with the assistance of GIZ to 
service the vocational training needs of the entire Northern Province with international 
training certification standard. The Institute which comes under the Ministry of Youth 
Affairs and Skills Development is now under construction and will be completed by 2015.  
</p>
<p>The food ratio is one of the principal indicators used to measure living standards of a 
population. Food ratios for the Northern and Eastern Provinces have declined from 59 per 
cent to 44.8 per cent, and from 57 per cent to 55 per cent, from 2009/10 to 2012/13, 
respectively.   
</p>
<p>The Government suggests that the Report includes acknowledgement of the above 
elaborated facts. 
</p>
<p>22. Para 31 &#8211; The Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) between the Government of Sri Lanka 
and the UN Humanitarian Country Team will also address the issue of provision of durable 
solutions for IDPs. The Government requests that this be included in this paragraph. 
</p>
<p>23. Para 32 &#8211; While the Report calls for greater clarity in the relationship between the 
PTF and the Provincial and District authorities in relation to IDPs, it may be noted that the 
relevant line Ministries, such as the Ministries of Resettlement, Economic Development; the 
relevant District and Provincial authorities are directly involved in the development process, 
including in the provision of durable solutions to IDPs. The PTF since its inception has 
continued to work with these authorities in line with its mandate. While the Report asks the 
Government to allow donors to partner directly with relevant local authorities to support 
solutions for IDPs, it is not possible to remove the relevant line Ministries which work in 
coordination with the local as well as the provincial administration as well development 
partners from the equation given the need to maintain coherent policy direction on IDP </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>resettlement, as well as to work in accordance with stipulated administrative guidelines. All 
such coordination now comes under the civil administration. There is no impediment as has 
been cited in the collaboration and coordination between the Ministries, the PTF and the 
local administration as evidenced through the implementation of a vast number of 
development projects and activities in the North and the East. The SR&#8217;s call for greater 
clarity in the relationship of the PTF is therefore without basis and the reference may be 
amended appropriately.  
</p>
<p>Additionally, the Government has an effective coordination mechanism to ensure 
complementarity of action between relevant partners and stakeholders, including IDPs. The 
following are examples of such &#8220;effective coordination&#8221; by the GOSL; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Advertisement of de-mined areas and invitations to resettle, 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Land kachcheri initiative to address land issues 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Systems put in place to accept requests/appeals on land issues 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Work carried out by the local administrative agencies such as the Divisional 
Secretariats in resolving land issues and in addressing the grievances 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Conducting of elections in the North and the East 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Employment of Tamil speaking police officers 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Recruiting competent people for government service in respective areas 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The GoSL&#8217;s joint work with INGOs and NGOs.  
The Government requests that these be acknowledged in the Report.  
</p>
<p>24. Paras 34 and 35 &#8211; The Government has recognized need to harmonize data on IDPs 
and returnees, and the needs linked to their displacement, as well as data desegregated by 
gender and age. The resettlement data are desegregated by gender to capture vulnerable 
groups and to address resettlement in a comprehensive manner. The Letter of Agreement 
(LOA) relating to the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) which was signed between the 
Government of Sri Lanka and the UN Humanitarian Country Team (UNHCT) on 25th 
March 2014 will address these issues further, including the specific needs linked to the 
displacement of IDPs, and to reconcile the discrepancies in relation to the number of 
remaining IDPs to be resettled.  The Steering Committee of the Technical Working Group 
of the JNA met on 7th April 2014 and the proceedings have commenced. The exercise is 
expected to end by 30th June 2014.   
</p>
<p>The Government has not maintained an exclusive focus on the categories of &#8216;old&#8217; and &#8216;new&#8217; 
IDPs, based on the time of displacement, nor does it maintain a distinction between &#8216;old&#8217; 
and &#8216;new&#8217; IDPs in the context of support, as made clear earlier. However, it may be noted 
that there was an urgent need in the immediate aftermath of the end of the conflict in May 
2009 to focus on those IDPs displaced recently given that their needs were more urgent, and 
thus needed to have a humanitarian focus. For example, the resettlement of those who got 
displaced as a result of the final stage of the conflict in May 2009 and were housed at the 
Menik Farm welfare village, was completed by the Government by 30 September 2012. The 
number of IDPs resettled from 05 August 2009 to 30 September 2012 from Menik Farm 
Welfare village amounted to 281,701. The current focus is therefore in addressing their 
needs from a durable solutions point of view.   
</p>
<p>As already indicated in the Report, the Government has acknowledged the need to 
harmonise data on IDPs, returnees and relocated persons, and assurances in this regard were 
given to the SR by stakeholders at the debriefing session held on 5 December 2013 in 
Colombo. Subsequently, the PTF, the Ministry of Resettlement and UNHCR jointly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>discussed this issue in January 2014 to finalise the correct numbers of IDPs as detailed in 
Paragraph 9 above. 
</p>
<p>The Government would appreciate if this paragraph is appropriately amended to reflect the 
above.   
</p>
<p>25. Paras 37, 38, 39 &#8211; The Report refers to security issues which affect IDP&#8217;s freedom of 
movement, the continuation of armed conflict measures, including the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act (PTA), and the continued heavy presence of military in the former conflict 
zone. Following the termination of military operations against the LTTE in 2009, the 
Government has undertaken a gradual process of reduction of military presence in the 
former conflict affected areas. The total strength of the military in the Northern Province 
has been reduced by approximately 30 per cent from 2009 to October 2013, a process which 
is continuing to take place. In the Eastern Province, an approximately 26 per cent reduction 
of troop presence has been undertaken. Also 50 per cent of the troops have been deployed in 
areas which were not affected by the conflict. The Government continues to evaluate and 
rationalize military presence according to national security imperatives. The timelines for 
such activities correlates directly to the threat perceptions of the Government to national 
security and is one which evolves as situations unfold. The references in the Report to the 
continuation of armed conflict measures and the continued heavy presence of military in the 
former conflict zone is therefore erroneous, as is the reference to an increase in military 
presence in Jaffna since the September 2013 Provincial Council election, as reported by 
civil society organisations, and the Government therefore requests deletion of these 
references.   
</p>
<p>The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) comes into force for individuals who are suspected 
of being involved in terrorist activity and have no bearing on IDPs freedom of movement, 
unless the IDPs have been found to be involved in terrorist activity. No restrictions have 
been placed by the PTA on the freedom of movement of Sri Lankan citizens. It should be 
noted that the UNHCR Report of June 2013 referenced at footnote 22 of the Report of the 
SR, states that a vast majority (96%) reports no restrictions on their freedom of movement 
in and out of their village (Figure 1.19 in page 17).  
The statement made that the involvement of the military in civilian issues affects the 
security climate in particular for women, whose position is made more vulnerable by the 
breakdown of social networks and communities, is without basis. Whilst reiterating that the 
military has no involvement in civilian matters, no information is provided on how such an 
eventuality would affect the security climate of women and lead to them becoming more 
vulnerable through breakdown of social networks and communities. No evidence is 
provided to arrive at such a conclusion. The civilian administration in the North and the 
East is fully functional with social and community networks involving civil society groups, 
I/NGOs, assisting the civilian administration in the discharge of duties.  
</p>
<p>The activities carried out by the Sri Lankan military are within the ambit of Civil Military 
Cooperation and are not intended to usurp the powers of civil administration. These 
activities are similar to post-conflict activities undertaken by military forces across the 
globe and involve reconstruction/renovation of houses, provision of adequate safe drinking 
water, construction of sanitary facilities, reconstruction of religious places for communities, 
improving access roads, irrigation projects etc. Whilst these were undertaken more 
intensively in the immediate post-conflict period, these activities have also become limited 
due to the strengthening of civilian institutions and their capacity to undertake such work. 
The Report of the UNHCR (June 2013) referenced by the SR at Footnote 22 states in its 
analysis that &#8220;a positive note about military presence is that the military is involved in 
settling disputes, helping people to build houses and assisting with development activities in 
the villages&#8221; (page 10).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6

<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>The Government rejects the claims made in the Report that the military has undertaken 
commercial activity which impacts on local small farmers and impacted on their 
commercial interests, and requests that this reference be corrected. No commercial activities 
are undertaken by the military in the North. All agricultural/other projects maintained by the 
Sri Lanka military, are on State owned land, and have been undertaken to meet the basic 
food requirements of military personnel and is not being undertaken as a commercial 
activity. This issue was comprehensively addressed during the visit of the SR to Sri Lanka 
in December 2014 by stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>The hotels run by the Sri Lankan military are for the purposes of welfare of the families of 
military personnel to provide leisure activities at a lesser cost. These facilities are also open 
to the public in order to obtain revenue which would facilitate granting welfare prices to 
military personnel and their families. It may also be noted that similar projects have been 
undertaken in the South and elsewhere in the country as well. Similar examples in 
cantonment areas exist in many parts of the world where militaries engage in such activities 
as welfare measures for service personnel.   
</p>
<p>26. Para 38 &#8211; With regard to the SR&#8217;s claim that a Presidential palace is being built in 
the North of Jaffna in the HSZ, it may be noted that whilst the Government is well within 
its rights to build suitable premises for the use of the Head of State anywhere in its territory, 
the point which the SR is attempting to make with regard to this reference is unclear as well 
as irrelevant to the subject matter of the Report.  
The Report&#8217;s claim that the PTF has denied civil society organizations access to IDPs is 
baseless and erroneous. With regard to civil society, the PTF deals exclusively with I/NGOs 
registered with the NGO Secretariat. No complaints have been received or made by any of 
those I/NGOs with regard to denial of access to IDPs by the PTF.  The Government 
therefore requests that this erroneous reference be deleted.  
</p>
<p>The Government also requests that the erroneous claim that the civil society representatives 
are reported to be under constant surveillance by the Government and the military be 
deleted, as there is no constant surveillance by either party on civil society representatives.  
</p>
<p>27. Para 40 - This paragraph identifies the reasons preventing IDPs from accessing their 
lands as (a) presence of land mines (b) set up of special military and economic zones (c) 
lack of documentation of their land of origin. The Report has overlooked that (a) only about 
82 Sq.Km. remain to be cleared of landmines, (b) the Military is restricted to cantonments 
and High Security Zones have ceased to exist, and (c) Special Economic Zones are major 
development projects and help generate development and livelihood programmes for the 
IDPs. The Government has given sufficient solutions with regard to land acquisitions for 
Economic Zones. (d) New land policies are designed to address land issues of all Sri 
Lankans including the IDPs, according to documentation on land or origins. (Please also 
refer to the section on Land with reference to Para 17 above.) The Government requests that 
these facts be acknowledged in the Report.  
</p>
<p>28. Para 42 - The section makes reference to a land area of 62,000 Sq. Miles as still 
uncleared of landmines, out of a total land area of 1.4 million Sq. Miles contaminated with 
mines at the end of the armed conflict.  The land area indicated as remaining uncleared is 
incorrect. As of now, about 96 per cent of the areas identified for demining has been 
cleared, and only 82 Sq. Km. remain to be cleared from land mines out of total area of 
2,064 Sq. Km. The Government requests that these errors be corrected in the Report.  
</p>
<p>29. Para 43 - The Report makes reference to the demarcation of large areas in the 1990s 
as High Security Zones (HSZs) and that &#8216;significant tracts of land continue to be used by 
the military for cantonment and other activities&#8217;. It may be noted that former High Security 
Zones (HSZs) have ceased to exist. The Palaly cantonment is now the only area in which 
some security restrictions remain although civilians have unrestricted access to the Palaly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>airport and the KKS Harbour. Similarly, former HSZs in the Eastern Province located in the 
Sampur area from 2007 has been reduced in extent by 65 per cent and declared a licensed 
zone under the Board of Investment. To date a total of 20,011 acres of private land and 
5,740 acres of state land have been released in the North and East. Further, access has been 
give to land owners inside military cantonments and HSZs for cultivation purposes.  
</p>
<p>It should be noted that for 30 years much of the former conflict affected areas in the North 
and East were illegally occupied by the LTTE which prevented the GoSL from establishing 
permanent military establishments in areas of strategic importance for national security 
purposes. Following the elimination of the LTTE, the GoSL which regained full control of 
its territory is in the process of establishing military installations in areas which are of 
significance from a national security perspective. The statements made that families are 
unable to access lands due to military &#8220;occupation&#8221; are misplaced and misleading. The Sri 
Lankan military is not an occupying force as the areas concerned are within the territory of 
Sri Lanka. It is the national military, deployed by the Government for purposes of securing 
its territorial integrity and sovereignty, in line with security considerations.  
</p>
<p>In all instances in which private land has been acquired, it has been done through proper 
procedures and by providing compensation/or alternate land to owners. Similar processes 
have also taken place elsewhere in Sri Lanka. The land owners have access to justice and 
can challenge such processes through courts if they feel proper procedures have not been 
followed. There is no truth whatsoever in the claim made that military personnel have 
intimidated persons who have challenged acquisition of lands in these areas through court 
procedures. The Government requests that such erroneous references be deleted from the 
Report.  
</p>
<p>The Government has allocated SL Rs. 200 Million to pay compensation for those who have 
lost their lands to the Palaly Cantonement, and steps have been taken to provide alternate 
land for these people. Additionally, a sum of SL Rs. 200 Million has been allocated in 2014 
to pay compensation for land acquired by the Government for development activities. The 
Government is in the process of making amendments to the Lands Act to resolve a number 
of contemporary issues.  Action has been taken to introduce amendments to Land 
Development Ordinance, Land Acquisition Act and the Land Grant (Special Provision) Act 
in order to meet the timely requirements and repeal the laws which do not meet the needs of 
the public. Amended Bills of the Land Development Ordinance and the Land Acquisition 
Act have been finalized.  
</p>
<p>The Government requests that this information be reflected appropriately in this section.  
</p>
<p>30. Para 44 - The main reason preventing access to land is not lack of land ownership 
documentation as indicated in the Report. The mechanism set in motion by the Government 
for the Commissioner General of Land to resolve land related issues in each district has 
been formulated to ensure that the loss of documentation will not be the major impediment 
in relation to resolution of land matters. In actuality, the applications received for lost land 
documents are very few. The major impediment to address land issues is in effect 
landlessness, which is not a problem peculiar to the Northern Province. (Please also refer to 
Para 10 above in this regard). All issues related to land are being addressed by the direct 
mechanism already set in motion by the Government. The Government recommends that 
this section be amended to reflect this.  
</p>
<p>31. Para 45 &#8211; The Amendment to the Prescription Ordinance will be presented to 
Parliament in May 2014. Steps are being taken to Gazette the necessary Orders under the 
Special Mediation Board Act, to establish relevant Boards in certain areas where armed 
conflict prevailed, and to address certain identified land disputes that have arisen in those 
areas. This action is being undertaken with a view to implementing the relevant 
recommendations of the LLRC to grant legal ownership of land to those (IDPs) who have </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>been resettled, and amend the law pertaining to prescription in its application to land 
transfers / occupation effected during the period of conflict in order to prevent legitimizing 
of forced eviction and secondary occupation of private lands in the North and the East. The 
Government recommends that this section be updated to reflect this information.  
</p>
<p>32. Para 46 &#8211; In exceptional cases where land cannot be returned, the Government is 
taking necessary steps to follow due process, provide compensation and support for 
sustainable relocation.   
</p>
<p>33. Para 47 &#8211; The references in the Report to lack of effective remedies for violations of 
International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law and the comments of 
the Panel of Experts (PoE) report on Sri Lanka are erroneous and politicized, and are 
therefore categorically rejected by the Government of Sri Lanka. These references also have 
no relevance to the mandate of the SR on the Human Rights of IDPs, as himself 
acknowledged during his meeting with GoSL interlocutors in December 2013. The PoE 
report is a discredited document containing unverified and unsubstantiated information 
from questionable sources. The Report has also not received the endorsement of the 
intergovernmental process. The Government has placed on record its views on the PoE 
Report in its Comments on the OHCHR Report on Promoting Reconciliation and 
Accountability in Sri Lanka presented to the 25th session of the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/25/G/9). The Government therefore requests deletion of reference to the above, 
including specific reference to the PoE on Sri Lanka. Alternatively, the Government 
requests that its views on the subject be reflected in the SR&#8217;s Report.   
</p><p>34. Para 48 &#8211; The reference in the Report to alleged attacks by Buddhist extremists who 
have targeted Muslim and Christian sites in different parts of the country is irrelevant to the 
subject of IDPs, and therefore to the mandate of the SR, as himself acknowledged during 
his interactions with GoSL in December 2013. In fact there have been in the recent past, 
sporadic incidents focusing on places of worship of all four religions. In such instances the 
police has taken steps to report facts to magistrates, and action has been taken to produce 
suspects before magistrates where credible information has been available. The reference to 
some mosques and churches frequented by IDPs having been destroyed in the North is 
without basis and factually incorrect. No specific references and information have been 
provided to substantiate this claim. The Government therefore requests deletion of reference 
to alleged attacks by Buddhist extremists as well as the general unsubstantiated reference to 
mosques and churches in the North being destroyed.   
</p>
<p>35. Para 49 &#8211; The reference in the Report that in the Kilinochchi district alone 16,000 
applications of missing persons was collected by the Commission on Disappearances is 
erroneous and misleading. As at end March, the Commission had received approximately 
18,000 complaints, inclusive of 5,500 complaints from relatives of security forces 
personnel, from all parts of the country. The complaints are submitted to the Commission 
both by post as well by relatives during public sittings, hence there is reasonable 
opportunity for multiple submissions to be made in relation to a single complaint. The 
reference to this is also irrelevant to the mandate of the SR and his subject in the Report.  
The Government therefore requests its deletion.   
</p>
<p>The SR also exceeds his mandate in his call for the involvement of the UN Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to assist and complement the work of the 
Commission on Disappearances established by the GoSL. The Government therefore 
requests its deletion.  
</p>
<p>36. Paras 51 and 52 &#8211; The references in the Report to the alleged gross violations of 
human right of internally displaced women, including sexual violence, is unsubstantiated 
and incorrect. While challenges remain, specifically in the context of the particular 
vulnerability of women in the post-conflict resettlement process, the Government has taken </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>every effort to address the specific concerns of internally displaced women in a gender 
sensitive manner. The Government has set up special women&#8217;s protection units with female 
police officers and women centres in the IDP welfare centres, and continues to provide 
counseling services. Strict legal action has been taken to combat sexual violence. There 
have been no allegations of gross violations of human rights of Internally Displaced 
women. The Government requests that this section be appropriately amended.  
</p>
<p>37. Para 52 &#8211; The Government categorically rejects the unsubstantiated allegation of 
reported forced prostitution by elements of the military. The Government places highest 
priority on the protection of women and children, and significant efforts have been made 
including through the establishment of Women and Children Desks at Police stations to 
ensure access to justice and also create a suitable environment in which to report abuses and 
violence. Steps have also been taken by the Government to establish new police stations. In 
line with the recommendations of the LLRC, the new Ministry of Law and Order was 
created in August 2013, under which the Police Department is now placed. The 
Government deplores all acts of violence against women and girls and has taken concrete 
action against reported cases and will continue to do so. There exists no basis for concern 
with regard to the presence of the security forces contributing to the vulnerability of women 
to sexual violence in the North which is not borne out by available data.   
</p>
<p>The Government has acknowledged the challenges faced due to lack of sufficient Tamil 
speaking officers in the police, and have taken steps to address this. For this reason, under 
the Trilingual Policy, civil servants and police officers have been recruited and trained to 
serve the public in the North and the East in the language of their choice. Special focus is 
being placed in enabling police officers serving in the North to have a sound knowledge of 
Tamil. the Police Department has deployed 900 Tamil police officers and 1,500 Sinhala 
police officers fluent in the Tamil language in police stations in the Northern and Eastern 
provinces. Preparations are also underway to recruit 150 Tamil speaking women police 
officer in 2014 to augment all units of Women and Children&#8217;s Bureaus at all Police Stations 
in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Under the Trilingual Policy, the Government has 
initiated a programme to make public sector workers bilingual in the vernacular, with the 
ability to converse in both Sinhala and Tamil, and Government officers are regularly 
encouraged to participate in language competency training.   
</p>
<p>The Government therefore requests that this information be appropriately reflected in the 
Report.  
</p>
<p>38. Para 53 &#8211; All schools destroyed as a result of the conflict have been repaired. All 
schools in the Northern Province used by the Sri Lanka military have been handed over to 
civilian use. The schools occupied by the LTTE were renovated by the Government and 
handed over to the respective Zonal Directors of Education in the Northern Province. It may 
be further noted that children in the former conflict affected areas attend school, and 
internally displaced children continued to attend schools while even living in welfare 
villages. (Please see Para 30 above on education in the North and the East). Resettled 
children are not prevented from attending school due to the lack of a birth certificate. The 
Government therefore requests that this erroneous reference be deleted.  
</p>
<p>39. Para 56 &#8211; It may be noted that the LLRC&#8217;s recommendations on IDPs (Chapter 5) 
and on Land (Chapter 6) are already under implementation within the framework of the 
LLRC NPoA as stated under Para 17 of the Report above. Most of these recommendations 
are already at a high level of implementation.  
</p>
<p>The Government further notes that the SR&#8217;s recommendations with regard to the 
Commission on Disappearances and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances are not relevant to the subject of IDPs nor the mandate of the SR.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>With regard to the SR&#8217;s recommendation to address impunity for security forces personnel 
in relation to offences against civilians, the Government rejects the claim of impunity, 
which is made without any justification whatsoever and is unsubstantiated and 
uncorroborated. The Government categorically states that on no occasion has the Sri Lanka 
military engaged in offences against civilians. Any offences by the security forces, for 
which credible evidence is available, are promptly investigated and action is taken under the 
existing legal system.  </p>
