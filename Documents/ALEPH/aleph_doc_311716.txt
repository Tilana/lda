8.6 Permitted Financings and Permitted Encumbrances

(a) With respect to any one or more secured Financings that either the Vendor or its
Afﬁliates arranges for the Milligan Project from time to time, or that are secured

Financing shall provide that the Lenders (or any agent or trustee that holds the
Lender Security) will agree to enter into an intercreditor agreement with the
Purchaser that will be acknowledged by the Vendor, and such intercreditor
agreement will be on terms reasonable in the syndicated secured lending market
prevailing at the time such intercreditor agreement is negotiated taking into
account the purpose and comparative size of the Financing and that such
intercreditor agreement shall contain the following tems:

(i) an acknowledgment that the Purchaser will hold a ﬁrst-perfected security
interest in the Designated Percentage of Produced Gold and all proceeds
thereof registered pursuant to the Personal Property Security Act (British
Columbia) (the “Gold Security Interest”),


(ii) provisions reﬂecting the subordination of the Purchaser’s security interest
in the assets of the Vendor (other than the Gold Security Interest) to the
Lender Security and limiting the enforcement of the Purchaser’s security
interest by inclusion of a standstill provision whereby the Purchaser agrees
not to exercise or continue to exercise, as applicable, remedies against the
Vendor and its Afﬁliates or the assets of the Vendor or its Afﬁliates for a
deﬁned period of time, which period shall be not less than 120 days from
the date on which the Lenders are notiﬁed of the event of default under
this Agreement or any document, instrument or agreement delivered
pursuant hereto, and that such standstill period shall continue for so long
as the Lenders are then acting diligently and in good faith with respect to
all or any material ponion of the Lender Security or attempting diligently
and in good faith to vacate any stay or prohibition against such exercise, in
each case at the expiration of such period; provided however, that such
standstill shall not in any way affect the Purchaser’s rights with respect to

of claim in any bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings or
(B) responsive pleadings to any objections to Purchaser’s claim in
connection with such bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding,

(iii) the amount of the Financing having priority over the Purchaser’s security
interest in the assets of the Vendor (other than the Gold Security Interest)
pursuant to such intercreditor agreement shall not be limited in any
respect,

insolvency proceeding of the Vendor or its subsidiaries, whether voluntary
or involuntary, (A) if Lenders were to desire to consent to the use of their
cash collateral or to consent to the Vendor or any other subsidiary
obtaining debtor in possession financing (a “DIP Financing”), then
Purchaser would agree to not raise any objection to such use of such cash
collateral or to such DIP Financing and would subordinate its liens on the
Collateral (other than the Gold Security Interest) to any such DIP
Financing on the same terms (but on a basis junior to the liens of Lenders
that are participating as lenders in such DIP Financing) as the prepetition
liens of the Lenders are subordinated thereto; provided, that, if the Lenders
were to be granted adequate protection in the form of replacement liens on
any of the assets constituting Collateral, then the Purchaser may seek
adequate protection in the form of a replacement lien on the same assets
but subordinated to the liens securing the Financing and the DIP
Financing, and (B) the Purchaser would not raise any objection or
opposition to any sale of assets consented to by the Lenders or made in
connection with the enforcement of rights by the Lenders in the Collateral
(other than the Gold Security Interest); provided, that the proceeds of all
such sales shall become subject to the liens securing the obligations owed
to Purchaser to the same extent as any assets so disposed,


(V) additional reasonable terms and provisions which, in the event of a
bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding by or against the Vendor or
any of its subsidiaries, (A) limit tlie Purchaser's rights to seek adequate
protection of its security interest in the Collateral (other than the Gold
Security Interest); provided, that, if the Lenders were to be granted
adequate protection in the form of replacement liens on any of the assets
constituting Collateral, then the Purchaser may seek adequate protection in
the form of a replacement lien on the same assets but subordinated to the
liens securing the Financing and the DIP Financing and (B) prohibit the
Purchaser from seeking relief from any stay granted as a result of the
ﬁling of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding,

(vi) an agreement by the Lenders not to contest the validity of the Gold
Security Interest, and an agreement by each of the Lenders and the
Purchaser not to contest the validity of the other party’s security interest in
any of the assets of the Vendor or its afﬁliates,

(vii) an agreement by each of the Purchaser and the Lenders to promptly notify
the other party in writing of any material breach under this Agreement or
any event of default as deﬁned in any document, instrument or agreement
delivered in connection with this Agreement or any event of default as
deﬁned in any document, instrument or agreement delivered in connection
with the Financing, as applicable, and

(viii) an agreement by the Lenders that, in any realization upon the Lender
Security during the continuance of an event of default with respect to the
Financing, they will not convey or approve a transfer of any mineral
tenures necessary or desirable for the extraction of gold at the Milligan
Property without requiring such transferee to agree in writing that its
interests in such mineral tenures are subject to the obligations of the
Vendor under this Agreement,

The parties agree that in considering the reasonableness of any intercreditor agreement which the
Vendor proposes to the Purchaser in connection with any Financing, each of the foregoing shall
be considered valid and material considerations.

(b) As and when the Vendor considers any Financing, where an intercreditor
agreement is or may be required, the Vendor will notify the Purchaser and, as
soon as practicable following the Vendor’s receipt of the initial draft of the
intercreditor agreement, provide such initial draft to the Purchaser accompanied
by all material details of the Financing and the proposed Lender Security that are
reasonably necessary for the Purchaser to consider the reasonableness of the
proposed intercreditor agreement (a “Proposed Intercreditor Agreement”). The
Purchaser shall have ﬁve Business Days following its receipt of any Proposed
Intercreditor Agreement to notify the Vendor that it accepts or rejects the
Proposed Intercreditor Agreement. If the Purchaser rejects the Proposed
Intercreditor Agreement or any aspect thereof, the Purchaser, acting in good faith,
shall participate in negotiations with the proposed Lenders in a bona ﬁde effort to


ﬁnalize such intercreditor agreement. For purposes of this Section 86, the
revised version of the intercreditor agreement that the proposed Lenders and the
Vendor would be prepared to enter into in accommodation of the Purchaser
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be referred to hereafter as
the “Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement’h If, within ten Business Days
following the date on which the Purchaser shall have notiﬁed the Vendor that it
has rejected the Proposed Intercreditor Agreement, the Purchaser and the
proposed Lenders have not ﬁnalized the terms of an intercreditor agreement,
Vendor shall provide to Purchaser the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement on
such tenth Business Day, and on the Business Day following the Purchaser’s
receipt of the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement, the Purchaser shall (i) notify
the Vendor of the provisions or aspects of the Intermediate Intercreditor
Agreement which it considers unreasonable, and (ii) provide Vendor with a
modiﬁed version of the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement that it would be
prepared to execute (the “Stipulation and Proposal") A failure of the Purchaser
to notify the Vendor by the end of the fifth Business Day following the
Purchaser’s receipt of the Proposed Intercreditor Agreement that it rejects the
Proposed Intercreditor Agreement or any aspect thereof shall be construed as an
acceptance of the Proposed Intercreditor Agreement, and a failure of the
Purchaser to provide the Stipulation and Proposal on the Business Day following
the Purchaser’s receipt of the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement shall be
construed as an acceptance of the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement; and, in
either instance, the Purchaser shall thereaﬂer be bound to execute and deliver the
applicable intercreditor agreement in furtherance of the Financing.

(c) In any case where the Purchaser and the proposed Lenders have been unable to
ﬁnalize an intercreditor agreement as set forth above, the Vendor may submit the
matter to the expedited arbitration process set forth in Annex 2 for a
determination of whether the Purchaser has established by a preponderance of the
evidence that the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement was unreasonable,
measured by the terms set forth in Section 86(a) and any other criteria which the
arbitrator considers relevant or material

(d) In the event that the arbitrator determines that the Intermediate Intercreditor
Agreement was not unreasonable, the Purchaser shall, upon the Vendor‘s request,
execute and deliver the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing: (i) any Financing that the Vendor arranges
for assets (including without limitation, mobile mining equipment, motor vehicles
and office equipment) subject to operating leases or purchase money ﬁnancing or
other similar ﬁnancing arrangements shall also be entitled to priority over the
Purchaser’s security interest with respect to such assets under the Security
Agreements (other than the Gold Security Interest) and there shall be no
requirement for any such lessor or lender to enter into an intercreditor agreement
with the Purchaser; and (ii) the Purchaser’s security interest in any asset of the
Vendor under any of the Security Agreements and any existing intercreditor
agreements related thereto (other than the Gold Security Interest and any
provision of any intercreditor agreement related thereto) shall terminate upon the


Deposit Reduction Time, at which time, except for intercreditor agreements
relating to the Gold Security Interest which shall be no less favourable to the
Lenders than the intercreditor agreements previously entered into hereunder, there
will be no further requirement under this Section 86 for the Lenders to enter into
intercreditor agreements,

(t) The security interests referred to in this Section 8,6 which are registered in the

(i) Personal Property Security Registry; (ii) British Columbia’s Mineral Titles

Online Registry, and (iii) Land Title Ofﬁce with respect to any Surface Rights

that are registered in the Land Title Ofﬁce from time to time shall be deemed to

be Permitted Encumbrancesi

ANNEX 2
RULES OF ARBITRATION — SECTION 8.6

The following sets forth the expedited procedures that must be followed in
connection with any arbitration brought by the Vendor pursuant to Section 8.6(0) of the
Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise deﬁned have the meanings
assigned to them in the Agreement.

1. The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Arbitration Rules (as that
term is deﬁned in Section 1.1 of the Agreement) then prevailing, except as to those
Arbitration Rules that may be inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 8.6(0) and
8.6(d) of the Agreement, or the terms of this Annex, in which case the terms of this
Annex shall prevail over any inconsistent terms thereof, and the terms of Sections 8.6(0)
and 8.6(d) of the Agreement shall prevail over any inconsistent terms otherwise
contained in the Arbitration Rules.

2. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be impartial and independent of
the Parties and the proposed Lenders,

3. The arbitrator shall be selected through a rank and strike method among a list
of 15 arbitrators provided to Vendor and Purchaser by the British Columbia International
Commercial Arbitration Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia (the “BCICAC”), which
list shall consist of transactional lawyers who have commercial lending expertise and
who have worked for at least ten years at a large commercial law ﬁrm in Vancouver,
British Columbia or Toronto, Ontario (the “List”). Prior to the date on which BCICAC
provides the List, but no later than one Business Day after the BCICAC is requested to
provide the List, Vendor and Purchaser will provide BCICAC with the name of any
arbitrator who would otherwise be eligible to be included in the List but who is a member
of the audit or legal ﬁrm or ﬁrms who advise such Party or the proposed Lenders or a
person who is otherwise regularly retained by such Party or the proposed Lenders, and
BCICAC shall not include any such arbitrators in the List. Each of Vendor and Purchaser
(i) may strike no more than ﬁve names from the List, (ii) shall rank the remaining names
on the List, and (iii) shall provide their conﬁdential ranks and strikes to the BCICAC
within one Business Day of receiving the List If Vendor or Purchaser fails to provide its
ranks and strikes within the one Business Day provided for, it shall be deemed to waive
its right to object, and the other Party‘s ﬁrst ranked arbitrator shall become the appointed
arbitrator. BCICAC shall notify the Vendor and Purchaser of the arbitrator selected no
later than one Business Day from the date it circulated the List, and its decision shall be
conclusive, ﬁnal, and non-appealable, subject to the requirements of Paragraph 2.

4. The arbitrator selected shall have one Business Day thereafter to conﬁrm his
willingness and availability to proceed on the expedited basis provided in this Annex, and
shall by that time also conﬁrm that he meets the criteria set forth in Paragraphs 2 and 3
and has no legal conﬂictsi If the arbitrator fails to make the required conﬁrmations
within the required time frame, then the BCICAC shall, on the following Business Day,
select the next ranked arbitrator from the list and so forth until an arbitrator is selected


5, Once conﬁrmed, the arbitrator shall hold a telephone conference with the
Parties by the next Business Day, and the Parties shall make themselves available for
such conference. During the conference, the arbitrator shall address logistics regarding
the hearing and pre—hearing submissions If one Party fails to participate without good
cause (as determined by the arbitrator), then the arbitrator shall proceed with the
conference without that Party and the Party shall be bound by the decisions reached,

6, Within ﬁve Business Days of that initial telephone conference, each Party
shall simultaneously submit to the arbitrator and exchange with the other Party (by hand
or email) its factual and legal submission (the “Purchaser Submission” and the “Vendor
Submission”, respectively, and each, a “Submission”) addressing the issues set forth in
Paragraph 9 below. The Purchaser and Vendor Submission shall consist of afﬁdavits,
exhibits, and all materials and any other evidence that the Parties wish the arbitrator to
consider in evaluating their respective positions, and shall also include the Intermediate
Intercreditor Agreement that the Vendor provided to Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.6(b)
of the Agreement, Neither Party shall be allowed to supplement its respective
Submission except on good cause shown (as determined by the arbitrator), and the
Purchaser and Vendor Submissions shall substitute for direct testimony at the hearing,
The Parties shall address in their respective Submissions all matters, defenses, proofs,
and arguments (hereinaﬂer, the “Matters”) that they reasonably anticipate the other Party
may raise in its respective Submission.

7, Within ﬁve Business days of the exchange of the Purchaser and Vendor
Submissions, each Party shall simultaneously submit to the arbitrator and exchange with
the other Party (by email or by hand) its rebuttal of the other Party’s Submission (the
“Rebuttal Submission”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Rebuttal Submission may
include Matters not contained in the Parties’ initial Submissions, but only to the extent
such Matters could not have been reasonably anticipated by the Parties in accordance
with the terms of Paragraph 6 hereof. By motion of either Party, made no later than two
Business Days following the exchange of the Rebuttal Submissions, either Party may
seek to exclude any matters from the Rebuttal Submission that should have been
reasonably anticipated in the other Party’s initial Submission, The arbitrator shall rule on
any such motion within two Business Days thereafter,

8, The hearing shall be held in Vancouver no later than ﬁve Business Days
following the date the Rebuttal Submissions were due. There shall be no direct testimony
at the hearing. The afﬁdavits contained in the Parties’ Submissions and Rebuttal
Submissions, to the extent not excluded by the arbitrator pursuant to Paragraph 7 above,
shall constitute the direct testimony at the hearing, Each Party at the hearing shall be
allotted equal time in which to cross-examine the other Party and any witnesses for which
the other Party put in afﬁdavits. The hearing shall be concluded on the same day, and the
arbitrator shall render a short form decision within one Business Day thereafter, which
brieﬂy explains his ﬁndings and the reasons therefor. The arbitrator’s decision shall be
ﬁnal and binding,

9, The sole issues for resolution by the arbitrator shall be whether the Purchaser
has met its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (i) the


Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement does not contain each of the terms set forth in
Section 8.6(a)(i) through 8.6(a)(viii) of the Agreement (the “Required Terms”), unless
such omission was not included in the Stipulation and Proposal; (ii) the provisions of the
Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement containing the Required Terms are set forth in an
unreasonable manner, as measured by any criteria which the arbitrator deems to be
relevant or material (so long as any such criteria does not conﬂict with the terms set forth
in Section 86 of the Agreement); or (iii) the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement is
unreasonable as a whole, as measured by similar terms prevailing in the syndicated
secured lending market If the arbitrator ﬁnds that the Purchaser did not prove (i), (ii), or
(iii) in the preceding sentence, then the arbitrator shall immediately enter a ﬁnal order
and judgment requiring Purchaser to fully execute the Intermediate Intercreditor
Agreement in all respects within one Business Day of receiving a written request from
the Vendor that the Purchaser execute the Intermediate Intercreditor Agreement (the
“Arbitrator Compel Order”). Vendor and Purchaser agree that the Arbitrator Compel
Order will be speciﬁcally enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction. Any appeal
of the Arbitrator Compel Order shall be made on an expedited basis It is agreed that no
stay will issue or be applied for pending any such appeal.

10‘ If any Party fails to cooperate with the arbitration as provided for herein
without good cause (as determined by the arbitrator), the arbitrator shall proceed without
that Party’s participation, and the resulting decision shall be fully enforceable and
effective as if that Party fully participated in all respects. It is understood that time is of
the essence, and that Purchaser agreed to the limited remedy reﬂected in Paragraph 9
hereof in consideration of and in reliance on the expedited timetables reﬂected herein,
The arbitrator has no power to extend the outside dates contemplated herein for the
arbitration hearing and/or for its decision thereafter

11‘ The costs and expenses of the arbitration provided for herein, including
reasonable attorneys’ and expert’s fees, shall be borne by the losing party The losing
party shall be the Purchaser if the arbitrator issues the Arbitrator Compel Order in
Paragraph 9, and shall be Vendor, if the arbitrator does not issue the Arbitrator Compel
Order. In furtherance of this paragraph, within thirty days of issuing the order and
judgment referenced in Paragraph 9, the arbitrator shall issue a further order and
judgment identifying the precise amount that the losing party must pay pursuant to this
Paragraph 11, and ordering that the losing party pay that amount within ﬁve Business
Days thereof. To the extent either party is required to commence a court action to
enforce the decision, award and/0r judgment of the arbitrator under this Annex, the other
Party shall owe that Party its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert’s fees, and costs incurred
in connection therewith. The arbitrator hereunder will determine how much those fees
and costs calculate to, and shall order them to be paid within ﬁve Business Days
therefrom.
