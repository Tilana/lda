<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 28/32, 
</p>
<p>was prepared in cooperation with the Human Rights Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). The Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) continues to assist UNAMI in implementing 
</p>
<p>its mandate on the promotion and protection of human rights in Iraq. UNAMI is located in 
</p>
<p>Baghdad and has field offices in Basra, Erbil and Kirkuk. Despite the difficult security 
</p>
<p>situation, UNAMI continues to conduct its activities in governorates of Iraq in coordination 
</p>
<p>with relevant governmental and non-governmental institutions.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>2. The human rights situation in Iraq remains alarming in the light of violations and 
</p>
<p>abuses committed by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and 
</p>
<p>associated groups. The non-international armed conflict continues to affect large areas of 
</p>
<p>the Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salah al-Din Governorates, while acts of violence 
</p>
<p>and terrorism continue in Baghdad and other areas of the country. On 13 March 2015, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR expressed its concern about the situation in Iraq in its report on the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation in the light of abuses committed by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the 
</p>
<p>Levant and associated groups.1 
</p>
<p>3. In March, Iraqi security forces and associated forces began military operations to 
</p>
<p>retake Tikrit, Salah al-Din Governorate from ISIL, which had held the town since June 
</p>
<p>2014. Military operations commenced on 2 March with an assault by about 30,000 Iraqi 
</p>
<p>security personnel, Popular Mobilization Units, armed groups and tribal fighters. Booby 
</p>
<p>traps, roadside bombs and snipers impeded Iraqi and associated forces in taking the town. 
</p>
<p>The offensive was halted on 14 March, ostensibly pending the arrival of reinforcements and 
</p>
<p>to allow civilians to leave the city, but resumed on 27 March. Prime Minister Haidar al-
</p>
<p>Abadi announced that the State had retaken control of Tikrit on 31 March. 
</p>
<p>4. On 13 April, ISIL attacked the country&#8217;s largest refinery, in Baiji, Salah al-Din 
</p>
<p>Governorate, a strategically important facility accounting for more than a quarter of the 
</p>
<p>State&#8217;s oil refining capacity. ISIL surrounded the refinery and set fire to three oil storage 
</p>
<p>tanks. On 21 May, Iraqi security forces reportedly broke the siege by ISIL. Clashes 
</p>
<p>continued, with ISIL targeting the Iraqi forces with suicide vehicle-borne improvised 
</p>
<p>explosive devices. ISIL fighters reportedly set areas of the refinery on fire to hinder the 
</p>
<p>advance of Iraqi forces. Gains by the Iraqi forces and the Popular Mobilization Units were 
</p>
<p>announced, but reportedly suffered heavy casualties on 6 June after the detonation of one or 
</p>
<p>more improvised explosive devices. On 9 June, ISIL reportedly advanced into the city in 
</p>
<p>the wake of a number of suicide and mortar attacks. At the end of the period under review, 
</p>
<p>heavy fighting around Baiji was continuing. 
</p>
<p>5. On 9 April, the Government of Iraq began military operations against ISIL in Anbar; 
</p>
<p>the next day, ISIL launched an attack on Ramadi District on multiple fronts. On 9 May, the 
</p>
<p>authorities began enlisting 1,000 new recruits to a Sunni militia to assist the Iraqi security 
</p>
<p>forces in Anbar. By 16 May, the city had fallen to ISIL, which then began moving 
</p>
<p>eastwards. Reportedly, some 3,000 Popular Mobilization Forces were deployed to the 
</p>
<p>Habbaniyah airbase to fight ISIL, while 60,000 fighters were deployed to Baghdad to 
</p>
<p>protect the city. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/28/18. </p>


<p>6. After the fall of Ramadi, reports received contained allegations that ISIL had 
</p>
<p>abducted and executed a significant number of civilians and captured Iraqi security 
</p>
<p>personnel. There were also allegations that ISIL was preventing civilians from leaving the 
</p>
<p>city. By 26 May, 220,164 people had fled Ramadi and its environs.2 Large numbers of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons made their way towards Baghdad, Karbala and Babil 
</p>
<p>Governorates, although many were denied entry unless they had a sponsor resident.  
</p>
<p>7. In late May, ISIL seized al-Walid border crossing between the Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>and Iraq, launched an offensive to retake Anbar and carried out attacks east of Fallujah 
</p>
<p>using vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, killing at least 17 soldiers. 
</p>
<p>8. On 2 June, ISIL reportedly closed the gates of a dam in Ramadi, cutting water 
</p>
<p>supplies to al-Khalidiya and al-Habbaniya to the east, which were held by Iraqi security 
</p>
<p>forces and Popular Mobilization Units. Possibly as a result, the level of water in Thi-Qar 
</p>
<p>Governorate dropped, in some places critically. On 4 June, several sheikhs and tribal 
</p>
<p>leaders from Anbar reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIL after a meeting in Fallujah on 3 
</p>
<p>June. It is not clear whether support was pledged under duress. At the end of the period 
</p>
<p>under review, clashes were continuing in several areas of Anbar. 
</p>
<p>9. The situation in Ramadi prompted the Kirkuk Provincial Council Security 
</p>
<p>Committee to stop all road movement to and from areas controlled by ISIL on 20 May. On 
</p>
<p>25 May, the main Kirkuk-Baghdad road was reopened for part of the day. On 3 June, an 
</p>
<p>explosion caused by an airstrike hit a storage facility, causing a significant number of 
</p>
<p>casualties and damage to surrounding structures. Some reports indicated that the facility 
</p>
<p>contained chemical fertilizers, while others claimed that it was used to build improvised 
</p>
<p>explosive devices. One Council member informed media outlets that 150 civilians had been 
</p>
<p>killed and wounded, including women and children, in addition to 100 ISIL militants. 
</p>
<p>10. During the period under review, Diyala Governorate witnessed a steady increase in 
</p>
<p>attacks targeting members of its communities, culminating in May with 22 verified 
</p>
<p>incidents, including at least 28 killings and 13 abductions. In most incidents, perpetrators 
</p>
<p>remain unidentified. Explosions and attacks continued through June, with an individual 
</p>
<p>detonating a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device at a security checkpoint in 
</p>
<p>Baladruz on 6 June. The incident killed at least 11 civilians and wounded 14 others.  
</p>
<p>11. ISIL marked the one-year anniversary of the capture of Mosul, Ninewa Governorate. 
</p>
<p>It continued to have control over all aspects of everyday life in the city. Dress codes have 
</p>
<p>been imposed and freedom of movement is severely restricted. ISIL has imposed its own 
</p>
<p>education curriculum, and demands steep rents and taxes. Punishment for violating ISIL 
</p>
<p>rules is severe, often imposed by its self-appointed courts, and included flogging, 
</p>
<p>amputation, beheading, stoning, immolation and other cruel and unlawful punishment. 
</p>
<p>Reports have been received of a food scarcity in some areas under ISIL control in the 
</p>
<p>Governorate. 
</p>
<p>12. In May, ISIL issued new instructions through mosques, pamphlets and its local radio 
</p>
<p>channel ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. According to the instructions, women are not 
</p>
<p>allowed to leave their home from dawn to sunset, and no stores, except grocery stores and 
</p>
<p>pharmacies, may open during this period. On 17 May, ISIL divided Ninewa Governorate 
</p>
<p>into three &#8220;states&#8221; &#8211; Jazeera, Tigris and Ninewa &#8211; and appointed a <i>wali</i> for each one. An 
</p>
<p>order was also issued preventing residents from leaving Mosul, save for medical 
</p>
<p>emergencies. In mid-June, local media reported that ISIL had banned grain exports from 
</p>
<p>Mosul and was demanding a share of harvests from farmers.

</p>
<p>2015. </p>


<p>13. In Baghdad, terrorist attacks with improvised explosive devices were made on a 
</p>
<p>daily basis, killing and wounding civilians. Unidentified bodies continued to be found 
</p>
<p>around Baghdad and its outlying areas. 
</p>
<p>14. UNAMI/OHCHR continued to monitor and report on the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR has repeatedly called upon all armed groups to comply strictly with 
</p>
<p>applicable international humanitarian and human rights law and to take all feasible 
</p>
<p>precautions to spare civilians the effects of hostilities. UNAMI and OHCHR issued joint 
</p>
<p>reports on the protection of civilians in the armed conflict in Iraq on 18 August 2014,
3
 26 
</p>
<p>September 2014
4
 and 23 February 2015.
</p>
<p>5
 They also issued joint reports on the death penalty 
</p>
<p>in Iraq in October 2014,6 and on the judicial response to allegations of torture in February 
</p>
<p>2015.7 The ongoing hostilities and violence have, however, had a severe impact on the 
</p>
<p>ability of UNAMI and OHCHR to verify furthermore allegations in areas under the control 
</p>
<p>of ISIL or to provide technical assistance in those areas.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights priorities and technical assistance needs 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Impact of the conflict on civilians 
</b></p>
<p>15. From 1 January 2014 to 31 May 2015, UNAMI/OHCHR recorded at least 46,114 
</p>
<p>civilian casualties (15,612 killed and 30,502 wounded) as a result of the non-international 
</p>
<p>armed conflict in Iraq.8 Owing to severe limitations to the capacity of UNAMI and OHCHR 
</p>
<p>to verify reports of civilian casualties, these figures should be regarded as the minimum. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, the number of civilians killed as a result of secondary effects of violence, 
</p>
<p>such as lack of access to food, water or medicine, is unknown. 
</p>
<p>16. UNAMI/OHCHR supported the Government&#8217;s efforts to fulfil its primary 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect civilians from the effects of conflict and violence, and to meet its 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law. For instance, in May, it 
</p>
<p>organized training courses for staff members of the National Operations Centre, composed 
</p>
<p>of representatives of various government ministries, on State obligations in relation to 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and human rights principles, including principles of 
</p>
<p>proportionality and distinction, and reporting on incidents involving civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 OHCHR/UNAMI, Report on the Protection of Civilians in the Non International Armed Conflict in 
</p>
<p>Iraq: 5 June &#8211; 5 July 2014.  
</p>
<p> 4 OHCHR/UNAMI, Report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict in Iraq: 6 July &#8211; 10 
</p>
<p>September 2014.  
</p>
<p> 5 OHCHR/UNAMI, Report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict in Iraq: 11 September &#8211; 10 
</p>
<p>December 2014. 
</p>
<p> 6 OHCHR/UNAMI, Report on the Death Penalty in Iraq, Baghdad, October 2014. 
</p>
<p> 7 OHCHR/UNAMI, Report on the judicial response to allegations of torture in Iraq, Baghdad. February 
</p>
<p>2015. 
</p>
<p> 8 The civilian casualty figures given in the present report include civilians and civilian police officers, 
</p>
<p>including civilian casualties from Anbar Governorate. UNAMI was prevented from effectively 
</p>
<p>verifying casualties in conflict areas owing to the prevailing insecurity. The figures for casualties 
</p>
<p>from Anbar Governorate, provided by the Anbar Health Directorate, might be underestimated owing 
</p>
<p>to the heightened volatility of the situation and disruptions to services. In some cases, UNAMI was 
</p>
<p>able to verify only partially certain incidents in the governorate. </p>


<p>17. UNAMI/OHCHR held a round table with Ninewa Provincial Council members in 
</p>
<p>June to discuss the protection of civilians and the need for community reconciliation. The 
</p>
<p>importance of accountability and justice for victims was emphasized as a means of 
</p>
<p>overcoming the cycle of violence.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Unlawful killings and abductions 
</b></p>
<p>18. UNAMI/OHCHR continued to receive numerous credible reports of gross violations 
</p>
<p>and abuses of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law being 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by ISIL against civilians in an apparent widespread or systematic manner. In 
</p>
<p>some instances, these may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide 
</p>
<p>(see A/HRC/28/18). 
</p>
<p>19. In particular, ISIL continued to target individuals and groups, including former 
</p>
<p>members of the Iraqi security forces, public figures, professionals and persons perceived to 
</p>
<p>be associated with the Government or against ISIL ideology or rule. Sources reported that, 
</p>
<p>on 9 June, ISIL killed 134 former members of the Iraqi security forces by shooting them in 
</p>
<p>the head in Mosul, Ninewa. The victims had been held captive for months and forced to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;repent&#8221; to ISIL, whose members suspected that they intended to join forces to liberate 
</p>
<p>Mosul. Reports received described how ISIL also targeted and murdered religious and 
</p>
<p>community leaders, as well as professionals, including journalists and doctors, who refused 
</p>
<p>to conform to its rules or to work in its service. 
</p>
<p>20. ISIL carried out executions following sentences imposed its self-appointed courts, 
</p>
<p>particularly in Mosul. Sources reported that residents were gathered and forced to watch 
</p>
<p>executions and other cruel treatment. Often reasons for killings and abductions were 
</p>
<p>unknown.  
</p>
<p>21. UNAMI/OHCHR also received reports of abuses and violations perpetrated by the 
</p>
<p>Iraqi security forces and associated forces. In some cases, civilians and civilian 
</p>
<p>infrastructure appear to have been directly targeted during military operations; in other 
</p>
<p>cases, military operations may have been carried out without proper regard for the 
</p>
<p>principles of distinction and proportionality. Reports indicated that some armed forces were 
</p>
<p>operating outside of government control and perpetrating a range of violations and abuses, 
</p>
<p>including unlawful killings, abductions and destruction of property in areas recently 
</p>
<p>liberated from ISIL. 
</p>
<p>22. UNAMI/OHCHR also received reports of targeted attacks and reprisals against 
</p>
<p>persons believed to support or to be associated with ISIL, particularly Sunni Arab 
</p>
<p>community members. In early June, a video was posted on the Internet purporting to show 
</p>
<p>members of a militia burning the body of a man hanging by his feet, reportedly in Garma, 
</p>
<p>north-east of Fallujah, Anbar Governorate. Members of the militia are heard accusing the 
</p>
<p>man of having been a member of ISIL.  
</p>
<p>23. UNAMI/OHCHR documented human rights abuses and violations committed by 
</p>
<p>unidentified perpetrators. Detonation of improvised explosive devices in public places, 
</p>
<p>unlawful killings and abductions continued to be reported in large numbers, particularly in 
</p>
<p>Baghdad, as well as in other areas of the country not directly affected by the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>Targeted individuals included parliamentarians, tribal and religious leaders, judges and 
</p>
<p>other public officials.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Destruction of civilian property and infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p>24. ISIL continued deliberately to target civilian objects in attacks, in particular the 
</p>
<p>property of individuals perceived to oppose ISIL, including the homes of tribal leaders, 
</p>
<p>public officials and local leaders, as well as government buildings. UNAMI/OHCHR also </p>


<p>verified reports that ISIL had planted explosives in homes when retreating from territory, 
</p>
<p>killing civilians when they returned. 
</p>
<p>25. ISIL also continued to destroy places of religious and cultural significance, which 
</p>
<p>ISIL considers to be un-Islamic, including mosques, churches, ancient sites, shrines, tombs 
</p>
<p>and graves. ISIL loots the sites before destroying them.  
</p>
<p>26. UNAMI/OHCHR also received allegations that pro-government forces had 
</p>
<p>destroyed civilian property. On 1 April, UNAMI received reports that militias had looted 
</p>
<p>and burned more than 200 civilian homes and 300 shops in Tikrit, Salah al-Din 
</p>
<p>Governorate in the first 48 hours of the liberation of the city. The Prime Minister 
</p>
<p>established a committee to investigate the events. The committee issued a statement noting 
</p>
<p>that 67 homes and 85 shops were burned down in Tikrit at the beginning of April. UNAMI 
</p>
<p>met with tribal and community representatives from Tikrit to discuss these reports, as well 
</p>
<p>as the alleged targeting of civilians by militia forces. The means of creating conditions for 
</p>
<p>the safe, dignified and voluntary return of displaced persons to their homes were also 
</p>
<p>discussed.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Groups in focus 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Women 
</b></p>
<p>27. The 2005 Constitution provides for fundamental women&#8217;s rights, including equal 
</p>
<p>treatment before the law. UNAMI/OHCHR nonetheless observed that Iraqi women 
</p>
<p>continued to face violence, discrimination and unequal treatment. Cases of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence are believed to go largely unreported and unpunished, and victims remain largely 
</p>
<p>unprotected. The lack of comprehensive official statistics on domestic violence prevents a 
</p>
<p>full understanding and the formulation of a proper response to such cases. 
</p>
<p>28. Strengthening the legal protection framework against gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>continues to be a priority. The draft family protection law, the text of which substantively 
</p>
<p>fails to meet the State&#8217;s obligations under international law, has been pending before the 
</p>
<p>Council of Representatives. The draft shelter policy for victims of domestic violence also 
</p>
<p>remained under review. The Criminal Code No. 111 of 1969 continues to permit &#8220;honour&#8221; 
</p>
<p>as a lawful defence in crimes alleging violence against women and family members, 
</p>
<p>although it is reported that many hundreds of women die from honour killings each year. 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR also received credible reports of women being trafficked inside Iraq. 
</p>
<p>Women remain underrepresented in public life.  
</p>
<p>29. The family protection units of the Iraqi police, aimed at providing protection to 
</p>
<p>victims of domestic violence, are underresourced and understaffed, and remain inaccessible 
</p>
<p>to most victims; consequently, women who are the victims of domestic and other forms of 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence still have nowhere to seek sanctuary or to claim their legal rights. 
</p>
<p>Those who seek protection are often housed in women&#8217;s prisons and detention centres.  
</p>
<p>30. In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, the full realization of women&#8217;s rights continues to be 
</p>
<p>hindered by a number of factors, including deep-rooted patriarchal norms, legislative gaps 
</p>
<p>and a culture of silence. The participation of women in political life remains limited. The 
</p>
<p>Government of the Kurdistan region of Iraq has, however, introduced a number of 
</p>
<p>legislative, institutional and policy reforms aimed at addressing violence against women 
</p>
<p>and other forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>31. The ability of women to enjoy a full range of human rights has deteriorated 
</p>
<p>considerably with the ongoing armed conflict. ISIL, in particular, continues to perpetrate 
</p>
<p>gross violations of women&#8217;s rights. It has imposed strict codes of behaviour, including </p>


<p>regulations concerning dress and freedom of movement. Women must be fully covered 
</p>
<p>while in public and are only allowed to move in public in the company of an appropriately 
</p>
<p>related male chaperone. Severe forms of punishment are imposed for non-compliance, 
</p>
<p>including fines, lashings and even execution.  
</p>
<p>32. ISIL continued to target female community and political leaders, subjecting them to 
</p>
<p>abduction, torture and murder. UNAMI/OHCHR continued to receive reports that women 
</p>
<p>and girls held by ISIL, particularly those from ethnic and religious minority communities 
</p>
<p>such as the Yezidi and others, are subjected to harrowing acts of sexual and physical 
</p>
<p>violence and to sexual slavery. UNAMI/OHCHR believes that there may still be as many as 
</p>
<p>3,500 women and children, and some men, predominantly Yezidi, but also other ethnic and 
</p>
<p>religious communities who are still being held by ISIL. Sexual violence appears to be used 
</p>
<p>by ISIL as a deliberate tactic in targeting diverse ethnic and religious communities. 
</p>
<p>33. UNAMI/OHCHR works with a range of counterparts, including government actors, 
</p>
<p>institutions, civil society groups and women&#8217;s right defenders to monitor women&#8217;s rights to 
</p>
<p>raise awareness and build capacity of local actors. For instance, in the Kurdistan region of 
</p>
<p>Iraq, UNAMI is working with the Directorate for Combating Violence against Women to 
</p>
<p>promote respect for key human rights standards and to raise awareness about violations 
</p>
<p>against women. 
</p>
<p>34. In mid-May, UNAMI/OHCHR met with a member of the Board of Commissioners 
</p>
<p>of the Iraq High Commission for Human Rights to discuss concerns regarding allegations 
</p>
<p>of violations and abuse of internally displaced persons perpetrated by security forces, 
</p>
<p>including alleged sexual violence. On 2 June, UNAMI/OHCHR also met with the 
</p>
<p>Chairperson of the Committee on Women of the Basra Provincial Council to discuss the 
</p>
<p>protection of civilians and the vulnerability of women and girls during armed conflict. It 
</p>
<p>provided technical advice on the responsibility of State actors and actions to be taken to 
</p>
<p>ensure the protection of women and girls.  
</p>
<p>35. UNAMI/OHCHR will also seek to implement, inter alia<i>, </i>a number of projects to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the Iraqi legal system and institutions, in particular to address sexual and gender-
</p>
<p>based violence and to promote gender equality in compliance with international human 
</p>
<p>rights law; to further increase participation of human rights defenders and journalists, 
</p>
<p>including women, in public life at the international, national and local levels; and to 
</p>
<p>increase access to psychosocial support for victims of torture and sexual and gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Children 
</b></p>
<p>36. Children have been the victims of violence associated with the hostilities and been 
</p>
<p>severely affected by the denial of access to humanitarian assistance and the disruption to 
</p>
<p>education caused by the ongoing conflict. UNAMI/OHCHR also continued to receive 
</p>
<p>reports of forced recruitment and use of children in hostilities by ISIL. 
</p>
<p>37. The ISIL recruiting campaign continued, with reports in mid-May that ISIL fighters 
</p>
<p>were visiting high schools in Mosul and demanding that students as young as 14 pledge 
</p>
<p>allegiance to the group and to fight in its forces. ISIL subsequently announced at schools 
</p>
<p>and universities that all male students must join ISIL after completing their exams. ISIL 
</p>
<p>posted videos on the Internet purporting to show children being taught its ideology and 
</p>
<p>trained to become fighters. The children in the videos appeared to be as young as 12. 
</p>
<p>Another video appeared to show captured Yezidi children as young as seven being 
</p>
<p>indoctrinated. UNAMI/OHCHR received reports that ISIL has used children as fighters in 
</p>
<p>areas of Sinjar and Zummar in Ninewa Governorate. </p>


<p>38. UNAMI/OHCHR works with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund to monitor and 
</p>
<p>report on violations of the rights of children, contributing to the annual report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on children and armed conflict, and reporting on relevant violations to 
</p>
<p>the Security Council by way of a global horizontal note coordinated by the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>39. The non-international armed conflict in Iraq resulted in the internal displacement of 
</p>
<p>3,035,592 civilians from January 2014 to 21 May 2015.
 
Over 70 per cent are from Anbar 
</p>
<p>and Ninewa Governorates. As at 21 May, improvements in the security situation in some 
</p>
<p>areas led to the return of 171,204 displaced persons to their places of origin.9 
</p>
<p>40. UNAMI/OHCHR monitors the situation of internally displaced persons across Iraq 
</p>
<p>and &#8211; security conditions permitting &#8211; conducts regular visits to camps and other locations 
</p>
<p>where displaced persons have settled. UNAMI liaises with authorities and organizations 
</p>
<p>providing support to displaced persons and raises issues of concern during monitoring 
</p>
<p>visits. UNAMI/OHCHR gave capacity-building assistance to staff providing front-line 
</p>
<p>support to displaced persons. For instance, in early June, UNAMI/OHCHR gave training 
</p>
<p>courses on international human rights standards, with a particular focus on the rights of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, humanitarian principles, and the protection of civilians in 
</p>
<p>conflict, to 45 staff members from four camps for displaced persons in Dohuk Governorate. 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR, as a full member of the United Nations country team Protection Cluster, 
</p>
<p>also supports work to address the needs of displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>41. In southern Iraq, where thousands of displaced families have been hosted in camps 
</p>
<p>and collective centres since June 2014, UNAMI/OHCHR and United Nations country team 
</p>
<p>staff members met with officials from the Ministry of Displacement and Migration in Basra 
</p>
<p>in mid-June. Methods of improving coordination among country team agencies and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations regarding the protection of civilians were discussed, and 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR gave a briefing on international humanitarian law, including on 
</p>
<p>international crimes. 
</p>
<p>42. UNAMI/OHCHR has consistently advocated for the full respect of the rights of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, particularly their freedom of movement and access to safety 
</p>
<p>and humanitarian assistance. UNAMI/OHCHR regularly liaises with local government 
</p>
<p>actors, including mayors and governors, concerning the rights of displaced persons, and 
</p>
<p>advocates for appropriate measures to ensure their freedom of movement and access to 
</p>
<p>safety while taking security concerns into account. For instance, UNAMI/OHCHR met with 
</p>
<p>a member of the Kirkuk Provincial Council, city council members and several village and 
</p>
<p>community representatives in Kirkuk to discuss authorization procedures for return to 
</p>
<p>liberated areas, the security concerns of displaced persons, the destruction of property, the 
</p>
<p>appropriation of land and access to humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>43. On 26 May, UNAMI/OHCHR met with members of the Iraqi police in Kirkuk to 
</p>
<p>discuss the situation of internally displaced persons in the city, including access through 
</p>
<p>checkpoints and registration procedures, as well as reports of arrests of displaced persons in 
</p>
<p>certain areas of the city. UNAMI/OHCHR raised concerns regarding the voluntary nature 
</p>
<p>and safety of the prospective return of displaced persons to areas of origin, as well as 
</p>
<p>protection concerns of women and girls, including early marriage, increased prostitution, 
</p>
<p>and the rising number of street children, who are particularly vulnerable to sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation. UNAMI/OHCHR also met with the Intelligence Police (<i>Asayish</i>) of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 IOM, Displacement Tracking Matrix (see footnote 2). </p>


<p>Kurdistan region of Iraq in Kirkuk to discuss the security of displaced persons in the city 
</p>
<p>and to raise the issue of alleged forced returns. 
</p>
<p>44. UNAMI/OHCHR continuously engages with the Ministry of Human Rights and has 
</p>
<p>developed an agreed timetable for the delivery of joint technical assistance, including 
</p>
<p>training courses on human rights and humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>45. In early May, UNAMI/OHCHR met with the Minister for Human Rights to discuss 
</p>
<p>allegations that displaced persons from Anbar seeking refuge and protection in Baghdad 
</p>
<p>had been subjected to threats, kidnapping and killings by armed groups. Reports were also 
</p>
<p>received that displaced persons had been forcibly evicted from Baghdad and sent back to 
</p>
<p>Anbar. The Government was urged to investigate these reports and to respect fully the 
</p>
<p>rights of displaced persons to have access to areas of safety.  
</p>
<p>46. UNAMI monitored cases of arrest and detention of internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>attempting to reach areas of safety. Reports indicated that many, if not most, of these 
</p>
<p>detainees had been held by authorities without charge for long periods without access to 
</p>
<p>judicial review or legal representation, and their families had not been informed of their 
</p>
<p>whereabouts. UNAMI regularly monitors detention facilities to follow up on such cases and 
</p>
<p>has advocated with security forces and Government authorities to ensure that international 
</p>
<p>due process standards are respected.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Ethnic and religious groups  
</b></p>
<p>47. Ethnic and religious groups and minorities in Iraq have endured a history of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and violence. These communities have become more vulnerable owing to 
</p>
<p>the ongoing armed conflict and many have suffered gross violations of their human rights.  
</p>
<p>48. ISIL has continued to target members of different ethnic and religious communities, 
</p>
<p>including Christians, Faili Kurds, Kaka&#8217;e, Sabaeans, Shabak, Shi&#8217;a Arabs, Turkmen, Yezidi 
</p>
<p>and others, intentionally subjecting them to a range of abuses and violations of international 
</p>
<p>human rights and humanitarian law. These acts appear to be part of a systematic or 
</p>
<p>widespread policy that aims to suppress, permanently expel or destroy these communities 
</p>
<p>within ISIL areas of control. ISIL continued to publish &#8220;justifications&#8221;, including its 
</p>
<p>requirement to cleanse lands under the control of its self-declared &#8220;Islamic caliphate&#8221; of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;infidels&#8221;, by forcibly converting, suppressing, expelling or killing people of other faiths or 
</p>
<p>those who do not subscribe to its <i>takfiri</i> doctrines. ISIL has imposed on Christians and 
</p>
<p>Sabaeans the requirement to convert to Islam, pay <i>jezyah</i> (a protection or toleration tax), be 
</p>
<p>expelled or be killed; for Shias to repent or face penalties (including death) as apostates; 
</p>
<p>and for Yezidi, Kaka&#8217;ee and other faith communities (which ISIL regard as infidels) to 
</p>
<p>convert to Islam or be killed. Most recently, ISIL published another &#8220;justification&#8221; for the 
</p>
<p>sexual enslavement of Yezidi women and other women from communities it regards as 
</p>
<p><i>kufaar</i> (infidels) in its magazine, <i>Dabiq</i>.  
</p>
<p>49. As many as 2,500 men, women and children &#8211; predominantly from the Yezidi 
</p>
<p>community but also from other groups &#8211; are being held by ISIL. UNAMI/OHCHR fears for 
</p>
<p>their safety and security. Those who have reached safety consistently report lack of basic 
</p>
<p>necessities such as food and hygienic items, forced labour, forced religious conversion, ill-
</p>
<p>treatment, murder and the regular infliction of physical and sexual violence, including 
</p>
<p>sexual slavery and the trafficking of women and children.  
</p>
<p>50. UNAMI/OHCHR has been monitoring the situation of minority groups in Iraq, and 
</p>
<p>actively working with local communities to promote respect and protection of their rights. 
</p>
<p>UNAMI met with the elected representative of minority communities in the Basra 
</p>
<p>Provincial Council and legislative staff to give advice and make recommendations on </p>


<p>international standards regarding the protection of civilians, particularly vulnerable ethnic 
</p>
<p>and religious minorities.  
</p>
<p>51. In June 2015, UNAMI/OHCHR re-established a committee appointed by a 
</p>
<p>conference on the rights of minorities held in Baghdad in March 2014 and attended by 
</p>
<p>representatives of all minority ethnic and religious communities in Iraq. The participants 
</p>
<p>had agreed to a declaration on the rights of minorities in Iraq and a road map of legislative, 
</p>
<p>policy and other reforms that would strengthen their protection and facilitate their full and 
</p>
<p>equal participation in political, social and economic life. The security situation had 
</p>
<p>prevented the committee from convening any meetings until recently.  
</p>
<p>52. In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, UNAMI/OHCHR offered technical assistance to 
</p>
<p>members of Parliament regarding draft legislation to establish a minorities council with a 
</p>
<p>mandate to protect and promote the rights of minorities in the region. UNAMI/OHCHR 
</p>
<p>made comments on the draft law, advising that the role of the council be made meaningful 
</p>
<p>through elaboration of its mandate and that the issues of its independence and authority of 
</p>
<p>be clarified.  
</p>
<p><b>5.  Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>53. Across Iraq, UNAMI/OHCHR observed that persons with disabilities were often 
</p>
<p>neglected in public discourse dominated by the ongoing armed conflict. They remain 
</p>
<p>among the most vulnerable communities, and face numerous barriers to their full and equal 
</p>
<p>participation in political, social, economic and cultural life. The full impact of the conflict 
</p>
<p>on this group is unknown and the welfare of those living in areas under ISIL control or 
</p>
<p>where conflict is ongoing remains a grave concern.  
</p>
<p>54. UNAMI has been working with members of the Government and with civil society 
</p>
<p>to improve the enjoyment of rights by persons with disabilities. For instance, it delivered a 
</p>
<p>training workshop on 26 May in coordination with a local non-governmental organization 
</p>
<p>representing people with disabilities. Approximately 20 people with disabilities attended 
</p>
<p>the workshop, together with government officials working on disability-related issues. The 
</p>
<p>participants were trained on methodologies for improving advocacy to promote greater 
</p>
<p>respect for their rights through an increased understanding of the legal regime of protection 
</p>
<p>of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Judicial system and respect for due process 
</b></p>
<p>55. UNAMI/OHCHR continued to work with relevant government and judicial 
</p>
<p>departments to address shortcomings in the application of due process and fair trial 
</p>
<p>standards. Particular attention is given to respect for procedural guarantees, including the 
</p>
<p>presumption of innocence, access to legal counsel, and consideration of the testimony of 
</p>
<p>witnesses and other evidence provided as opposed to confessions that might have been 
</p>
<p>extracted under duress.    
</p>
<p>56. UNAMI/OHCHR assists the Government in implementing law, policy and 
</p>
<p>institutional reforms aimed to bring about greater respect for the rule of law, including due 
</p>
<p>process and fair trial standards. 
</p>
<p>57. In May, UNAMI/OHCHR gave technical assistance to 30 lawyers from Anbar, 
</p>
<p>Baghdad, Diyala and the Kurdistan region of Iraq on the Basic Principles on the Role of 
</p>
<p>Lawyers, human rights standards in the administration of justice, and the legal framework 
</p>
<p>for the protection of internally displaced persons. UNAMI/OHCHR continues to provide </p>


<p>capacity-building assistance to justice actors to strengthen the rule of law and respect for 
</p>
<p>due process, and in this regard will implement a project to facilitate consultations with 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and develop human rights and rule of law training curricula for civilian law 
</p>
<p>enforcement and corrective services officials. 
</p>
<p>58. UNAMI/OHCHR also brought allegations of enforced disappearance to the attention 
</p>
<p>of the Government. Multiple reports were received that individuals had been detained by 
</p>
<p>Iraqi and Kurdish authorities, but their whereabouts had not been communicated to their 
</p>
<p>families, detainees had not been informed of the charges against them, they had been 
</p>
<p>denied access to legal representatives or were being held incommunicado. 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR engaged with the Minister of the Interior, the Minister for Defence, the 
</p>
<p>Minister for Human Rights and the Minister for Justice to ascertain whether disappeared 
</p>
<p>individuals had been detained by any Iraqi authorities and, if so, requested that they provide 
</p>
<p>information on the whereabouts and condition of specified individuals, as well as on the 
</p>
<p>status of any legal proceedings against them. In June 2015 the Government of Iraq 
</p>
<p>responded to the queries of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances in relation to three 
</p>
<p>cases.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Detention standards 
</b></p>
<p>59. According to the Government, as at 14 April 2014, 27,843 persons were being held 
</p>
<p>in detention centres and prisons administered by the Ministry of Justice. This number 
</p>
<p>included 11,779 detained under the Anti-terrorism Law (both those awaiting trial and those 
</p>
<p>convicted), 926 women and 181 juveniles.10  
</p>
<p>60. Where security conditions allow, UNAMI/OHCHR regularly visits detention centres 
</p>
<p>and prisons under the authority of the Ministry of Justice. Although conditions of detention 
</p>
<p>have improved, problems persist, including overcrowding, poor hygienic conditions and 
</p>
<p>limited medical services in some facilities. UNAMI/OHCHR also noted a lack of 
</p>
<p>specialized facilities to accommodate women and children, who are often held in cells in 
</p>
<p>police stations. Children are often interned in adult facilities.  
</p>
<p>61. Through its monitoring, UNAMI/OHCHR notified the authorities responsible for 
</p>
<p>detention facilities and the Ministry of Justice of issues of concern and cases requiring 
</p>
<p>attention. It also made recommendations on improving conditions of detention to bring 
</p>
<p>them into line with international standards. Owing to the security situation in the country 
</p>
<p>and the transfer of prisoners and detainees to safe areas, detention centres and prisons have 
</p>
<p>suffered serious overcrowding in already inadequate penitentiary infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>62. For instance, in early April, UNAMI/OHCHR visited the Basra Central Prison, 
</p>
<p>where many individuals held for terrorism-related offences are detained. UNAMI met with 
</p>
<p>the director to discuss compliance with due process standards, particularly the right of 
</p>
<p>detainees to have access to a lawyer while in detention and facilitation of the right of the 
</p>
<p>accused to prepare an adequate defence. The duties of prison officials and procedures that 
</p>
<p>should be in place when faced with credible allegations of torture were also discussed. The 
</p>
<p>director pointed out that, owing to transfers of detainees from other parts of Iraq, the facility 
</p>
<p>hosted twice as many detainees than its maximum capacity. Similarly, the director of al-
</p>
<p>Hoot prison in Nassiyira pointed out the same problem in his facility. 
</p>
<p>63. Overcrowding was exacerbated by the lack of adequate resources for the judiciary to 
</p>
<p>process cases in a timely and efficient manner.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 The figures include detainees held in two federal prisons in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. The number 
</p>
<p>of detainees held under the authority of the ministries of the Interior, Defence and Labour and Social 
</p>
<p>Affairs is not known. </p>


<p>64. On 14 April, UNAMI/OHCHR visited al-Rusafa detention facility in Baghdad and 
</p>
<p>subsequently sent recommendations to the Ministry of Justice on improving the conditions 
</p>
<p>of detention. In June, UNAMI/OHCHR visited several detention facilities in Zakho, Dohuk 
</p>
<p>Governorate, and raised concerns with relevant authorities regarding the conditions of 
</p>
<p>detention at an <i>Asayish</i> facility.  
</p>
<p>65. In late April, in coordination with the management of al-Ma&#8217;aqal Prison in Basra, 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR held a seminar where experts from the University of Basra delivered 
</p>
<p>presentations on prison management, treatment of detainees, and their reintegration into 
</p>
<p>society. The experts discussed, inter alia, international legal standards applicable to persons 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty and comparative best practices in prison management that could be 
</p>
<p>adopted in Iraq. The participants included judges, prosecutors, prison officials, lawyers, 
</p>
<p>journalists and representatives of non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Torture and other ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>66. UNAMI/OHCHR received allegations from detainees and prisoners that they had 
</p>
<p>been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. Through direct trial monitoring, 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR noted that courts often relied on confessions as the sole or most 
</p>
<p>significant evidence upon which convictions are based, even where the accused person has 
</p>
<p>claimed that the confession was induced through torture.  
</p>
<p>67. UNAMI/OHCHR has advocated to the Government to ensure that any allegations of 
</p>
<p>torture or other ill-treatment are promptly and properly investigated.  
</p>
<p><b> D. National institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. National Human Rights Commissions 
</b></p>
<p>68. UNAMI/OHCHR began to advocate for the establishment of an Iraqi High 
</p>
<p>Commission for Human Rights in compliance with the Paris Principles in 2004. The 
</p>
<p>Commission was established by law No. 53 of 2008. 
</p>
<p>69. UNAMI/OHCHR, in partnership with the United Nations Office for Project Services 
</p>
<p>and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in a project funded by the 
</p>
<p>European Union, provided the Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights with support and 
</p>
<p>technical advice. In May, UNAMI/OHCHR gave training courses to members of the 
</p>
<p>Commission secretariat on the protection of civilians, State responsibility, accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and the role of the national human rights institution. In June, a training course 
</p>
<p>was conducted on monitoring, investigating and reporting on human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>abuses to more than 40 staff members of the Commission secretariat. 
</p>
<p>70. UNAMI/OHCHR, in partnership with UNDP, also supported the establishment and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building of the Independent Board of Human Rights in the Kurdistan region of 
</p>
<p>Iraq. UNAMI/OHCHR supported the creation of a database to facilitate information-
</p>
<p>gathering and analysis, and organized training courses on detention monitoring and the 
</p>
<p>investigation and documentation of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>71. On 3 November 2014, Iraq was reviewed for the second time by the Working Group 
</p>
<p>on the Universal Periodic Review. A total of 91 States made 229 recommendations on 
</p>
<p>improving the human rights situation, of which the Government accepted 175. 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR provided the Government with technical assistance in the preparation of 
</p>
<p>its State report, and also trained members of non-governmental organizations to assist in 
</p>
<p>with the preparation of their stakeholder submissions. UNAMI/OHCHR furthermore 
</p>
<p>provided technical support to a coalition of 29 representatives of non-governmental </p>


<p>organizations from all governorates of Iraq in preparation of their submission to the review. 
</p>
<p>It also gave technical advice to Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Independent Board of Human Rights on their joint submission, and assisted the United 
</p>
<p>Nations country team in preparing its submission. UNAMI/OHCHR is working with the 
</p>
<p>Government on the development of a second national plan of action on human rights to 
</p>
<p>implement the recommendations accepted during the review. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Civil society actors 
</b></p>
<p>72. UNAMI/OHCHR regularly liaises with civil society partners, human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and journalists. In mid-June, UNAMI/OHCHR organized capacity-building 
</p>
<p>activities on human rights-based approaches to journalism for 18 journalists in Kirkuk. The 
</p>
<p>activity sensitized participants on special considerations to take into account when reporting 
</p>
<p>on human rights issues.  
</p>
<p>73. On 24 May, UNAMI/OHCHR met with the Chairperson of the non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organization committee of the Basra Provincial Council and discussed how the ongoing 
</p>
<p>armed conflict has been affecting the work of non-governmental organizations in the 
</p>
<p>governorate. UNAMI provided advice on best practices for civil society organizations to 
</p>
<p>work on protection of civilians and explored means of enhancing cooperation among the 
</p>
<p>Council, non-governmental organizations and UNAMI/OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>74. Nineteen staff members of a Yezidi non-governmental organization were trained in 
</p>
<p>June in Dohuk Governorate on human rights, humanitarian and protection principles, and 
</p>
<p>monitoring and documenting violations. In addition, UNAMI/OHCHR provided technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to non-governmental organizations in Basra on human rights standards, including 
</p>
<p>the responsibility of State actors in relation to the protection and human rights of civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Legal reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>75. UNAMI/OHCHR has been pursuing initiatives to promote community 
</p>
<p>reconciliation. For instance, UNAMI/OHCHR engaged with Government actors in the de-
</p>
<p>Baathification process. It also offered technical advice on legislation to amend the current 
</p>
<p>justice and accountability law, which mandates the investigation of individuals referred to it 
</p>
<p>and different actions addressing individuals found to have been members of the Baath 
</p>
<p>party.  
</p>
<p>76. UNAMI/OHCHR also embarked on a community reconciliation programme, which 
</p>
<p>involves working in partnership with Iraqi non-governmental organizations to identify past 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, and individuals and communities that have been affected by them, 
</p>
<p>and to engage in a dialogue on processes and policies that would provide victims with 
</p>
<p>justice, accountability and compensation or support. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Criminal laws 
</b></p>
<p>77. In the context of the ongoing gross violations of human rights and serious violations 
</p>
<p>of humanitarian law in Iraq, such as those committed by ISIL and associated armed groups, 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR has encouraged the authorities to pursue meaningful accountability, 
</p>
<p>particularly for international crimes. At present, war crimes, crimes against humanity and 
</p>
<p>genocide are not within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts. In the Kurdistan region of 
</p>
<p>Iraq, UNAMI/OHCHR met with the Deputy Speaker and the Human Rights Committee of 
</p>
<p>the Parliament to advocate for the inclusion of these crimes in regional legislation so that </p>


<p>perpetrators could be brought to justice in a manner that recognizes the true nature of such 
</p>
<p>crimes. UNAMI/OHCHR also encouraged the Government of Iraq to accede to the Rome 
</p>
<p>Statute of the International Criminal Court and to ratify Protocol to the Geneva 
</p>
<p>Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts. 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR conducted training with the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee on 
</p>
<p>the protection of civilians and on international legal obligations with regard to 
</p>
<p>accountability for the commission of international crimes.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Anti-terrorism laws 
</b></p>
<p>78. UNAMI/OHCHR has serious concerns concerning Anti-terrorism Law No. 13 of 
</p>
<p>2005 and its conformity with international human rights standards. UNAMI/OHCHR 
</p>
<p>conducted advocacy with the Government of Iraq, the Parliamentary Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee, law enforcement officials, the judiciary and non-governmental organizations on 
</p>
<p>the need to amend the law to ensure it complies with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR has embarked on a technical cooperation project to study thoroughly the 
</p>
<p>law and to propose amendments.  
</p>
<p>79. UNAMI/OHCHR will implement a number of projects involving consultations with 
</p>
<p>stakeholders with a view to identifying gaps in the criminal system and drafting a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive package of proposed law reforms, and to developing and advocating for a 
</p>
<p>package of policies and approaches that will ensure respect and protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>while countering terrorism.  
</p>
<p>80. UNAMI/OHCHR also has concerns regarding the anti-terrorism law of the 
</p>
<p>Kurdistan region of Iraq and its lack of conformity with international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards.11   
</p>
<p>81. UNAMI/OHCHR extensively engaged with the authorities in the Kurdistan region 
</p>
<p>of Iraq on the law, and urged that it be brought into conformity with international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards. UNAMI also met with al-Shura Council and the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>of the Kurdistan Parliament to reiterate this position.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Government of Iraq continues to implement the death penalty despite repeated 
</p>
<p>calls, including those of the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights, to implement a moratorium on the death penalty with a view to its 
</p>
<p>abolition, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>83. While officially no executions have been carried out in Iraq in 2015, 
</p>
<p>UNAMI/OHCHR received reports that four individuals were executed in March in al-Hoot 
</p>
<p>prison in Nassiriyah. UNAMI/OHCHR informed the Government that lack of transparency 
</p>
<p>in the application of the death penalty constitutes a violation of the State&#8217;s international 
</p>
<p>legal obligations with regard to due process and transparency.  
</p>
<p>84. UNAMI/OHCHR also intervened with several government officials with regard to a 
</p>
<p>number of cases where individuals (including two foreign nationals) were sentenced to 
</p>
<p>death for crimes allegedly committed while juveniles, urging their execution be 
</p>
<p>immediately stayed and their ages be properly determined, whereupon the verdicts should 
</p>
<p>be set aside and the individuals in question be retried in accordance with standards 
</p>
<p>applicable to juveniles. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 For instance, see Human Rights Committee, communication No. 1110/2002 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/82/D/1110/2002)<i>,</i> para. 5.2.  </p>


<p>85. The Kurdistan Regional Government continues to apply an unofficial moratorium to 
</p>
<p>the death penalty. No executions have taken place in 2015. UNAMI continues to encourage 
</p>
<p>Kurdish authorities to formalize the moratorium by abolishing the death penalty in law. 
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The human rights situation in Iraq remains alarming in the light of violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and abuses committed by ISIL and associated groups. The non-international armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict and acts of terrorism continue to inflict tremendous suffering on civilians. 
</b></p>
<p><b>ISIL continued to target members of different ethnic and religious communities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>intentionally subjecting them to a range of abuses and violations of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and humanitarian law.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The ability of women to enjoy the full range of human rights has deteriorated 
</b></p>
<p><b>considerably with the ongoing armed conflict. Children suffer from violence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>trauma, and bear the brunt of displacement. From 1 January 2014 to 31 May 2015, 
</b></p>
<p><b>UNAMI/OHCHR recorded at least 15,612 civilians killed, 30,502 others wounded and 
</b></p>
<p><b>at least 3 million persons displaced as a result of the non-international armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Iraq. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> UNAMI/ OHCHR continued to monitor and report on the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation and repeatedly called upon all armed groups to comply strictly with 
</b></p>
<p><b>applicable international humanitarian and human rights law, and to take all feasible 
</b></p>
<p><b>precautions to spare civilians from the effects of hostilities. UNAMI/OHCHR issued 
</b></p>
<p><b>joint reports on the human rights situation in Iraq and provided technical support to 
</b></p>
<p><b>duty bearers and stakeholders in addressing protection concerns.   
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> UNAMI/OHCHR continued to provide training and capacity development to 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant ministries and parliamentary committees, the Iraqi High Commission for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights and various civil society actors.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> In response to the current crisis and its effects, UNAMI/OHCHR dedicated 
</b></p>
<p><b>considerable efforts to promoting and protecting human rights and the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p><b>through a three-fold project. UNAMI/OHCHR will develop studies of legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies with a view to submitting proposals on judicial, legal and institutional reforms 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the relevant authorities.  
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> UNAMI/OHCHR will assist the Government of Iraq in comprehensively 
</b></p>
<p><b>reviewing criminal justice laws and policies, including Anti-terrorism Law No. 13 of 
</b></p>
<p><b>2005, to ensure compliance with international human rights standards, including with 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to the rights of due process and fair trial standards, and to introduce 
</b></p>
<p><b>amendments to the Criminal Code and other relevant laws to grant domestic courts 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdiction over international crimes committed in Iraq.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> UNAMI/OHCHR will advise the Government in undertaking administrative 
</b></p>
<p><b>and institutional reforms to ensure that the police forces and all officials engaged in 
</b></p>
<p><b>law enforcement and the administration of justice comply with the obligations of Iraq 
</b></p>
<p><b>under its Constitution and under international human rights law, including with 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to persons detained in relation to terrorism.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>In addition, strengthening the legal framework for the protection against 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender-based violence continues to be a priority. UNAMI/OHCHR will assist the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government in addressing legal gaps in the protection of women, in compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law, and, in particular, in ensuring that the national 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy on combating violence against women is fully implemented. </b></p>


<p>94.<b> UNAMI/OHCHR will design human rights training manuals tailored to 
</b></p>
<p><b>government officials and civil society actors, and conduct a series of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>training courses for them.  
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> UNAMI/OHCHR will also organize a forum to discuss best practices regarding 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal and institutional reforms, in particular on the use of the death penalty in Iraq. 
</b></p>
