<p><i>Summary 
</i> This report presents the findings and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak, 
on his mission to Greece, from 10 to 20 October 2010. He expresses his deep appreciation 
to the Government for the full cooperation extended by the authorities during the course of 
the mission. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur understands the particularly overwhelming situation faced 
by law enforcement officials in Greece, confronted with a major increase of irregular 
migrants and refugees coming, mostly, via the land border with Turkey. Hundreds of aliens 
enter the country irregularly every day and their systematic detention puts the border guard 
stations, police stations, and migration detention centres in a situation of crisis. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur received numerous reports of ill-treatment by police 
officers, in particular in premises of Criminal Investigation Departments (CID), some 
amounting to torture in the sense of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) but with little 
forensic evidence to corroborate the allegations. The lack of evidence may be explained by 
the non-functioning system of police investigation and complaint mechanisms. This creates

</p>
<p>an environment of powerlessness for victims of physical abuse and may perpetuate a 
system of impunity for police violence. 
</p>
<p> In the police stations he visited, the Special Rapporteur found almost exclusively 
foreign nationals and it seemed that the stations operate as facilities for detention awaiting 
deportation, contrary to their normal function. In all but one facility under the authority of 
the Ministry of Citizen&#8217;s Protection (police stations, border guard stations and migration 
detention centres) he found foreign nationals detained in overcrowded, dirty cells, with 
inadequate sanitary facilities, insufficient or no access to outdoor exercise and inadequate 
medical attention. He found such conditions to amount to inhuman and degrading 
treatment, in violation of articles 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> He is particularly concerned about the situation of unaccompanied minors who are 
often not properly registered and systematically detained, often together with adults. 
</p>
<p> Greek prisons are severely overcrowded, some having to host up to three times more 
prisoners than their capacity. The pretrial rate is very high and pretrial detainees are not 
separated from those convicted, in violation of article 10 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur calls upon the European Union (EU) and United Nations 
agencies to promptly assist the country with its migration burden. He also urges EU 
member States to suspend all returns under the Dublin II Regulation and to design a fairer 
system of burden sharing with respect to receiving irregular migrants and refugees, as well 
as granting access to refugee determination procedures.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, Manfred Nowak, undertook a visit to Greece from 10 to 20 October 2010, at 
the invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment in the 
country, including conditions of detention and to initiate a process of cooperation with the 
Government, in particular with regard to challenges faced by the Government in addressing 
the high level of irregular migration into the country, a task which is particularly 
challenging due to the Dublin II system of transfers from European Union member States to 
Greece. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses deep appreciation to the Government for 
extending an invitation to visit the country and the frankness of the discussions he had with 
the Government. He also appreciates the full cooperation extended by the authorities during 
the course of the visit, and would like to thank the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and 
Human Rights, the Ministry of Interior, Decentralization and E-Government and the the 
Ministry of Citizens&#8217; Protection for issuing authorization letters providing him with access 
to all detention facilities. During the visit, he was able to carry out unannounced visits to 
places of detention and to conduct confidential interviews with selected detainees. 
</p>
<p>4. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with officials, civil society 
organizations, lawyers, detainees, aliens and victims of ill-treatment and visited prisons, 
police stations, border guard stations, migration detention centres and hospitals (see 
appendix for the list of places of detention visited).  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge with appreciation the excellent 
support provided by the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Ms. Maria Luisa Silva, and 
by Mr. Tsarbopoulos and Ms. Kapentana, respectively Head of the Office and Protection 
Assistant of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); Dr. Duarte 
Nuno Vieira, forensic doctor; and Tiphanie Crittin and Moritz Birk of the Ludwig 
Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>6. While still in the country, the Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings 
with the Government, which responded with constructive comments. On 1 February 2011, a 
preliminary version of this report was sent to the Government. The Government provided 
comments on 3 March 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>7. Greece is party to all major United Nations human rights treaties1 including the 
Convention against Torture, recognizes the competence of the Committee against Torture 
</p>
<p>  
 1 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its two Optional Protocols, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); the Convention on the 
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD); the International Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (CRC); the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>to receive and consider individual complaints2 but has not signed its Optional Protocol (OP-
CAT). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>8. In the context of the Council of Europe, Greece has ratified a series of relevant 
regional conventions, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights (ECHR) and its major Protocols; the European Social Charter; and the European 
Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. It has however not ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action 
against Trafficking in Human Beings. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National level 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Constitutional and legislative provisions criminalizing torture 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Constitution of Greece, adopted in 1975 and amended in 1986 and 2001, 
contains provisions regarding torture and ill-treatment as well as fundamental safeguards 
for its prevention. Article 7(2) of the Constitution prohibits &#8220;torture, any bodily 
maltreatment, impairment of health or the use of psychological violence, as well as any 
other offence against human dignity&#8221;. Even in the case of public emergencies prescribed in 
article 48 of the Constitution no suspension of the prohibition of torture is possible, 
pursuant to article 4, paragraph 2,  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.3 In addition, there are several legislative provisions prohibiting and punishing 
torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.4 
</p>
<p>10. Torture is defined in article 137A(1) of the Penal Code as an act (a) to obtain from a 
person or a third person a confessed testimony, information or statement of acceptance or 
repudiation of a particular policy or other ideology; (b) to punish this person, (c) to 
intimidate this person or a third person. Article 137A(2) further states that torture is &#8220;every 
orderly provocation causing intense physical pain or physical exhaustion that is dangerous 
for health or psychological pain that may cause serious psychological damage, together 
with any illegal use of  chemicals, drugs or other physical or technical means in order to 
bend the will of the victim&#8221; committed by a public official or military officer for the 
specific purposes laid out in article 137A(1).  
</p>
<p>11. According to article 137A(1) of the Penal Code, torture is criminalized and 
&#8220;punishable by imprisonment&#8221;. Less serious cases and other offences against human dignity 
are punishable by at least three years&#8217; imprisonment.5 In most serious cases the penalty is of 
at least 10 years&#8217; imprisonment6 and life imprisonment if the victim dies.7 In addition, 
persons convicted of offences described in articles 137A and 137B are automatically 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Art. 22, CAT. 
 3 HRI/CORE/1/Add.121, p. 17. 
 4 Articles 137A-D Penal Code, articles 2 to 4 Code of Ethics for Police Officers, Presidential Decree 
</p>
<p>254/2004, including the prohibition of excessive use of force. 
 5 Article 137A(3) Penal Code: less serious cases involve &#8220;physical injury, health damage, execution of 
</p>
<p>illegal violence, physical or psychological, or any other serious offence against human dignity [&#8230;]. 
As breaches of human dignity are mainly considered: a) the use of truth detector, b) prolonged 
isolation, c) a serious breach of sexual dignity&#8221;.

</p>
<p>deprived of their political rights and dismissed from their work,8 and leading to a conviction 
of 10 years&#8217; and life imprisonment.9 According to articles 83 and 84 of the Penal Code, 
courts may impose a lower sentence under mitigating circumstances. The victims of the 
offences defined in articles 137A and 137B can claim compensation, &#8220;including pecuniary 
satisfaction for psychological and moral damage&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p>12. There are several procedural safeguards provided in the Constitution, including the 
protection from arrest or imprisonment &#8220;without a reasoned judicial warrant&#8221;;11 the right to 
be brought before an &#8220;examining magistrate within twenty-four hours of his arrest at the 
latest&#8221;;12 and the protection from detention pending trials longer than &#8220;one year in the case 
of felonies or six months in the case of misdemeanours&#8221;.13 The suspension of these 
safeguards is only permitted in public emergencies prescribed in article 48 of the 
Constitution in which case extraordinary courts are established.  
</p>
<p>13. Further, fundamental safeguards can be found in articles 2 to 4 of the Code of Ethics 
for Police Officers, including the right to be informed of the reasons for arrest, and in a 
language the detainee can understand; the right to contact a third party; the right to consult 
a lawyer; the right to contact his/her family; and the right to access to a doctor of his/her 
choice. The Code of Ethics for Police Officers provides guarantees of detention conditions, 
such as safety, health, protection and separation of detainees.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Complaints and investigations of acts of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>14. Greek legislation provides for two investigation procedures regarding the excessive 
use of force and torture or ill-treatment by law enforcement officials or military personnel: 
administrative investigations and criminal investigations.  
</p>
<p>15. The aim of internal administrative procedures is to investigate the disciplinary 
responsibility of the respective law enforcement official and impose a disciplinary sanction 
if a disciplinary offence was found. These investigations are initiated ex officio when 
indications of ill-treatment arise or when complaints were lodged by a person or a legal 
entity.14 In cases of more serious forms of disciplinary offences, including the excessive use 
of force and torture or ill-treatment, which can be punished by dismissal from service, 
Sworn Administrative Inquiries are launched. The European Committee for the Prevention 
of Torture (CPT) has criticized that to date no independent complaints mechanism was 
introduced.15 Sworn Administrative Inquiries are primarily meant to protect the rights of the 
officer under investigation.  
</p>
<p>  
 8 Art. 9(1c) of Presidential Decree 22/1996 punishes torture and ill-treatment by the removal from 
</p>
<p>service. 
 9 Art. 137C, Penal Code. 
 10 Art. 137D(4), Penal Code. 
 11 Arts. 5(2) and 6(1) ,Constitution of Greece. 
 12 Art. 6(2), Constitution of Greece: &#8220;should the arrest be made outside the seat of the examining 
</p>
<p>magistrate, within the shortest time required to transfer him thereto. The examining magistrate must, 
within three days from the day the person was brought before him, either release the detainee or issue 
a warrant of imprisonment. Upon application of the person brought before him or in case of force 
majeure confirmed by decision of the competent judicial council, this time-limit shall be extended by 
two days&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 13 Art. 6(4), Constitution of Greece; &#8220;In entirely exceptional cases, the maximum durations may be 
extended by six or three months respectively, by decision of the competent judicial council&#8221;.

Punishment (CPT)&#8221;, p. 14. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>16. Criminal investigations can be initiated parallel to the administrative investigation 
without being bound by its conclusions. However, the disciplinary authority is bound by the 
judgement of the criminal court with regards to the existence or absence of material facts. 
Criminal investigations are launched by the public prosecutor ex officio or at the police 
investigators&#8217; request. If, in the course of the administrative investigation, the act of the 
concerned police officer is considered a criminal offence, the superior officer has to refer 
the case to the public prosecutor.16 
</p>
<p>17. If the preliminary investigations reveal an indication of guilt, they can result in the 
committal for trial. If the public prosecutor does not proceed with the investigation or if the 
criminal complaint is dismissed as unfounded, the involved party can appeal against the 
decision before the public prosecutor of the appeal court. The limitation period for criminal 
investigations in cases of torture is 15 years and 5 years in cases of other forms of ill-
treatment. 
</p>
<p>18. The Greek Ombudsman was established in 1998 as a constitutionally sanctioned 
independent authority.17 The Ombudsman investigates individual administrative acts, 
omissions or material actions undertaken by the public sector, local and regional authorities 
and other public bodies interfering with the legal interests of persons or legal entities.18 The 
Greek Ombudsman is mandated to initiate investigations either following a signed 
complaint made by any directly involved person or union of persons as well as legal entities 
or ex officio in cases of particular public interest.19 
</p>
<p>19. According to Law No. 3811/2009, the Greek Ombudsman and the competent 
Parliament&#8217;s inter-party committee have been given the right to visit detention facilities, 
supported by the Body of Inspection and Control of the Detention facilities.20 However, it 
lacks the competence to conduct an independent investigation and its powers are restricted 
to asking the police to investigate. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Greek Parliament ratified Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human 
Rights in November 2004, thereby abolishing death penalty for all crimes.21 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Juvenile justice 
</b></p>
<p>21. In 2003, the Reform of Penal Legislation for Juveniles and Other Regulations22 was 
adopted to harmonize the existing criminal law provisions with the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. The Greek Penal Code establishes in its Eighth Chapter on juvenile 
justice the criminal responsibility at the age of 1323 and divides the legal consequences for 
minor offenders into reformatory measures,24 therapeutic measures25 &#8211; which can also be 
imposed on minor offenders between 8 and 13 even though they are not criminally

 20 Law No. 3090/2002.

</p>
<p>Protocol 6 to the ECHR.

<p>responsible26 &#8211; and confinement in a specific juvenile correctional institution, as a measure 
of last resort.27 Article 54 of the Penal Code, as amended, outlines the length of sentences 
that can be imposed on juveniles. If the juvenile attains adulthood, the Juvenile Court can 
impose a reduced prison sentence which the offender has to serve in a prison facility.28 
According to NGOs,29 the number of confinement terms imposed by courts is relatively low 
as opposed to reformatory measures.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Protection of asylum-seekers and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>22. Greece is a State Party to the Convention Against Torture, the Convention relating 
to the Status of Refugees, the ICCPR and the ECHR, prohibiting the return of persons to 
another State where he/she may be subjected to torture (principle of non-refoulement). 
Article 21(1) of the PD 96/200830 and article 5 of PD 90/200831 prohibits refoulement, the 
latter foreseeing a right to stay for asylum-seekers until the administrative procedure for the 
examination of their application has been concluded.  
</p>
<p>23. According to article 13(1) of the PD 90/2008, applicants for asylum are exempt from 
expulsion and cannot be detained for the sole reason that the person illegally entered or 
remained in the country. However, article 13(2) allows for the detention of asylum-seekers 
in appropriate places &#8220;when, and for as long as necessary, this is needed in order to 
determine the circumstances of entry, the identity and origin of mass illegal entries of 
applicants, when this is required for reasons of public interest or public order or when this 
is considered necessary for the speedy and effective completion of the above mentioned 
procedure. The total time under restriction shall, in no case, exceed sixty days&#8221;. However, 
once a person is detained, the immigration law 3386(2005) applies and the filing of an 
asylum claim does not affect the asylum-seeker&#8217;s detention. Article 76(2) allows for the 
detention pending deportation for up to 6 months and under exceptional circumstances up 
to 18 months. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Assessment of the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Challenges facing the country 
</b></p>
<p>24. Greece, due to its geographical location, is under a particular pressure from migrants 
and refugees entering the EU. While the arrivals via the Mediterranean route have 
significantly dropped, arrivals via the Greek-Turkish border in the Evros region increased 
by 369 per cent in the period from January to September 2010,32 with 1,400 aliens arrested 
during the first two days alone of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. Aliens entering Greece are

<p>systematically detained. According to the Government, in 2008, some 50 per cent of all 
arrests of aliens in the EU took place in Greece. This number has increased to 75 per cent in 
2009 and almost 90 per cent in 2010. The mass influx, coupled with systematic detention,  
puts border-guard stations and migration detention facilities at the Greek Turkish border in 
a situation of crisis. But the police facilities in areas with high rates of aliens are also 
overcrowded with persons in detention awaiting deportation. The detention crisis is further 
worsened by the Government&#8217;s extreme budgetary constraints due to the current economic 
crisis in the country. 
</p>
<p>25. The migration burden on Greece is aggravated by the Dublin II Regulation 
allocating the responsibility for asylum claims to the country of first entry. Thus, every 
asylum-seeker having entered through Greek territory is to be returned to Greece for filing 
an application, creating a totally unequal burden for the protection of refugees in the EU.  
</p>
<p>26. Since taking office in October 2009, the Government has made the issue of 
detention of irregular migrants and refugees a priority and is planning a substantive reform 
of the asylum system and migration management. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Acts of torture and ill-treatment in places of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Facilities under the authority of the Ministry of Citizen&#8217;s Protection: Migrants and 
Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur received numerous allegations of ill-treatment by law 
enforcement officers, whether upon arrest, or later in detention; in police stations, Criminal 
Investigation Departments (CID), border-guard stations and migration detention centres. He 
heard reports and noticed a generally rough attitude of the officers towards detainees, and a 
sentiment of anxiety among the detainees. In most places, he found the atmosphere very 
agitated and tense. 
</p>
<p>28. In police stations and CID<i>,</i> the Special Rapporteur received numerous and consistent 
allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement officials. Many detainees said they have 
been physically or verbally abused by police officers either upon arrest or later at the police 
station. In a few cases, this ill-treatment amounted to torture. However, the allegations were 
rarely corroborated by forensic medical evidence. This may be explained by the non-
functioning system of police investigation and complaint mechanisms. The Special 
Rapporteur also witnessed a high degree of fear of reprisals expressed by detainees in the 
hands of the police, sometimes directly, or implied in their behaviour, which, combined 
with the dysfunctional judicial system, may perpetuate a system of impunity for police 
violence. 
</p>
<p>29. The allegations concerned primarily kicks, slaps and punches with feet, hands or 
sticks. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was also reported several cases, for example in 
Omonia CID, in which the detainees were blindfolded with a motorcycle helmet and 
handcuffed before being beaten. In general, the abuses were reported to be more frequent 
and brutal in CID premises, where the detainees seemed particularly afraid of the officers. 
Often the victims did not understand the reason for their ill-treatment. However, many 
alleged to have been abused for complaining about the conditions of detention and for the 
purpose of extracting a confession.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>30. In border-guard stations the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the extremely 
difficult situation of border guards having to cope with an unprecedented number of arrests  
of aliens and a serious lack of resources. He recognizes the authorities&#8217; efforts to cope with 
the crisis situation, in particular in Feres Border Guard Station, where the Chief of Police 
appeared to be very committed to meet the most basic needs of the detainees.<b> </b></p>

</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur received, however, several consistent allegations of ill-
treatment by border-guard officers of detainees upon arrest, and later in the border-guard 
station. Detainees mentioned kicks, slaps, or being pushed, mostly when they did not 
understand or follow the officers&#8217; orders immediately, or when they made complaints. This 
seems to be particularly the case at Soufli Border Guard Station. However, the forensic 
expert could corroborate these statements with medical evidence in only a few cases. 
</p>
<p>32. In general, most of the detainees complained about the rough tone and attitude of the 
officers towards them, and stated that the miscommunication arising from the language 
barrier led to reactions of impatience from the officers, who lacked empathy and respect 
towards them. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur received a few complaints of ill-treatment in the migration 
detention centres, which consisted mainly of verbal abuse. Most of the detainees pointed 
out that the attitude of the staff was very rough and often impolite, particularly at the 
registration when refusing to give fingerprints. The Special Rapporteur could witness that 
the interactions between the overwhelmed and frustrated staff and the detainees were 
aggressive and tense, in particular in the migration detention centre in Venna. This was 
further worsened by the language barrier.  
</p>
<p>34. Detainees expressed reluctance to lodge official complaints while in detention due to 
the ineffective complaints mechanism33 and the lack of procedural guarantees against 
deportation. Aliens have an additional obstacle in the language barrier and the lack of 
interpretation services provided by the State, preventing them to make an oral or written 
complaint about conditions of detention, or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judicial prisons 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur did not encounter complaints by prisoners of beatings by the 
officers at judicial prisons. Despite the difficult working conditions of the guards in Greek 
prisons, most seem to have a professional attitude towards detainees. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>36. The lack of an effective complaints mechanism, independent investigation and 
monitoring create an environment of powerlessness for victims of physical abuse. 
According to the statistics sent by Greece to the Committee Against Torture in September 
2010, in the period from 2005 to 2009, a total of 281 complaints were investigated for 
police ill-treatment; disciplinary sanctions were imposed in 13 cases involving 21 police 
officers.34 During this period, in 140 of the 281 complaints for abuse and ill-treatment there 
was no corresponding criminal charge. According to the Government this was because 
either no charges were brought against the police or the administrative inquiries did not find 
that a criminal offence had been committed.35 
</p>
<p>  
 33 Neither Law 3386/2005 nor any other national legislation provides for a legal remedy to which a 
</p>
<p>detained migrant or asylum seeker can resort in order to complain about conditions of detention.

</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s plans to establish a bureau 
within either the Ministry of Citizen&#8217;s Protection or the Ministry of Interior to examine 
police misconduct. As of October 2010, a Bill had yet to be submitted to Parliament. 
However, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that a totally independent police complaint 
body with full investigative powers under a ministry different than the Ministry of Citizen&#8217;s 
Protection is needed as already highlighted by the Greek National Commission for Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Facilities under the authority of the Ministry of Citizen&#8217;s Protection: Migrants and 
refugees 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the systematic detention of aliens upon 
arrival in Greece. Furthermore, in Athens, he saw many aliens who were arrested on the 
suspicion of a criminal offence then being held under administrative detention by the police 
for not possessing valid papers after the dismissal of the case by the prosecutor or the court. 
This includes those migrants or refugees who cannot be deported for factual or legal 
reasons.  
</p>
<p>39. Very often the detainees were not informed of the grounds and length of their 
detention. The length of detention was felt to be dependent on the nationality of aliens. 
While aliens who cannot be deported (e.g. from Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan) were 
usually released within several days with an order to leave the country within 30 days, 
those who can most often be deported frequently had to wait up to several months in police 
custody. This created a feeling of extreme injustice and discrimination among the detainees.  
</p>
<p>40. It has been reported to be extremely difficult for aliens to challenge their detention 
as there is no regular automatic judicial review. The absence of interpreters and legal aid 
reportedly make it practically impossible to complain before an administrative court.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur found the conditions of detention in police stations, CID, 
border-guard stations and migration detention centres to be very poor throughout the 
country.  (See appendix for detailed descriptions of all detention facilities visited) 
</p>
<p>42. In police custody he almost exclusively came across foreign nationals. While some 
were detained on suspicion of a criminal offence, most were held under administrative 
detention. In fact, it appeared that many police stations, in particular in Athens, have been 
converted into facilities for detention awaiting deportation. The detained aliens were 
frequently held in police cells not designed for prolonged detention for up to six months. 
They neither provided any meaningful activities nor access to outside exercise and fresh air. 
The cells were often overcrowded forcing detainees to share mattresses or sleep on the 
floor. They frequently provided insufficient natural lighting and poor ventilation. Although 
many police stations have been freshly painted and cleaned before the visit, many detainees 
complained about the lack of cleaning, and the beds and sanitary installations were often 
unhygienic. As a result of the poor conditions many people had respiratory, skin as well as 
psychological problems. Access to medical care was very limited. Many detainees 
complained that they had no access to a doctor and even upon specific request were denied 
to be brought to a hospital. They further complained about lacking access to phones and 
visitors. Thus, some detainees were very worried that they could not inform their relatives 
and friends of their whereabouts. The Special Rapporteur witnessed a high degree of 
frustration among the detainees who mostly did not understand the grounds for or the 
length of their detention and had no access to lawyers or efficient complaints mechanisms. 
The conditions of detention were appalling at Venizelos Airport Police Station in Athens, 
where aliens were primarily held for the possession of false documents when attempting to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>leave the country, and some were even prevented from returning to their countries of origin 
despite having a valid ticket. 
</p>
<p>43. At the Criminal Investigation Departments (CIDs), the conditions of detention were 
particularly appalling. At the CIDs of Omonia, Agiou Panteleimonos and Akropolis in 
Athens, the Special Rapporteur found more than 40 foreigners held in irregular and 
apparently unofficial detention areas. It appeared that these people were being excluded 
from the official statistics which were communicated to the Ministry of Citizen&#8217;s Protection 
on a daily basis. The non-registration of detainees significantly increases the risk of being 
subjected to torture or ill-treatment. The detention areas were in no way designed for even 
short-term detention. The detention areas of the CIDs visited were overcrowded, providing 
insufficient lighting, ventilation and bedding. The detainees were forced to sleep on 
benches or the floor for sometimes up to two weeks. In terms of sanitary conditions, access 
to drinking water or the toilets was severely limited. The toilets were often located outside 
the cells, creating an unnecessary dependence of the detainees on officers. Showers or 
washing rooms were not available at all. Many detainees complained that they received no 
food unless they paid for it themselves.  
</p>
<p>44. The border-guard stations in Soufli and Feres were facing immense problems due to 
the mass influx of aliens over the Greek-Turkish border. Despite their unsuitability for 
long-term detention, migrants and refugees were often detained in cells up to several 
months due to the lack of capacities in other facilities. In general the facilities were 
overcrowded, not providing many detainees with beds or even mattresses. The situation at 
the Feres Border Guard Station was particularly severe, holding 123 detainees in a facility 
designed for 28 at the time of the visit. In both border-guard stations that he visited, the 
cells were dirty, dark and cold with unhygienic and inadequate sanitary facilities. 
Furthermore, the detainees were inadequately provided with sanitary products. The 
overcrowding made any meaningful separation of men, women, and children, of migrants, 
refugees and smugglers, or of persons of different ethnic or religious background 
impossible.  
</p>
<p>45. Also in the two migration detention centres in the Evros region, Fylakio and Venna, 
which<i> are </i>designed for long-term detention, the conditions were inadequate to meeting the 
most basic needs of detainees. The required Ministerial Decision establishing those special 
facilities and prescribing minimum operational standards has never been issued. The 
maintenance of the centres in Fylakio and Venna and the care of the persons detained there 
were neglected by the prefectures responsible. The aliens being held for up to six months 
were hardly ever being left out of the dark cells to exercise or breathe fresh air. The 
facilities were run down and provided a very hostile environment for detention. There was 
inadequate staff to take care of the detainees and of interpreters to enable the 
communication between police officers and detainees adding to the frustration on both 
sides. Detainees were often provided with insufficient blankets or warm clothes despite the 
low temperatures in the Evros region. The cells were dirty and often infested with mice or 
insects. The sanitary conditions were especially appalling. In the arrival cell of Fylakio 
Migration Detention Center, the toilets were clogged and feces were flowing out of the 
bathrooms into the sleeping area. The Special Rapporteur found a serious lack of medical 
assistance in all facilities, creating serious problems as many aliens have medical conditions 
from their long journey or ill-treatment in their countries of origin. The detainees also 
frequently complained about a lacking access to phones or the high costs for making calls 
abroad. 
</p>
<p>46. A positive example was the Mersidini Migration Detention Centre in Chios, where 
the Chief employed by the prefecture took adequate care of the detainees. Due to the drop 
of immigration via the Mediterranean Sea, the centre was no longer overcrowded. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>detainees were able to access the outside, their cells were clean and well-equipped, and the 
most basic needs were adequately being cared for.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur concludes that the conditions in all facilities he visited to 
detain aliens awaiting deportation, with the exception of the Mersidini Migration Detention 
Centre, were not in conformity with the United Nations Body of Principles for the 
Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, or the Standard 
of Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. The prolonged detention of aliens under 
the conditions of detention described amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment, in 
violation of articles 7 and 10 of the International Covenant. 36 
</p>
<p>48. The Government openly acknowledged the severe problems regarding the detention 
of aliens and has adopted a &#8220;Greek Action Plan on Migration Management&#8221;. At the points 
of entry to the country, &#8221;screening centres&#8221; will be established where aliens are to be held 
for no longer than 15 days for their identification and registration. Afterwards, those who 
cannot be deported for factual or legal reasons shall be transferred to open reception 
facilities. Those who can be deported will be transferred to &#8220;deportee detention centres&#8221; 
where the conditions are to comply with the European Committee for the Prevention of 
Torture guidelines. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the planned reforms and urges the 
Government to promptly proceed with their implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judicial prisons 
</b></p>
<p>49. In all prisons visited, the Special Rapporteur witnessed a situation of severe 
overcrowding, with some prisons (Korydallos, Komotini) hosting three times more 
prisoners than their maximum capacity. At the time of the visit, there were around 12,100 
prisoners for a maximum capacity of 9,100 detainees in Greek prisons. Fifty-seven per cent  
of all prisoners in Greece are foreigners. The Special Rapporteur found that law 
enforcement officials were completely overwhelmed by the current situation of severe 
overcrowding and lack of resources.  
</p>
<p>50. The pretrial rate is very high in Greece, with a national average of 41 per cent. 
While legislation provides for a separation between pretrial detainees and convicted 
prisoners, this distinction does not exist in practice due to the lack of infrastructure and 
capacity, in violation of article 10 of the International Covenant. The Government indicated 
its plans to construct more prisons, as officials acknowledged that there are at least 500 
people being held in police custody who should be in facilities under the Ministry of 
Justice. 
</p>
<p>51. In Korydallos Prison in Athens, prisoners were extremely agitated and showed a 
very high level of frustration. The blocks were overcrowded, and the sanitary conditions 
were bad, with some mattresses hiding hundreds of cockroaches and bugs. He was 
informed that detainees had to buy almost everything and were not provided with enough 
food and sanitary products. He met detainees who had been in pretrial detention for up to 
18 months and expressed a strong feeling of arbitrariness. The Special Rapporteur noticed 
with concern that a part of Block E was hosting aliens in administrative detention, despite 
the clear lack of competence of prisons for such detainees. He observed that vulnerable 
groups such as gay, lesbian and transgender persons were held in separate cells. However, 
they were kept inside at all times in unacceptable conditions. Finally, in Korydallos and 
Chios Prisons, he noticed a lack of meaningful opportunities for education, work and 
recreation. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the completion of a new detention facility in 
</p>
<p>  
 36 See ECtHR judgments:  <i>S.D. v. Greece</i> (2009) and <i>Tabesh v. Greece </i>(2009) where the court found the 
</p>
<p>conditions in detention amounted to a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR and a violation of Article 
5(1); <i>M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece</i> (2011). </p>

</p>
<p>Nigrita, Serres, with a capacity of 700, reportedly part of a Greek government plan to 
construct more detention facilities. It is his hopes that the planned constructions in Drama 
and Chania will be completed as scheduled in 2012. 
</p>
<p>52. In Komotini and Kos Prisons, the Special Rapporteur welcomed positively the 
willingness and the commitment of their directors to raise funds, to create partnerships with 
private firms and to utilize the technical skills of the prisoners to make the best of the 
situation. It constituted a best practice as it allowed for a real possibility of rehabilitation. In 
Komotini Prison, the detainees built the entire visitors room and furniture for the prison, 
while the gym was equipped with donations from fitness centres. In Kos, prisoners 
decorated the facility with paintings and murals and were allowed to practice various sports 
on a daily basis. In both these prisons, the detainees complained much less about their 
conditions, although in Komotini the facility was holding more than three times its 
capacity, and in Kos twice its capacity.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Psychiatric and medical institutions 
</b></p>
<p>53. The situation in terms of health care provided to detainees raised a number of 
substantial concerns. Generally, an appropriate health care system for detainees is lacking, 
and the quality of the health care provided was not in conformity with European and 
international standards. Most of the doctors who visit the prisons were very inexperienced 
and lack the specialization and training to work in these conditions.  In the majority of 
situations, the forensic expert observed shortages of health care staff, of modern medical 
diagnostic tools and equipment, of adequate health care facilities and of therapeutic drugs 
adapted to the variety of health problems usually seen in the detainee&#8217;s population. Of the 
limited supply of medications that were kept in the facilities, many of the drugs had expired 
or were near the expiry date. 
</p>
<p>54. Apart from Korydallos, with its own hospital, detainees who required specific 
medical treatment had to go to an external hospital. Thus, due to a lack of staff detainees 
sometimes have to wait for days to receive adequate medical attention.  
</p>
<p>55. In most detention facilities visited, psychiatric evaluations were not performed on a 
routine basis. Despite a ministerial decision37 that grants conditional release to detainees 
suffering from certain illnesses and disabilities, the Special Rapporteur found several 
detainees with a condition. 
</p>
<p>56. In addition, law 2525/1997 established &#8220;Schools of Second Chance&#8221; and there are 
sixteen treatment centres for drug addiction (including one in a juvenile facility). The 
Special Rapporteur learned that a methadone programme is under consideration and that the 
Government will set up an expert committee to evaluate this in the two largest prisons. 
Following the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Expert Commission was established on 27 
December 2010 under Ministerial Decision No. 127183. 
</p>
<p>57. Outside of the prison system, the Special Rapporteur wishes to stress the positive 
impression he received of the Alexandroupoli Hospital Psychiatric Clinic and he welcomes 
the practice of involuntary patients not being kept apart in isolation areas. 
</p>
<p>  
 37 Ministerial Decision 164484/2009 (GG B 52/2010). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> E. Refugees and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Access to refugee protection/Non-refoulement</b>38<b> 
</b></p>
<p>58. Upon arrival, refugees are systematically detained, registered and their fingerprints 
are taken. However, due to the great number of new arrivals every day and the lack of staff,  
and in particular of interpreters, an adequate registration and documentation is often not 
possible. The Special Rapporteur has come across several cases where the nationality of 
aliens has been wrongly identified. This can have serious consequences for refugees who 
are wrongly identified as Iraqis Iranian or Syrian, who could be returned to Turkey under 
the Greek-Turkish Readmission Agreement.  
</p>
<p>59. Many refugees are not informed of the procedures for seeking protection or have 
claimed that it is not possible for them to make their protection claim heard due to the lack 
of interpreters. Only in the border-guard station in Feres did the Special Rapporteur come 
across information brochures in different languages on the asylum procedure in Greece. 
While in principle all police authorities should accept asylum applications, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the respective police authorities often reject the responsibility 
for accepting and forwarding asylum applications and tell the applicants to go to the main 
directorates responsible for the processing of asylum claims. Thus, detained asylum-seekers 
often have to wait for their release until they can make a claim. The responsible directorates 
were said to lack the capacities to deal with the many asylum applications in the country. 
The Special Rapporteur was informed that the main authority in Attica, Petrou Ralli, was so 
severely understaffed that it had at times accepted asylum claims on only one day of the 
week and then was not able to register more than around 20 applications. 
</p>
<p>60. But even those who are able to file their claims fall victim to the country&#8217;s highly 
dysfunctional asylum system. The first-instance procedure is in the hands of police 
authorities who lack the necessary capacities and expertise in accepting and processing the 
large number of applications. There is no system of free legal aid and a general lack of 
registered lawyers. Further, in practice interpreters were reported to be largely unavailable 
during the interviews making the assessment of a claim practically impossible. As a 
consequence, the quality of the decisions was said to be very poor and Greece has the 
lowest protection rates at first instance in the EU close to zero.39 The dysfunctional system 
has created a backlog of more than 52,000 cases to be examined as of August 2010. With 
the abolition of the independent Appeals Board there is now only a limited form of appeal 
available before the Council of State. However, it can only investigate into the legality of 
the administrative ruling but not the merits of a claim. Also in the second instance 
procedure the protection rates are very low (2.87 per cent in 2009). As a consequence, 
refugees seeking protection in Greece had no confidence in the asylum procedures and very 
often refrained from filing a claim despite a serious fear of being returned to their country 
of origin. 
</p>
<p>61. In the detention facilities that the Special Rapporteur visited, he witnessed great 
misinformation among the detainees about the asylum system, further increasing the stress 
caused by the appalling detention conditions. Some detainees thought they already filed an 
asylum claim at their registration and taking of the fingerprints. Also, many aliens were 
</p>
<p>  
 38 Since 2 June 2010, over 33,000 irregular migrants have been detected crossing the Greek-Turkish 
</p>
<p>land border. The largest group (47 per cent) coming from Afghanistan. The next largest groups were 
from Algeria (17 per cent), Pakistan (8 per cent). Somalia (7 per cent) and Iraq (5 per cent). See 
http://frontex.europa.eu/newsroom/news. 
</p>
<p> 39 In 2009, 15,928 asylum applications were made but only 36 asylum-seekers were granted refugee 
status and 130 asylum-seekers were granted humanitarian status and subsidiary protection. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>afraid to file an asylum claim in fear of being detained longer as a consequence. Further, 
many did not file a claim believing that this would deprive them of seeking asylum in 
another EU member State where the chances of success are higher.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Readmission Agreement with 
Turkey facilitating the deportation of aliens to its neighbouring countries.40 The lack of any 
automatic individual assessment by Greek police, prosecutors or judges whether citizens of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq or the Syrian Arab Republic face a serious risk of being 
deported by Turkish authorities to their countries of origin, constitutes a violation of the 
principle of non-refoulement under articles 3 of the Convention Against Torture, 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 3 of the European Convention on 
Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>63. In view of the serious flaws in accessing protection in Greece, the legal amendments 
foreseen by the draft Presidential Decree on the procedure to grant refugee status or 
subsidiary protection to third-country nationals and stateless persons, which was signed by 
the Minister of Citizen&#8217;s Protection on 24 September 2010, is to be welcomed. It foresees a 
new timeframe for the issuance of asylum decisions &#8211; the accelerated process taking three 
months and the normal process six months. Furthermore, the asylum procedure will be 
handed over to Refugee Committees comprised of qualified civil authorities.41 In regions 
with a large concentration of third-country nationals, 13 police departments will examine 
asylum claims decentralizing the examination procedure. The independent Appeals Board 
will be reinstated as a second-instance procedure in which the police will not participate. In 
the meantime, there was supposed to be a procedure in place to deal with the transitional 
period in between the old and new systems, however, this transitional period has been 
extended for over one year. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Detention 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur has witnessed that asylum-seekers arrested at the borders of 
Greece are principally treated in the same manner as migrants. Most asylum applications 
were initiated <i>after</i> the refugee had been arrested and deportation ordered, which suspended 
the execution of the deportation order, but had no bearing on the detention order. Thus, 
asylum-seekers are equally systematically subjected to detention which may last until their 
asylum procedure has been concluded or the maximum of six or 18 months. The systematic 
detention of asylum-seekers constitutes a violation of article 5 of ECHR. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s plans to reform the system of detention, which 
includes plans to detain asylum-seekers for no longer than 15 days before they are 
transferred to open reception centres. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Living conditions 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur has been informed by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that reception conditions for asylum-seekers do not 
meet their most basic needs. There are only 865 reception places available for thousands of 
asylum seekers. The level of medical and educational services provided for asylum-seekers 
</p>
<p>  
 40 According to official statistics provided by UNHCR, in regard to the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Readmission Protocol from January to June 2010 of third-country nationals deported, 238 were from 
Iraq. 
</p>
<p> 41 Members of these Committees will include one civil servant of the Ministry of Interior or Justice, one  
representative of UNHCR and a refugee and human rights lawyer selected by the Minister from a list 
submitted by the National Committee for Human Rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>is very low and they receive no financial allowance.42 As a consequence, many are forced to 
live on the streets and have to resort to illegal activities to survive. This leads to their 
marginalization in Greek society, triggering attitudes of xenophobia and racism. In a recent 
judgment, the European Court of Human Rights has confirmed the impression of the 
Special Rapporteur that the difficult conditions of the asylum-seekers amount to degrading 
treatment, in violation of article 3 of ECHR. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The European asylum system 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Government is clearly under pressure to find an adequate solution that is in 
accordance with European and international standards. Greece has the right to take effective 
measures to manage its external borders but this must be done in a manner that respects 
international human rights. In that regard it should be supported by EU member States and 
the recently established European Asylum Support Office (EASO). All asylum-seekers 
must have the effective possibility to make their claim heard and effectively assessed in 
compliance with European and international standards.43 The Special Rapporteur urges all 
member States to suspend and examine all cases of Dublin II returns to Greece and 
immediately renegotiate Dublin II to find a fair way of burden sharing for refugee 
protection in the EU. 
</p>
<p>67. On 26 October 2010, six days after the Special Rapporteur issued his preliminary 
findings, the Government requested members of the Rapid Border Intervention Team 
(RABIT) deployed by the European Agency for the Management of Operational 
Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union 
(FRONTEX) to control the migratory flows on the Greek-Turkish land border and assist the 
Greek authorities in border management. The Special Rapporteur urges the border guards 
of other EU member States under Frontex to respect European and international human 
rights standards in all their endeavours. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Juveniles 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the fate of unaccompanied minors in 
Greece, as they are not protected properly at any stage of their stay in the country. The 
Special Rapporteur notes with concern that unaccompanied minors are systematically held 
in detention, instead of being held at reception centres under the authority of the Ministry of 
Health designed exclusively for them. He met with unaccompanied minors in police 
stations, CIDs, border guard stations and migration detention centres, since, in practice, 
reception centres are not numerous enough and are also overcrowded. These minors have 
no possibility to enrol in schools and to receive a proper education. 
</p>
<p>69. In Greece, the guardianship system, which in the law guarantees a protection for 
minors, is dysfunctional. Juvenile and court prosecutors have the responsibility for 
unaccompanied minors, but in practice many minors are left without guardians. Most of the 
unaccompanied minors the Special Rapporteur met during the visit had not been adequately 
informed about the asylum procedure and their rights, and were generally ignorant about 
the system. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur witnessed unaccompanied minors being held with adults in 
a number of facilities, such as Omonia CID, Feres Border Guard Station as well as Fylakio 
</p>
<p>  
 42 See the UNHCR Submission to ECHR, case <i>M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece</i>. 
 43 See judgement in <i>M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece,</i> 21 January 2011 which found a violation of articles 
</p>
<p>3 and 13 against both States because of the applicant&#8217;s detention conditions and the deficiencies in the 
asylum procedure in Greece. </p>

</p>
<p>and Venna Migration Detention Centers. Due to the overcrowding in the facilities, the 
officers could not separate them from the other detainees. However, the Special Rapporteur 
recalled that this vulnerable group is at risk to be exposed to various forms of ill-treatment 
including sexual abuse when not properly separated from adults.  
</p>
<p>71. Furthermore, the procedure to identify minors, and assess their age and vulnerability 
appears to be completely inadequate as many juveniles reported being registered as adults. 
This may be explained by a general lack of trained staff and interpretation services. 
</p>
<p>72. Also, the Special Rapporteur came across a number of cases of ill-treatment of 
minors, corroborated by medical evidence. 
</p>
<p>73. Finally, the release of unaccompanied minors pending deportation puts them at 
significant risk for further abuse, including exploitive work and the risk of being trafficked, 
if they are not provided with adequate care and not registered in a tracking system.44  
</p>
<p><b> G. Women in detention 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur generally found male and female detainees to be separated 
in the places of detention he visited. However, due to the recent influx of aliens over the 
Greek-Turkish border and the overcrowding of the facilities located in the Evros region, he 
found women detained with men at the border-guard stations of Feres and Soufli. 
</p>
<p>75. The women held at Venizelos Airport Police Station were held in much better 
conditions than the men. They were not in small, overcrowded and suffocating cells; they 
had room to move around and could access the shower and toilet facilities as they were 
located within their contained area. However, they complained about the lack of cleaning 
supplies and hygiene products. 
</p>
<p>76. Many women detained in migration detention centres were even more affected by 
the appalling conditions of detention and the lack of hygiene, as they had to take care for 
babies and small children.  
</p>
<p>77. In the Korydallos Women&#8217;s Prison the Special Rapporteur witnessed an atmosphere 
of extreme agitation and despair due to the slow criminal justice system and the conditions 
of detention. The detainees complained about long periods (up to 15 months) of pretrial 
detention, lack of access to free legal aid, and long prison terms for comparatively minor 
crimes, above all drug-related offences. The vast majority of the women detained were in 
remand because they could not afford bail. Detainees with a drug addiction received no 
adequate medical attention or access to substitute treatment. Many detainees had serious 
diseases, such as hepatitis C, HIV or multiple sclerosis, and were without access to basic 
medical assistance. The detainees complained that they had to pay for services which 
should be provided free of charge by the prison administration, such as toilet paper, soap, 
decent food, etc. This led to a feeling of powerlessness and discrimination among the 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>78. One of the most serious complaints received was the ongoing practice of intra-body 
searches. The Government reported that the practice of &#8220;vaginal searches&#8221; of female 
prisoners was abolished in September 2010. The Penitentiary Code (sect. 23, para. 6) 
provides the basis on which an intra-body search may be conducted, which says there must 
be &#8220;reasonable cause&#8221; to justify such a search. When there are violations of this provision, 
the Government informed that the competent Public Prosecutor is responsible for 
</p>
<p>  
 44 Human Rights Watch report, 2008, &#8220;Left to Survive &#8211; systematic failure to protect unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>migrant children in Greece, p. 103. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>investigating and imposing appropriate disciplinary and penal measures. However, in 
conducting interviews with female prisoners in Korydallos, the Special Rapporteur found 
that the practice continued to take place on a regular basis whenever female prisoners were 
returned to the facility from an outside visit, i.e. to attend court or visit the doctor.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Measures undertaken since the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur welcomes supplementary information provided by the 
Government of Greece on legislative and other measures, it has taken since his country 
visit: 
</p>
<p> (a) Presidential decree 114/200(Procedure for the recognition of the status of  
refugee or beneficiary of auxiliary protection to non nationals and stateless persons); 
</p>
<p> (b) Law 3907 of 26 January 2011 was published in the Government <i>Gazette 
</i>(A/26 Jan 2011). The law will provide for the establishment of an Asylum Agency and a 
First Reception Service for Immigrants, as well as for harmonization of the Greek 
legislation with the provisions of Directive 2008/115/EC on common standards and 
procedures in Member States for returns of illegally staying third-country nationals; 
</p>
<p> (c) Regarding the use of non-custodial measures, the Law 3904/2010 (GG 
218/2010 v.A') has been recently voted on and will determine the necessary conditions for 
reducing prison sentences to community services. Since its implementation, approximately  
650 detainees have been released pursuant to it. The Joint Ministerial Decision on the 
participation of 277 entities in the implementation of community services institution has 
also taken effect; 
</p>
<p> (d) Inclusion of a provision to address the backlog of first-instance asylum cases 
in a Draft Law on the establishment of an office to address incidents of arbitrariness in the 
Ministry of Citizen Protection. The law is currently being discussed in Parliament; 
</p>
<p> (e) The establishment of a joint committee that visits police detention facilities to 
verify compliance with terms and conditions relating to hygiene and safety of detainees and 
the protection of their rights. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep appreciation to the Government of 
Greece for the full cooperation extended by the authorities during the course of the 
mission. He recognizes the challenges faced by the Government regarding the high 
numbers of irregular migrants and refugees entering the country every day. He 
believes the Government wants to change the current practice of systematic detention 
into a reformed system that is in accordance with international human rights and 
humanitarian law.   
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>There is a humanitarian crisis facing new arrivals into Greece, detained in 
overcrowded and poor conditions amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment; 
particularly vulnerable are pregnant women, single women with small children, and 
unaccompanied minors. Most have no access to legal assistance or interpretation and 
medical attention is extremely limited or unavailable. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the broad powers of the police to 
hold persons in administrative detention. The police practices he observed resulted in 
the systematic detention of irregular migrants and refugees without a sufficient legal 
basis.   
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The asylum procedure has collapsed and refugees are denied access to any 
meaningful refugee-determination procedure. This puts them at a serious risk of 
refoulement, aggravated by the Readmission Agreement with Turkey allowing for the 
forcible return of aliens to the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq and the Syrian Arab 
Republic.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The dysfunctional migration and asylum system has had a direct and negative 
impact on the criminal justice system, resulting in severe overcrowding, prolonged 
detention and unsanitary conditions in police lock-ups, border guard stations, 
migration detention centres and prisons.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Addressing the problems will not only require political will but resources and it 
is very uncertain that Greece has the financial means to effect the changes it wishes to 
make. Although the Government maintains that addressing the problem of irregular 
migration is a priority, there have been serious delays to enact new legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Greece should not carry the burden of receiving the vast majority of all 
irregular migrants and refugees entering the European Union. This is a truly 
European problem which needs a joint European solution, and not only a 
reinforcement of the European borders through Frontex. This measure is effective 
only if irregular migrants and refugees are properly identified in accordance with 
fundamental rights and human dignity.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur did not find widespread use of torture. However, he 
found many cases of beatings by the police, upon arrest or detention or as a form of 
punishment, some of which amounted to torture in the sense of the Convention 
Against Torture definition. The lack of an effective independent complaints 
mechanism gave rise to an atmosphere of impunity. His overwhelming concern, 
however, is in regard to inhuman and degrading conditions of detention that do not 
comply with international minimum standards for the humane treatment of detainees. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In a spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
following recommendations to the Government of Greece, aimed at preventing torture 
and ill-treatment and improving conditions of detention. He is assured that every 
effort will be taken to implement his recommendations and stands ready to offer his 
full cooperation and assistance in this regard.  The Special Rapporteur recommends:

asylum system is in line with international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To undertake measures so that the police, currently under the Ministry

determination procedure; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Places of detention visited and interviews conducted 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>During the official visit, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with State officials, 
including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Droustas; the Minister of Citizen&#8217;s 
Protection, Mr. Papoutsis, the Chief of Police, and representatives from the following 
departments: Head of Security Services, Aliens Division, the Coast Guard, Legislation and 
Training; the Special Secretary for Correctional Policy and Forensic Services, Mr. 
Skandamis and other officials of the Ministry of Justice; the President, Mr. Kalamidas and 
Deputy Prosecutor of the Court; the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Decentralization and 
E-Government, Ms. Tzakris, the Deputy Minister of Health and Social Solidarity, Mr. 
Timosidis; and the Deputy Ombudsman for Human Rights, Mr. Karydes. He was also 
hosted at an official lunch by the General Director for Multilateral Institutions, Mr. Lazos.  
</p>
<p>Outside of Government, the Special Rapporteur met with a broad range of civil society 
organizations, lawyers, detainees, aliens and victims of ill-treatment. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur met with the Greek National Commission for Human Rights. He also 
held meetings with representatives of international organizations, including the lead agency 
in the country the United Nations Environmental Program and MAP, the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, and the diplomatic 
community. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur conducted unannounced visits to detention facilities and was able 
to hold private interviews with detainees in all facilities he visited. If detainees did not wish 
that their interviews are recorded, the information provided is only reflected in the general 
findings of the report. Some detainees only agreed to an anonymous publication of their 
interviews. The Special Rapporteur has in his files the full name of the detainees 
interviewed. 
</p>
<p><b>  Omonia Police Station, Athens 
Visited on 10 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Deputy Duty Officer <b>Papatzikis Panteleimon</b>. 
The police station provided for one detention room at the second floor which was used for 
short term detention of new arrivals where at the time of the visit no one was kept. There 
were another three cells in the basement of the police station which were used for long-term 
detention. All of the detainees encountered were foreigners being held under administrative 
detention, sometimes up to six months. The cells were video-monitored from the second 
floor. The police cells in the basement have been recently cleaned up and freshly painted. 
According to the detainees the mattresses have been exchanged and some detainees were 
removed to reduce the overcrowding. Usually the cells were reported to be very 
overcrowded with insufficient beds for the detainees. The cells were warm and humid due 
to the ventilation pipes running through the basement. There was a lack of fresh air and 
only little daylight entering through the windows. The space between the cell grid and the 
windows was full of trash and appeared not to be cleaned. There was no space or yard for 
exercising or breathing fresh air. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>Male detainees</b> from Afghanistan, Algeria, and Morocco complained that they have skin 
problems caused by <i>inter alia</i> allergies, insect bites and the humidity in the cells and would 
not receive any medical attention. In principle, they were refused access to a doctor. The 
Afghan detainee was a drug addict and did not receive any substitute treatment or other 
particular medical attention. Even in cases of severe sickness the authorities refused to take 
them to the hospital. 
</p>
<p><b>H.O.F.,</b> aged 35, a Kurd from Iraq, was picked up off the street and detained.  He said he 
was beaten on 9 October by one police officer, three Greek nationals and five Albanians on 
the public square Karaiskaki. He was beaten on the head, cut on both hands and on the 
back. The medical forensic examination confirmed the presence of traumatic evidences 
compatible with this allegation. One arresting officer threatened to sexually assault him. He 
was not able to call a lawyer. He said the police officers located on the CID floor were 
particularly cruel and verbally abusive. He was detained with 15 people in his cell but on 
the date of interview there were only four. His entire family was killed in Iraq; he had been 
in Greece for eight years. 
</p>
<p><b>Charles Eze</b>, aged 28, from Sierra Leone, was picked up off the street, handcuffed and 
searched. His left wrist had a mark from the handcuffs. He was on parole so he cannot be 
deported. He said the cells had been recently painted. 
</p>
<p><b>Amhed Abdusallah</b>, aged 19 from Syria, was searched and arrested on Omonia Square. 
The police took a knife out of a garbage can and accused him of owning it. He has been 
detained for five months. During the interview he was hitting his head against the wall. He 
had a problem with his teeth and had not received any treatment. The toilet was not 
working properly and there was no soap. He drank water out of the toilet. He was worried 
he would be sent back to Syria. The police tore up his papers and he has not been allowed 
to make a phone call. 
</p>
<p><b>Keitta Hamit</b>, aged 25, from Rwanda, was detained for having no papers. He had been 
detained in the facility for one week. He has been living in Greece for one year. He was not 
beaten or ill-treated by the police. 
</p>
<p><b>Mohammed Ali</b>, aged 22 from Palestine, was picked up by police on Victoria Square and 
detained because he had no papers. He had been in custody for six days. He said they 
needed blankets. 
</p>
<p><b>Ten</b> <b>male detainees</b>, all of them foreigners held under administrative detention. Many 
complained about having been ill-treated upon arrival at the police station. The ill-treatment 
was said to have taken place on the third floor at the criminal investigation department. 
They were handcuffed and a helmet was put on their heads and then police officers beat 
them on the helmet and also slapped them on the back and kicked them in the legs. Some 
were hit with batons. They also complained of having been violently forced to sign papers 
in Greek they could not understand. After arrest, the detainees complained about minor 
beatings from the authorities in case they would complain or refuse an order. The detainees 
complained about the poor detention conditions. The cells were said to be overcrowded 
with insufficient beds forcing some detainees to share beds or sleep on the floor. 
Furthermore, they complained about the quality and variety of food often not meeting the 
religious dietary requirements. They complained that they were never allowed to leave the 
cells to exercise and breathe fresh air. They further complained about the bad ventilation 
and the unhygienic conditions caused by a lack of cleaning of the cells. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Omonia Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Athens 
Visited on 10 October 2010   
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. Ioannis Athanasakis, Police Officer A, who 
explained that the CID was completely separated from the police department with a 
different chain of command. The criminal investigation department was at the third floor of 
Omonia Police Station and the authorities only opened the door to the offices after some 
insistence. At the entrance of the department, right next to the offices of the criminal 
investigators, 27 detainees were kept in the lobby. All detainees were foreigners being held 
on the suspicion of a criminal offence. According to information provided by the 
Government on 3 March 2011, the detainees were reportedly detained at the office of the 
Officer on Duty because the detention facilities of the said Police Station were full. The 
lobby was completely overcrowded and providing only some chairs completely unsuitable 
for even short-term detention. The detainees had to sleep on the chairs or on paper cartons 
spread out on the floor. They were not provided with blankets. There was no shower and 
only one toilet for all detainees making it difficult to regularly access the toilets. Only after 
hesitation a list but no register of the detainees was provided by the officers. Although the 
detainees appeared to be unofficially detained the authorities insisted that they were not 
trying to hide them. The detainees at the CID were said to be brought before a judge and 
subsequently released, transferred to a prison or kept under administrative detention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.</b>, aged 17, from Algeria, was arrested at the Turkish border and recorded as being aged 
20. He stated his stay in CID was a nightmare, that he could not take a shower, or call any 
member of his family. He also stated that he suffers from asthma and that the smoke in the 
room was worsening his condition. 
</p>
<p><b>H. M</b>., aged 18, from Algeria, took a flight from Tunisia to Turkey and then a bus until the 
border. He was arrested, brought to Fylakio Migration Center, and then released. He spent 
28 nights in the streets of Athens before being caught again in an identity check. 
</p>
<p><b>A.,</b> aged 22, from Algeria, was beaten several times by the CID officers, who tighted him 
up to the bench in the room, put a motorbike helmet on his head to blindfold him, and used 
sticks on him. He said he was in CID custody for five days, and was previously held 
downstairs in the cells. He thinks he was moved up with the other detainees because the 
cells were being painted. He is held in administrative detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Medi</b> <b>Salah</b> from Palestine was arrested on 1 September 2010 and brought to Omonia 
Police Station. On 2 September the prosecutor ordered his release but the police continued 
to keep him in administrative detention as an illegal immigrant. On 15 September he was 
brought before a court. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b> from Albania complained that he was held in the CID for ten days upon 
arrest where he was successively beaten on the head for no apparent reason. 
</p>
<p><b>Sahib Muhamad</b>, aged 28, from Pakistan, was held in the CID for 21 days without a 
mattress or blanket. Upon arrest, all his belongings were taken from him. The first two 
weeks he was not allowed to take a shower and received no toothpaste.

<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Chief of Police <b>Evangelos Rufios</b>. The border 
guard station provides for two cells with a capacity for 38 detainees while 68 detainees 
were being held at the time of the visit. The cells were said to be regularly overcrowded 
sometimes holding more than 100 detainees. The cells have recently been cleaned, painted 
and according to the detainees the sanitary installations have been renovated. The facilities 
were nevertheless in a fairly poor state and unsuitable for long-term detention. Due to the 
overcrowding many detainees were forced to sleep on the floor. The facility provided for 
two toilets/showers for all detainees but no soap. The facility had no door but grids to the 
outside reportedly posing a problem at cold temperatures. There was no courtyard to 
exercise for the detainees. The border guard station also had a nursery station providing a 
range of medication<b>

arrested in the streets of Soufli by two police officers. They did not use violence, and 
simply asked him to come into a car. They then registered him and locked him up in the </p>

Embassy. He has no lawyer. He assesses that detainees are desperate and treated like 
animals.  He thinks this system will breed criminals. He particularly complains about the 
fact that detainees are not able to leave their cells at all. Upon arrival he did not have any 
medical check-up. He says that a day earlier his blood was taken by a nurse, and that he 
was injected some liquid. He said he did not know what it is since he was not told anything.

away. He complained that the conditions of detention are terrible, and that there is not 
enough food. 
</p>
<p><b>M.J.</b>, aged 21, from Iran was arrested and brought to the border guard station upon entry 
into Greek territory in September. He complained about being regularly shouted at by the 
officers if he does not understand or respond to their orders. He has witnessed several 
detainees being slapped and kicked. Furthermore, the officers sometimes woke the 
detainees up in the middle of the night in order to interrupt their sleep. Due to the severe 
overcrowding he had to share his mattress with one or more detainees and even had to sleep 
on the floor before. The cells were very cold, the heating did not work and they were not 
provided with adequate clothing or shoes. He often had to wait hours before being able to 
access the toilets when necessary and they were not provided with sanitary products. In the 
42 days of detention, he was not allowed to leave the cells once. He complained about 
frequent fights between the detainees due to the poor detention conditions. He had no 
access to a lawyer or interpreter and did not want to claim asylum in fear of then being 
detained even longer. He had received no information on the grounds or length of his 
detention. 
</p>
<p><b>S.D.</b>, aged 25, from Somalia had been detained for 20 days. He had received no information 
about the grounds and length of the detention or about the possibility of claiming asylum. 
The authorities have wrongfully identified him as a Nigerian although he speaks no 
English. When he and his two brothers complained about this, they were slapped by the 
officers. 
</p>
<p><b>J.B., </b>aged 29, from Iran, was arrested by two police officers on 2 September 2010 close to 
the train station in Soufli. He had crossed the Evros River.  He was not subjected to 
handcuffs or force. He has been detained in this facility for 42 days. He was ordered to pull 
his trousers down upon arrest, and felt like he was treated like a criminal. The police took 
away all his belongings, including sentimental items from his family. He was afraid he 
would be sent back to Iran so he tore up his papers and swallowed them. He has not been 
given a change of clothes. He was sick but had not been seen by a doctor. He had been 
taken for a blood test and did not know the results yet. The guards spoke some English but 
there was no Farsi interpreter. A Greek refugee agency visited the facility and told him to 
seek asylum. He does not want to be refugee in Greece, as he wanted to go to the United 
Kingdom. He saw Afghans and Pakistanis detained and then released. Two days ago 30-40 
Afghans and Pakistanis were released. He was not beaten but there is psychological 
pressure.. In August, there were a number of detainees beaten very badly to the point of 
unconsciousness but they had been deported. Four to five days ago some of the detainees 
were ordered to paint the cells and then they were deported. There were usually 40 people 
in the cell. The windows were cracked and cold air blew in. The toilet was in very bad 
condition so he tried not to go. The people used the water from the shower to drink. There 
was only one blanket per person and this was not enough. There were a number of fights 
among the detainees.

of hygiene, especially for the women and children. It was a psychological stress. She 
witnessed them beat themselves against the cell walls, especially the ones who had been 
here a long time. She had only been able to leave the cell on one occasion, when the cells 
were painted. There was only cold water. She had been sick. A doctor had come to see her 
in the cell. She was sent to the hospital and had to pay for the check-up. Two nights ago 
there were 105 people in the cell, mostly Afghans and Pakistanis who, she said, were very 
dirty.

<p><b>Nikolaus Hatzipavlou</b>, aged 47, Greek national, was arrested for alleged smuggling of 
persons. He stated to have been well treated during his arrest as well as his detention in 
police custody. He also described the conditions of detention as adequate. He explained that 
according to his experiences the treatment by police officers and the conditions in police 
custody have significantly improved over the last decade. He wanted to be brought to a 
remand prison in order to have access to exercise, a courtyard and activities, but the prisons 
in the region were currently refusing detainees due to their overcrowding.

<p><b>  Fylakio Migration Detention Centre, Orestiada 
Visited on 12 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by the the head of the Center, <b>Gavranidis Kyriakos</b>. 
The migration detention center was established specifically for the purpose of processing 
and detaining irregular migrants crossing the Greek-Turkish border. The facility has a 
capacity of 379 persons and was holding 486 detainees at the time of the visit. However, 
reportedly the center often holds more than 550 detainees, particularly during the last six 
months where reportedly up to 200 persons arrived daily at the center. It was comprised of 
one big building for detention, a large yard with a metal container for the processing of the 
new arrivals. The belongings of the new arrivals were stored in confiscated trucks in front 
of the center. The building had 4 cells for men, separate cells for women, 1 cell for families 
and 1 arrival cell. The center was severely understaffed with 11 officers per shift including 
administrative staff. There was only one doctor working only weekdays at the facility.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>Due to the high occupancy over the last months, the center was in a very poor state at the 
time of the visit. When entering the building the detainees became very agitated and 
initially the officers were reluctant to open the cells. The conditions of detention were 
extremely poor. There were not enough beds for each detainee forcing many to share beds 
or sleep on the floor. The beds, blankets and pillows were very dirty. The sanitary 
installations were in a very poor state with dirty walls, doors and water running out of the 
washrooms and toilets. The cells were humid and the floors dirty.  The cells were poorly lit, 
many ceiling lamps were broken and there was almost no natural light. There was little 
space between the bunk beds allowing detainees to move around. They had no access to a 
yard and outdoor exercise.  
</p>
<p>The semi-open cell for the new arrivals was in the worst state. The bathroom appeared not 
to be cleaned for a long time. The toilets were clogged causing water and faeces to stand in 
the washroom. The detainees defecated in the corridor of the washroom and the dirty water 
ran out of the bathroom in the sleeping cell causing an unbearable smell. Consequently, 
many new arrivals preferred to sleep outside. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>Two male detainees</b> alleged that they were beaten by the Greek police. The allegations 
were confirmed by the forensic doctor. 
</p>
<p><b>Walid Khalid Oumar</b>, aged 15, from Palestine alleged that he was beaten and injured on 
his shoulder with a machete during his arrest some 6 weeks ago.  
</p>
<p><b>Hiriche Abdolah</b>, aged 16, from Iraq, alleged that he was beaten in the detention centre 
because he refused to give fingerprints. He was punched in his face some 10 days ago and 
had a blue eye.  
</p>
<p><b>Faudel Azami</b> from Palestine helped with the interpretation from Arabic into French and 
complained that he (as many others) has no access to his clothes and his personal 
belongings which are kept outside in the open trucks.  
</p>
<p><b>Jaber Muhamad Khalef</b>, aged 40, from Palestine, alleged that he has Hepatitis C, and 
came on 10 October from Turkey. He was arrested on 11 October and punched and kicked 
by the police during the taking of the fingerprints. He came together with some 100 other 
migrants. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee, his wife and</b> <b>three children</b>, from Iran, were brought over the border 
during the night. They were a group of 100 people from Iran and Afghanistan. They swam 
across the Evros River and walked a long time towards the lights. They wanted to be sure 
they were in Greece. They came across police officers sitting in three police cars. The 
police let out dogs to chase them back to Turkey. Many of the people they travelled with 
were illiterate. The police yelled at them to keep them in order. They were captured earlier 
on that day and have stood  outside the cell for hours in order to be fingerprinted. They 
could not communicate with the guards but think they were registered for asylum. There 
were no toilets in the outside enclosure. They had been travelling for three weeks and they 
were tired and hungry but the conditions of the facility were much worse than they could 
have imagined. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 38 <b>with his wife </b>and<b> children</b>, from Afghanistan, left Afghanistan a 
month ago and they were arrested after crossing the river. The police put them in a car and 
brought them to the facility on that day. The toilets were absolutely terrible and 
overflowing. The police did not ask if they wanted asylum. They could not stand the 
killings in Afghanistan so they had to leave. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife and child</b>, from Afghanistan, were arrested by the police early 
that morning along with about 100 other people and were brought to the facility in cars and </p>

<p>buses. They were 7 or 8 people in a small boat crossing the river and nearly drowned. They 
lost coats, money and had no other clothes and were therefore wet and cold. They left 
Afghanistan two months ago to escape the killings and inflation. 
</p>
<p><b>Khodor Molla</b>, from Palestine, had been detained in the facility for 2 &#189; months. He had no 
change of clothes as the police confiscated all the clothes. He slept on the floor. He had 
schizophrenia and epilepsy and there were no medications available, which was confirmed 
by the forensic expert who recommended having him examined.  
</p>
<p><b>Jamil Abel Ali</b>, from Iraq, had been held in the facility for 15 days. He was a severe 
diabetic and could not eat the regular food. Although it was not possible to do a medical 
laboratory confirmation of the situation, a medical  examination was performed to the 
detainee that confirm the disease He had not received any special food and he needed a 
special regime and medication.  
</p>
<p><b>Kogi Tsetsklatze</b>, from Georgia, had severe pain in his abdomen. For the past six days he 
had passed blood when defecating. He needed to see a doctor according to the medical 
forensic expert who examined him.

been seen by a doctor. 
</p>
<p><b>Kadjida Hamsa</b>, aged 37, from Somalia arrived in Greece on 12 October 2010 by passing 
through the Evros River where her clothes and belonging fell into the water. Upon arrival in 
Greece she was picked up and transferred to Fylakio at 12 pm. She described the behaviour 
of the officers as unfriendly, stressed and aggressive. The officers did not speak French and 
there were no interpreters so she was unable to understand what they were saying. She was 
surprised and intimidated by the behaviour of the officers as she had been told that Fylakio 
was a UNHCR facility. She has been registered and a photo and fingerprints have been 
taken. She also signed a paper in Greek she could not understand. She wanted to file an 
asylum claim but had not yet received any information about it. She was provided with 
bread and beans but has not been able to access her belongings. She was very cold because 
of her wet clothes.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee, </b>from Iraq, detained in Fylakio for 21 days. Upon arrival he was slapped 
by the officers to force him to take fingerprints. Since his arrival he had not been able to 
access his belongings with his clean clothes. He was only allowed to leave his cell twice in 
the last three weeks. 
</p>
<p><b>Ahmed Reis</b>, aged 26, from Palestine, was arrested on a train to Athens without papers. 
The officer who arrested him shouted at him and slapped him in the face. When he 
complained about the treatment he was slapped again. He was first detained at a police 
station close to the border under very poor conditions and then brought to Fylakio where he 
had been for three days. He complained about not receiving drinking water. He was afraid 
to drink the tap water due to the poor hygienic conditions in the facility. He had to share a 
bed with three other detainees.

<p>private donors and the workforce of detainees they have been able to carry out significant 
renovations in the prison. They had completely renovated the visitor area, installed a gym, 
and built new furniture in the prison. The prison had a capacity of 100 detainees holding 
326 persons. The pre-trial detention rate was over 50 percent and 195 of the detainees were 
foreign nationals.  The prison was divided into a &#8220;chamber building&#8221; with 9 bigger 
chambers (4 on the ground floor and 5 on the 1st floor) designed for 8 prisoners each (some 
of which held up to 30 prisoners) and a &#8220;cell building&#8221; with 21 smaller cells (10 on the 
ground floor and 11 on the 1st floor) designed for 2 prisoners each (which held 6 prisoners). 
There were neither minors nor women in the prison. Pre-trial detainees were not separated 
from convicted prisoners, but prisoners were arranged according to their languages (e.g. an 
&#8220;Arabic cell&#8221;) and nationalities. The prison was an open prison allowing prisoners most of 
the day to walk around and use the yard. Despite the extreme overcrowding, the cells were 
fairly clean but nevertheless many rooms had problems with cockroaches and other insects. 
Every prisoner had his own bed with a mattress and blankets and could keep some personal 
belongings. Most cells had televisions which were private property of certain prisoners. 
There was no common dining hall but the food was consumed in the cells. According to the 
forensic expert, the medical facilities were well equipped and the records diligently kept. 
The most modern room was the visitor room, newly tiled and with glass windows instead 
grids separating the detainees from visitors. For children visiting their fathers the windows 
could be retracted to allow direct contact. Pursuant to Article 52 of the Penitentiary Code 
(Law 2776/1999, GG 291/1999,v.A), all detainees are entitled to visits by relatives, up to 
fourth degree affinity, at least once per week and for a minimum duration of half an hour. 
Regrettably, conjugal visits for a longer period were prohibited by a Ministerial decision to 
prevent drug smuggling.

his arrest in April 2010. A colleague denounced him for working without papers. In August 
he could finally go to court and then was brought to the prison. He does not have a lawyer. 
He states that he was treated like a dog at the police station, as the cells were overcrowded, 
the blankets and bed were dirty, and the food was insufficient. He said that violence was 
used by the officers in the interrogation room, but not on him. He lacks the money for the 
bail, and explains he would not have crossed the mountains and left home should he have 
had money. He adds that in the prison he never witnessed violence from the officers, but 
some racism in the sense that Greeks seems to have better access to the available jobs. He 
says that detainees refrain from being violent and get into troubles for fear of being 
transferred to another prison.

of police station, and <b>Lambros Tsiaras</b>, chief of CID. 
</p>
<p>The police station provided for 4 cells with 14 detainees. The cells were said to be 
frequently overcrowded due to overcrowded prisons refusing further tranfers. According to 
the detainees, there were 32 detainees one week prior to the visit, according to the police 
chief only 22. The head of the CID rejected any allegations of ill-treatment in the past 
claiming that he was present during all interrogations relating to serious offences. He 
claimed to not have received one allegation of ill-treatment during his past 10 years of 
office. The cells were fairly clean and at the time of the visit the 14 detainees that were in 
the facility had their own bed. The detainees had regular access to the toilets and showers 
although reportedly there was only cold water and no soap. Some detainees were already 
held at the police station for over two weeks without being able to leave the cells to

<p><b>Four Greek male detainees</b> have been there for 3 weeks, 3, 5 and 6 days. They can go to 
the toilet whenever they wish, but there is no hot water. Food is only provided once a day in 
the afternoon, but families are not allowed to bring food. They can receive visits every day 
except weekends from 5 to 7 pm for 10 to 15 minutes. They meet the visitors in the corridor 
outside their cells. During arrest, people are usually beaten by the police. They do not wish 
to complain out of fear of reprisals (new beatings or longer detention). Beatings also occur 
during interrogation by the CID in the 3rd floor.  
</p>
<p><b>T.S.O.</b> is for 67% mentally disabled from an accident and suffers from schizophrenia, 
which is confirmed on his medical records and by the forensic expert. On Friday 8 October, 
he came 5 minutes too late to his court hearing and was beaten and kicked by 3 or 4 police 
officers. He still has fresh injuries on both legs and one finger from these beatings which 
were examined by the forensic expert. He needs to be brought to a psychiatric hospital. 
</p>
<p><b>Engin Aptous Oglou, </b>Greek citizen aged 38, grew up in Germany and speaks German 
perfectly. In 2004, an arrest warrant was issued against him because he had injured 
somebody. He served 7 months in remand detention in Augsburg and after his conviction 
and sentence to 5 years and 3 months; he also served 10 months of his prison sentence in 
W&#252;rzburg. Since his family lives in Xanthi, it was decided that he could serve the rest of his 
sentence in Greece. On 28 May 2010 he was extradited to Greece and was sent on 1 June 
from Athens directly to the Police Station of Komotini. Instead of being transferred to a 
prison, he was forced to stay 18 weeks in the overcrowded police cell because the prisons 
are too full and there are problems with his papers. Two days ago, there were still around 
30 detainees kept there. In the third floor, the CID officers beat detainees frequently, as he 
could witness during these months. 
</p>
<p><b>Hardid Bogdani</b>, aged 25, from Albania, was arrested on 10 October 2010 at the train 
station in Komotini while hiding behind a train wagon from 20 police officers who were 
searching for escapees from Fylakio Migration Detention Centre. One of the police officers 
hit him with the fist in the face more than twenty times. On his face, the detainee displayed 
clear marks of the ring the officer was wearing on his hand. The wounds were confirmed by 
the forensic expert to the mission. During transfer to Komotini Police Station, the detainee 
was hit on the head and insulted by another officer. Upon arrival at the police station, he 
complained about ill-treatment but his wounds were neither documented nor did he receive 
medical treatment. He was not abused at the police station but complained about the </p>

</p>
<p>frequent overcrowding in the cells. He also raised the lack of warm water in the showers, 
the lack of soap and the limited access to phone calls. 
</p>
<p><b>Herfan Razenfer</b>, aged 24, from Pakistan, was arrested on 27 September 2010 at the train 
station in Komotini on account of smuggling of persons. He was not abused during his 
arrest and brought to Komotini Police Station for a couple of hours before being transferred 
to Iasmos Police Station. The next day he saw the District Attorney and was then again 
transferred to Komotini Police Station for his detention on remand. He complained about 
the overcrowding of the cells both in Iasmos and Komotini Police Stations. He had kidney 
stones causing him pain when using the toilet. He had not yet been able to see a doctor and 
was denied to be brought to the hospital. He was afraid to have to stay at Komotini Police 
Station for a longer time due to the overcrowding of prisons. He was told by the District 
Attorney that he may have to wait up to one and a half year until trial.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, from Greece, had been detained in the facility for ten days. He was 
arrested for possessing 6 g. of hashish and pled guilty. He was sentenced to 90 days 
imprisonment for not being able to pay a fine of 500 Euros. He had no claims of torture or 
ill-treatment by the police. He was in a cell with four other persons.

<p><b>  Venna Migration Detention Centre, Rodopi 
Visited on 13 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by <b>Nikolaos Mavrogiannis</b>, who has been the chief 
of the centre for the last 5 years. Venna Migration Detention Center, established in 2002/03, 
was a former agricultural storage facility with six big cells and two open yards. The 
capacity is 220, at the time of the visit there were 203 detainees. It received male detainees 
from other border guard and migration detention centres in the region. The director 
complained about the conditions being inadequate for detainees and the staff. Due to the 
inadequate maintenance neglected by the prefecture the facility was in a very poor state. 
The cells were not being cleaned as the contracted cleaning company only takes care of the 
office premises. The large cells were dirty and very poorly lit during the day. During night 
a strong light at the entrance prevents the detainees from sleeping. Most detainees were 
provided with a concrete bed and some only with a mattress on the floor.  They were 
provided with only thin blankets and no adequate clothing making many of them freeze. 
The detainees were not informed about the length and reasons for detention or the asylum 
procedure. Although there was an open space surrounded by a high wall and fences, the 
detainees were only rarely allowed into this space, allegedly for security reasons. The 
atmosphere was highly agitated and reminded of a concentration camp. Many detainees 
complained about the rough attitude of the guards.

<p><b>Group interview</b> <b>of around 34 male detainees </b>from Palestine, Iraq, and Syria. The one 
who has been there for the longest has been there for two months. They can go out briefly 
every three days and do not get enough food. They complain about the fact they do not 
receive soap, that the water is cold, that they do not have razors and that they do not have 
enough clothes. They all say that they are cold during the night. They say a doctor comes 
every day except the weekend, but that he can only communicate in Greek. Some detainees 
complain they were recorded as Tunisians although they are from Palestine, and with a 
wrong date of birth, but cannot communicate in Greek with the officers. Many are scared to 
request asylum because they do not want to spend more months in detention in Venna. 
Several of them mention they would like to be transferred to Feres Border Guard Station, </p>

</b></p>
<p>because of the outside yard that they can access during the day, where they can see the 
sunlight. There were no complaints about beatings or ill-treatment. Most of them 
complained that they requested lawyers to help them, who charged them a lot of money and 
never came back to visit them. They explain there is a mafia of lawyers taking advantage of 
the precarious position of migrants. The Syrian detainees express big fears that due to the 
readmission agreement between Turkey and Greece they will be deported back to Syria, 
where they face risks of torture and years of jail. 
</p>
<p><i>  Cell 2<b> 
</b></i></p>
<p><b>Five</b> <b>male detainees</b> from Iran were arrested by port authorities on a boat 80 days ago with 
a group of 40 Iranians. The boat had broken down and they surrendered to the authorities 
who towed them to the port of Santorini. Upon arrival at the port they were beaten, kicked, 
hit with batons, and strangled by around 20 officers. They were forced to sign a document 
in Greek they could not understand. They were afraid to apply for asylum before the Greek 
authorities, having heard that this may entail negative consequences. They were detained in 
Santorini for 20 days in a small warehouse together with women and children. It was very 
overcrowded and dirty; they did not receive enough food, no sanitary products and had no 
access to a doctor. They were only allowed to leave their cells 20 minutes a day. After a 
few days they went on a hunger strike. When loudly protesting during their time out of the 
cells, 8 police motorcycles came and the officers beat and kicked the protesters to force 
them back in their cells. As a consequence they were not allowed to leave their cells for 
eight days. They were transferred from Santorini to Aspropyrgos on a passenger boat where 
they had to sit handcuffed in front of all passengers, which they experienced as very 
humiliating. They were detained 27 days in Aspropyrgos in very overcrowded and dirty 
cells with unhygienic toilets, no warm water, no clean clothes and no possibility to exercise. 
Then they were transferred for one night to Thessaloniki and then one night to Venna from 
where they were being deported to Turkey in the early morning without prior warning. 
They had explained to the authorities at numerous occasions that upon return to Iran they 
would risk being tortured. In Turkey they were held for 15 days. When the Turkish 
authorities heard about their persecution in Iran, they sent them back to Greece. They had 
been detained in Venna for 20 days and complained about the harsh treatment of the 
officers and the poor conditions of detention. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee, </b>aged 31, from Iran, complained about the psychological ill-treatment by 
the officers, who would constantly humiliate, insult and bully them. For example, when the 
detainees asked them to close the doors to the cell earlier at night they would close it later 
just to bother them. The detainees are very intimidated by the officers. In one case he had 
witnessed a 16 year old boy detainee being beaten for not being able to tie his shoelaces fast 
enough when leaving the cell. 
</p>
<p><b>Five Male detainees</b> from Palestine arrived at Venna eleven days ago. Upon arrival they 
were forced to sign papers in Greek they did not understand. They would have been beaten 
otherwise. They complained that it is very difficult to sleep at night. They had to share 
mattresses on the floor where there are lots of mice. They have not left their cells more than 
once since they arrived. They have no contact to the outside world since their phone cards 
do not work with the phones at the facilities. <b>Osama</b> <b>Alkhteb</b>, aged 20, complained about 
strong stomach pain and thus could not sleep. The doctor did not properly examine him and 
gave him pain medication that did not help. <b>B.H.</b> aged 17, from Palestine, had been 
detained for 20 days. He was incorrectly registered as an adult. He was very cold, only 
wearing an undershirt and not being provided with any additional clothes.  
</p>
<p><b>A.</b>, aged 20, from Iraq, had been detained at Venna for 33 days. He fled Iraq as a member 
of a persecuted religious sect. He was arrested at Feres Border Guard Station from where he 
was transferred to Venna after some days. He was separated from his sister who could go to </p>

</p>
<p>Athens. He could not contact her, having no access to a phone. He was very worried about 
her, knowing that she has nothing and sleeps on the streets. He complained about the cold. 
He was not provided with any clothes or shoes and was barefoot. He had stomach pain but 
the doctor only provided him with two tablets that had no effect. 
</p>
<p><b>A.A.</b>, aged 30, from Iran, was arrested in September at the Greece-Turkey border and 
detained at Feres Border Guard Station for twelve days. Upon arrest he was beaten with a 
baton on the legs. He was then taken to Alexandroupoli Police Station before the Chief of 
Police who issued him a deportation order and an interim detention order. He had been 
detained in the Venna facility for eight days and had not been beaten. Every three days 
detainees get one hour of exercise. They receive food three times a day but it is often 
mouldy. There are no blankets and everyone is cold. The cell is full of mice and 
cockroaches. He used the phone by buying an expensive phone card from the guards which 
was 4 Euros per minute.  
</p>
<p><b>M.A.A</b> and <b>M.T</b>, aged 16, from Iraq, had spent twelve days in the facility. They were first 
detained at Feres Border Guard Station. They have not been able to call their family. 
Neither had documentation and were not able to prove their ages so they were not identified 
as minors. There were 36 people in the cell and this number had stayed constant.  
</p>
<p><b>George Kasharian</b>, aged 25, from Palestine, said the police registered him as being from 
Iraq. He had been detained in the facility for 90 days, and was here the longest of all.  
</p>
<p><b>Hassam Mohammed</b>, aged 28, from Palestine, lost all his family in Palestine and had one 
brother in France, who he was trying to join. He was first detained at Feres Border Guard 
Station and had been in this facility for one month. Police registered him as being from 
Syria. He said the police did this so they can deport him back to Turkey. He received a 
deportation order. He was able to understand what it said because he saw an information 
note in Arabic that described what the official document said.   
</p>
<p><b>Wael Sayed Ramadam</b>, aged 18, from Palestine, had epilepsy and a problem with his 
heart. He was detained in the facility for seven days. He requested medical attention and 
medical forensic expert who examined him confirmed this need. 
</p>
<p><b>Abdau Hassan</b>, aged 22, from Palestine, had been detained in the facility for 15 days. 
Police documented him as being from Syria and gave him a deportation order. He said he 
was asthmatic (the forensic medical doctor could not confirm this allegation).  
</p>
<p><i>  Cell 4 
</i></p>
<p><b>Group interview of 21 Georgians and 2 Chechens</b>, who complained primarily about the 
conditions of detention and the lack of medical treatment. Six detainees have hepatitis C, 
and one had a heart attack and problems with his prostate, without receiving proper medical 
assistance. They also have not been informed about the reasons and the length of their 
detention. In addition, they do not know what consequences an asylum application would 
have. Nobody was beaten by the prison guards, but they are rough and often threaten and 
verbally assault them. There is only cold shower and the possibility for one telephone call 
per day. They are only allowed in shifts to go out to the open space, which means that they 
are outside their cells only every third day for roughly one hour. The director, although 
mentioning detainees can stay out about 2 hours every third day, confirmed this policy and 
tried to justify it with security reasons and lack of staff. Six Georgians prefer to go back to 
Georgia rather than staying in these inhuman conditions any longer.

<p><b>Alexi Tsoulelskiri, </b>from<b> </b>Georgia, has been granted asylum in Austria and had lived there

<p><b>  Alexandroupoli University Hospital: Psychiatric Clinic 
Visited on 14 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by <b>Maria Samakouri</b>, Deputy Director and 
psychiatrist who had a good awareness of issues of ill-treatment in psychiatric settings. The 
clinic had no close wing but keeping voluntary and involuntary patients in the same 
facilities. The clinic had 22 beds in one or two-bed rooms. Five persons were held 
involuntarily and one person was a irregular migrant transferred from Venna detention 
center and guarded by a police officer. The clinic was clean and adequately kept. There was 
a common room with television and an adjacent outside area. At the time of the visit a 
group of young immigrants was brought by a police car from Feres for a child psychiatrist 
test.

<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 23 from Iran, had been brought to Alexandropouli Hospital one day 
ago because he fainted at the Migration Detention Center in Venna. He was examined by 
doctors and expected to be released on the same day. The detainee was previously held at 
Venna for 38 days. He reported that police officers there did not care for them. Eleven days 
after being brought to Venna, the detainee saw a fellow detainee having a heart attack. 
Despite the continuous requests by detainees, the officers refused to take care of the fellow 
detainee right away. After some time had passed, they came and gave him a pill. Next 
morning the fellow detainee was picked up by an ambulance that brought him to a hospital 
for check-up. He was brought back to Venna shortly after, and his health problems 
continued. The detainee complained that the cells at Venna are infested with mice. They 
jump on the detainees during the night which is why many detainees have problems 
sleeping. The detainee had not slept for three nights in a row which he said was confirmed 
by the doctor at Venna. 
</p>
<p><b>  Feres Border Guard Station 
Visited on 14 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Police Chief <b>Spyridou Daskaris</b>, a particularly 
knowledgeable officer who showed great professionalism and care for the detainees, and 
acknowledged the difficulty of his task. He had provided the detainees with the possibility 
to access a small outside yard but his staff was completely overwhelmed by the situation. 
The Border Guard Station had two cells with 14 mattresses each, and thus a capacity of 28. 
At the time of the visit there were 123 detainees in the cells, 75 persons in the left cell, 21 
in the right cell and 27, arrested the same morning, in a corridor next to the right room. The 
latter were said to be processed and brought to Soufli. According to the police chief this 
was an unprecedented high number caused by the arrest of 170 persons the day before. 
Each cell had separate toilets and showers and an adjacent outside yard. The cells were in a 
very poor state, in particular the cell to the left. The cells were dark and dirty. There was 
much trash on the floor and the cells were reportedly not being cleaned. The left cell was 
very wet due to water entering through the roof. They had an additional 14 mattresses 
spread out on the floor, many of which were very dirty and wet due to the water on the 
floor. Several detainees had to sleep on the floor. The detainees were only provided with 
thin blankets and no additional clothes and thus complained about the cold. The washrooms </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>and toilets were filthy and run-down. In my opinion, the showers in the right cell were 
functioning but the detainees had no soap to clean themselves. Due to the unforeseen 
number of detainees there was not enough food for everyone leading to fights among 
detainees during the distribution. The cleaning was outsourced by the Prefecture to a 
private cleaning company and the cleaning ladies were too afraid to enter the cells. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>M.E., </b>from<b> </b>Afghanistan, aged 17, and other unaccompanied minors (4 boys aged 15, and 3 
of 17), arrived three days earlier in Greece and went voluntarily to the police. The police 
officers were neither good nor bad, they did not use force. In Afghanistan, they had paid to 
the smugglers 4000 USD per person. They had walked 12 hours through the mountains 
from Iran to Turkey and another 6 hours through the jungle from Turkey to Greece. His 
cousin, aged 32, lives in Athens. He wishes to go to Sweden where he has a friend. 
</p>
<p><b>S.K.</b> and <b>K.W.</b>, both aged 17, from Iran, said that the border police registered them as aged 
18, therefore adults. They had been detained in the facility for twenty days. They were 
being taken care of by other Iranians in the cell. The Police Chief gave them the fax number 
of the stations and told them to have their families send documents to prove their age. They 
were allowed to call their families to convey this information but since then have had no 
contact with them. They crossed the river and were put into a car by smugglers; the police 
chased them and some people escaped out of the car but they were in the back and could 
not jump out. The police car hit their car, and they thought they were going to die. The ones 
who escaped were caught and they were all taken to Komotini Police Station.  
</p>
<p><b>A.R.</b>, aged 27, from Iran, had been detained in the facility for 15 days. Before that he spent 
two months in Komotini Police Station where he had surrendered himself to the authorities. 
He also spent three days in Komotini Hospital because he was very sick and fainted. He had 
many headaches due to numerous beatings by police in Iran. He had seen the doctor in this 
facility and was given a pill but it was not sufficient. He is not drinking the water because 
he said it made him ill. 
</p>
<p><b>Seven minors, </b>aged 15 or 17, from Afghanistan, had been detained in the facility for two 
days after they surrendered themselves at the bridge. They had not suffered any police 
brutality but the conditions in the facility were terrible. They had not been allowed to make 
a telephone call.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 24, from Palestine, has fled persecution and was detained at the 
border guard station for almost two months. He and his friends from Palestine wanted to 
make an asylum claim but cannot communicate with the officers due to a lack of 
interpreters. He complained that the officers are very overworked and stressed. He shared 
the mattress with three others. The food was given out by detainees and there were a lot of 
fights, leaving some people without food in the end.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b> from Somalia had been detained for 7 days and complained that he had to 
sleep on the bare wet and cold floor.

</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by <b>Yorgo Kakoussios</b>, Deputy Chief of the migration 
detention center, employed by the local prefecture. The center situated a few kilometres 
outside of the town was comprised of 10 metal containers with 12 beds each, a small 
kitchen, toilet, showers and air conditioning. It had a capacity of 120 and at the time of the 
visit held 58 detainees. Two or three years ago, when migrants to Greece mainly arrived via </p>

</b></p>
<p>the Mediterrean route it was reportedly often overcrowded holding up to 220 people. At the 
time of the visit some containers were closed down. Families can share a container. The 
conditions of detention were good. The containers were clean and equipped with a fridge, 
air-conditioning and a water kettle. The containers were usually open during the entire day 
but conflict among detainees six months prior to the visit brought the authorities to close 
the containers for a few hours during the early afternoon. The provision of food and health 
care appeared to be sufficient. There was a nurse at the center on a daily basis, weekly visits 
by a doctor and an ambulance car for emergencies. The children had toys donated by 
residents of Chios. The prefecture is responsible for the maintenance and the police for 
security. But contrary to the migration detention centres and border police stations in the 
Evros region, the director from the prefecture is present and feels responsible for the 
maintenance of the detention centre.

<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group interview of ten male detainees from Iran (3) and Iraq (7).</b> They have been there 
since 2 September, and they do not know how long they will stay in detention. They think 
the officers do not know this fact either. All of them came from Turkey by boat, and were 
actually planning to go to Italy, but the boat&#8217;s motor broke in the middle of the sea. They 
had paid 600 Euros each to the smugglers. The two captains of the boat are in prison. They 
were never beaten by the police. They are helped by a lawyer from the UNHCR who works 
in the island and come once or twice a week. They say the food is good. Most of them say 
they have troubles sleeping at night since they wake up at any little noise because of their 
state of anxiety. They mention the guards are good to them, and that it is easy to access a 
doctor when needed. Since they have their cell phones, they are called by their families. 
However, they complain that they cannot go to Western Union to receive the money their 
families send to them, because in the past a detainee escaped on the way to the office. They 
assess that the worst in their life is not to know anything about their future. They do not 
understand the asylum procedure well, but do not wish to remain in Greece because they 
fear they would never be integrated in the society because of the language issue mostly. 
</p>
<p><b>Parastu Mohamed Rashid</b> and <b>Volan Mahmud Mohamad</b>, both aged 22, from 
Afghanistan, have not complained about the conditions in the facility (apart from that they 
have had to stay in the containers at noon from 12 to 4 pm) but wish to leave Greece. They 
met each other during their flight. He got the permission to leave the country within one 
month, and the deadline was the day after the interview. He was told that if he did not leave 
the detention facility, he would have to go to prison. But he did not wish to leave without 
her. She was originally registered as Iraqi and, therefore, not released. Then she has 
claimed to be Afghani which, according to the interpreter, might be true. During the 
debriefing the Special Rapporteur requested that they should be allowed to leave together. 
</p>
<p><b>A.S.M.</b>, aged 30, from Iran, has two kids aged 9 and 7. Her husband was politically active 
in Iran. In 1999 they were both fleeing to the Northern part of Iraq. He stayed in Iraq, but 
she had health problems with her breast and decided to leave with her kids and Mr. <b>Khabat 
Ismail</b>, aged 26 years, who belongs to her family and wished to accompany them. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> aged 50, from Turkey had fled from persecution and was arrested on a

well and they received an initial medical examination by a doctor. The next day, after they 
were registered and their fingerprints were taken, they were brought to the migration center. 
He did not understand why he is detained because his family resides legally in Germany. 
He once saw a lawyer but did not know why and for how much longer he will be detained. 
He had received no information about the asylum procedure. He had tooth pain but no 
access to a dentist and only received pain killers. He could not receive any money from his </p>

<p><b>A.R.</b>, aged 24, from Iran had been detained at the facility for 43 days. He attempted to get 
to Italy in a boat but his boat got into trouble and he landed in Greece. The coast guard 
were very helpful; they helped everyone out of the boat. There were three persons in his 
container. The conditions were good, there were showers and the food was not bad. 
</p>
<p><b>Hamza Haili </b>and <b>Shadia Haili, </b>from Iraq,<b> </b>and their three children aged 5, 6 and 7 have 
been detained at the facility for 45 days. In September they came from Turkey in a small 
boat and there was a problem with the boat and the coast guard helped them. There used to 
be fifteen persons in the container but now only two families share a container &#8211; the other 
family was a woman with her two children. The mattresses were not very good. The 
children had lice; they had skin problems and were cold. The food was not good. They had 
a fridge and the drinking water was ok. The police have been kind to the children and let 
them run around.  
</p>
<p><b>H.A.H.</b>, aged 16, from Iraq has been detained in the facility for 40 days. He gave a 
document to a lawyer he hired to prove his age but he has never received his identification

</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Prison Director, <b>Mihalis Gialis</b> who ran the prison 
since 1972 and his brother <b>Argyris Gialis</b>, chief guard since 1983.  
</p>
<p>The prison consists of 6 chambers with 18 beds and 2 mattresses each and 3 chambers with 
10 beds each. In addition, there is one cell for 2 people used for the elderly or sick and one 
cell for solitary confinement. The capacity of the prison is 120 but at the time of the visit 
163 persons were being detained. Of all prisoners 52 were pre-trial detainees and 105 
foreign nationals. There are 62 persons working at the prison in 4 shifts. The severe 
overcrowding had increased the problems with drugs and inter-prisoner violence. 
According to the director, the prison had been renovated and cleaned over the last weeks. A 
doctor came every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The prison regime is as follows: At

<p>The cells were very small and overcrowded. At the time of the visit, the cells were fairly 
clean although some cells had problems with cockroaches. Many prisoners complained 
about the diet and hygiene conditions. There were little recreational activities offered to the 
detainees and only 41 detainees could work at the prison which was decided by a special 
committee. The health care provided was inadequate and the doctor was young and 
inexperienced. Conjugal visits were not allowed and permission of visits was only granted 
for direct blood relatives but not for friends. The detainees stated that it was difficult to 
complain or be heard in case of arbitrary or discriminatory treatment. In comparison to 
other prisons, such as Kos and Komotini which were both much more overcrowded but 
taken well care of by their respective directors, the overall conditions of Chios Prison were 
fairly poor. </p>

<p><b>Group interview of 23 male detainees</b> from Greece and Albania. They all complained 
about the overcrowding and mentioned that lifers should especially be put in smaller cells. 
There are fights due to the lack of beds for all, and some have to be three in one bed. The 
Albanians perceived that there is a discrimination against them relatively to jobs, and that 
Greeks have priority. They also said that Albanians do not have the right to go on leave, 
and therefore cannot go to agricultural prisons. Since in the island the water is not 
drinkable, the detainees complained that they have to buy water since no water is supplied 
to them except the tap water. The Government, however, informed that Chios detention 
centre is equipped with two water tanks with a total capcity of 16 tonnes, which, it said, is 
adequate for detainees&#8217; water needs. The detainees also complained about the limited 
activities provided to them, and said there are no workshops, woodwork, school or a gym, 
but only some books. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 21, Greek, grew up in Chios and lived in Athens for three years to 
study. He was arrested in February 2010 after a bank robbery by 4 or 5 officers, who 
handcuffed him and beat him with their hands. They brought him to Chios Police Station in 
a specific room to the left, next to the office of the Chief. 10 to 15 officers came in and beat 
him by shifts during 8 hours. He was handcuffed in the back, and they beat him all over the 
body, his face included, with sticks, gun butts and hands. This happened again several times 
during an entire week, and he spent days and nights in that cell without seeing a doctor. His 
request to see a lawyer was denied as well. After a week, he was brought to the prosecutor, 
with the face totally swollen, but did not dare to say anything since 5 police officers were 
next to him. After the hearing, he went back to the police station for two more days, and 
was then brought to the prison.

<p><b>Triantafilos Kyriazis</b>, aged 29, is an uneducated young man with serious psychiatric 
problems who was forcefully arrested in Samos on suspicion of having set fire to the forest. 
He signed a document which he could not read after the fire brigade coerced him to plead 
guilty. He was accompanied by <b>Georgios Mitsos</b>, aged 31, who told most of the story as 
the younger man had difficulties to speak. They had asked for a psychiatric investigation 
but the court in Samos had refused on 20 August 2010. All of them were beaten by the 
police in Samos in a special police room used for beatings. Then they were transferred to 
Chios Prison. Although there were no obvious conditions and  there was  neither time for a 
complete and thorough psychiatric evaluation, the psychiatric problems were evident 
according to the forensic expert  who examined him.

receive but, according to his opinion, not in sufficient quantity.. 
</p>
<p><b>Paleohoris Panayiotis</b>, aged 29, was released on 31 July 2010 after having spent three and 
a half years in prison. On 7 October 2010 he went with his girlfriend to Samos, where he 
was arrested by the police on suspicion of possession and possible trafficking of drugs. 
During the night from 9 to 10 October, he was beaten by 3 police officers (2 are named 
Costas and Thomas) with a black iron baton all over his body. The beatings lasted for 10 
minutes, and after 2 hours interruption again for 5 minutes. They only found 0,5 g heroine 
with his girlfriend but nothing on him. His girlfriend was not allowed to visit him. During 
the forensic assessment performed by the medical forensic expert no traumatic lesions were 
found that could corroborate the allegations of ill-treatment, but of course they could have 
disappeared due to the time past since the alleged beatings.

<p><b>Goudas Omiros</b>, aged 39, has been using drugs for 21 years. He was going to be released 
soon and wished to be transferred to a drug rehabilitation centre where he could get

</p>
<p><b>Asad Hashami</b>, aged 44, from Pakistan, had been detained in the facility for one and a half 
months. He has been in Greece legally since 1998. He was arrested in Athens in August 
2010 for possession of false documents. He said he renewed his visa and was given false 
documents. He was convicted and serving an 8 month sentence. There were 24 people in 
the cell, sometimes they had to sleep on the floor.  
</p>
<p><b>Abdullah Izan,</b> aged 28, from Turkey, is a Kurd and was arrested in January 2008 in 
Athens. He was beaten up by a police man in civilian clothes during interrogation. He did 
not make a complaint. The police hit him with their fists and feet. He said it was very cold 
in the facility in winter. They needed cleaning materials for the cell like mops, and washing 
powder as the cell is dirty. He said he did not know why he was in prison. 
</p>
<p><b>L.D.</b>, aged 53, from Belgium, was arrested in mid June 2010 in Chios when on holiday 
with the family and accused of stealing a credit card. He was in pre-trial detention and told 
he must wait one year for his trial. He had not had access to a lawyer or an interpreter. He 
has communicated with the Belgium Embassy. His son sent him money for bail but it never 
arrived. There was one shower for 24 persons, sometimes there is no hot water. He has had 
cardiac problems and used medicine. 
</p>
<p><b>Mohamed Souleman</b>, aged 33, from Palestine, has been detained in the facility for nearly 
three months. The police arrived at his hotel and ordered everyone out. He had to take off 
his clothes and hand over his money. The police beat him. He had no idea when he would 
be released. He slept on a dirty and ripped mattress. 
</p>
<p><b>Wesam Atta</b>, aged 25, from Egypt, came on a boat to Greece. He had been in pre-trial

for his trial date. 
</p>
<p><b>Salum Alial Hamid</b>, aged 25, from Palestine, was arrested by the police in July 2009 as he 
took a boat to Greece from Turkey. The police said he was the captain of the boat, he said 
the real captain ran away. He was charged with trafficking. He has received a 9 year 
sentence. He had an appointed lawyer who was assigned the day before the trial and he 
could not communicate with him. The lawyer did not know anything about the case. There 
was only one witness, the police officer who said he was the captain. They had to cook their 
food next to the toilet which often overflows. The floor and the showers were very dirty and 
there was no toilet paper. 
</p>
<p><b>Munir Shahid</b>, aged 31, from Iraq, was initially sentenced to 18 years. He appeared in 
court again and his sentence was reduced to six years. He has served three and half years of

building was very cold in winter and very overcrowded. They needed more materials to 
clean, like mops and soap.  
</p>
<p><b>Abzal Juragul</b>, aged 24, from Afghanistan, was arrested in September 2008 with 16 other

</p>
<p><b>John Koutoumanos</b>, aged 27, and <b>Mateo Agelopoulos</b>, aged 33, from Greece described 
the treatment of the prison officials as good. The cell was however overcrowded and one 
person had to sleep on a mattress on the floor. They complained about the quality of the 
medical treatment, the doctor being too young and not qualified. There was no access to a 
psychologist. The mattresses and blankets were very dirty and there were many 
cockroaches in the cell. The detainees were not provided with sufficient cleaning agent and 
were not allowed to order it with their own money. Drinking water and phone calls also had 
to be paid by the detainees and the quality of the food was described as poor.

<p><b>  Chios Police Station, Chios Island 
Visited on 15 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Deputy Police Director Mr. Efstratios Kourasanis . 
There were four police cells which were spacious and clean and a small outside yard. The 
facilities had recently been painted and cleaned. The facility had a capacity of 12 holding 5 
detainees at the time of the visit. In the past, the cells have reportedly been 
overcrowded.The Government stressed in a note provided on 3 March 2011 that since 2010, 
there has been increased inflow of irregular immigrants in the area of Evros (borders) 
which results in a large number of non-nationals being detained in the EXPAs (Special 
Facilities for Non-Nationals) of Venna-Rodopi and Fylakio-Orestiada, often exceeding the 
prescribed capacity of such Centres. This is due to the large number of arrests in this area, 
while there is substantial reduction of irregular immigrant flows through our eastern sea 
borders, which is also due to the activation of FRONTEX in the region. As a result, a small 
number of persons are detained in the EXPAs of Vathy-Samos and Mersinidi-Chios. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>Mohammed Amanullah</b>, aged 24, from Bangladesh, came in June 2009 to Greece. On 1 
September 2010, he was arrested by 2 police officers in Athens. He was handcuffed behind 
his back, they verbally assaulted him, but he was not beaten. He was held for one month at 
the Akropolis Police Station in Athens, but not in a cell. It was difficult to sleep, he had no 
shower and received food only once per day. He was also verbally abused. On 28 
September he was transferred to Chios Prison, and before the interview he was transferred 
to Chios Police Station, where he waited for his papers to be cleared. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee, </b>aged 20, from Albania, had been detained in the facility for three days. 
He was arrested because he did not have papers. He has been treated fine. He was in a cell 
with three other people. He had access to the toilet and the shower. There was very little 
heat. He had not asked to speak to a lawyer as he said it would be useless. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> aged around 30, from Iraq, came to Greece in 2008. He spent 3 months at 
Akropolis Police Station because he did not have papers. There he was beaten several times 
after being handcuffed and with a motorbike helmet on the head in CID custody. Once he 
received an electric shock with a taser because he went on a hunger strike to protest about 
the lack of information detainees receive. The shock was so strong that he fainted. He was 
later held at Omonia Police Station because he had remained in Greece despite the order to 
leave the country within 30 days. He was again blindfolded with a helmet, handcuffed and 
beaten. The following day the pain was so strong that he could not walk anymore. He spent 
until today four months in the prison for a debt he had not repaid and was transferred to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>police station just before the arrival of the Special Rapporteur. Since he is in Greece, he 
already signed in three occasions the notice to leave the country within 30 days. However, 
he was then always released in the streets. He assumes that the readmission agreement 
between Greece and Turkey does not apply to migrants who are not held in the Evros area, 
because of the cost to drive the migrants back to the Turkish border. He was therefore 
feeling very confident about the fact that once back in Athens, police officers would not 
send him to Turkey to be deported to Iraq, but would rather free him in the streets. 
</p>
<p><b>  Detention Cells at Venizelos Airport, Athens 
Visited on 16 and 19 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Wing for men 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Chief of Police <b>Giorgios Arkoumanis</b>. The 
detention facility comprises three sections where in a total of 103 detainees were kept. 88 
detainees were kept in the first section, reserved for men who try to leave Greece with false 
documents. 15 detainees are kept in the other sections, dedicated to political asylum 
seekers, including Dublin II returnees, women and families. 
</p>
<p>In general, the conditions in the men&#8217;s cells are inhuman because of extreme overcrowding 
which exceeded five times the capacity. During the debriefing the police officers admitted 
that the detention facilities were inhuman because they were designed for 2 detainees each 
and used by 10. They were never left out of their cells to exercise or breathe fresh air. The 
authorities admitted that 2 toilets (and showers) for the 88 men and only one telephone are 
not sufficient. The detainees were forced to regularly urinate in bottles.  The officers had 
asked for a 2nd phone for the men but had not received it. But the authorities insisted that 
they did their best to accommodate the wishes of the detainees. The officers working there 
are particularly sensitized but their working conditions are also inhuman. They said that 
they cannot provide towels but that soap is provided. They provide proper food and take 
care of religious restrictions. The cleaning is provided by cleaning services, but they cannot 
give bleach to the women as requested by them.  
</p>
<p>This first wing comprises of nine cells numbered from 13 to 21. Within the cells, detainees 
from all nationalities are mixed together and there is no effort to group them by culture, 
language or citizenship. Most of the detainees have been caught trying to exit the country 
with false documents. In principle, the cells are made for 2 detainees each, but for a long 
time these cells are incredibly overcrowded. UNHCR told the Special Rapporteur they 
could not even enter the cells because of the terrible conditions (up to 130 detainees). On 
the day of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit 88 detainees were being held.. 
</p>
<p>There was a long corridor with 2 toilets and showers on one side (since toilets and showers 
are together, one cannot use them separately, which means that showers can, in principle, 
only be used during the nights) and 9 cells on the other side. On one end of the corridor 
were desks where officers work and guard, and on the other end of the corridor the personal 
belongings of the detainees were kept.  
</p>
<p>On the other side of the cells, there is an open corridor with a terrible smell as the detainees 
throw bottles with urine and plastic backs used for defecation out of the cells because there 
are not sufficient possibilities to use the 2 only toilets available. There is no open space 
where the detainees could walk. They can only leave the cells for a few minutes in order to 
go to the toilets, perhaps to take a shower or to use a public telephone in the corridor. Under 
the criminal procedure code, they can only be detained here for up to 3 days, but in reality, 
these detention facilities are used for administrative detention purposes. The punishment of 
2 or 3 months for attempting to illegally leave Greece is only symbolic as they are in fact in 
detention pending deportation. According to the officers they are not kept longer than 25 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>days. Several detainees were kept in detention pending deportation to their home countries 
although they were detained at the Airport when they had attempted to fly back home. 
</p>
<p><b>  Wing for &#8216;on-the-spot&#8217; asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p>The second wing of the facility was for political asylum seekers, including Dublin II 
returnees. According to UNHCR it is for &#8216;on the spot&#8217; asylum seekers. Nine persons were 
detained in semi-open cells composed of three bedrooms with four two six bunk beds, a 
small corridor and showers and toilets. They could always move within this area but had no 
access to outdoor exercise.  All detainees were provided with their own bed. The detainees 
were held in that area between 5 and 18 days, the conditions were adequate although the 
detainees stated that it has just been cleaned and would often be much dirtier. They also 
complained that they would not receive sufficient soap and razors. Besides they did not 
complain about their treatment or the conditions of detention. Three came from Pakistan, 
two from Syria and one each from Morocco, Egypt, India and Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p><b>  Wing for women and children  
</b></p>
<p>The third section of the airport detention facility was more spacious, had beds, good toilets 
and bathrooms with liquid soap. However, the detainees lacked toys, medicine and diapers 
for children. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>

</i></p>
<p><b>Albert Cakolli</b>, aged 35, from Kosovo, had been detained in the facility for 30 days. He 
was detained at the airport for possessing false documents. He was threatened by police and 
the guards were very rude. There were eleven people in the cell, sometimes there have been 
fifteen people. They were allowed out of the cell for the toilet but only for two minutes. 
They had to bang on the cell door very loud and for a long time before the guards opened 
the door.  They used a plastic bottle in the cell to urinate during the night. He has had only 
one shower. There was no soap to wash his clothes and he was not provided with a change 
of clothes. There were only five mattresses. He has been seen by a doctor a number of 
times, the medication he has been given did not work. 
</p>
<p><b>Olsian Preci</b>, aged 24, from Albania, had been detained in the facility for six days for 
possessing false documents. The guards yelled and were very rude. He was able to make a 
telephone call but only for one minute with a guard standing right next to him.  
</p>
<p><b>Alabied Fawazim</b>, aged 31, from Syria, had been detained in the facility for 33 days. He 
was detained coming back from Syria on a Syrian passport with a Greek residency 
document. He has been in Greece for five years. The police did not explain why he was 
detained. He phoned a lawyer who did visit the facility.  There was a terrible smell in the 
cell. They urinated in a plastic bottle which was hung on the window and was only emptied 
every 24 hours.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 36, from Somalia, had been detained in the facility for four days. He 
was detained at the airport while trying to board a plan to leave Greece. He was taken to the 
basement of the airport and was beaten by one police officer while four others watched.  He 
was punched in the mouth and ears. He was brought before the court. He had no interpreter 
and was then brought back to the facility. He had not been able to shower.

<p>days). The cell was terribly overcrowded with an awful smell. They complained that they 
could only go at certain times to the toilet and almost never used a shower. Of all detainees, 
only 3 (from Albania, Georgia and India) were able to take a shower because one police 
officer was nicer and has sometimes permitted them to shower. There was no soap and 
towel in the shower and no shaving possibility (the officers said they provide a soap but no 
towels). They also complained that they cannot use the telephone, smoking was not allowed 
and the blankets were dirty. They received food 3 times (9am, 2 pm and in the evening) 
consisting of sandwiches, salad and macaroni, but almost no fruit. Nobody complained of 
beatings or other forms of ill-treatment. They also complained that they paid for a lawyer 
but can see him or her only for 5 minutes before the court hearing. They finally complained 
of very restricted access to their personal belongings but the officers said that they were 
always allowed access to their belongings in the corridor. 
</p>
<p><b>Balwinder Singh</b>, aged 33, from India, had paid 2000 &#8364; for documents to go back to India 
and had an air ticket when he was arrested by the police in Athens on 10 September 2010 at 
1.30 pm. He was charged with possession of illegal documents and got a detention order 
until expulsion of a maximum of 6 months. Sometimes, he shared this cell with 15 or 16 
people. 
</p>
<p><b>David Pancylaia</b>, from Georgia, had a proper passport but with a false visa. Since his 
cousin lived in Italy, he bought a ticket to Italy and was arrested when he tried to leave 
Greece. Since he suffered from hepatitis C he expressed his wish to go back as quickly to 
Georgia for the purpose of medical treatment. Although it was not possible to do a medical 
laboratory confirmation of the clinical situation, a medical examination was performed on 
the detainee that confirmed the possibility of an acute liver inflammation.

<p><b>Raduam Sayed Cherif,</b> aged 27, from Algeria, had been detained in the facility for 22 
days. He was arrested while stealing, taken to court and found not guilty and then detained 
for having no documents. He was not able to access the toilet when needed. He knocked on 
the cell door during the night to urinate but received now answer so he urinated in a plastic 
bottle.  He was on hunger strike along with three others; only drinking tap water. He had a 
problem with this stomach and was not able to breathe. A doctor came and took a blood 
sample.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Teton Kidita,</b> aged 40, from Algeria, had been detained in the facility for 22 days. He was 
living in Belgium and then expelled back to Algeria. He tried to come back to Belgium 
through Greece. He was only able to use the phone for one minute. He had tried to call his 
mother but when the phone was answered it was his brother. When the guard heard a male 
voice (because he was standing right next to the phone) the guard hung up the phone and hit 
his head with the phone. He was on a hunger strike. He had problems with his head from a 
prior accident and he finished his medicine two days ago. 
</p>
<p><b>Al Abd Ahmed</b>, aged 41, from Egypt, had been detained in the facility for 17 days for 
possessing false documents (fake residency card). He had a valid Egyptian passport and did 
not understand why he has not been sent back to Egypt. 
</p>
<p><b>Sergei Brianself</b>, aged 41, from Ukraine, had been detained in the facility for eleven days. 
He had a valid plane ticket to go to Ukraine via Rome but when he tried to board the plane 
he was stopped. He said he had bought a ticket via Rome because it was less expensive then 
a direct flight but police detained him at the airport. He was on a hunger strike. He was 
having dizzy spells and fainting. He had self-inflicted bite marks on his wrists from trying 
to calm himself.

detained.  
</p>
<p><b>Rashib Iqbal</b>, aged 33,<b> </b>and<b> Mirza Umer</b>, aged 23, had been arrested 25 days ago for 
possessing false travel documents. They complained about the aggressive behaviour of the 
officers who would often shout at them. They did not receive sufficient sanitary products to 
keep clean and wash their clothes which made the detention in an overcrowded cell even 
more difficult. They had no exercise or activities and could not access any other belongings 
from their luggage than their clothes. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b> from Senegal was arrested at the airport on 4 October 2010 for the 
possession of a false passport. He was taken to an office at the airport for interrogation. He 
was racially insulted and slapped in the face by an officer in order to admit that he was 
using someone else&#8217;s passport. He was told that he would be released upon confession. 
After one hour interrogation he admitted that it was not his passport and he was brought to 
the detention area. The next day he was brought before the attorney but only afterwards he 
could talk to a lawyer. He had been told that he would have to stay at least 15 days but did 
not now what will happen to him in the future. Due to the very limited access to the shower 
he displayed skin problems. He had only rare access to a doctor who did not provide him 
with medication. Due to his skin problems the officers let him access the shower more 
regularly.

explained he was hit in the legs by an officer after he was calling him to use the toilets 
because of a stomach problem. The man from Somalia had a bladder problem. The findings 
of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur corroborated his statement, and he 
recommended sending him to a hospital. Several of them complain that they are forced to 
remain in the cell although they accept to buy a new plane ticket and go back to their 
countries.

about the harsh and aggressive treatment by the officers. They would insult them, grab 
them violently and push them around. He had once been able to receive a visitor from 
abroad who was despite the long journey to Greece not allowed to meet him without direct 
supervision by an officer and for no longer than 5 minutes. 
</p>
<p>A<b> male detainee</b>, from Somalia, had a medical condition due to which he had to access the

<p><b>Group interview of 10 male detainees</b> from Albania, Afghanistan, Iraq, Mongolia,

</p>
<p><b>Magnus Grant</b>, aged 29, from South Africa, overstayed in Greece after his visa had 
expired for some days. He had asked his Embassy whether this would constitute a problem 
at the airport, and was told that in the worst case he would have to pay a fine. However, he 
was arrested three days earlier, and brought to this cell without being able to make a phone 
call. He went to court and said that he was willing to repay a flight to go back home, but the 
judge ignored that and sent him back to the cell. He then fainted as he has a heart problem 
but could not see a doctor. He was in an obvious state of panic. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, from Romania, has been detained for 8 days. He asked more than ten 
times to take a shower but this was refused. He has a strong stomach-ache.

<p><i>  Cell 21 
</i></p>
<p><b>Group interview of 8 detainees</b> from Pakistan (3), Albania (3), Moldova (1) and Egypt 
(1). Until recently, they were 13 people in the cell. The longest time in detention was 22 
days (Pakistani) and 15 days (Egyptian). They confirmed that they can go 3 times a day to 
the toilet (when the door of their cell is opened). At these occasions, they also fetch water. 
Sometimes they were allowed to use a shower during the night but there were no towels or 
soap. Sometimes they were also granted access to their personal belongings. They received 
food 3 times a day (sandwich for breakfast, warm lunch and dinner). Smoking was 
prohibited. Nobody claimed to have been beaten. 
</p>
<p><b>Vasyle Cozari</b>, from Moldova, had a ticket to go back to Moldova dated 11 October (Air 
Moldova 9U873). He checked in at 2 am with a valid passport but a false visa when he was 
arrested and kept in a normal room at the airport. In the morning he was brought to the 
airport police station, went before the court and paid 87 &#8364;. He got a sentence of 2 months 
suspended. He waited to be deported although he was actually trying to go back home. He 
needed to go home urgently as he had asthma and his wife was four and a half months 
pregnant. The case was raised with the police officers in order to speed up his voluntary 
return. 
</p>
<p><b>Lorenc Allajbeu</b>, aged 32, <b>Ermes Rushi</b>, aged 28 and <b>Cemal Mussarei</b>, aged 18, all from 
Albania, wished to go home voluntarily.<b> </b>Mr. Allajbeu said that he had met his British wife 
in December 2004 in London. They married in 2008 in Albania and have a 19 months old 
son together. She also has a daughter, his stepdaughter. He was arrested when he attempted 
to go via France to the UK. He urgently needed to see a dentist and wished to go home to 
Albania. He would also pay his ticket himself. Later the Special Rapporteur received a call 
from his wife in London stating that he had been beaten up by the police after he left the 
facility on 16 October. For this reason the Special Rapporteur undertook a second visit on 
Monday 19 October. Mr. Allajbeu explained that after the Special Rappoteur had left (at 
4.30 pm) he had asked to call his wife in London but his request was denied. When he 
complained he was told to clean the corridor which he refused. As a reprisal, he was beaten 
in his face and kicked with the boots by one police officer in the cell. Also the other 
detainees confirmed this ill-treatment. But the forensic expert did not find medical evidence 
to corroborate this story. In fact no recent traumatic lesions were found that could 
corroborate the allegations. This could also be due to the small intensity of an eventual 
aggression. After midnight he was finally allowed to call his wife and gave her the </p>

beaten because he had asked to use the toilet outside the official hours. 
</p>
<p><b>E.A.</b>, aged 38, from Egypt, arrived in 2006 in Greece and stayed here for one year. In 2007 
he went to France where he lived until 2010. In August 2010 the French police arrested him 
for lack of papers. He spent 22 days in prison. They could not send him back to Egypt as 
the Embassy did not wish to accept him. On 13 September 2010 he was sent to Greece. He 
could enter the country but did not find work here. He decided to go back to Egypt and 
bought an Egyptian Air ticket for 7 October from Athens to Cairo (A 3930: he showed his 
ticket). He checked in with his Egyptian passport and his luggage was sent to Cairo. But 
since his Greek residence permit had expired he had to pay a fine. The procedure took so 
long that he missed his flight for 10 minutes. The police told him he could buy another 
Olympic Airways ticket for the evening of the same day for 181.15 &#8364;. He did not have the 
money, and they brought him to the Airport Police Station. He was very angry about this 
unfair treatment and complained about a problem in his eye which the forensic expert 
examined, concluding that it was a chronic situation that did not need an urgent 
intervention, but that justified, however, medical attention..

<p><b>  Wing  for women and children  
</b></p>
<p><b>Two female detainees</b> from Somalia, aged 21 and 28, and the baby of one of them, 6 
months old, came to Greece via Turkey. They were arrested without violence, and brought 
to a border guard station. After some days, they were brought to Athens by bus after paying 
50 Euros each to the police officers for the ticket. They were left alone at the railway 
station. They went to a park to sleep and heard that in Omonia Square they could find help 
and a job. One says she did things with men for money in order to buy fake passports and 
food for the baby. They were arrested three days earlier at the airport while trying to leave 
the country and go to France with these fake documents. On Thursday they were brought to 
court but could not understand anything since there was no interpretation and signed 
documents. The mother of the child was in a terrible state of anxiety since her child was 
very sick but she was denied access to a doctor and had not received any medicines. The 
forensic expert confirmed that the baby had strong fever and needed to see a doctor. The 
mother added that she had received only one diaper since her arrival three days earlier. The 
baby did not have toys, and they did not have anything else than their bed. They were both 
crying a lot in reason of their situation and the uncertainty of the length of the detention as 
well as the next steps to go to France. They felt put aside by the men they met in Omonia 
Square, and stated that as women they had even fewer chances to find a job, or understand 
how the system works since their possibilities to integrate with a group of people were low. 
They both complained about the racism of the officers and of the people they have met 
since their arrival in Europe. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged 19, from Afghanistan, and her mother, have been detained for 
three days. They had been handcuffed and had been sent to court but there was no 
interpreter so they were brought back to the facility. Before that they had been held in 
Soufli Border Guard Station for three days. There were fourteen people being held in one 
large room. There were two showers and two toilets that smelled. They wanted bleach for 
the toilets to clean them. They did not have toilet paper or soap and shampoo. They said 
that they received food but could not eat it because they thought it was pork. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged 30, from Somalia, was seven months pregnant. She had been 
detained in the facility for 10 days and had not been seen a doctor. She was having light 
contractions and pain. She was handcuffed when first detained. She had to pay to get water. 
She said she could not eat the food because she thought it was pork. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee </b>from Belarus, aged 43, and <b>a female detainee</b> from Russia, aged 23.

detainee from Belarus wished to work in Greece and also managed to work for some time. 
Then she was back in Belarus and returned to Greece. Because of a false document she 
received a sentence of 3 months suspended. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 32, from Morocco, had been transferred from the overcrowded 
men&#8217;s detention facilities after one day because of his asthma. He slept in a separate room 
but could mix with the women and families. Later at the debriefing, the reason invoked why 
no other male detainees were in that section as well was that when it happened in the past, 
they damaged the cells.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kos Police Station, Kos 
Visited on 16 and 17 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Chief of Police <b>Dionysios Kapandritis.</b> There 
were seven men and two women detained in separate cells. 
</p>
<p>The police station is in a government house which was built in the years 1927 to 1929 and 
which houses the Sub-Prefecture of Kos, the courts and the Greek Police. The detention 
cells can be found in the ground floor, both for men and women. There were seven 
detainees in the men&#8217;s section: three Iranians, and one detainee from Greece, Egypt, 
Afghanistan and Eritrea. The cells were fairly spacious and clean but a bit dark. Detainees 
could leave their cells and communicate freely with the others. A toilet and a shower were 
available and freely accessible by the detainees. 
</p>
<p>During the debriefing, the chief of police said that he had been in this position only for 5 
days. He was not very cooperative when the Special Rapporteur asked questions. He said 
that he was trying to get more funds to improve the conditions of detention. In general, the 
police station made a fairly good impression. Some detainees were seen released after the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur which he could verify the next day.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.R.</b>, aged 35, from Iran, came by boat from Turkey and landed in Kos on 15 August 2010, 
together with 5 other Iranians. The others had no passports and were released 2 days ago 
(with 1 month notice to leave), whereas he came with a valid passport and was not released. 
He thought that he was in trouble because he did not throw away his passport as the others 
did. During the arrest, he was handcuffed in front but not beaten. They received food 3 
times a day (bread and tea for breakfast, warm lunch and dinner) which was not good. They 
received no soap or shampoo and could not use the telephone. The next day he was 
released. 
</p>
<p><b>X</b>, aged 23, from Iran, arrived from Turkey without his parents&#8217; agreement and came 
voluntarily to Kos, where he was arrested by the Port police. He wished to go back to Iran. 
</p>
<p><b>A.A.</b>, aged 38, from Iran, said that he lived in the UK between 2000 and 2010. Since 2009 
he took medicine against hepatitis C and became depressive. This is the reason why he was 
sent from the UK to Iran on 23 March 2010. But he decided to go back to the UK illegally. 
He arrived in Greece from Turkey and wished to go to Athens. 
</p>
<p><b>Y</b>, aged 19, from Afghanistan, arrived from Turkey via Northern Greece and travelled to 
Athens. Then he went by boat to Kos in order to fly to Germany. He was arrested at the 
airport when he wanted to board the plane. He was going to be set free soon. 
</p>
<p><b>K.,</b> from Egypt, has been for 4 years in Greece but his residence permit expired 2 years ago. 
He came to Kos to search for work. He was arrested on 21 April 2010 and spent almost 6 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>53 
</b></p>
<p>months in this police station. He was going to be released on 21 October after having 
served 6 months. He was once beaten here in front of the others but he had started the fight 
with the police out of frustration because he had to stay longer than all the others here. 
Sometimes there were up to 25 people in the cells. 
</p>
<p><b>  Female Section 
</b></p>
<p><b>Pechant Timoti</b>, aged 33, from Nigeria, had been detained in the facility for nearly six 
months. She had been living in Greece for ten years and was on Kos Island to look for work 
on the island. She was arrested for not having valid documents. There have been a 
maximum of four people in the cell designed for two people. There was some natural light 
and they were allowed to exit the cell to use the telephone. She said she expected to go to 
court soon when the six month limit was reached.  
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged 34, from Greece, had only been in the facility one day as she had 
been brought from Korydallos Women&#8217;s Prison in Athens where she had been in custody 
for twelve months. She was charged with drug trafficking in Rhodos and ordered to pay 
20,000 Euro to make bail. She could not make bail so she has been held in pre-trial 
detention. In Korydallos there were so many fights among the prisoners that she had to be 
put in a special cell.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kos Prison 
Visited on 16 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Prison Director <b>Vassilis Karathanos</b>, and Chief 
Guard <b>Alexandros Lois</b>.  
</p>
<p>From all prisons visited in Greece, this made the best impression. The director knew every 
single prisoner, and could answer all questions. He admitted that the medical services were 
very poor, since no doctor, nurse or dentist served in the prison. There was only one young 
practitioner who came every Saturday. Most importantly, the director had urged the 
authorities that dental care should be provided in the prison.  
</p>
<p>The facility comprised with a garden, laundry and washing machines, an orthodox church, a 
kitchen, a restaurant, paintings by detainees, an inside yard and outside yard where the 
detainees could play soccer and basket ball. It was a fairly open prison: the doors of the 
chambers are open from 7.30am to 12pm and from 2.30pm to 7 pm. When the doors are 
open, prisoners are free to go to the inner yard, to the workshops and gardening or play in 
the outer yard. There seem to be no unreasonable restrictions. Detainees can use the laundry 
machines once a week. Hot water is provided by solar energy. The chambers are clean, 
have beds and mattresses as well as satellite television.  
</p>
<p>At the time of the visit, there were a total of 104 prisoners, but one was on leave. Of the 
104, 51 were convicts and 53 in pre-trial. Also, 54 of them were Greeks and 50 foreigners. 
The official capacity is 45, thus the prison was severely overcrowded. Nevertheless, it made 
a good overall impression. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>Benjabor Sony</b>, aged 35, from Algeria (living in France), was on holiday with his friends 
in Kos when the police arrested him in July 2009. In the Kos Police Station, 5 to 6 
policemen hit him with their fists and plastic batons all over his body. He broke one tooth 
and sustained injuries on his head, back and legs. He spent 11 days at the police station. 
The police officers took away 2200 &#8364; as well his watch and jewellery. Then he was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b>  
</p>
<p>transferred to the Kos Prison, where the conditions were nice. The food was good, he could 
use the telephone any time; social services and the church helped them.  
</p>
<p><b>Zahir Ghozi Nahib</b>, aged 26, from Iraq (living in Italy) was arrested on 1 or 2 October 
2010, when he was visiting his friends, during a fight with a Greek in a bar. The police 
brought him to Petrou Ralli Police Station. He was handcuffed for 2 days with his hands on 
the back while sitting on the floor of his cell. He was kicked and beaten on his ear. He 
complained about cock roaches in the prison and the fact that telephone calls were not 
private. He was allowed to be visited by his wife on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday from 
8 to 11 am and from 3 to 6 pm. 
</p>
<p><b>Manolis Barbaris</b>, aged 29, from Greece, had a motorbike accident 1 year ago, was treated 
in the hospital, but his plaster was taken off too early. He alleged that he needs surgery. The 
forensic expert examined him and thought that at this late stage, nothing useful could be 
done any more. The traumatic lesions were absolutely fixed and consolidated, and a surgery 
would very probably not produce any special benefit.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 36, from Greece, had been in pre-trial detention in the facility for 
seven months awaiting trial. Before that he had spent nine days at Kos Police Station. He 
was an admitted drug addict. When he was in the police station he was in withdrawal and 
never went to see a doctor. In this facility he asked to see the doctor and waited five months 
to see one. There were too many people in this prison, a lot of them slept on the floor. He 
had access to a lawyer and his family was able to visit him. 
</p>
<p><b>Nikolaos Manikaros</b>, aged 37, from Greece, has been in pre-trial detention for five 
months. He also spent one month in the hospital. The doctor said he should go to a 
psychiatrist but he was not transferred. There was no psychologist in the prison. A nurse 
was supposed to visit regularly but never did. He said that he had epilepsy. The forensic 
doctor examined him and advised authorities that he should be seen by a psychiatrist. 
</p>
<p><b>M.Y.,</b> aged 27, from Iran, is a Kurd and had been detained in this facility for 50 days. 
Before that he spent three months in Omonia Police Station in Athens. He had applied for 
asylum.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> aged 39, from Greece, had been detained in the facility for two years. 
There was no medical check when they entered the prison, no one checked for contagious 
diseases. Due to the overcrowding, some of the prisoners had hepatitis and did not want to 
spread it to the children when they came for family visits. There was no doctor&#8217;s office; no 
place to do an examination. He had a problem with his leg and was given medicine but 
there was no follow-up. They cleaned the facility with their own products that they bought. 
The guards were nice but there was not sufficient money to adequately feed everyone.  
</p>
<p><b>Pavlos Tripilolitis,</b> aged 22, from Greece, had been detained in the facility for four months. 
He had a terrible problem with his teeth but there was no access to a dentist. Problems were 
due to lack of tooth care and were not from a traumatic origin, according to the medical 
forensic expert. He would have to pay for dentist and he had no money. He said he was 
beaten by four police officers when he was detained in Rhodos. He said they beat him with 
their hands and feet. 
</p>
<p><b>  Agiou Panteleimonos Police Station, Athens 
Visited on 17 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by <b>Thomas Fakalis</b>, Lieutenent in charge. The cells 
were fairly spacious, but dark. The police station is located in a particularly tense area of 
Athens. The Lieutenant acknowledged that the conditions of detention are inhuman. He 
also mentioned that neo-Nazi groups put a lot of pressure on police to detain migrants. </p>

<p><b>Christopher Lisowski, </b>aged 50, from Poland, had been detained in the facility for four 
days. He was arrested by five police officers who did not beat him but verbally abused him. 
He had been living in Greece since 1985. He had to stand most of the day as there was no 
room. He slept on a mattress on the floor. He had access to a shower.  
</p>
<p><b>R.</b>, aged 56, from Iran, had been detained in the facility for one week. He had asthma but 
had not seen a doctor. <b>I.R.</b>, aged 22, from Afghanistan, had been detained in the facility for 
ten days. He had a heart problem and had not seen a doctor either. 
</p>
<p><b>A</b> <b>male detainee</b>, aged 25, from Algeria, was arrested on the streets a month ago by ten 
police officers on motorcycles because he did not have his documents with him. He was hit 
with batons and kicked. When one of the officers wanted to bang his head against a wall, he 
pretended to faint and dropped to the ground. He was brought to the hospital for a check-up 
where he was neither treated nor were his wounds documented. After two hours he was 
transferred to the police station. He was brought to the CID on the fourth floor where he 
was placed on a seat outside. He was hit by officers on his arms and back on four occasions 
and officers who passed slapped him or spit at him. After approximately 8 hours of 
repeated abuse outside the offices he was brought to the arrival cell of the CID for 20 days. 
He was not allowed to take a shower during that entire period. The first two days he was 
not given any food, later only once a day. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 16, from Algeria, was falsely registered as 20. He had been detained 
for 7 days despite the possession of valid documents (&#8216;white card&#8217;). He said that the officers 
threw his documents away. He did not know why and how much longer he would be 
detained. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 36, from Patras in Greece, was in a cell on his own, downstairs, 
after he was hit in the head by a CID officer on his way back from the toilets. He is a strong 
injection drug user and has spent five days without any substitute. He was denied access to 
the hospital when he was feeling terribly sick because of the lack of heroin. The forensic 
expert examined him and concluded he was in intense suffering, needing for medical 
observation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Agiou Panteleimonos Criminal Investigation Department, Athens 
Visited on 17 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by CID Commander in charge, <b>Dimitris 
Diamantidis</b>. As it was the case at Omonia Police Station, and later at Akropolis Police 
Station, detainees held in police custody informed the Special Rapporteur about cells 
holding detainees in CID offices. The Ministry of Citizen&#8217;s Protection did not mention CID 
holding cells and seemed to be unaware of their existence. 
</p>
<p>On the CID floor, there was one unofficial cell measuring about 11m&#178;. There were 10 
detainees kept there, sharing 1m&#178; each. It was totally dark and filthy with bad air, and only a 
small hole in the wall. There were no windows or lights in the cell. The temperature was 
very hot. In addition, many detainees smoked against the stress.  
</p>
<p>The detainees were too afraid to come out for interviews, and strongly feared of reprisals. 
The Special Rapporteur assessed Agiou Panteleimonos<b> </b>CID as being one of the worst place 
of detention visited in Greece. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases   
</b></p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> aged 32, from Morocco, has been held in this small cell for 11 days. He 
is terribly afraid to speak to the Special Rapporteur because of fear of reprisals. When he 
was arrested, CID officers put him on the ground and handcuffed him, but did not beat him. 
He says they are treated like pigs, and were 23 detainees in the cell until some days ago. He 
complains that he can go to the toilets only if the officer in charge is nice. He says he sleeps 
on cardboard since there is no bed and only one long bench. He has no blanket either.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> aged 40, from Afghanistan, has been held for 7 days in CID custody. He 
speaks very low because of fear of the officers next to the cell, and states that one of them, 
the commander, is particularly violent. He was asked for his pink card during a control in 
the street, and did not carry it with him. Police officers therefore brought him here, without 
violence. He was then beaten in the ribs five times by the Commander&#8217;s fists. He said that 
he feels very afraid since the officers often come and beat people in the cell, and sometimes 
are three to beat one detainee. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 20, from Palestine, was arrested 3 days ago by several police 
officers and pushed to the ground. Also neo-Nazis were there, and a fight between right and 
left wing people had broken out, but no neo-Nazis were detained. He was accused of theft. 
At the police station, there were no more beatings. They received one or two cold meals per 
day and could use the toilet twice a day. They used this opportunity also to fetch water. He 
went with two African men to the court but they had no access to a lawyer. On 26 October 
he will have the next court hearing. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 18, from Georgia, came to Greece 2 weeks ago and stayed with his 
aunt in Athens. On 15 October, he was picked up by the police in the street as he had no 
documents and was brought before the court. The day after the interview, he was going to 
the court again where he hoped his aunt was present. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, from Albania,<b> </b>has been a drug addict and was very agitated and angry 
since he was dependent on methadone but has not received any medicine in time. He was 
told to wait another 2 hours. 
</p>
<p><b>  Akropolis Police Station, Athens 
Visited on 18 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Chief of Police <b>Constantinos Kaldis</b>.  In the 
official holding cells at the 2nd floor of Akropolis Police Station, there were 15 irregular 
migrants kept and registered. There were four cells, a shower and two toilets, connected by 
a small corridor. The cells were fairly dark and the air was bad. During the past month, 
there were up to 30 detainees kept there. It is semi-open, and detainees can walk in that area 
at any time, and also access the telephone. They receive food twice a day. But they do not 
have access to a doctor. 
</p>
<p>The court usually drops the criminal charges (on theft, possession of drugs etc.), but they 
remain in administrative detention, in which they are systematically kept for up to 6 
months.  
</p>
<p>During the interviews, the Special Rapporteur was told that there is a CID holding cell on 
the fourth floor of the building. The visit of the CID is described in the next section.  
</p>

they have been beaten by CID officers. One said that he was beaten heavily, and that the 
CID officers quickly put ice on his swollen face since he had to go to court. They say they 
are treated like dogs. 
</p>
<p><b>Shahzad Aslam</b>, aged 26, from Pakistan, was arrested on 18 September 2010 for allegedly 
possessing a stolen cell phone. Upon arrest he was beaten in the neck and on the arms by 7 
police officers and then brought to the police station. He was held in the small waiting room 
of the CID for 15 days. The first three days several officers regularly hit him in the neck, 
yelled and spit at him. He was not provided with food or water unless he paid for it. Then 
he was brought before a judge who dismissed the charges and transferred him to the regular 
police cells for administrative detention. He was a heart patient but was refused access to a 
doctor unless he would pay for it himself.

<p><b>A male detainee</b>, from Pakistan, was arrested one month ago, brought before a judge who 
dismissed all charges, and is now held in administrative detention. He experienced no abuse 
during his arrest. He was refused access to a doctor but instead was just given painkillers by 
the police officers. He received no soap and could not use the telephone because he had no 
money to pay for it. Due to the frustration about his detention and the poor conditions he 
has cut himself before.  
</p>
<p><b>M.A.</b>, aged 26, from Eritrea, was arrested without papers 3 days ago. The two police 
officers arresting him beat him and kicked him in the stomach for no apparent reason. The 
first day he had to stay at the CID in the fourth floor, and then he was transferred to an 
arrival cell outside the regular police cells with no direct access to the toilet or the shower. 
He could access the toilet whenever requesting it but had not been able to take a shower 
yet. He wanted to apply for asylum but has never managed due to the many applicants 
queuing at the Petrou Ralli offices. The officers at the police station rejected the 
responsibility to take up and forward his asylum claim.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> aged 18, from Afghanistan, was first detained and handcuffed (including 
at night) for ten days in the CID cell on the fourth floor of the facility with five to ten other 
persons. He waited one week to have a shower. The police treated him fine during the 
arrest. He was then taken to a cell on the first floor where he had been detained for 1 &#189; 
months. There were sometimes up to 30 persons in the cell. He had access to a shower in 
this cell. There was one small window but no light, either natural or artificial in the cell. 
There was no doctor visiting and no medications available. He was initially arrested in 
Omonia Square for using drugs and then the police held him for not possessing valid 
documents. He had a lawyer visit him but the lawyer did nothing.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> aged 42, from Iraq, was initially held upstairs on the fourth floor for three 
days. He had been detained in the cell on the first floor of the facility for 36 days. He was 
detained for having no documentation. He contacted a lawyer, who came to visit one time, 
took the money and then he never saw him again. The air was stifling hot; he could not 
breathe.  
</p>
<p><b>  Akropolis Criminal Investigation Department, Athens 
Visited on 18 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>On the information of the detainees of the second floor, the Special Rapporteur decided to 
visit the fourth floor of the building where the CID offices are, and discovered that 
detainees were also held there in a cell, which was actually a very small waiting room next 
to the CID offices.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>58</b>  
</p>
<p>There were four detainees, in a small waiting room, not designed to be a cell. These 
detainees do not seem to be registered at all and are also not counted in the figures provided 
to the Special Rapporteur by the Ministry of Citizens Protection, as it was also the case for 
Omonia and Agiou Panteleimonos Police Stations.  
</p>
<p>In the cell, the air was barely breathable because of the smoke. There were no beds, only 
chairs and a bench. There was garbage all over the floor, and several chairs they used for 
sleeping. There were no toilets in the cell either, and detainees have access to them only in 
the evening. They receive no food from the police, but families can bring food. The 
conditions of detention in the 2nd floor are much better than in the 4th floor.  
</p>
<p>Detainees held on the second floor in police custody say that the worst they experienced in 
this police station was the treatment at the CID, where they were regularly beaten by CID 
officers. The detainees in CID custody were very afraid of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur conducted a joint debriefing with the Chief of Police and the Chief 
of the CID, who both denied any knowledge of torture or beatings and claimed that they 
provide the best possible treatment to the detainees. The Chief of Police, in particular, 
claimed that every detainee receives an information sheet with all their rights and that he 
provides all services, such as telephone calls with lawyers and relatives, constant supply of 
water and showers, and three meals a day to all detainees including those at the 4th floor. 
However, when he wishes to show the receipt of the day&#8217;s food order for 19 people, he 
could not find it. He also strongly maintained that since he is in this position (26 March 
2010), no form of torture or beatings had happened. The Chief of the CID is somewhat 
more open and self-critical. He arrived here on 14 November 2009 and had not received 
any complaint of torture either. But he admits that the conditions of detention had 
deteriorated since March 2010. The main problems were identified as the inhuman living 
conditions for detainees. In his opinion, the temporary holding facility in the 4th floor might 
be acceptable for 1 to 2 hours but not for any longer. He acknowledges that the CID keeps 
detainees there for up to 3 days, and said that food and water was provided by the Chief of 
Police. 
</p>
<p>According to both officers, people arrested on a criminal charge are brought to the CID and 
can be held there for up to 3 days. They check their criminal records and bring them before 
the courts. If they are then kept in administrative detention, they are brought to the cells in 
the 2nd floor. A decision to release them can only be taken by the Aliens Department. 
</p>
<p>Most of their explanations are in contradiction to all the interviews conducted. The 
statements by the detainees were more credible than those of the police officers. The Chief 
of Police seemed to be very concerned about his authority and responsibility for the entire 
police station, unlike in other police stations where chiefs stated clearly that CID was under 
a completely separated authority.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases  
</b></p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b> from Iraq who has political asylum since 2007 was arrested four days 
earlier in the streets for possession of ecstasy pills. He was beaten upon arrest, and 
strangled by an officer. He was then beaten again on the second floor of the police station, 
by police and CID officers. He will not raise this fact in court because he is too afraid of 
reprisals.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b> from Algeria was arrested three days earlier at the bank while he was 
taking money in order to leave the country and because he had no papers. He was not 
beaten, but complains that there is no bed in the cell, only one bench and chairs, and that 
detainees have to sleep on the chairs. Also, there is no window and he says that the smoke 
hurts him a lot. Finally, he complains that detainees in CID do not receive any food from 
the officers, and cannot take a shower. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b> from Tunisia has been here for three days. He was heavily beaten by CID 
officers. The forensic expert said that his story is corroborated by the fresh and large scars 
on his face, skull and fingers. The traumatic lesions were totally compatible with the 
allegation presented. He could not see a doctor. He also complains that he received no food 
at all, and could not take a shower. He showed to the Special Rapporteur that he can drink 
from a pipe that is falling from the roof, on the wall. He is very afraid and does not dare to 
speak much. In the middle of the interview, he is roughly asked to go to court by the 
officers and leaves.  
</p>
<p><b>  Korydallos Men&#8217;s Prison, Athens 
Visited on 18 October 2010  
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by the Prison Director Prison Director Mr. Zannides 
Korydallos Prison is the biggest prison in Greece. It was designed for 800 prisoners but 
holds presently 2256 plus 20 new arrivals. It is divided into 6 different buildings. Blocks A, 
B, C and D are built in the same way: 3 floors of 40 single cells each, i.e. 120 prisoners per 
bloc. Presently each cell, built for one detainee, holds up to 4 of them. Blocks E and F were 
added later. Block A is presently used mostly for Greeks, Bloc B for drug offenders, Blocks 
C and D for foreigners. Persons of the same nationality are put together in the same cells. A 
part of Block C is dedicated to vulnerable people. Block E is for detainees from other 
prisons who are brought before a court and for migrants in administrative detention.  Block 
F is for people who are held for debt to the Greek State and for special categories, such as 
police officers, prison guards and people fearing for their lives. The disciplinary cells are 
between Blocks C and D, but are now used as normal cells because of overcrowding.  
</p>
<p>From 8 to 11 am, the cell doors are open in most blocks and detainees go to the outside 
yard but cannot mix with prisoners from other blocks. Lunch is from 11 to noon, and from 
12 to 3.45 pm the cell doors are closed. From 3.45pm until sunset the detainees can go 
again to the yard. Those in the punishment cells are allowed one hour each in the morning 
and in the evening out of the cells. The vulnerable people unit in Block C is constantly 
locked down because of an escape in 2008. The detainees held there can therefore not go 
out at all. 
</p>
<p>There are jobs for a total of 600 prisoners, and presently 550 have work. Most detainees are 
in pre-trial detention. 
</p>
<p>Any new detainee must have an initial medical screening. In 2010, they found injuries from 
beatings by the police, but no further action was taken. There is a special complaints 
procedure against prison guards, and the prosecutor can be directly contacted, even by 
anonymous letter. 
</p>
<p>The Forensic Expert visited the Korydallos Psychiatric Prison Hospital. He reported to the 
Special Rapporteur that the injecting drug users (IDU) do not receive substitute treatment or 
specific medical attention. According to the information received, Korydallos does provide 
methadone and the forensic expert observed the kind of substitution therapeutics that were 
available. 
</p>
<p>On Saturday 16 October, there was a serious incident in Block C. Fights broke out between 
different ethnic groups, in particular Iraqi Kurds and Algerians. A number of detainees and 
guards were injured, and some had to be brought to the hospital. According to detainees the 
fight really sparked with the general frustration about the conditions of detention and the 
judicial system. As a consequence, all prisoners in the 2nd and 3rd floor are locked down. 
When the Special Rapporteur visited Block C, prisoners were extremely agitated. Shouted 
from inside the cells and started to light fires both outside and inside the building. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Block A 
</i></p>
<p>This block was completely overcrowded and detainees were very noisy and restless. The 
conditions of hygiene were very bad. The Special Rapporteur observed many cockroaches 
and bugs. It was cold, and most detainees complained about the lack of food, and its 
quality. 
</p>
<p><b>Stan Marius</b>, aged 23,<b> Cubahit Gabriel Adrian</b>, aged 30,<b> Borhan Mihai</b>, aged 29,<b> 
Damalache Tudor Costel</b>, aged 34, and<b> Davel Ilie Stefat, </b>aged 22,<b> </b>had been detained on 
remand for four to six months. They have not alleged any abuse during arrest or in the 
prison. They complained about the discrimination of foreigners in accessing a workplace. 
They expressed concerns that in the prisons they mix serious criminals with pre-trial 
detainees. Also they criticized that there is no initial blood test upon arrival at the prison 
thus exposing them to a risk of infectious diseases, in particular tuberculosis and 
HIV/AIDS. The quality of the medical treatment was said to be very bad. The doctor would 
not really listen to the detainees but only hand out painkillers. One of the detainees recently 
fainted due to a kidney problem and the doctor&#8217;s advice was to drink more water. The 
quality of the food was very poor. The detainees tried to always cook by themselves which 
was difficult since there were no refrigerators available. They complained about the 
mattresses being very dirty and uncomfortable leading to back pain. The biggest problem 
was said to be the overall poor hygiene of the prison with cockroaches everywhere. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainees</b> from Ghana, Nigeria and Somalia have not received sufficient clothes or 
clean blankets. They complained about the filthiness of the mattresses that are infested with 
cockroaches.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> from Greece, was serving a 32 year sentence for trafficking 3.2 tonnes of 
cocaine. He had served three years to date in the facility. He had a lawyer. His wife and 
child visited him once a week for 15 minutes behind a glass barrier. He saw his child one 
time a month in an open setting. Many people used heroin inside the facility. There was 
easy access as the drugs were thrown over the fence. If they needed medicine they had to 
pay for it themselves. There were no library facilities. If they undertook an educational 
program it helped reduce the amount of time to be served.  
</p>
<p><i>  Block C 
</i></p>
<p>The atmosphere is extremely tense because the prisoners in the first and second floors, 
where the fights occurred some days prior to the visit, were still locked down. Prisoners 
were shouting, banging the doors, and started to light fires both outside and inside the 
building. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 39, from Greece, speaking German was heavily beaten and kicked 
during his arrest by the police 8 months ago. He was arrested for possession of hashish, 
since Greece has one of the harshest drug laws in the world. There is no therapy for drugs. 
If the police claim that one has drugs, one must prove the opposite. Police officers also 
stole personal belongings, such as computers, from the detainees. The worst police station, 
in his opinion, was Kalifea Police Station. Legal aid lawyers were not efficient as they just 
have finished their law studies. Since he had money, he had two of the best lawyers and 
will be brought to court on 8 December 2010. He has spent already 8 months in pre-trial 
detention. The conditions in the prison, apart from the overcrowding, were alright if you 
had money. The food is so bad that he did not eat it, but he could cook his own food. His 
lawyer has managed that he got one of the few jobs in prison. Because of the sun collectors, 
there is only 5 minutes hot water in the morning and 5 minutes in the afternoon. His parents 
could visit him twice a week for 2 hours each. On average, there was one death in prison </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>61 
</b></p>
<p>per month, often related to drugs or suicide. Not all deaths in prison were duly registered 
and investigated. In relation to the allegation that not all deaths were duly registered and 
investigated, the Government informed that all deaths in the detention facilities are fully 
registered and investigated. Only deaths that occur in hospitals are investigated by the 
hospital and not by the detention facilities' authorities due to medical privacy. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, from Sudan, has been detained in the facility for three months for not 
possessing valid documents. There were sixteen persons in his cell. They used their own 
money to buy food and soap. They cleaned the toilets and showers themselves. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, from Palestine, had been detained in the facility for two months for not 
possessing valid documents. There were sixteen persons in his cell. The cell was very dirty, 
lots of insects and flies. Many people in his cell were here for 6 months to one year for not 
possessing valid documents. The telephone was not working.  
</p>
<p><b>Four male detainees </b>from Albania explain that the first and second floor of C Block was 
in lockdown because a fight had broken out between Arabs and Pakistanis and they 
believed an Arab man may have been killed. These things happen all the time. A number of 
people were injured, including one guard who was badly beaten. The guards ordered a lock 
down as a disciplinary measure. The prisoners shouted and banged on the doors for hours 
and setting fire to their clothes and hanging them out the window. Many were in the facility 
serving long sentences for drug offences.   
</p>
<p><i>  Block C- Section of vulnerable people  
</i></p>
<p>In this block there are 23 detainees in cells of two beds each. The cell doors are open during 
the day, but the doors of the block, including the doors to the external secured yard, are all 
the time closed. As a result the detainees can not go out to breathe fresh air, practice any 
activity or see the sunlight at all. 
</p>
<p><b>Two transgender persons</b> from Greece were brought from Corfu to Athens for their court 
hearing three days earlier. They complained about the fact that the cell is overcrowded and 
very unhygienic. Also, they mention that the section of vulnerable persons is completely 
locked down all along the year, and that detainees cannot access the yard, because of an 
escape that happened in 2008. They therefore have to remain inside the small block all the 
time. They say that guards and detainees are respectful. The Government informed that the 
vulnerable persons in Block C of Korydallos Detention Facility were all pre-trials and held 
in separate cells for their own protection temporarily - contrary to the information provided 
by some detainees who mentioned they had been in these cells for a rather long period of 
time. The Government added that these two persons have already been transferred to other 
detention facilities, in individual cells, for serving their sentence.  
</p>
<p><i>  Block E - basement used for administrative detention 
</i></p>
<p>This block comprises in its basement irregular migrants held in administrative detention. 
There are 3 cells of 16 people each. The door to the basement is open and detainees can at 
time access the ground floor, but they cannot go out on the yard. Some have beds; others 
sleep on the floor as it is overcrowded. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur 
on 3 March 2011 that the irregular immigrants held in the basement of Block E, are mainly 
immigrants for deportation to their countries but they have refused to cooperate with the 
competent authorities for issuing the appropriate travel documents. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur noticed hundreds of bugs and cockroaches crawling under the 
mattresses, in the food and on the floor. The conditions of hygiene were very bad. The 
Special Rapporteur noticed that the detainees were very agitated and anxious. Also, several 
detainees had self-mutilation signs. </p>

<p><b>A</b> <b>male detainee</b>, aged 21, from Algeria, was arrested on 21 May 2010 and brought to the 
police station at Piraeus. There he was beaten with fists and a baseball bat by the officers. 
One of his thumbs broke. He was kept at the police station for 5 days without access to a 
doctor. Then he was transferred to Korydallos Prison where he is detained since. He has 
had no access to a lawyer and has not seen a judge. He complained about the treatment of 
the prison guards who regularly insulted and humiliated him. He complained about being 
detained underground. Due to the humidity in the cells he displayed skin problems. 
</p>
<p><b>Group interview with male detainees</b>, who complain that it is colder in the basement, and 
that they have only one hour of warm water per day. They say that the food is not good, in 
insufficient quantity (twice a day), and that the kitchen facilities are dirty. Furthermore, 
they have no access to a doctor. 
</p>
<p><b>  Korydallos Women&#8217;s Prison, Athens 
Visited on 18 October 2010   
</b></p>
<p>There are 201 female detainees. On the date of the visit. The detainees are held in a three 
story building and remandees are not separated from those serving sentences.  They live 
partly in chambers of 16 to 18 people and in cells of 2 to 3. Generally, it overcrowded but 
the facility is much better taken care of than the males&#8217; part. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur noticed a high level of frustration with the conditions of detention 
and the system of criminal justice in general. The detainees complained about long periods 
(up to 15 months) of pre-trial detention, lack of access to free legal aid, and long prison 
terms for comparatively minor crimes, above all drug related offences.  
</p>
<p>Detainees have to pay for services which should be provided free of charge by the prison 
administration, such as toilet paper, soap, decent food, etc. Many detainees have serious 
diseases, such as hepatitis C, HIV, multiple sclerosis, without access to basic medical 
assistance.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>A</b> <b>female detainee</b>, aged 40, from Greece, was arrested on 21 June 2010 by 15 policemen 
at her home in Drama in the presence of her 6 year-old son. They brought her with 
handcuffs behind her back to the police station of Drama, together with her son. There she 
was interrogated and severely beaten on the 1st floor by one CID officer in civilian clothes 
and by the CID commander in civilian clothes. They beat her in her face, in her back and 
neck. As a result, two ribs and her cheekbone were broken. She was brought before the 
prosecutor and the magistrate in Drama. Her face was swollen and she complained about 
the ill-treatment, but they did not care. From the police in Drama she was brought via a 
transit centre in Thessaloniki and a similar centre in Athens to Korydallos Prison, where she 
arrived on 30 June 2010. She immediately requested to be brought to the hospital, but this 
request was only fulfilled on 16 September 2010, i.e. two and a half months later. At that 
time, her visible injuries were gone, but the fracture of her cheekbone was diagnosed with 
an x-ray. There were, however, several women who could witness her swollen face when 
she was brought to Korydallos Prison. 
</p>
<p>A<b> female detainee</b> was arrested on 25 June 2010 at Rhodos Island and brought to the 
police station of Rhodos. There she was interrogated from 7 pm to 2 am. She 
unsuccessfully demanded a lawyer and a telephone call. Although she was not physically 
assaulted, she was threatened with 15 years to life imprisonment if she would not cooperate 
and confess to drug trafficking. She stayed together with an Asian woman for 10 days in the 
women&#8217;s cell, and was only provided once a day with food. They brought her to the 
prosecutor and a magistrate without being defended by a lawyer and assisted by an </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>interpreter (a police officer assisted with interpretation). After another few days in the 
police cell, she was brought by boat to Athens and then transferred to Korydallos Prison.   
</p>
<p><b>A</b> <b>female detainee</b>, from Brazil, had been waiting one year in pre-trial detention. She had 
not seen a lawyer as it was too expensive. She said that there were vaginal searches done 
when one first entered the prison and whenever they exit the prison and return, i.e. visit the 
hospital. These were done by a male doctor with a female nurse present. The guards 
imposed disciplinary measures if one refused to sign the consent form for this search. The 
guards did not sexually or physically abuse the detainees, as most were female guards.  
</p>
<p><b>A</b> <b>female detainee</b>, aged 40, from Romania, had been detained in pre-trial for 6 months. 
Since she could not pay bail she had to wait for her trial up to 18 months in remand. There 
were 60 Romanians being held in the facility. Most women were held in large chambers 
with 15-18 people and a few people shared small cells. She had epilepsy and no medication.  
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, from Ghana, had received an 80-year sentence for trafficking 6 kilos of 
hashish. She had served 7 years of her sentence so far. Many women were serving 
sentences for drug possession of or drug abuse. She was HIV positive so she had her own 
room. There were two women who were HIV positive. She was able to see a doctor when 
needed. There were 4 showers on the entire floor shared by more than 150 people. Many of 
the windows were not able to close and there were large drafts so very cold in winter. They 
ate the food in the cells with their hands. They had to buy everything themselves - soap, 
food and clothes. 
</p>
<p><b>A.M.</b>, aged 41 and other <b>female detainees</b>, had not been ill-treated upon arrest or in 
detention. However, detainees coming back from day paroles are routinely subjected to 
vaginal searches. They complained about the conditions of detention. They were not given 
enough cleaning agent to keep their cells clean. As a result there were many cockroaches. 
They were not given sufficient sanitary products such as toilet paper and soap and had to 
buy it mostly themselves. There was only warm water for one hour every evening, creating 
fights among the detainees. The cells were very cold, the windows not isolated and some 
panes broken. They have complained about the quality of the food and that they are always 
given rice or pasta. The medical treatment was very poor. The doctors would not really 
listen to the complaints of the detainees but usually just give sleeping pills and psychotropic 
drugs. Some detainees were separated from their children and could not see them regularly. 
The detainees were not allowed to bring their belongings from home but had to buy all 
things including clothes and bed sheets new. Detainees without any financial means were 
very disadvantaged. They have complained about the arbitrary treatment by the prison 
officials who sometimes refuse to buy things for prisoners without any reason. The poor 
conditions created much frustration among the detainees and many have been cutting 
themselves. 
</p>
<p><b>K.A.</b>, a Greek Roma, complained about racial discrimination by the prison officials. She 
could not receive visitors from abroad. Her minor son was very sick and she could not visit 
him. Her brother had recently died and she was prevented from going to his funeral. 
</p>
<p><b>T.P</b>., aged 28, from Poland, was detained for 3 months. She had a young child with a Greek 
man she is not married to. She was about to be sent to a prison to Poland against her will. 
She was afraid of being permanently separated from her child. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, from Russia, was subjected to strip searches when returning from 
visiting her husband in the male prison. She complained that she had no possibility to carry 
illegal object with her coming from one prison to another. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, from Germany, stated that non-Greeks were discriminated against by 
the prison officials. She also complained about the smell from the drainage that was not </p>

</p>
<p>being cleaned. She said to have respiratory problems caused by the bad ventilation and 
everyone in the prison smoking. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee,</b> aged 22, from Poland, complains that there are not enough books and 
educational material for detainees. She also states that they have limited physical and 
recreational activities. She was never beaten, but mentioned that the officers can shout at 
them easily. She would like to have chlorine water to be able to clean the cells properly.  
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b><i>,</i> aged around 60, from Greece, was arrested on 2 March 2010 together 
with her whole family and brought to Gada Police Station. Her family was discharged after 
24 hours but she was kept. In order to extract a confession, the officers asked her to seat on 
a broken chair for 80 hours during which she was not allowed to stand except once to go to 
the bathroom. After a while, her feet became swollen, and she was hungry since she only 
received water. She was beaten nights and days by four CID officers, who used their hands, 
and punched her like a ball. She fell on her back at times, and had bruises all over the body. 
Once she came back from the toilets, a female officer asked her to get naked, and then 
made fun of her being so old and out of shape. The most senior officer of the group lifted 
her several times by the hair. After 80 hours, her face was completely blue, and so were her 
legs and arms. She was forced to sign papers. She was brought to court, and asked the judge 
to see a forensic expert. This was denied. She was then brought back to the police station, 
to a temporary cell, together with many people. Among them were three women, who 
helped her seat since she was half conscious. Five days later, the officers again brought her 
back to court and assigned her a lawyer. She refused, but asked to see a doctor. It was 
refused again. She was brought back to the police station&#8217;s large common room. On 19 
March, she was brought to Korydallos prison, and heard for the first time that she was 
charged with intention of killing. She was immediately brought to the clinic of the prison 
and underwent exams. She then used these medical records to launch a habeas corpus 
petition, and stated she had to confess against herself, but it was rejected for procedural 
reasons, since one document was not in conformity with the requirements. She is now 
appealing.  
</p>
<p><b>  Korydallos Psychiatric Prison Hospital, Athens 
Visited on 18 October 2010   
</b></p>
<p>Korydallos Psychiatric Prison Hospital is located in an old and dilapidated building and 
lacked the required health staff and modern medical equipment needed to be in accordance 
with international standards for this kind of health facility. From the visit to the premises, 
and from interviews with health professionals and detainees, the Special Rapporteur found 
there was a great commitment and dedication from the health staff, who did their best to 
compensate for the difficult work conditions. A number of efforts were being made by the 
present administration to renew the facilities and to implement a new internal organization 
and provide health psychiatric programs. These efforts were well recognized by the 
psychiatric population, who were particularly happy with recent changes introduced in the 
establishment. However, without a substantial investment on the renewal of the facilities 
and adequate equipment and staff resources, Korydallos will not be adequately prepared for 
the future.

<p><b>  Echsarkia Criminal Investigation Department, Athens 
Visited on 19 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by CID Sergeant <b>Apostolos Zotos</b>. There were nine 
detainees held under the authority of the CID. Unlike in other CID facilities, all detainees </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>65 
</b></p>
<p>were registered. This police station is notorious for drugs, since there are 18 drug therapy 
centres in the surroundings, covering 1500 injecting drug users (IDU) every day. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 31, from Afghanistan, had been detained in the facility for six 
months and five days. He was arrested for possession of drugs and has applied for asylum. 
But he did not want to file for asylum because he has heard that it meant he would be 
detained for longer. He said the police treatment was fine, but the food was terrible. There 
was no change of clothes, soap or toothpaste available. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 32, from Afghanistan, has been detained in the facility for four 
days. He said that he had been arrested along with a Greek citizen. He said the police took 
the drugs off the Greek&#8217;s pocket and put them in his so he was arrested and the Greek was 
released. He said he was beaten by police upon arrest in the hallway on one of the upper 
floors of the police station. He was kicked and hit in the back while handcuffed. He said his 
cheek bones hurt a lot but there were no longer any marks. He was going through drug 
withdrawal and had not been seen by a doctor. Two nights earlier he was taken to a medical 
clinic and given an injection of something and then returned to the facility. He said the 
authorities cleaned the garbage off the floor in the police station   half an hour before the 
Special Rapporteur arrived.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 44, from Pakistan, had been detained in the facility for 60 days. He 
was detained for not possessing valid papers. He had been living in Greece for four years 
and had contacted a lawyer by phone by using one of the very expensive phone cards. He 
said the food was terrible. On this day there were 27 people detained in the three cells, this 
was typical as usually there were between 23 and 28 people here. Many people had to sleep 
in the hallway.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 22, from Somalia, had been detained in the facility for 5 months and 
6 days. He was detained for not possessing valid papers. He said sometimes they had to 
wait a long time to receive food. There was no outdoor space and only a very small window 
high up on the wall which provided some air.
