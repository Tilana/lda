<p><b>HIGH-LEVEL CONFERENCE ON &#8220;TEN YEARS OF THE GUIDING 
PRINCIPLES ON INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT - ACHIEVEMENTS 
AND FUTURE CHALLENGES&#8221; (OSLO, 16 AND 17 OCTOBER 2008): 
 SUMMARY OF THE CONFERENCE CHAIR 
</b></p>
<p>1. The purpose of the high-level conference titled &#8220;<b>Ten years of the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement - achievements and future challenges</b>&#8221; was to assess the 
accomplishments and shortcomings of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement over the 
last 10 years, and to chart a way forward for national and international decision-makers, 
including relevant States, United Nations bodies, regional organizations and civil society actors. 
Specifically, the conference sought to generate increased political will to incorporate the Guiding 
Principles into national, regional and global frameworks and to encourage progress towards their 
practical implementation. 
</p>
<p>2. The conference reaffirmed the Guiding Principles as an important framework for 
upholding the rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and was encouraged by reports from 
a number of States that the Guiding Principles had been incorporated into national laws and 
policies and that a variety of actors have found them useful in promoting IDP rights. 
</p>
<p>3. However, the conference emphasized that increased political and financial commitment is 
needed to ensure the full protection of IDPs. States are encouraged to develop or strengthen their 
policies to include: (a) preventive measures to avert displacement, (b) crisis-mitigation 
procedures, to be activated once displacement has occurred, and (c) durable solution 
frameworks. 
</p>
<p>4. There is an urgent need for humanitarian and development actors, Governments and 
financial institutions to work together to ensure durable solutions to displacement. Joint 
approaches are also required to address the challenges resulting from the increasing scale and 
complexity of forced displacement, and to ensure that the standards set by the Guiding Principles 
are met. 
</p>
<p><b>Achievements of the Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>5. Participants in the conference emphasized that the Guiding Principles have become a key 
point of reference for the development of normative frameworks for the protection of IDPs in 
domestic laws and policies. For example, IDP policy of the Government of Uganda is based on 
the Guiding Principles, on international humanitarian law and on its national Constitution. These 
serve as a guide for government institutions, humanitarian and development agencies while 
providing assistance and protection to internally displaced persons. In Georgia, the Ministry of 
Refugees and Accommodation has consulted international representatives to ensure that the 
actions of the Government are in compliance with the standards of the Guiding Principles, as 
outlined in the IDP State Strategy Plan of Action. In Turkey, the Government has incorporated 
the Guiding Principles into its strategy document and used them as a basis for its Compensation 
Law. With the help of the United Nations, the model used to develop the Van Province plan of 
action for IDPs is now being expanded to cover other provinces. Examples from Mozambique 
and the Maldives were also given, confirming the relevance of incorporating the Guiding 
Principles into national legislation in situations of displacement resulting from natural disasters. </p>

</p>
<p>6. At the regional level, the Organization of American States and the Council of Europe have 
recommended to their Member States the adoption of the Guiding Principles through national 
legislation. In Africa, the Great Lakes Protocol on the Protection and Assistance to Internally 
Displaced Persons includes a legal obligation for signatories to incorporate the Guiding 
Principles into domestic law. 
</p>
<p>7. The essential role of the judicial system and civil society organizations in promoting the 
Guiding Principles and monitoring commitments and obligations of national authorities was 
highlighted in the context of Colombia. 
</p>
<p>8. The conference provided an occasion for the Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the human rights of internally displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin, to launch a new resource 
publication, Protecting Internally Displaced Persons: A Manual for Law and Policymakers<i>. </i>This 
manual, developed by an international group of legal experts, provides practical guidance for 
bringing relevant domestic laws in line with the Guiding Principles. Furthermore, this accessible 
guide promotes ownership of the Guiding Principles by the Governments of States affected by 
displacement. 
</p>
<p>9. During the discussion, it became apparent that the Guiding Principles were operationally 
valuable for actors engaged in providing protection and assistance to IDPs. From the point of 
view of humanitarian agencies, the Guiding Principles have shaped humanitarian and protection 
operations. They also provide the primary reference from which humanitarian and protection 
standards and practices are developed. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) affirmed that the Guiding Principles had become an extremely relevant 
protection instrument, in the absence of binding instruments, and that operational responsibilities 
of UNHCR in relation to displaced persons have been developed based on the Guiding 
Principles. The Emergency Relief Coordinator highlighted the role of the Guiding Principles in 
helping to develop partnerships, and therefore, better preparedness and responses. ICRC 
expressed its conviction of the relevance of the Guiding Principles, stating that they were as 
pertinent during and after an armed conflict as in situations of internal strife, complex 
emergencies or natural disasters; in certain instances they provide more specific guidance than 
international humanitarian law. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) noted that the Guiding Principles had proven to be useful in a variety of 
situations and that they had been shared with all its offices. 
</p>
<p>10. With respect to displacement resulting from natural disasters, the conference affirmed that 
the Guiding Principles provided a useful framework for disaster risk reduction, the mitigation of 
displacement, and ending displacement after disasters. In situations of disaster-induced 
displacement, protection risks are often underestimated. In disaster-prone countries, the Guiding 
Principles should be used to build closer partnerships between Governments, aid providers and 
civil society, as part of the disaster prevention framework. At the onset of a disaster, the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) noted, the role of the Guiding Principles is in 
serving as a checklist to develop a response strategy which ensures that all proper planning and 
responses are carried out. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Challenges ahead 
</b></p>
<p>11. Despite the considerable achievements outlined above, major challenges to the realization 
of rights of IDPs remain. The number of people who have been forcibly displaced from their 
homes is estimated at 1 per cent of the world&#8217;s population. Moreover the number of IDPs 
continues to increase, primarily as a result of the growth in disaster-induced displacement related 
to climate change, but also because of situations of protracted displacement. These usually occur 
as a result of unresolved conflicts, lack of political will amongst national Governments, or 
insufficient support by international actors. In many countries, significant gaps between policies 
and practice are observed, especially in relation to durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>12. The conference noted that a majority of States affected by internal displacement remained 
unable or unwilling to take on their responsibilities for protecting IDPs. In the worse cases, the 
humanitarian space required to prevent displacement or to provide protection to IDPs is limited 
as a result of obstruction by Governments or non-State actors. In reality, the &#8220;responsibility to 
protect&#8221; concept has been of limited value in the protection of human rights of IDPs, as a number 
of States remain more committed to the doctrine of national sovereignty when it comes to 
dealing with internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>13. It was felt that the current legal and normative protection framework needed to be 
re-examined in the light of the new categories of forced migrants as a result of climate 
change-related disasters or long-term environment degradation. 
</p>
<p>14. With an increasing number of IDPs residing in urban areas, States and protection agencies 
must seek new, appropriate means of providing them with adequate protection and assistance, as 
their requirements are different from those of people in camp settings or in rural areas. The 
appropriate durable solutions also need to be considered, as urbanization affects choices and 
opportunities. For example, after IDPs have adapted to urban livelihoods, return to rural homes is 
often no longer an option. 
</p>
<p>15. With respect to international protection, humanitarian reform has contributed to better 
predictability in humanitarian responses. The fact that UNHCR now takes the lead in protecting 
IDPs in situations of armed conflict has significantly improved leadership of coordination of 
protection. Nevertheless, as stressed by the Emergency Relief Coordinator, humanitarian actors 
risk having their credibility undermined if greater care is not given to ensure equality of attention 
to different IDP populations in protracted crises. 
</p>
<p>16. In situations of disaster-induced displacement, protection leadership remains inadequate at 
the institutional level, as the responsibility for international coordination is divided between 
UNHCR, UNICEF and OHCHR, all of which have concerns about their capacity to take on this 
additional responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>17. <b>The Guiding Principles should be incorporated into national legislation so as to 
promote their implementation and accountability for the protection of IDPs. The 
publication of the Manual for Law and Policymakers on Protecting Internally Displaced 
Persons will be a useful resource to Governments as it provides a guide for policymakers to </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/10/13/Add.3 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p><b>bring relevant domestic laws in line with the Guiding Principles in a practical way. 
National authorities not only have a responsibility to develop legislative frameworks, but 
also to ensure that laws and policies are implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>18. <b>Effective partnerships are required to meet the twin challenges of preventing 
displacement and of ending displacement. These partnerships should be developed amongst 
States; between States and civil society; between States and financial institutions; between 
States, civil society and international protection and assistance agencies; and between 
international humanitarian agencies and development agencies. 
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>More efforts need to be made to prevent displacement, through effective disaster-risk 
reduction and emergency preparedness, and through conflict prevention. In parallel, 
sustained efforts need to be made to end displacement. Both areas of action should be 
accompanied by coordinated political commitment of all influential actors, as well as by 
adequate and predictable resourcing. 
</b></p>
<p>20. <b>Planning for durable solutions must start soon after displacement occurs so as to 
facilitate the transition from humanitarian assistance to development through effective 
early recovery strategies. Following the ongoing field testing of the framework for durable 
solutions, the focus should be on implementing the framework, from an early stage in the 
humanitarian response. 
</b></p>
<p>21. <b>Political dialogue, including peace negotiations, needs to ensure that IDPs&#8217; voices are 
represented and heard on all issues which affect them. Experience shows that early and 
sustained dialogue on issues relating to access to land, housing and property is essential to 
the identification of durable solutions. 
</b></p>
<p>22. <b>In disaster-prone countries, the Guiding Principles should be used to build closer 
partnerships between Governments, aid providers and civil society, as part of the disaster 
prevention framework. At the onset of a disaster, the Guiding Principles should be used as 
a checklist to develop a response strategy to ensure that all proper planning and response 
are carried out. 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>With an increasing number of IDPs residing in urban centres, States and protection 
agencies must seek new, appropriate means of providing them with adequate protection 
and assistance, as their requirements are different from those of people in camp settings or 
in rural areas. 
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>Finally, it is important to develop mechanisms to ensure the participation of IDPs in 
political processes, in decisions affecting their lives during displacement, and in developing 
and implementing solutions to bring an end to their displacement. Their participation is a 
precondition to the implementation of the Guiding Principles.
