2      ENERPLUS 2014 Q2 REPORT
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
I am pleased to report that Enerplus delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. We achieved record production of 104,000 BOE
per day which is the highest level in our 28 year history. We grew production in each of our four core areas. In particular, our North Dakota production grew by
14% from the first quarter of 2014.
Daily production was up 5% quarter over quarter, and 15% higher than the same period one year ago. Liquids production grew by 6% quarter over quarter
averaging 43,500 barrels per day driven by the significant growth in light oil from North Dakota. The Marcellus also continued to outperform increasing our total
natural gas volumes quarter over quarter.
As a result of the continued operational outperformance, we are increasing our annual average production guidance by 4,000 BOE per day. We now expect to
produce between 100,000 BOE per day and 104,000 BOE per day in 2014. We continue to expect to grow our liquids volumes throughout the year and are
maintaining our guidance of 44,000 barrels per day in 2014. Natural gas production is also expected to grow ahead of our expectations due to the performance of
the Marcellus. It also assumes the sale of 2,500 to 3,500 BOE per day of gas weighted production from non-core properties in Canada that we expect to close in
the fourth quarter.
Our capital spending is on track year-to-date. With the strength of our balance sheet and the anticipated proceeds from our non-core divestments we are
evaluating opportunities to modestly increase spending in our core areas. At this time, we are maintaining our capital spending guidance at $800 million but plan
to review spending levels in the third quarter. We also expect to see an improvement in operating costs and cash general and administrative costs. We are now
forecasting operating costs of $10.10 per BOE, down from $10.25 per BOE and cash general and administrative costs of $2.30 per BOE down from our previous
guidance of $2.45 per BOE.
During the quarter, the largest share of our capital spending continued to be allocated to Fort Berthold, where we directed almost half of our $204 million
investment. Our development activities in this area have significantly increased the value of this asset. As announced on June 18, 2014, our estimate of
economic contingent resources has increased by 250% to 136 million BOE. In addition, our drilling inventory increased by 125% and we now estimate
approximately 330 net drilling locations, representing 16 years of future drilling at our current two-rig pace. This presentation is available on our website.
Funds flow in the quarter grew by 4% compared to the same period in 2013. Compared to last quarter, our funds flow modestly declined due to a 20% drop in
realized natural gas prices. This is despite the growth in production and higher crude oil prices in the quarter. Both AECO and NYMEX gas prices declined and
we continued to see pressure on basis differentials in the Marcellus. Although our long-term pricing contracts shielded us somewhat, price differentials in the
Marcellus averaged US$1.50 per Mcf below NYMEX for the second quarter. Given the increasing supply outlook in the region, and our growing uncontracted
production volumes, we are revising our Marcellus price differential outlook and expect to average a discount of US$1.35 per Mcf to NYMEX for calendar 2014.
With rising crude oil prices, we continued to hedge our future production volumes in order to protect a portion of our funds flow, and support our capital spending
plans and dividend. We increased our hedges for 2015 significantly since the last quarter. We have now swapped half of our net oil production after royalties for
the first six months of 2015 at an average price of US$93.58 per barrel. For the second half of 2015, we've swapped 26% of our net oil production after royalties
at similar prices.
Our financial flexibility remains strong, ending the quarter with a trailing 12-month debt-to-funds flow ratio of 1.3x, unchanged from Q1 2014. We further
strengthened our financial position entering into private placement agreements for a US$200 million offering of senior, twelve-year amortizing, unsecured notes at
a fixed-rate coupon of 3.79%. We expect to close the offering in early September, and will use the proceeds to pay down our bank debt, replacing short-term,
floating interest rate debt with long-term debt at an attractive fixed interest rate.

Wells drilled during the quarter that are pending potential completion/tie-in or abandonment as at June 30, 2014.
Total wells brought on-stream during the quarter regardless of when they were drilled.
Asset Activity
Our second quarter capital spending totaled $204 million, down slightly from the first quarter. This investment saw us drill 14.3 net horizontal wells and place
19.3 net wells on-stream, the majority of which were in our Bakken/Three Forks and Marcellus plays.
At Fort Berthold, we invested $98.6 million in the quarter with 6.9 net wells drilled targeting a mix of Bakken and Three Forks horizons. We also completed and
brought on-stream 5.1 net wells, including our two top performing wells, one Bakken and one second bench Three Forks, which produced an average of
approximately 2,400 barrels per day per well in their first 30 days (cumulative production of over 70,000 barrels of oil each). Daily production increased by 14% at
Fort Berthold over the first quarter of 2014, averaging 20,800 BOE per day, a new high for this project.
In the Marcellus, our operations continued to be focused in Wyoming, Susquehanna, Bradford and Sullivan counties. During the quarter we invested $45.1 million,
drilling and bringing on-stream 5.9 net wells. Production averaged a record 189 MMcf per day, up 5% compared to the first quarter of the year, and more than
double from the production rate in the second quarter of 2013.
4      ENERPLUS 2014 Q2 REPORT
We also invested $28.1 million into our low-decline Canadian oil waterflood portfolio for both near and long-term growth, increasing production slightly quarter over
quarter. At Brooks, we continued to advance our 60-well drilling program targeting the Lower Mannville sands and we are moving forward with the second phase
of development in our polymer project at Medicine Hat.
Consistent with our on-going portfolio management, we expect to sell non-core gas weighted properties with production of 2,500 BOE to 3,500 BOE per day with
closing early in the fourth quarter.
Summary
We have delivered another quarter of consistent operational execution which is driving production growth and further confirming the sustainability of our business.
We are proud to be hitting record production levels while maintaining our capital discipline and strong financial position. We remain focused on achieving our
operating and financial targets and creating value for our shareholders.

MD&A
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("MD&A")
The following discussion and analysis of financial results is dated August 7, 2014 and is to be read in conjunction with:
•
•
•
the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Enerplus Corporation ("Enerplus" or the "Company") as at and for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 (the "Interim Financial Statements");
the audited consolidated financial statements of Enerplus as at December 31, 2013 and 2012 and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011
(the "Financial Statements"); and
our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the "Annual MD&A").
Where applicable, natural gas has been converted to barrels of oil equivalent ("BOE") based on 6 Mcf:1 BOE and oil and natural gas liquids ("NGL") have been
converted to thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent ("Mcfe") based on 0.167 bbl:1 Mcfe. BOE and Mcfe measures are based on an energy equivalent conversion
method primarily applicable at the burner tip and do not represent a value equivalent at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of
natural gas as compared to crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an
indication of value. Use of BOE and Mcfe in isolation may be misleading. All production volumes are presented on a Company interest basis, being the
Company's working interest share before deduction of any royalties paid to others, plus the Company's royalty interests unless otherwise stated. Company
interest is not a term defined in Canadian National Instrument 51-101– Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities ("NI 51-101") and may not be
comparable to information produced by other entities.
The following MD&A contains forward-looking information and statements. We refer you to the end of the MD&A under "Forward-Looking Information and
Statements" for further information.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Interim Financial Statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP") including the prior period comparatives. All amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, oil and gas sales are presented net of royalties in our Interim Financial Statements. Under IFRS, industry standard is to present
oil and gas sales before deduction of royalties and as such this MD&A presents production, oil and gas sales, and BOE measures on this basis to remain
comparable with our peers.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company utilizes the following terms for measurement within the MD&A that do not have a standardized meaning or definition as prescribed by U.S. GAAP
and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities:
"Netback" is used to evaluate operating performance of our crude oil and natural gas assets. The term netback is calculated as oil and natural gas sales revenue
(net of transportation), less royalties, production taxes and cash operating costs.
"Funds Flow" is used to analyze operating performance, leverage and liquidity. Funds flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities but before
asset retirement obligation expenditures and changes in non-cash operating working capital.

"Debt to Funds Flow Ratio" is used to analyze leverage and liquidity. The debt to funds flow ratio is calculated as total debt net of cash, divided by a trailing
12 months of funds flow.
"Adjusted Payout Ratio" is used to analyze operating performance, leverage and liquidity. We calculate our adjusted payout ratio as dividends to shareholders,
net of our Stock Dividend Program ("SDP") proceeds, plus capital spending (including office capital) divided by funds flow.
OVERVIEW
Our strong operational performance continued during the second quarter with production of 103,987 BOE/day, up 15% from the same period a year ago and up
5% from the prior quarter. Based on our year to date performance, we have increased our annual production guidance to 100,000-104,000 BOE/day from 96,000-
100,000 BOE/day and are on track to deliver approximately 5% crude oil and liquids growth, with production of 44,000 bbls/day. Our capital program remained on
track with spending of $204.4 million during the quarter and we are maintaining our capital spending guidance for 2014 of $800 million. With the strength of our
balance sheet and the anticipated proceeds from our non-core divestments, we are evaluating opportunities to modestly increase spending in our core areas and
plan to review spending levels in the third quarter.
Funds flow in the second quarter totaled $213.2 million compared to $204.7 million in the same period in 2013 and $220.5 million in the first quarter of 2014. The
decrease in funds flow compared to the first quarter of 2014 was primarily a result of lower natural gas prices and a wider Marcellus differential to NYMEX, offset
by higher crude oil prices. Operating costs and cash general and administrative costs came in better than expected at $10.09/BOE and $1.97/BOE, respectively,
and as a result we are lowering our 2014 guidance for operating costs and cash general and administrative to $10.10/BOE (from $10.25/BOE) and $2.30/BOE
(from $2.45/BOE). Our share price rose by approximately $4.80 or 22% during the second quarter, which led to an increase in our cash share-based
compensation expense. Accordingly, we are increasing our cash share-based compensation guidance to $0.60/BOE from $0.45/BOE.
We continue to maintain our financial flexibility and strong balance sheet. Our trailing 12 month debt to funds flow ratio was 1.3x and we had $706.7 million of
undrawn credit capacity at quarter end. In June, we signed agreements and priced a US$200.0 million private placement of senior unsecured notes with a
ten year average life and an interest rate of 3.79%. The debt issue is expected to close in early September and proceeds will be used to repay outstanding debt.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Production
Production increased by 5% to 103,987 BOE/day in the second quarter of 2014 from 98,821 BOE/day in the first quarter. Crude oil volumes grew by 6% due to
our ongoing development program in Fort Berthold, while natural gas volumes rose by 5% as a result of the strong performance of our Marcellus assets.
Compared to the second quarter of 2013, production increased 15% or 13,950 BOE/day. Natural gas volumes grew by approximately 25% due to our ongoing
development activity in the Marcellus, along with the December 2013 acquisition of additional working interests in our existing Marcellus properties. Over the
same period, our crude oil volumes increased by approximately 5% due to growth in our Fort Berthold production volumes and despite divestments of
approximately 2,100 BOE/day of non-core Canadian crude oil production in the second half of 2013.
Our production mix was unchanged from the previous quarter, with natural gas accounting for 58% of production and crude oil and liquids making up 42%
of production.

As a result of strong operational performance, we are increasing our annual average production guidance to 100,000-104,000 BOE/day from 96,000-
100,000 BOE/day, with crude oil and natural gas liquids expected to contribute approximately 44,000 bbls/day. This revised production guidance assumes
anticipated divestments of non-core gas weighted properties in Canada with production of approximately 2,500 to 3,500 BOE/day in the fourth quarter.

WTI prices increased by 4% during the second quarter of 2014 due to elevated tensions in the Middle East and decreased U.S. storage levels as refiners ran at
high utilization rates. In particular, balances at Cushing, the WTI pricing hub, decreased significantly during the quarter due to increased take away. The market
rallied strongly in June on fears of a potential supply disruption in Iraq, driving spot WTI prices to reach an intra-day high of US$107.73/bbl.
Crude oil differentials in Canada improved in the second quarter, with WCS averaging US$20.04/bbl below WTI and light sweet differentials averaging
US$6.13/bbl below WTI. The improvement in differentials was largely due to scheduled maintenance by oil sands producers that restricted production during the
period. We expect that incremental downstream pipeline capacity coming into service in the second half of 2014 will help support Canadian differential prices for
the remainder of the year. Our realized differential for Canadian crude oil improved during the second quarter averaging US$17.80/bbl below WTI compared to
US$20.70/bbl in the first quarter.
Our average realized Bakken differential widened during the quarter, to US$14.55/bbl below WTI from US$11.85/bbl in the first quarter, as our volumes being
shipped by rail grew during the quarter and rail netbacks fell.
Natural Gas
U.S. natural gas prices weakened throughout the second quarter as injections into storage facilities were much higher compared to the same period in 2013 due
to cooler than normal weather conditions across much of the key U.S. demand centres. In Canada, AECO differentials to NYMEX narrowed to US$0.38/Mcf
below NYMEX during the second quarter compared to US$0.63/Mcf in the first quarter.
8      ENERPLUS 2014 Q2 REPORT
We continue to maintain a balanced mix of AECO basis, month and day index price exposures in our Canadian gas portfolio, with our index exposure split almost
evenly between month and day AECO indices. During the first quarter, our realized differentials were positively impacted by the volatility of the AECO daily
index, while the second quarter saw no material differences between AECO month and day index.
Natural gas prices in the Marcellus weakened considerably in the second quarter as cooler temperatures resulted in lower than expected demand for gas-fired
power generation. When combined with an estimated net supply increase of over 1.5 Bcf/day in the Northeast U.S. relative to last year, regional spot price
differentials to NYMEX in the Marcellus widened from an average of approximately US$0.88/Mcf below NYMEX in April to as much as US$2.30/Mcf below
NYMEX in June. Approximately 56% of our Marcellus production during the quarter was exposed to these regional spot prices contributing to our realized
Marcellus price differential of US$1.50/Mcf below NYMEX for the quarter. We now expect an annual realized Marcellus price differential of US$1.35/Mcf below
NYMEX for 2014.
Foreign Exchange
The majority of our oil and gas sales are based on U.S. dollar denominated indices, and a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar increases the amount
of our realized sales. Following a rapid depreciation of the Canadian dollar in the first quarter of 2014, the dollar regained some ground in the second quarter
supported by higher oil prices and rising inflation. After reaching a low of 1.1251 near the close of the first quarter, the Canadian dollar rose to 1.0676 at
June 30, 2014. As the dollar weakened in the first quarter, we entered into costless collars on our oil and gas sales to protect a portion of our anticipated
revenues at favorable exchange rates.
Price Risk Management
We have a price risk management program that considers our overall financial position, the economics of our capital program and potential acquisitions. We have
increased our crude oil hedges significantly since last quarter. As of July 23, 2014 we have swapped an average of 21,000 bbls/day from July 1, 2014 to
December 31, 2014 at an average price of US$95.42/bbl, which represents approximately 68% of our forecasted net crude oil production after royalties. For the
first half of 2015, we have swapped 15,500 bbls/day at an average price of US$93.58/bbl, which represents approximately 50% of our forecasted net crude oil
production after royalties. Additionally, we have 8,000 bbls/d swapped for the second half of 2015 at an average price of US$93.86/bbl, which represents
approximately 26% of our forecasted net crude oil production after royalties.
We have entered into WCS differential swap positions for 2014 to manage our exposure to widening heavy crude oil differentials. These differential swaps have
been fixed at an average price of WTI less a fixed spread of US$21.00/bbl on 3,000 bbls/day from July through September of 2014 and 4,000 bbls/day from
October through December of 2014. We have also entered into 3,000 bbl/day of Brent-WTI differential swap positions for the remainder of 2014 to shift some of
our WTI price exposure to Brent based pricing, selling WTI at an average of 92.63% of Brent pricing.
As of July 23, 2014 we have downside protection on approximately 50% of our forecasted natural gas production after royalties for the remainder of 2014
consisting of NYMEX swaps at US$4.14/Mcf on 28% of production, NYMEX collars at US$4.30 – $5.08/Mcf on 11% of production and AECO swaps at an
average price of $4.25/Mcf on 11% of production. Overall for 2015, we have downside protection on approximately 23% of our forecasted annual natural gas
production after royalties comprised of NYMEX swaps at an average price of US$4.26/Mcf on 20% of production and NYMEX collars in the first quarter at
US$4.53 -$5.53/Mcf on 3% of forecasted annual production.
We have foreign exchange costless collars in place to hedge a floor exchange rate on a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated oil and gas sales and to
participate in some upside potential in the event the Canadian dollar continues to weaken. As of July 23, 2014 we have US$12.0 million per month hedged for the
remainder of 2014 at an average USD/CDN floor of 1.1046, ceiling of 1.1558 and conditional ceiling of 1.1198. Under these contracts, if the monthly foreign
exchange rate settles above the ceiling rate the conditional ceiling is used to determine the settlement amount. For 2015, we have US$12.0 million per month
hedged at an average USD/CDN floor of 1.1083, ceiling of 1.1900 and conditional ceiling of 1.1254. During the second quarter, we recorded cash gains of
$0.4 million and non-cash mark-to-market gains of $6.7 million on the contracts.

During the second quarter of 2014, we realized cash losses of $21.2 million on our crude oil contracts and $3.3 million on our natural gas contracts. In
comparison, during the second quarter of 2013, we realized cash gains of $11.0 million on our crude oil contracts and cash losses of $1.9 million on our natural
gas contracts. The cash losses realized in 2014 were a result of crude oil and natural gas prices rising above our fixed price swap positions. The crude oil cash
gains in 2013 were due to contracts that provided floor protection above market prices.
As the forward markets for crude oil and natural gas fluctuate, as new contracts are executed, and as existing contracts are realized, changes in fair value are
reflected as either a non-cash charge or gain to earnings. At the end of the second quarter of 2014 the fair value of our crude oil
10      ENERPLUS 2014 Q2 REPORT
and natural gas contracts represented net loss positions of $49.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 the
change in the fair value of our crude oil contracts represented losses of $24.8 million and $34.2 million, respectively, while the change in fair value of our natural
gas contracts represented a gain of $5.3 million and a loss of $2.6 million, respectively.

Royalties are paid to government entities, land owners and mineral rights owners. Production taxes include state production taxes, Pennsylvania impact fees,
freehold mineral taxes and Saskatchewan resource surcharges. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 royalties and production taxes increased to
$109.6 million and $216.7 million, respectively, from $81.4 million and $156.0 million for the same period a year ago. This upward trend is primarily due to higher
realized prices and increased production from higher royalty rate U.S. properties. Royalties and production taxes averaged 22% of oil and gas sales (net of
transportation) in 2014 compared to 20% in 2013.
We expect an average royalty and production tax rate of 23% in 2014.

Our operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 were $95.5 million or $10.09/BOE and $184.6 million or $10.06/BOE respectively. In
comparison, we had operating costs of $85.4 million or $10.42/BOE and $166.7 million or $10.39/BOE for the same periods in 2013. The current year operating
costs have decreased on a per BOE basis mainly due to the higher production from our lower cost Marcellus and Fort Berthold properties.
Based on our increased production guidance and continued focus on cost control, we are reducing our annual guidance for operating costs to $10.10/BOE from
$10.25/BOE.

Our crude oil properties accounted for 71% of our corporate netback before hedging for the year to date compared to 78% for the same period in 2013. Crude oil
netbacks per BOE increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 primarily due to higher realized crude oil
prices partially offset by higher royalties as a result of increased U.S. production. Natural gas netbacks per Mcfe decreased slightly during the second quarter
compared to the same period last year due to weakened gas prices and widening differentials. Strong gas prices in the first quarter led to an increase in the
natural gas netback for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.

Cash G&A expenses during the second quarter were in line with our expectations at $18.7 million or $1.97/BOE compared to $18.8 million or $2.29/BOE in the
second quarter of 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2014 cash G&A expenses were $39.2 million or $2.14/BOE compared to $43.5 million or $2.71/BOE
for the same period in 2013. The decrease during 2014 was mainly due to one-time charges recorded in the prior year associated with the departure of personnel.
Higher production volumes in 2014 have also helped to decrease our reported G&A on a per BOE basis.
Cash SBC expense increased during 2014 due to the increase in our share price, which had risen by 39% during the six months ended June 30, 2014. For the
second quarter of 2014, cash SBC expense was $10.7 million or $1.12/BOE compared to $3.7 million or $0.45/BOE during the second quarter of 2013. For the
six months ended June 30, 2014 cash SBC expense was $17.5 million or $0.95/BOE compared to $9.2 million or $0.57/BOE for the same period in the prior year.
We have hedged a portion of the outstanding cash settled units under our LTI plans at an average price of $14.78/share. As a result of the increase in our share
price we recorded non-cash mark-to-market gains of $4.7 million and $5.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively.
We are reducing our 2014 guidance for cash G&A expense to $2.30/BOE from $2.45/BOE based on our revised production guidance and continued focus on cost
control. We are also increasing our 2014 guidance for cash SBC to $0.60/BOE from $0.45/BOE based on our share price at June 30, 2014.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 we recorded total interest expense of $16.5 million and $31.7 million, respectively, compared to $14.8 million
and $29.2 million in the same periods in 2013. Despite a decreasing debt balance, interest on our senior notes increased slightly year over year due to the impact
of a weaker Canadian dollar on our U.S. dollar denominated interest payments.
Non-cash amounts recorded in interest expense include unrealized gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of the interest component of our cross
currency interest rate swap ("CCIRS") and amortization of deferred financing charges.
At June 30, 2014, after including our underlying derivatives, approximately 72% of our debt was based on fixed interest rates and 28% on floating interest rates.

We recorded a net foreign exchange gain of $7.2 million during the second quarter and a gain of $5.8 million year to date, compared to net losses of $2.2 million
and $6.5 million during the same periods in 2013.
On June 19, 2014 we made the final US$35.0 million principal repayment on our US$175.0 million senior notes and corresponding CCIRS settlement, which
resulted in a $15.8 million realized foreign exchange loss. The remaining realized losses during the quarter related to day-to-day transactions denominated in
foreign currencies.
Unrealized foreign exchange gains in the quarter related to the translation of our U.S. dollar debt and working capital and the reversal of cumulative mark-to-
market losses on the final settlement of our CCIRS.

Capital spending for the second quarter totaled $204.4 million compared to $139.7 million during the same period in 2013. We continue to focus our spending on
our core development areas. Crude oil spending for the quarter included $98.6 million at Fort Berthold and $28.1 million on our Canadian waterflood properties.
Natural gas spending included $45.1 million in the Marcellus and $31.0 million on our Deep Basin assets.
We completed minor property and land acquisitions totaling $3.2 million during the quarter. In the second quarter of 2013 we spent $51.7 million, which included
$34.0 million for the acquisition of an incremental 50% working interest in our Pouce Coupe light oil waterflood property as well as $16.7 million on land
acquisitions around our existing acreage in the U.S.
Property dispositions of $71.3 million in the second quarter of 2013 included the sale of our Taylorton and Turner Valley non-core oil asset for proceeds of
$57.2 million along with other minor dispositions totaling $14.1 million.
ENERPLUS 2014 Q2 REPORT      15
We are maintaining our capital spending guidance at $800 million. However, given the strength of our balance sheet and anticipated divestment proceeds, we are
evaluating opportunities in our core areas and may modestly increase spending in the second half of the year.

DDA&A of property, plant and equipment ("PP&E") is recognized using the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. For the three and six months
ended June 30, 2014 DDA&A decreased to $148.7 million and $280.8 million, respectively, compared to $160.5 million and $306.7 million during the same
periods in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to significant reserve additions for the year ended December 31, 2013 that lowered our depletion rate in 2014.
Asset Retirement Obligation
In connection with our operations we incur abandonment and reclamation costs related to assets such as surface leases, wells, facilities and pipelines. Total
asset retirement obligations included on our balance sheet are estimated by Enerplus based on our net ownership interest, anticipated costs to abandon and
reclaim and the timing of the costs to be incurred in future periods. We have estimated the net present value of our asset retirement obligation to be
$288.6 million at June 30, 2014 compared to $291.8 million at December 31, 2013.

We recorded total tax expense of $16.5 million and $48.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to $21.7 million and
$24.9 million for the same periods in 2013. For the three months ended June 30, 2014 the decrease in total tax expense relates primarily to the decrease in net
income for tax purposes. For the six months ended June 30, 2014 higher revenues caused net income for tax purposes to increase resulting in an increase in
tax expense.
Our current tax is comprised mainly of Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") payable with respect to our U.S. subsidiary. We expect to recover AMT in future years
as an offset to regular U.S. income taxes otherwise payable. Based on current commodity prices and assuming no acquisition and divestment activity, we
expect to pay U.S. cash taxes of between 3% to 5% of our U.S. funds flow for 2014 and 2015. We expect to continue to pay U.S. AMT through 2018 with the
rate gradually increasing to approximately 15% over that time. We currently do not expect to pay material cash taxes in Canada until after 2018.

Oil and gas sales increased in the second quarter of 2014 due to higher production volumes which were partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices
compared to the first quarter. Oil and gas sales grew during 2013 with increasing production volumes. Net income grew in 2014 compared to 2013 from increased
production and realized prices. Net income in 2012 was lower due to asset impairments recorded during the year.
18      ENERPLUS 2014 Q2 REPORT
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity through the second quarter. At June 30, 2014 we had a conservative trailing 12 month debt
to cash flow ratio of 1.3x and approximately $706.7 million of undrawn credit capacity. On June 19, 2014 we made the final principal payment on our
US$175.0 million senior notes and the related CCIRS settlement. During the quarter, we entered into agreements to issue US$200.0 million of senior unsecured
notes on a private placement basis. The notes, which are expected to close on September 3, 2014, have a twelve year amortizing term with a ten year average
life and a fixed interest rate of 3.79%. We plan to use the proceeds to repay our short-term, floating interest rate bank debt.
Our adjusted payout ratio, calculated as dividends (net of SDP proceeds) plus capital and office spending, divided by funds flow, increased to 120% and 119%
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, compared to 89% and 106% for the same periods in 2013. Although funds flow increased by 4%
and 15% for the three and six months ended June 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013, we saw a proportionately larger increase in our capital spending
program and a decrease in our SDP participation over the same period.
Total debt net of cash at June 30, 2014 was $1,067.6 million, including current portion, compared to $1,022.3 million at December 31, 2013. Total debt was
comprised of $293.3 million of bank indebtedness and $776.3 million of senior notes, less $2.0 million in cash. Our working capital deficiency, excluding cash
and current deferred financial and tax assets and credits, increased slightly during the quarter to $251.2 million from $226.1 million. Although receivables
increased due to higher production levels, this was offset by a higher current portion of long-term debt related to senior note maturities in June of 2015. We
expect to finance our working capital deficit through funds flow and our bank credit facility.
Our key leverage ratios are detailed below:

At June 30, 2014 we were in compliance with all covenants under our bank credit facility and senior notes. Our bank credit facility and senior note purchase
agreements have been filed as material documents on our SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 we recorded dividends to our shareholders of $55.2 million ($0.27/share) and $110.1 million ($0.54/share),
respectively, compared to $54.0 million ($0.27/share) and $107.8 million ($0.54/share) for the same periods in 2013. For the first six months of 2014, dividend
payments including SDP amounted to 25% of our funds flow of $433.7 million. We will continue to assess our dividend levels with respect to anticipated funds
flow, debt levels, capital spending plans and capital market conditions and do not anticipate any changes to our dividend at this time.
Participation in the SDP is optional allowing our shareholders to continue to receive cash dividends unless they elect to receive stock dividends. As a result of
our improved sustainability and strong balance sheet, in April of this year we eliminated the 5% discount with the intention of reducing shareholder dilution.
Subsequently, our participation rate in the SDP decreased significantly to approximately 9% where we had
ENERPLUS 2014 Q2 REPORT      19
previously been averaging 23%. Participation in the SDP for July was approximately $1.7 million compared to approximately $4.2 million per month in the
first quarter.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a – 15 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as defined in Canada under National Instrument 52-109,
Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Enerplus
Corporation have concluded that, as at June 30, 2014, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective. There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period beginning on April 1, 2014 and ending June 30, 2014 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND STATEMENTS
This MD&A contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws ("forward-looking
information"). The use of any of the words "expect", "anticipate", "continue", "estimate", "guidance", "objective", "ongoing", "may", "will", "project", "should",
"believe", "plans", "intends", "budget", "strategy" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking information. In particular, but without limiting the
foregoing, this MD&A contains forward-looking information pertaining to the following: expected 2014 average production volumes and the anticipated production
mix; the proportion of our anticipated oil and gas production that is hedged; the results from our drilling program and the timing of related production; future oil and
natural gas prices and differentials and our commodity risk management programs; expectations regarding our realized oil and natural gas prices; future royalty
rates on our production and future production taxes; anticipated cash and non-cash G&A, share-based compensation and financing expenses; operating costs;
capital spending levels in 2014 and its impact on our production level; potential future asset impairments; the amount of our future abandonment and reclamation
costs and asset retirement obligations; future environmental expenses; our future U.S. cash taxes; deferred income taxes, our tax pools and the time at which
we may pay Canadian cash taxes and regular U.S. taxes; future debt and working capital levels and debt-to-funds-flow ratio and adjusted payout ratio, financial
capacity, liquidity and capital resources to fund capital spending and working capital requirements; the amount and timing of future cash dividends that we may
pay to our shareholders; the amount and timing of future debt issuances and expected use of proceeds therefrom; and future dispositions and acquisitions,
including production volumes associated therewith.
The forward-looking information contained in this MD&A reflects several material factors, expectations and assumptions including, without limitation: that we will
conduct our operations and achieve results of operations as anticipated; that our development plans will achieve the expected results; the general continuance of
current or, where applicable, assumed industry conditions; the continuation of assumed tax, royalty and regulatory regimes; the accuracy of the estimates of our
reserve and resource volumes; commodity price and cost assumptions; the continued availability of adequate debt and/or equity financing and funds flow to fund
our capital, operating and working capital requirements, and dividend payments as needed; the continued availability and sufficiency of our funds flow and
availability under our bank credit facility to fund our working capital deficiency; the availability of third party services; and the extent of our liabilities. We believe
the material factors, expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking information are reasonable but no assurance can be given that these factors,
expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct.
The forward-looking information included in this MD&A is not a guarantee of future performance and should not be unduly relied upon. Such information involves
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-
looking information including, without limitation: changes in commodity prices; changes in realized prices of Enerplus' products; changes in the demand for or
supply of our products; unanticipated operating results, results from our capital spending activities or production declines; changes in tax or environmental laws,
royalty rates or other regulatory matters; changes in our capital plans or by third party operators of our properties; increased debt levels or debt service
requirements; inaccurate estimation of our oil and gas reserve and resource volumes; limited, unfavourable or a lack of access to capital markets; increased
costs; a lack of adequate insurance coverage; the impact of competitors; reliance on industry partners and third party service providers; a failure to complete
planned asset dispositions on the terms anticipated or at all; and certain other risks detailed from time to time in our public disclosure documents (including,
without limitation, those risks and contingencies described under "Risk Factors and Risk Management" in this MD&A and in our other public filings).
The forward-looking information contained in this MD&A speaks only as of the date of this MD&A, and we do not assume any obligation to publicly update or
revise such forward-looking information to reflect new events or circumstances, except as may be required pursuant to applicable laws.

Enerplus is exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to its U.S. operations, and U.S. dollar denominated senior notes and working capital. Additionally,
Enerplus' crude oil sales and a portion of its natural gas sales are based on U.S. dollar indices. Enerplus manages currency risk relating to its senior notes
through the derivative instruments detailed below.
Foreign Exchange Derivatives:
During the six months ended June 30, 2014, Enerplus entered into foreign exchange collars to hedge a portion of its foreign exchange exposure on U.S. dollar
denominated oil and gas sales. The following contracts are outstanding at July 23, 2014:
Instrument Type(1)
Jun 1, 2014 – Dec 31, 2014

Transactions with a common term have been aggregated and presented at average USD/CDN foreign exchange rates.
If the USD/CDN average monthly rate settles above the ceiling rate the settlement amount is determined based on the conditional ceiling.
During 2007 Enerplus entered into foreign exchange swaps on US$54.0 million of notional debt at an average US$/CDN$ exchange rate of 1.02. At
June 30, 2014, following the third settlement, Enerplus had US$21.6 million of remaining notional debt swapped. These foreign exchange swaps mature between
October 2014 and October 2015 in conjunction with the remaining principal repayments on the US$54.0 million senior notes.
During 2011 Enerplus entered into foreign exchange swaps on US$175.0 million of notional debt at approximately par. These foreign exchange swaps mature
between June 2017 and June 2021 in conjunction with the principal repayments on the US$225.0 million senior notes.
Interest Rate Risk:
At June 30, 2014, approximately 72% of Enerplus' debt was based on fixed interest rates and 28% was based on floating interest rates. At June 30, 2014
Enerplus did not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding.
Equity Price Risk:
Enerplus is exposed to equity price risk in relation to its cash settled long-term incentive plans detailed in Note 14.
Enerplus has entered into various equity swaps maturing between 2013 and 2016 and has effectively fixed the future settlement cost on 995,000 shares at a
weighted average price of $14.78 per share.
(ii) Credit Risk
Credit risk represents the financial loss Enerplus would experience due to the potential non-performance of counterparties to its financial instruments. Enerplus is
exposed to credit risk mainly through its joint venture, marketing and financial counterparty receivables.
Enerplus mitigates credit risk through credit management techniques, including conducting financial assessments to establish and monitor counterparties' credit
worthiness, setting exposure limits, monitoring exposures against these limits and obtaining financial assurances such as letters of credit, parental guarantees,
or third party credit insurance where warranted. Enerplus monitors and manages its concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis.
Enerplus' maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date consists of the carrying amount of its non-derivative financial assets and the fair value of its
derivative financial assets. At June 30, 2014 approximately 73% of Enerplus' marketing receivables were with companies considered investment grade.
ENERPLUS 2014 Q2 REPORT      35
At June 30, 2014 approximately $1.1 million or 0.5% of Enerplus' total accounts receivable were aged over 120 days and considered past due. The majority of
these accounts are due from various joint venture partners. Enerplus actively monitors past due accounts and takes the necessary actions to expedite collection,
which can include withholding production, netting amounts off future payments or seeking other remedies including legal action. Should Enerplus determine that
the ultimate collection of a receivable is in doubt, it will provide the necessary provision in its allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding charge to
earnings. If Enerplus subsequently determines an account is uncollectible the account is written off with a corresponding charge to the allowance account.
Enerplus' allowance for doubtful accounts balance at June 30, 2014 was $2.8 million (December 31, 2013 – $2.8 million).
(iii) Liquidity Risk & Capital Management
Liquidity risk represents the risk that Enerplus will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they become due. Enerplus mitigates liquidity risk through
actively managing its capital, which it defines as debt (net of cash) and shareholders' capital. Enerplus' objective is to provide adequate short and longer term
liquidity while maintaining a flexible capital structure to sustain the future development of its business. Enerplus strives to balance the portion of debt and equity
in its capital structure given its current oil and natural gas assets and planned investment opportunities.
Management monitors a number of key variables with respect to its capital structure, including debt levels, capital spending plans, dividends, access to capital
markets, as well as acquisition and divestment activity.
16) CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
Enerplus is subject to various legal claims and actions arising in the normal course of business. Although the outcome of such claims and actions cannot be
predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect these matters to have a material impact on the interim Consolidated Financial Statements. In instances
where the Company determines that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, an accrual is recorded.
During the quarter, Enerplus entered into an agreement to extend its Calgary head office lease for an additional 5 years through 2024, which including operating
costs, is expected to amount to approximately $57 million over the additional term.
