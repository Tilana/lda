REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
For  the half-year  ended  30  June 2016 the  Company  and  its  Controlled  Entities  (“Controlled  Entity”)  made a loss  of
$357,345.
CYU is maintaining a twofold strategy of firstly assessing significant project acquisition opportunities (both locally and
overseas) and secondly, reviewing its exploration holdings in the Mount Isa region of north-west Queensland.
JCHX Group Participation
In the half-year ended 30 June 2016, the Company welcomed the introduction of a new substantial shareholder, JCHX
Group (“JCHX”). JCHX controls one of China’s largest mining service companies, JCHX Mining Management Co., Ltd,
which currently manages 33 mining operations throughout China, and other parts of the world, including 4 projects in
Zambia,  Africa.  Chairman  of  JCHX,  Mr  Xiancheng  Wang  was  also  appointed  as  a  non-executive  director  of  the
Company.
Acquisition Opportunities
The Company is continuing to pursue certain acquisition and project opportunities that are consistent with its objective
of becoming a mid-tier copper producer. Due diligence reviews and ongoing (but as yet incomplete) negotiations are
proceeding.
Mount Isa Activities
The Company is continuing to review the nature and extent of further exploration activities within its tenure holdings in
the Mount Isa region. During the half-year period to 30 June 2016, the Company:
·
Terminated its existing Joint Venture with Goldsearch Limited, thereby securing a further 20% interest in
the JV tenures, subject to a 1.75% net smelter royalty;
·  Agreed  with  Elementos  Limited  to  terminate  the  existing  Millennium  farm-in  Joint  Venture,  with  CYU
relinquishing all  interests in the various  EPM and  Mining Leases  that  formed part  of the Millennium  JV;
and
·  Made application to the Qld Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Mines  to renew  two  existing tenure
holdings – EPMs 14022 and 12205.
FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS
The Company is reliant on future successful capital raisings to realise the benefits of the capitalised exploration costs.
Based  on  the  success  of  prior  capital  raisings  and the  progress  with current  projects,  the  Directors  are  confident  of
securing funds if and when necessary to meet the Company’s obligations as and when they fall due.
EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE
There have been no events since 30 June 2016 that impact upon the financial report.

Chinalco Yunnan Copper Resources Limited
Consolidated Financial Report for the Half-Year Ended 30 June 2016
NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a)  Reporting Entity
Chinalco Yunnan Copper Resources Limited (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in Australia.  The consolidated
interim financial report of the Company as at and for the six months ended 30 June 2016 comprises the Company and its
controlled entities (together referred to as the “Consolidated Entity”).
b)  Statement of Compliance
The consolidated interim financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance
with AASB 134 Interim Financial  Reporting and the Corporations Act  2001. The Company is a for-profit  entity for the
purpose of preparing the interim financial report.
The consolidated interim financial report does not include all of the information required for a full annual financial report,
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated annual financial report of the Consolidated Entity as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2015.
This consolidated interim financial report was approved by the Board of Directors on 1 August 2016.
New and revised standards have been issued by the AASB and are effective for the half-year;  however there are no
material  changes  to  the policies  that  affect  the  recognition  or  measurement  of  the  results  or  financial  position  of  the
Consolidated Entity.
Accounting Policies
With the exception of the below, the accounting policies and methods of computation applied by the Consolidated Entity
in the consolidated interim financial report are the same as those applied by the Consolidated Entity in its consolidated
financial report as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
(i)
Financial Instruments: Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either not suitable to be classified into other
categories  of  financial  assets  due  to  their  nature,  or  they  are  designated  as  such  by  management.  They  comprise
investments in the equity of other entities where there is neither a fixed maturity nor fixed or determinable payments.
They are subsequently measured at fair value with changes in such fair value (ie gains or losses) recognised in other
comprehensive income (except for impairment losses). When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or
loss pertaining to that asset previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified into profit or loss.
Available-for-sale financial assets are included in non-current assets where they are expected to be sold more than 12
months after the end of the reporting period. All other financial assets are classified as current assets.
As at 30 June 2016 CYU hold 500,000 shares in Hammer Metals Limited (ASX: HMX) acquired in exchange for
surrendering tenement rights from the Millennium Joint Venture. These shares were valued at period end using the
closing share price for Hammer Metals Limited on 30 June 2016, consistent with a Level 1 measurement technique.

Chinalco Yunnan Copper Resources Limited
Consolidated Financial Report for the Half-Year Ended 30 June 2016
NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
c)  Going Concern
As at 30 June 2016 the Consolidated Entity had cash reserves of $965,071, and net assets of $5,185,075. The ability of
the Consolidated Entity to continue as a going concern is principally dependent upon  the following:
· 
·
the ability of the Company to raise additional capital in the future; and
the successful exploration and subsequent exploitation of the Consolidated Entity’s tenements.
These conditions give rise to material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Consolidated Entity’s ability
to continue as a going concern.
Based  on  the  success  of  previous  capital  raisings  combined  with  the  ongoing  support  of  its  key  shareholders,  the
potential to attract a farm-in partners for projects and the potential sale of the current portfolio of exploration assets held,
the  Directors  have prepared  the financial  statements  on  a going concern  basis,  which contemplates  the  continuity  of
normal  business activities and the realisation of assets and discharge of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors are confident of securing funds as and when necessary to meet the Consolidated Entity’s obligations as
and when they fall due.
Should the Consolidated Entity be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be required to realise its assets and
extinguish its liabilities other than in the ordinary course of business, and at amounts that differ from those stated in the
financial statements.
This financial report does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts  or  the  amounts  or  classification  of  liabilities  and  appropriate  disclosures  that  may  be  necessary  should  the
Consolidated Entity be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 2   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS – DECONSOLIDATION OF SANMU
On 1 January 2015, CYU relinquished all and any control of Yunnan Copper San Mu Mining Industry Co Ltd (Sanmu) to
Yunnan Copper Industry (Group) Co Ltd (YCI).
All of the representative directors of CYU that were appointed to the Board of Sanmu were removed as directors prior to
1 January 2015 and since that time  YCI has controlled all activities and the direction of Sanmu, and its Laos subsidiaries
at both an operational and corporate level.
CYU is not under any future obligation to contribute additional funds towards Sanmu as part of the dissolution process or
for any other purpose.
Based on the above, CYU was deemed to have lost control of on 1 January 2015, and the Company’s investment was
reclassified to an Investment accounted for using the equity method on that date.

As a result of the deconsolidation of Sanmu,  CYU derecognized $79,402 in cash and cash equivalents in its Balance
Sheet.    This  impact  is  shown  as  an  outflow  of  cash  in  Cash  Flow  Statement  under  the  category Cash  Flows  from
Investing Activities.
Reclassification of investment
CYU’s 51% equity interest Sanmu was reclassified to an Investment accounted for using the equity method on 1 January
2015.
Sanmu had a net asset deficiency of $314,417 on that date.  CYU’s share of that deficiency was $160,353.  At the time
of the loss of control and consistent with Sanmu’s net asset deficiency, the fair value of the equity accounted investment
was determined to be $Nil.  As CYU is not under any future obligation to contribute additional funds towards Sanmu, it
has not recorded any interest in Sanmu’s loss for the periods ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016.

During the half-year ended 30 June 2016, the Company agreed with, China Yunnan Copper (Australia) Investment and
Development  Co  Ltd  (CYC  -  substantial  shareholder),  that  CYC  would  reimburse  the  Company  for  costs  incurred  in
connection with due diligence activity associated with a proposed acquisition in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The

whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes
us believe that the financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including:
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Chinalco Yunnan
Copper Resources Limited and the entities it controlled during the half-year, ASRE 2410 requires that
we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001. We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence
Declaration, a copy of which is included in the Directors’ Report.

Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us
believe that the half-year financial report of Chinalco Yunnan Copper Resources Limited is not in
accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:
a)
b)
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and
of its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations
Regulations 2001.
Material Uncertainty Regarding Continuation as a Going Concern
Without qualifying our conclusion, we draw attention to Note 1(c) in the half-year financial report
which describes the principal conditions that raise doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a
going concern.  As a result of these matters, there is significant uncertainty whether the entity will
continue as a going concern, and therefore whether it will realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities
in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial report. The half-year
financial report does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or to the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the entity not continue as a going concern.
