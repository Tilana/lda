Chairman's Statement
In the last six months despite the very tough market conditions for the resource sector, the
Company has delivered a number of significant milestones at Araguaia which we are developing
as the next major nickel project in Brazil.
We have been able to continue the critical aspect of permitting for the project, and in this respect
we were delighted to receive the LP in June for the mining and beneficiation plant to produce
ferronickel.  This is a significant milestone which demonstrates the viability of Araguaia and
represents the State Government approval for the planned project.  The next stage is to advance
the permitting process towards the award of the Installation Licence ('LI') which allows
construction to commence.  The Pará State Government considers Araguaia to be a key
economic driver for the southern part of the State with the potential to provide approximately
1,100 jobs in the construction phase, and around 500 jobs during the operational phase of the
mine.  We have also received strong community support for the project as evidenced in the 2015
Public Hearing in Conceição do Araguaia which received a high turnout at the meeting (+1,000
people) and the overriding support at the local and state level is a key factor for the future
success of Araguaia.
The award of the LP is timely as we are in the final stages of completing the new Pre-Feasibility
Study based on the enlarged project combining Araguaia with the GAP project following our
acquisition of the project from Glencore.  The combination of the two projects creates one of the
largest nickel saprolite resources globally.  The PFS will include a revised Mineral Resource,
data from the full scale metallurgical pilot plant campaign completed in Q3 2015, and updated
capital and operating costs.  It is our aim, with the completion of the PFS, to show that Horizonte
owns a Tier 1 asset with robust economics even at the current low nickel prices with a proven
process route for the commercial production of ferronickel.  If we are able to deliver a project at
the lower end of the cost curve combined with significant resource upside and optionality, we will
be well positioned for the upturn in the nickel markets which are forecast to rise further over the
coming years from the lows of early 2016.
Another key achievement post period end was the completion of the Glencore transaction.  This
was a compelling transaction in terms of the purchase price for Horizonte and provides massive
flexibility in the way the project is developed.  Following the delivery of the PFS, it is our plan to
advance to full Feasibility Study and we intend to commence this process later in the year.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support and we
look forward to keeping the market updated with our progress during an exciting second half of
2016.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1.  General information
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (together 'the Group') is the exploration
and development of precious and base metals. There is no seasonality or cyclicality of the
Group's operations.
The Company's shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock
Exchange (AIM) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). The Company is incorporated and
domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 26 Dover Street London
W1S 4LY.
2.  Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting
policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards and in accordance with
International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The condensed interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the
year ended 31 December 2015, which have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements set out above do not constitute
statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared on
a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Statutory
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were approved by the Board of
Directors on 15 March 2016 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the
auditors on those financial statements was unqualified.
The condensed  consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have not been
audited or reviewed by the Company's auditor, BDO LLP.
Going concern
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the
Group to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2016.
Risks and uncertainties
The Board continuously assesses and monitors the key risks of the business. The key risks that
could affect the Group's medium term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks have
not substantially changed from those set out in the Group's 2015 Annual Report and Financial
Statements, a copy of which is available on the Group's website: www.horizonteminerals.com
and on Sedar: www.sedar.com The key financial risks are liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk,
credit risk, price risk and interest rate risk.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items
subject to such estimates are set out in note 4 of the Group's 2015 Annual Report and Financial
Statements. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the
interim period.
3.  Significant accounting policies
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain of the subsidiaries' assets and
liabilities to fair value for consolidation purposes.
The same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation have been followed in
these condensed consolidated interim financial statements as were applied in the preparation of
the Group's Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
4  Segmental reporting
The Group operates principally in the UK and Brazil, with operations managed on a project by
project basis within each geographical area. Activities in the UK are mainly administrative in
nature whilst the activities in Brazil relate to exploration and evaluation work. The reports used by
the chief operating decision maker are based on these geographical segments.

5  Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
Contingent Consideration payable to the former owners of Teck Cominco Brasil S.A.
Contingent consideration payable to the former owners of Teck Cominco Brasil S.A. has a
carrying value of £2,637,724 at 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: £ 2,452,538). The fair value of the
contingent consideration arrangement with the former owners of Teck Cominco Brasil S.A. was
estimated at the acquisition date according to when future taxable profits against which the tax
losses may be utilised were anticipated to arise. The fair value estimates were based on the
current rates of tax on profits in Brazil of 34%. A discount factor of 7.0% was applied to the future
dates at which the tax losses will be utilised and consideration paid.
As at 30 June 2016, there was a finance expense of £83,000 (30 June 2015: £161,963)
recognised in finance costs within the Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income in
respect of this contingent consideration arrangement, as the discount applied to the contingent
consideration at the date of acquisition was unwound.
The cash flow model used to estimate the contingent consideration was adjusted, to take into
account changed assumptions in the timing of cash flows as derived from the Pre-Feasibility
Study as published by the Group in March 2014. The key assumptions underlying the cash flow
model derived from the Pre-Feasibility Study as published by the Group in March 2014 are
unchanged as at 30 June 2016, other than that in 2015 the assumed date for commencement of
commercial production was revised from 2017 to 2019. The change in the fair value of contingent
consideration payable to the former owners of Teck Cominco Brasil S.A. generated a charge to
profit or loss of £ 189,971 for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: £55,063
charge) due to changes in the functional currency in which the liability is payable.
Contingent Consideration payable to Xstrata Brasil Mineração Ltda
The contingent consideration payable to Xstrata Brasil Mineração Ltda has a carrying value of £
3,170,131 at 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: £ nil). It comprises two elements: US$1,000,000 due
after the date of issuance of a joint feasibility study for the combined Enlarged Project areas and
to be satisfied by shares or cash, together with US$5,000,000 consideration in cash as at the
date of first commercial production from any of the resource areas within the Enlarged Project
area. The key assumptions underlying the treatment of the contingent consideration the
US$5,000,000 are as per those applied to the contingent consideration payable to the former
owners of Teck Cominco Brasil S.A.
As at 30 June 2016, there was a finance expense of £89,925 (2014: £nil) recognised in finance
costs within the Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of this contingent consideration
arrangement, as the discount applied to the contingent consideration at the date of acquisition
was unwound.
The change in the fair value of contingent consideration payable to Xstrata Brasil Mineração Ltda
generated a charge to profit or loss of £273,330 for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (30 June
2015: £nil) due to changes in the functional currency in which the liability is payable.

No dividend has been declared or paid by the Company during the six months ended 30 June
2016 (2015: nil).
9  Earnings per share
The calculation of the basic loss per share of 0.142 pence for the 6 months ended 30 June 2016
(30 June 2015 loss per share: 0.235 pence) is based on the loss attributable to the equity holders
of the Company of £ (956,174) for the six month period ended 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015:
£(1,159,181)) divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period of
671,204,378 (weighted average number of shares for the 6 months ended 30 June 2015:
492,427,105).
The calculation of the basic loss per share of 0.093 pence for the 3 months ended 30 June 2016
(30 June 2015 loss per share: 0.041 pence) is based on the loss attributable to the equity holders
of the Company of £ (624,074) for the three month period ended 30 June 2016 (3 months ended
30 June 2014: £ 203,146) divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the
period of 671,204,378 (weighted average number of shares for the 3 months ended 30 June
2015: 492,427,105).
The basic and diluted loss per share is the same, as the effect of the exercise of share options
would be to decrease the loss per share.
Details of share options that could potentially dilute earnings per share in future periods are
disclosed in the notes to the Group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended
31 December 2015 and in note 10 below.
10  Issue of Share Options
No share options were issued in the first 6 months of 2016.
On 10 June 2015, the Company awarded 13,250,000 share options to Directors and senior
management. All of the share options have an exercise price of 4.00 pence. One third of the
options are exercisable from 10 December 2015, one third from 10 June 2016 and one third from
10 December 2016.
11  Ultimate controlling party
The Directors believe there to be no ultimate controlling party.
12  Related party transactions
The nature of related party transactions of the Group has not changed from those described in the
Group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
13  Events after the reporting period
On August 3rd 2016 the Company announced the transfer to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company of the remaining two licences that make up the Glencore Araguaia nickel project
('GAP'). This completes the licence transfer under the agreement ('Asset Purchase Agreement')
to acquire GAP from Xstrata Brasil Exploraçâo Mineral Ltda ('Xstrata'), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Glencore, as announced by the Company on 28 September 2015.
Following the registration by the National Department of Mineral Production of Brazil of the
transfer of the outstanding GAP licences from Xstrata to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company and pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Horizonte has now completed the
second and final allotment to Xstrata of Initial  Consideration Shares.
Further to the above, the Company has issued and allotted 50,729,922 new Ordinary Shares to
Xstrata, being the Initial Consideration Shares equivalent in value to US$1,340,000. These
closing Initial Consideration Shares were issued at a price of 1.99 pence (the "Issue Price").  In
accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement the Issue Price was equal to the five
day weighted average price per Ordinary Share on AIM, taken on the business day when the
transfer of the remaining GAP licences was confirmed, and converted at a rate of exchange as
set out in the Asset Purchase Agreement.  This allocation of shares signifies the completion of
the issuance of the Initial Consideration Shares to a total value of US$2,000,000.  Initial
Consideration Shares were previously issued under the Asset Purchase Agreement to the value
of US$660,000 in November 2015 following transfer of the first GAP licence to a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company.

These Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements were approved by the Board of
Directors on 9 August 2016.

events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
