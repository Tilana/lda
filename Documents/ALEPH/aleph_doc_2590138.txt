CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.Basis of Presentation
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Chesapeake
Energy Corporation ("Chesapeake" or the "Company") and its subsidiaries were prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and
include the accounts of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which
Chesapeake has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany accounts and balances have been
eliminated. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with the instructions to
Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all disclosures required for financial statements
prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
This Form 10-Q relates to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 (the "Current Quarter"
and the “Current Period”, respectively) and the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 (the
"Prior Quarter" and the “Prior Period”, respectively). Chesapeake's annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 ("2015 Form 10-K") includes certain definitions and a
summary of significant accounting policies that should be read in conjunction with this Form 10-
Q. All material adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) which, in the
opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods
have been reflected. The results for the Current Quarter and the Current Period are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
Risks and Uncertainties
Our ability to grow, make capital expenditures and service our debt depends primarily upon the
prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) we sell. Substantial
expenditures are required to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans.
Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been very volatile, and may be subject to wide
fluctuations in the future. The substantial decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices from 2014
levels has negatively affected the amount of cash we have available for capital expenditures and
debt service.
We face other significant risks to our business, including:
In the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, capitalized
costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded our full cost ceiling, resulting in an impairment
in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties of $1.045 billion, $5.015 billion, $1.898
billion and $9.991 billion, respectively. Based on the first-day-of-the-month prices we have
received over the 11 months ended August 1, 2016, as well as the current strip price for
September 2016, we expect to record downward reserve revisions and another write-down in
the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in the third quarter of 2016, although the
amount of impairment could be mitigated by the impact of anticipated divestitures in the third
quarter of 2016 or other factors.
Oil, natural gas and NGL prices have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and quantities of reserves that may be economically produced. If
depressed prices persist throughout 2017 and we are unable to restructure or refinance our debt
or generate additional liquidity through other actions, our ability to comply with the financial
•
•
covenants under our revolving credit facility and to make scheduled debt payments could be
adversely impacted.
As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $8.679 billion principal amount of debt outstanding,
of which $1.382 billion matures or can be put to us in 2017 (including $337 million of maturities
in January 2017, $730 million which can be put to us in May 2017 and $315 million that matures
in August 2017) and $846 million that matures or can be put to us in 2018. See Note 3 for further
discussion of our debt obligations, including principal and carrying amounts of our notes. As of
June 30, 2016, we had $100 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility
and $3.087 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.

•
•
Since December 2015, Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
have significantly lowered our credit ratings. Some of our counterparties have requested or
required us to post collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain
contractual arrangements, such as gathering, processing, transportation and hedging
agreements. As of August 1, 2016, we have received requests and posted approximately $274
million in collateral under such arrangements (excluding the supersedeas bond with respect to
the 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes) litigation discussed in Note 4). We may be
requested or required by other counterparties to post additional collateral in an aggregate
amount of approximately $664 million, which may be in the form of additional letters of credit,
cash or other acceptable collateral. Any posting of additional collateral consisting of cash or
letters of credit, which would reduce availability under our revolving credit facility, will negatively
impact our liquidity.
We may seek to access the capital markets or otherwise incur debt to refinance a portion of our
outstanding indebtedness and improve our liquidity.
We have taken measures to mitigate the risks and uncertainties facing us for the next 12 months,
including mitigating a portion of our downside exposure to lower commodity prices through
derivative contracts, the suspension of dividend payments on our convertible preferred stock, the
April 2016 amendment to our revolving credit facility (discussed in Note 3) and divesting assets
to increase our liquidity; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will satisfy our
needs.
Reclassifications
In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that requires
debt issuance costs related to term debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the associated debt liability. This standard requires retrospective application and
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. This change in
accounting principle is preferable since it allows debt issuance costs and debt issuance

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began presenting third party transportation and
gathering costs as a component of operating expenses in our statement of operations.
Previously, these costs were reflected as deductions to oil, natural gas and NGL sales. These
costs have been reclassified in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the Prior
Quarter and the Prior Period to conform to the presentation used for the Current Quarter and the
Current Period. The net effect of this reclassification did not impact our previously reported net
loss, stockholders’ equity or cash flows; however, previously reported oil, natural gas and NGL
sales have increased from the amounts previously reported, and total operating expenses have
increased by those same amounts.

2.Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period and includes the effect of any participating securities as
appropriate. Participating securities consist of unvested restricted stock issued to our employees
and non-employee directors that provide dividend rights.
Diluted EPS is calculated assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive
securities, provided the effect is not antidilutive. For the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the
Current Period and the Prior Period, our contingent convertible senior notes did not have a
dilutive effect and therefore were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. See Note 3 for
further discussion of our contingent convertible senior notes.
For the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, shares of the
following securities and associated adjustments to net income, representing dividends on
preferred stock and allocated earnings on participating securities, were excluded from the
calculation of diluted EPS as the effect was antidilutive.

The repurchase, conversion, contingent interest and redemption provisions of our contingent
convertible senior notes are as follows:
(a)
(b)
Holders’ Demand Repurchase Rights. The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes
may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal
amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the
maturity date.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
(Unaudited)
Optional Conversion by Holders. At the holder’s option, prior to maturity under certain
circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock
using a net share settlement process. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our
common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter.
Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in
the Current Quarter, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series
of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to
convert their notes into cash and common stock in the third quarter of 2016 under this provision.
The notes are also convertible, at the holder’s option, during specified five-day periods if the
trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of
our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current
Quarter and the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior
note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for
the note’s conversion value in excess of the principal amount.
Contingent Interest. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they
have been outstanding at least ten years during certain periods if the average trading price of the
notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture.
The holders’ demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts
(as adjusted to give effect to cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the
first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible
senior notes are as follows:

Optional Redemption by the Company. We may redeem the contingent convertible senior notes
once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount of the notes, payable in cash. In addition, we may redeem our 2.75% Contingent
Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 at any time.
(c)
The carrying amount associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible
senior notes as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is net of $75 million and $133
million, respectively. This amount is amortized based on an effective yield method.
(d)See Interest Rate Derivatives in Note 8 for further discussion related to these instruments.
(e)
As of June 30, 2016, current maturities of long-term debt net includes our 6.25% Euro-
denominated Senior Notes due 2017 and our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due
2037 (the 2037 Notes). As discussed in footnote (b) above, the holders of our 2037 Notes
could exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on May 15, 2017, which would
require us to repurchase all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes. As of June 30,
2016, there was $36 million associated with the equity component of the 2037 Notes.
Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior Notes
In the Current Period, in addition to the repayment upon maturity of $259 million principal amount
of our 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately $181
million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for $151 million and $118 million
principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for $63 million.
Additionally, we privately negotiated exchanges of approximately $290 million principal amount
of our outstanding senior notes for 53,923,925 shares of common stock and $287 million
principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for 55,427,782 shares of
common stock. In the Current Period, we recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $168
million associated with the repurchases and exchanges (including $68 million in the Current
Quarter).
Chesapeake Energy Corporation is a holding company and has no independent assets or
operations. Our obligations under our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior
notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our 100%
owned subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are minor and,
as such, we have not included condensed consolidating financial information.

Revolving Credit Facility
We have a $4.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019. As
of June 30, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $100 million under the credit facility and had
used $813 million of the credit facility for various letters of credit (including the $461 million
supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation discussed in Note 4). The terms of
the credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar
fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries
and enter into transactions with affiliates. We were in compliance with all financial covenants
under the agreement as of June 30, 2016.
In April 2016, we entered into the third amendment to our senior revolving credit facility. Pursuant
to the amendment, our borrowing base was reaffirmed in the amount of $4.0 billion and the next
scheduled borrowing base redetermination review was postponed until June 15, 2017, with the
consenting lenders agreeing not to exercise their interim redetermination right prior to that date.
The amendment also provides temporary financial covenant relief, with the credit facility’s
existing first lien secured leverage ratio and net debt to capitalization ratio suspended until
September 30, 2017 and the interest coverage ratio maintenance covenant reduced as noted
below. In addition, we agreed to grant liens and security interests on a majority of our assets, as
well as maintain a minimum liquidity amount (defined as cash and cash equivalents and
availability under our revolving credit facility) of $500 million until the suspension of the existing
maintenance covenants ends.
The amendment reduces the interest coverage ratio from 1.1 to 1.0 to 0.65 to 1.0 through the first
quarter of 2017, after which it will increase to 0.70 to 1.0 through the second quarter of 2017, 1.2
to 1.0 through the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25 to 1.0 thereafter. The amendment also includes a
collateral value coverage test whereby if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of
December 31, 2016, falls below 1.1 to 1.0, the $500 million minimum liquidity covenant increases
to $750 million, and if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of March 31, 2017, falls below
1.25 to 1.0, our borrowing ability will be reduced in order to satisfy such ratio. The amendment
also gives us the ability to incur up to $2.5 billion of first lien indebtedness secured on a pari
passu basis with the existing obligations under the credit agreement, subject to payment priority
in favor of the existing lenders and the other limitations on junior lien debt set forth in the credit
agreement.
Fair Value of Debt
We estimate the fair value of our exchange-traded debt using quoted market prices (Level 1). The
fair value of all other debt, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, is estimated
using our credit default swap rate (Level 2). Fair value is compared to the carrying value,
excluding the impact of interest rate derivatives, in the table below.

4.Contingencies and Commitments
Contingencies
Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings (including those
described below). Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of them seek or may
seek damages and penalties, the amount of which is indeterminate. We estimate and provide for
potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such
losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making
these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated
liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis
and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the
progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar
cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. We account for legal defense
costs in the period the costs are incurred.
2016 Shareholder Litigation. On April 19, 2016, a derivative action was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and current and former directors
and officers of the Company alleging, among other things, violation of and conspiracy to violate
the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, breach of fiduciary duties, waste
of corporate assets, gross mismanagement and violations of Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of
the Exchange Act related to actions allegedly taken by such persons since 2008. The lawsuit
seeks certification as a class action, damages, attorneys’ fees and other costs.
Regulatory Proceedings. The Company has received, from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)
and certain state governmental agencies and authorities, subpoenas and demands for
documents, information and testimony in connection with investigations into possible violations
of federal and state antitrust laws relating to our purchase and lease of oil and natural gas rights
in various states. The Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state
subpoenas seeking information on the Company’s royalty payment practices. Chesapeake has
engaged in discussions with the DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state agency representatives and
continues to respond to such subpoenas and demands.
Redemption of 2019 Notes. As previously disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K, in connection with
the litigation related to the Company’s notice issued on March 15, 2013 to redeem all of the 2019
Notes at par (plus accrued interest through the redemption date) pursuant to the special early
redemption provision of the supplemental indenture governing the 2019 Notes, the Company
filed a notice of appeal on July 27, 2015 of an amended judgment entered on July 17, 2015 by
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York awarding the Trustee for the 2019
Notes $380 million plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $59 million. The Company posted
a supersedeas bond in the amount of $461 million (reflected as an outstanding letter of credit
under the Company’s credit facility) to stay execution of the judgment while appellate
proceedings are pending. We accrued a loss contingency of $100 million for this matter in 2014,
and we accrued an additional $339 million in 2015.
Business Operations. Chesapeake is involved in various other lawsuits and disputes incidental
to its business operations, including commercial disputes, personal injury claims, royalty claims,
property damage claims and contract actions. With regard to contract actions, various mineral or
leasehold owners have filed lawsuits against us seeking specific performance to require us to
acquire their oil and natural gas interests and pay acreage bonus payments, damages based on
breach of contract and/or, in certain cases, punitive damages based on alleged fraud. The
Company has successfully defended a number of these failure-to-close cases in various courts,
has settled and resolved other such cases and disputes and believes that its remaining loss
exposure for these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Regarding royalty claims, Chesapeake and other natural gas producers have been named in
various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayment. The suits against us allege, among other things,
that we used below-market prices, made improper deductions, used improper measurement
techniques and/or entered into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of
royalties in connection with the production and sale of natural gas and NGL. Plaintiffs have
varying royalty provisions in their respective leases, oil and gas law varies from state to state,
and royalty owners and producers differ in their interpretation of the legal effect of lease
provisions governing royalty calculations. The Company has resolved a number of these claims
through negotiated settlements of past and future royalties and has prevailed in various other
lawsuits. We are currently defending lawsuits seeking damages with respect to royalty
underpayment in various states, including, but not limited to, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. These lawsuits include cases filed by individual royalty
owners and putative class actions, some of which seek to certify a statewide class. The
Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state subpoenas seeking information
on the Company’s royalty payment practices.
Chesapeake is defending numerous lawsuits filed by individual royalty owners alleging royalty
underpayment with respect to properties in Texas. On April 8, 2015, Chesapeake obtained a
transfer order from the Texas Multidistrict Litigation Panel to transfer a substantial portion of these
lawsuits filed since June 2014 to the 348th District Court of Tarrant County for pre-trial purposes
(the “MDL”). These lawsuits, which primarily relate to the Barnett Shale, generally allege that
Chesapeake underpaid royalties by making improper deductions and using incorrect production
volumes. In addition to allegations of breach of contract, a number of these lawsuits allege fraud,
conspiracy, joint venture and antitrust violations by Chesapeake. The lawsuits seek direct
damages in varying amounts, together with exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and
interest. Chesapeake entered into a settlement agreement with MDL plaintiffs representing over
97% of the hydrocarbons at issue by volume and, on July 22, 2016, the plaintiffs who accepted
the settlement filed to dismiss such lawsuits. Chesapeake funded the settlement amount of
approximately $29 million in cash and signed a $10 million, three-year promissory note in July
2016, which is accrued for as of June 30, 2016. Additional plaintiffs are continuing to accept the
settlement on a rolling basis. Chesapeake expects that additional lawsuits filed by plaintiffs not
participating in the settlement will continue to be pursued and that new plaintiffs will file other
lawsuits making similar allegations.
On December 9, 2015, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by the Office of Attorney General,
filed a lawsuit in the Bradford County Court of Common Pleas related to royalty underpayment
and lease acquisition and accounting practices with respect to properties in Pennsylvania. The
lawsuit, which primarily relates to the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, alleges that Chesapeake
violated the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL) by
making improper deductions and entering into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in
underpayment of royalties. The lawsuit seeks statutory restitution, civil penalties and costs, as
well as temporary injunction from exploration and drilling activities in Pennsylvania until
restitution, penalties and costs have been paid and permanent injunction from further violations
of the UTPCPL. On February 8, 2016, the Office of Attorney General amended the complaint to,
among other things, add an additional UTPCPL claim and antitrust claim alleging that a joint
exploration agreement to which Chesapeake is a party established unlawful market allocation for
the acquisition of leases. In response to Chesapeake’s preliminary objections, the Office of
Attorney General filed a second amended complaint on May 3, 2016, alleging further violations of
the UTPCPL based upon alleged predicate violations of the federal Sherman Act and the
Federal Trade Commission Act. Chesapeake removed the case to the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on May 27, 2016.
Putative statewide class actions in Pennsylvania and Ohio and purported class arbitrations in
Pennsylvania have been filed on behalf of royalty owners asserting various claims for damages
related to alleged underpayment of royalties as a result of the Company’s divestiture of
substantially all of its midstream business and most of its gathering assets in 2012 and 2013.
These cases include claims for violation of and conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for an unlawful market allocation agreement for
mineral rights. One of the cases includes claims of intentional interference with contractual
relations and violations of antitrust laws related to purported markets for gas mineral rights,
operating rights and gas gathering sources. We have not accrued a loss contingency for any of
the Pennsylvania and Ohio matters seeking class certification.
We believe losses are reasonably possible in certain of the pending royalty cases for which we
have not accrued a loss contingency, but we are currently unable to estimate an amount or range
of loss or the impact the actions could have on our future results of operations or cash flows.
Uncertainties in pending royalty cases generally include the complex nature of the claims and
defenses, the potential size of the class in class actions, the scope and types of the properties
and agreements involved, and the applicable production years.
The Company is also defending lawsuits alleging various violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act
and state antitrust laws. In 2016, putative class action lawsuits have been filed in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and in Oklahoma state courts, and an
individual lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court of Kansas, in each case against the
Company and other defendants. The lawsuits generally allege that, since 2007 and continuing
through April 2013, the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress the market for the
purchases of oil and natural gas leasehold interests and properties in the Anadarko Basin
containing producing oil and natural gas wells. The lawsuits seek damages, attorney’s fees,
costs and interest, as well as enjoinment from adopting practices or plans which would restrain
competition in a similar manner as alleged in the lawsuits.
In April 2016, a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of the Company’s 6.875% Senior Notes
due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) was filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Company’s December
2015 debt exchange, whereby the Company privately exchanged newly issued 8.00% Senior
Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 (Second Lien Notes) for certain outstanding senior
unsecured notes and contingent convertible notes. The lawsuit alleges that the Company
violated the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
by benefiting themselves and a minority of noteholders who are qualified institutional buyers
(QIBs). According to the lawsuit, as a result of the Company’s private debt exchange in which
only QIBs (and non-U.S. persons under Regulation S) were eligible to participate, the Company
unjustly enriched itself at the expense of class members by reducing indebtedness and reducing
the value of the 2020 Notes and the 2022 Notes. The lawsuit seeks damages and attorney’s
fees, in addition to declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the liens created for the benefit
of the Second Lien Notes are null and void and that the debt exchange effectively resulted in a
default under the indentures for the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes. In June 2016, the lawsuit
was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.
Based on management’s current assessment, we are of the opinion that no pending or
threatened lawsuit or dispute relating to the Company’s business operations is likely to have a
material adverse effect on its future consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. The final resolution of such matters could exceed amounts accrued, however, and actual
results could differ materially from management’s estimates.
Environmental Contingencies
The nature of the oil and gas business carries with it certain environmental risks for Chesapeake
and its subsidiaries. Chesapeake has implemented various policies, programs, procedures,
training and auditing to reduce and mitigate such environmental risks. Chesapeake conducts
periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to assess changes in our environmental risk profile.
Environmental reserves are established for environmental liabilities for which economic losses
are probable and reasonably estimable. We manage our exposure to environmental liabilities in
acquisitions by using an evaluation process that seeks to identify pre-existing contamination or
compliance concerns and address the potential liability. Depending on the extent of an identified
environmental concern, Chesapeake may, among other things, exclude a property from the
transaction, require the seller to remediate the property to our satisfaction in an acquisition or
agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property.

Commitments
Gathering, Processing and Transportation Agreements
We have contractual commitments with midstream service companies and pipeline carriers for
future gathering, processing and transportation of oil, natural gas and NGL to move certain of our
production to market. Working interest owners and royalty interest owners, where appropriate,
will be responsible for their proportionate share of these costs. Commitments related to gathering,
processing and transportation agreements are not recorded in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets; however, they are reflected in our estimates of proved reserves.
The aggregate undiscounted commitments under our gathering, processing and transportation
agreements, excluding any reimbursement from working interest and royalty interest owners,
credits for third-party volumes or future costs under cost-of-service agreements, are presented

In addition, we have entered into long-term agreements for certain natural gas gathering and
related services within specified acreage dedication areas in exchange for cost-of-service based
fees redetermined annually or tiered fees based on volumes delivered relative to scheduled
volumes. Future gathering fees vary with the applicable agreement. One of these agreements (in
the Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma) contains cost-of-service based fees that are
redetermined annually through 2019. The annual upward or downward fee adjustment for this
contract is capped at 15% of the then-current fees at the time of redetermination. To the extent the
actual rate of return on capital expended by the counterparty over the term of the agreement
differs from the applicable rate of return, a payment is due to (from) the midstream service
company.
Drilling Contracts
We have contracts with various drilling contractors to utilize drilling services with terms ranging
from three months to three years at market-based pricing. These commitments are not recorded
in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2016, the
aggregate undiscounted minimum future payments under these drilling service commitments
were approximately $177 million.
Pressure Pumping Contracts
We have an agreement for pressure pumping services. Throughout the term of the agreement,
which expires in June 2017, the services agreement requires us to utilize, at market-based
pricing, the lesser of (i) three pressure pumping crews through June 30, 2017 or (ii) 50% of the
total number of all pressure pumping crews working for us in all of our operating regions during
the respective year. We are also required to utilize the pressure pumping services for a minimum
number of fracture stages as set forth in the agreement. We are entitled to terminate the
agreement in certain situations, including if the contractor fails to provide the overall quality of
service provided by similar service providers. As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate undiscounted
minimum future payments under this agreement were approximately $155 million.

Drilling Commitments
We previously committed to drill wells for the benefit of Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust (the
Trust). In connection with the Trust’s initial public offering, we conveyed royalty interests to the
Trust that entitle the Trust to receive certain proceeds from the production of 69 then-producing
wells, and 118 development wells that have been drilled in the Colony Granite Wash play in
Washita County in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma. Pursuant to the terms of a
development agreement with the Trust, we were obligated to drill and complete, or cause to be
drilled and completed, the development wells at our own expense prior to June 30, 2016. As of
June 30, 2016, we had fulfilled our drilling and completion commitment. See Note 10 for further
discussion of the Trust.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Purchase Commitments
We commit to purchase oil, natural gas and NGL from other owners in the properties we operate,
including owners associated with our volumetric production payment (VPP) transactions.
Production purchases under these arrangements are based on market prices at the time of
production, and the purchased oil, natural gas and NGL are resold at market prices. See
Volumetric Production Payments in Note 9 for further discussion of our VPP transactions.
Net Acreage Maintenance Commitments
Under the terms of our Utica Shale joint venture agreements with Total S.A., we are required to
extend, renew or replace expiring joint leasehold, at our cost, to ensure that the net acreage is
maintained in certain designated areas as of a future measurement date.
Other Commitments
As part of our normal course of business, we enter into various agreements providing, or
otherwise arranging for, financial or performance assurances to third parties on behalf of our
wholly owned guarantor subsidiaries. These agreements may include future payment obligations
or commitments regarding operational performance that effectively guarantee our subsidiaries’
future performance.
In connection with acquisitions and divestitures, our purchase and sale agreements generally
provide indemnification to the counterparty for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a
representation or warranty by the indemnifying party and/or other specified matters. These
indemnifications generally have a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against
risks that are difficult to predict or cannot be quantified at the time of entering into or
consummating a particular transaction. For divestitures of oil and natural gas properties, our
purchase and sale agreements may require the return of a portion of the proceeds we receive as
a result of uncured title defects.
Certain of our oil and natural gas properties are burdened by non-operating interests such as
royalty and overriding royalty interests, including overriding royalty interests sold through our
VPP transactions. As the holder of the working interest from which these interests have been
created, we have the responsibility to bear the cost of developing and producing the reserves
attributable to these interests. See Volumetric Production Payments in Note 9 for further
discussion of our VPP transactions.
While executing our strategic priorities, we have incurred certain cash charges, including contract
termination charges, financing extinguishment costs and charges for unused natural gas
transportation and gathering capacity. As we continue to focus on our strategic priorities, we may
take certain actions that reduce financial leverage and complexity, and we may incur additional
cash and noncash charges.

stock options are equity-classified awards and the PSUs are liability-classified awards.
Equity-Classified Awards
Restricted Stock. We grant restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. Prior
to 2014, we also granted restricted stock awards as equity compensation. We refer to both types
of awards as restricted stock. A summary of the changes in unvested restricted stock during the

As of June 30, 2016, there was approximately $76 million of total unrecognized compensation
expense related to unvested restricted stock. The expense is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of approximately 1.57 years.
Stock Options. In the Current Period and the Prior Period, we granted members of senior
management stock options that vest ratably over a three-year period. In January 2013, we also
granted retention awards of stock options to certain officers that vest one-third on each of the
third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. Each stock option award has an exercise
price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. Outstanding
options expire seven to ten years from the date of grant.

We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options. The
expected life of an option is determined using the simplified method. Volatility assumptions are
estimated based on an average of historical volatility of Chesapeake stock over the expected life
of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of
the grant over the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is based on an annual dividend
yield, taking into account the Company's dividend policy, over the expected life of the option. The
Company used the following weighted average assumptions to estimate the grant date fair value
of the stock options granted in the Current Period.

Liability-Classified Awards
Performance Share Units. We have granted PSUs to senior management that vest ratably over a
three-year term and are settled in cash on the third anniversary of the awards. The ultimate
amount earned is based on achievement of performance metrics established by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which include total shareholder return (TSR)
and, for certain of the awards, operational performance goals such as finding and development
costs and production levels.
For PSUs granted in 2016, the TSR component can range from 0% to 100% and the operational
component can range from 0% to 100%, resulting in a maximum payout of 200%. The payout
percentage of these PSUs is capped at 100% if the Company's absolute TSR is less than zero.
For PSUs granted in 2015, the TSR component can range from 0% to 100%, and each of the two
operational components can range from 0% to 50% resulting in a maximum total payout of 200%.
The payout percentage for these PSUs is capped at 100% if the Company’s absolute TSR is less
than zero. For PSUs granted in 2014, the TSR component can range from 0% to 200%, with no
operational components. Compensation expense associated with PSU grants is recognized over
the service period based on the graded-vesting method. The number of units settled is
dependent upon the Company’s estimates of the underlying performance measures. The
Company utilized the Monte Carlo simulation for the TSR performance measure and the
following assumptions to determine the grant date fair value of the PSUs.

8.Derivative and Hedging Activities
Chesapeake uses derivative instruments to secure attractive pricing and margins on its share of
expected production, to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in future commodity prices and to
protect its expected operating cash flow against significant market movements or volatility.
Chesapeake also uses derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of its exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations. All of our commodity derivative instruments are net settled
based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment,
resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Derivatives
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments
consisted of the following types of instruments:
Swaps: Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty
for the hedged commodity. In exchange for higher fixed prices on certain of our swap trades, we
granted options that allow the counterparty to double the notional amount.
Options: Chesapeake sells, and occasionally buys, call options in exchange for a premium. At
the time of settlement, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, Chesapeake
pays the counterparty the excess on sold call options and Chesapeake receives the excess on
bought call options. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment
is due from either party.
Collars: These instruments contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market
price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the
fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the put and the call strike
prices, no payments are due from either party.
Basis Protection Swaps: These instruments are arrangements that guarantee a fixed price
differential to NYMEX from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives the fixed price
differential and pays the floating market price differential to the counterparty for the hedged
commodity.
The estimated fair values of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instrument assets (liabilities)

Interest Rate Derivatives
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding.
We have terminated fair value hedges related to certain of our senior notes. Gains and losses
related to these terminated hedges will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over
the remaining term of the related senior notes. Over the next four years, we will recognize $6
million in net gains related to these transactions.
Foreign Currency Derivatives
We are party to cross currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations. In December 2015, we exchanged in privately negotiated transactions and
subsequently retired €42 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Euro-denominated
Senior Notes due 2017, and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same
principal amount at a cost of $8 million. As a result, we realized a loss of $8 million in 2015 which
was included in losses on purchases or exchanges of debt. Under the terms of the remaining
cross currency swaps, on each semi-annual interest payment date, the counterparties pay us €9
million and we pay the counterparties $15 million, which yields an annual dollar-equivalent
interest rate of 7.491%. Upon maturity of the notes, the counterparties will pay us €302 million
and we will pay the counterparties $403 million. The terms of the cross currency swaps were
based on the dollar/euro exchange rate on the issuance date of $1.3325 to €1.00. The swaps are
designated as cash flow hedges and, because they are entirely effective in having eliminated
any potential variability in our expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates,
changes in their fair value do not impact earnings. The fair values of the cross currency swaps
are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as liabilities of $64 million and $52
million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The euro-denominated debt in
long-term debt has been adjusted to $337 million as of June 30, 2016, using an exchange rate of
$1.1106 to €1.00.
Supply Contract Derivatives
From time to time and in the normal course of business, our marketing subsidiary enters into
supply contracts under which we commit to deliver a predetermined quantity of natural gas to
certain counterparties in an attempt to earn attractive margins. Under certain contracts, we
receive a sales price that is based on the price of a product other than natural gas, thereby
creating an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. In one of these supply contracts, we are
committed to supply a minimum of 90 bbtu per day of natural gas through March 2025. The
bifurcated derivative is measured at fair value on a quarterly basis and resulted in an unrealized
loss of $37 million in the Current Quarter and $17 million in the Current Period, respectively. Both
settlements and mark-to-market gains (losses) are included in marketing, gathering and
compression revenues in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Balance, end of period
Approximately $99 million of the $104 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of
June 30, 2016 represents the net deferred loss associated with commodity derivative contracts
that were previously designated as cash flow hedges for which the hedged production is still
expected to occur. Deferred gain or loss amounts will be recognized in earnings in the month in
which the originally forecasted hedged production occurs. As of June 30, 2016, we expect to
transfer approximately $20 million of net loss included in accumulated other comprehensive
income to net income (loss) during the next 12 months. The remaining amounts will be
transferred by December 31, 2022.
Credit Risk Considerations
Our derivative instruments expose us to our counterparties’ credit risk. To mitigate this risk, we
enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are rated investment grade and
deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers, and we attempt to limit
our exposure to non-performance by any single counterparty. As of June 30, 2016, our oil, natural
gas, NGL, foreign currency and supply contract derivative instruments were spread among 15
counterparties.
Hedging Arrangements
In 2015, we began entering into bilateral hedging agreements. The counterparties’ and our
obligations under certain of the bilateral hedging agreements must be secured by cash or letters
of credit to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to us or by us exceed defined
thresholds.

Fair Value
The fair value of our derivatives is based on third-party pricing models which utilize inputs that
are either readily available in the public market, such as oil, natural gas and NGL forward curves
and discount rates, or can be corroborated from active markets or broker quotes. These values
are compared to the values given by our counterparties for reasonableness. Since oil, natural
gas, NGL, interest rate and cross currency swaps do not include optionality and therefore
generally have no unobservable inputs, they are classified as Level 2. All other derivatives have
some level of unobservable input, such as volatility curves, and are therefore classified as Level
3. Derivatives are also subject to the risk that either party to a contract will be unable to meet its
obligations. We factor non-performance risk into the valuation of our derivatives using current
published credit default swap rates. To date, this has not had a material impact on the values of
our derivatives.

Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value
Measurements
The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 derivative contracts include unpublished forward
prices of natural gas, market volatility and credit risk of counterparties. Changes in these inputs
impact the fair value measurement of our derivative contracts. For example, an increase or
decrease in the forward prices and volatility of oil and natural gas prices decreases or increases
the fair value of oil and natural gas derivatives, and adverse changes to our counterparties’
creditworthiness decreases the fair value of our derivatives. The following table presents
quantitative information about Level 3 inputs used in the fair value measurement of our
commodity derivative contracts at fair value as of June 30, 2016:

9.Oil and Natural Gas Property Transactions
Under full cost accounting rules, we accounted for the sales of oil and natural gas properties
discussed below as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no recognition of gain or loss as the
sales did not involve a significant change in proved reserves or significantly alter the relationship
between costs and proved reserves.
In the Current Quarter and the Current Period, we sold certain of our noncore oil and natural gas
properties for net proceeds of approximately $833 million and $964 million, respectively, after
post-closing adjustments. In both the Current Quarter and the Current Period, additional
consideration of approximately $106 million was withheld subject to certain title, environmental
and other standard contingencies. In conjunction with certain of these sales, we purchased oil
and natural gas interests previously sold to third parties in connection with four of our VPP
transactions for approximately $259 million. A majority of the acquired interests were part of the
asset divestitures discussed above and we no longer have any further commitments or
obligations related to these VPPs. The asset divestitures cover various operating areas.
Volumetric Production Payments
From time to time, we have sold certain of our producing assets located in more mature
producing regions through the sale of VPPs. A VPP is a limited-term overriding royalty interest in
oil and natural gas reserves that (i) entitles the purchaser to receive scheduled production
volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests; (ii) is free and clear of all associated
future production costs and capital expenditures; (iii) is non-recourse to the seller (i.e., the
purchaser’s only recourse is to the reserves acquired); (iv) transfers title of the reserves to the
purchaser; and (v) allows the seller to retain all production beyond the specified volumes, if any,
after the scheduled production volumes have been delivered. For all of our VPP transactions, we
novated to each of the respective VPP buyers hedges that covered all VPP volumes sold. If
contractually scheduled volumes exceed the actual volumes produced from the VPP wellbores
that are attributable to the ORRI conveyed, either the shortfall will be made up from future
production from these wellbores (or, at our option, from our retained interest in the wellbores)
through an adjustment mechanism, or the initial term of the VPP will be extended until all
scheduled volumes, to the extent produced, are delivered from the VPP wellbores to the VPP
buyer. We retain drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals and outside
of producing wellbores.
As the operator of the properties from which the VPP volumes have been sold, we bear the cost
of producing the reserves attributable to these interests, which we include as a component of
production expenses and production taxes in our condensed consolidated statements of
operations in the periods these costs are incurred. As with all non-expense-bearing royalty
interests, volumes conveyed in a VPP transaction are excluded from our estimated proved
reserves; however, the estimated production expenses and taxes associated with VPP volumes
expected to be delivered in future periods are included as a reduction of the future net cash flows
attributable to our proved reserves for purposes of determining our full cost ceiling test for
impairment purposes and in determining our standardized measure. Pursuant to SEC guidelines,
the estimates used for purposes of determining the cost center ceiling and the standardized
measure are based on current costs. Our commitment to bear the costs on any future production
of VPP volumes is not reflected as a liability on our balance sheet. The costs that will apply in the
future will depend on the actual production volumes as well as the production costs and taxes in
effect during the periods in which the production actually occurs, which could differ materially
from our current and historical costs, and production may not occur at the times or in the
quantities projected, or at all.
For accounting purposes, cash proceeds from the sale of VPPs were reflected as a reduction of
oil and natural gas properties with no gain or loss recognized, and our proved reserves were
reduced accordingly. We have also committed to purchase natural gas and liquids associated
with our VPP transactions. Production purchased under these arrangements is based on market
prices at the time of production, and the purchased natural gas and liquids are resold at market
prices.

10.Variable Interest Entities
The Trust is considered a VIE due to the lack of voting or similar decision-making rights by its
equity holders regarding activities that have a significant effect on the economic success of the
Trust and because the royalty interest owners, other than Chesapeake, do not have the ability to
exercise substantial liquidation rights. Our ownership in the Trust and our previous obligations
under the development agreement constitute variable interests. We have determined that we are
the primary beneficiary of the Trust because (i) we have the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact the economic performance of the Trust via our obligations to perform
under the development agreement, and (ii) as a result of the subordination and incentive
thresholds applicable to the subordinated units we hold in the Trust, we have the obligation to
absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that potentially could be significant to the
Trust. As a result, we consolidate the Trust in our financial statements, and the common units of
the Trust owned by third parties are reflected as a noncontrolling interest. As of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, we had $261 million and $259 million, respectively, of noncontrolling
interests on our condensed consolidated balance sheets attributable to the Trust. Net loss
attributable to the Trust’s noncontrolling interests is presented in our condensed consolidated
statements of operations as a nominal amount in the Current Quarter, a loss of approximately $1
million in the Prior Quarter, a nominal amount in the Current Period and a loss of approximately
$1 million in the Prior Period.
The Trust is a consolidated entity whose legal existence is separate from Chesapeake and our
other consolidated subsidiaries, and the Trust is not a guarantor of any of Chesapeake’s debt.
The creditors or beneficial holders of the Trust have no recourse to the general credit of
Chesapeake. In consolidation, as of June 30, 2016, $1 million of cash and cash equivalents,
$488 million of proved oil and natural gas properties and $456 million of accumulated
depreciation, depletion and amortization were attributable to the Trust. We have presented
parenthetically on the face of the condensed consolidated balance sheets the assets of the Trust
that can be used only to settle obligations of the Trust and the liabilities of the Trust for which
creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Chesapeake.
11.Impairments
Impairments of Oil and Natural Gas Properties
Our proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to quarterly full cost ceiling tests. Under the
ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes,
may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net
revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in
developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. Estimated
future net revenues for the quarterly ceiling limit are calculated using the average of commodity
prices on the first day of the month over the trailing 12-month period. In the Current Quarter, the
Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas
properties exceeded the ceiling, resulting in impairments in the carrying value of our oil and
natural gas properties of $1.045 billion, $5.015 billion, $1.898 billion and $9.991 billion,
respectively. Cash flow hedges which relate to future periods increased the ceiling test
impairment by $160 million, $190 million, $326 million and $385 million in the Current Quarter,
the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively. Based on the first-day-of-
the-month prices we have received over the 11 months ended August 1, 2016, as well as the
current strip price for September 2016, we expect to record another write-down in the carrying
value of our oil and natural gas properties in the third quarter of 2016, although the amount of
impairment could be mitigated by the impact of anticipated divestitures in the third quarter of 2016
or other factors. Further write-downs in subsequent quarters will occur if the trailing 12-month
commodity prices continue to fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters.

Impairments of Fixed Assets and Other
We review our long-lived assets, other than oil and natural gas properties, for recoverability
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not
recoverable and exceeds its fair value. A summary of our impairments of fixed assets by asset
class and other charges for the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the
Prior Period is as follows:

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements. Fair value measurements for certain of the impairments
discussed above were based on recent sales information for comparable assets. As the fair value
was estimated using the market approach based on recent prices from orderly sales transactions
for comparable assets between market participants, these values were classified as Level 2 in
the fair value hierarchy. Other inputs used were not observable in the market; these values were
classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
12.Income Taxes
A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when
it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be
realized. To assess that likelihood, we use estimates and judgment regarding our future taxable
income, and we consider the tax consequences in the jurisdiction where the taxable income is
generated, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. The evidence can include
our current financial position, our results of operations, both actual and forecasted, the reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies as well as the current and forecasted business
economics of our industry.
Based on our estimated operating results for the subsequent quarters, we project being in a net
deferred tax asset position as of December 31, 2016. We believe it is more likely than not that
these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and
negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to
permit the use of deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence
evaluated is the projected cumulative loss we expect to incur over the three-year period ending
December 31, 2016. This objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider other
subjective positive evidence, such as our projections for future growth. The amount of the
deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future
taxable income are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is
no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as future expected
growth.

14.Segment Information
As of June 30, 2016, we have two reportable operating segments, each of which is managed
separately because of the nature of its operations. The exploration and production operating
segment is responsible for finding and producing oil, natural gas and NGL. The marketing,
gathering and compression operating segment is responsible for marketing, gathering and
compression of oil, natural gas and NGL.
Management evaluates the performance of our segments based upon income (loss) before
income taxes. Revenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL related to Chesapeake’s
ownership interests by our marketing, gathering and compression operating segment are
reflected as revenues within our exploration and production operating segment. These amounts
totaled $848 million, $1.204 billion, $1.631 billion and $2.437 billion for the Current Quarter, the

Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively.
During the Current Period, we changed the structure of our internal organization to include
certain assets in our Exploration and Production reportable segment instead of our Other
segment. Accordingly, this change has been reflected through retroactive revision of the segment
information as of December 31, 2015, as shown in the tables below.

15.Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the FASB issued updated revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for
recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and
international financial reporting standards. The new standard requires the recognition of revenue
to depict the transfer of promised goods to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration
the company expects to receive in the exchange. The accounting standards update is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with
early application not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the
effective date as well as permission to early adopt the new revenue recognition standard as of
the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued an update clarifying the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB
issued an update clarifying the identification of performance obligations and licensing
implementations guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued an update clarifying guidance in a few
narrow areas and added some practical expedients to the guidance. We are evaluating the
impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In August 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance that requires management, for each annual
and interim reporting period, to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in
the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. If
management concludes that conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability
to continue as a going concern, certain disclosures are required to be made within the footnotes
to the consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for annual
periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption
permitted. We are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued updated lease accounting guidance requiring companies to
recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases of
assets on the balance sheet. The accounting standards update is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating the
impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance for improvements to employee share-based payment
accounting to simplify the accounting for share-based compensation. The new standard requires
all excess tax benefits and reductions from differences between the deduction for tax purposes
and the compensation cost recorded for financial reporting purposes be recognized as income
tax expense or benefit in the income statement and not recognized as additional paid-in capital.
The new standard also requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be classified as
operating activity within the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the
amendments are effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual
periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual
period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We have
elected to early adopt the amendments effective January 1, 2016. The cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings for all excess tax benefits not previously recognized as of the
beginning period is fully offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance resulting in
no change. The implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that will result in fewer put or call options
embedded in debt instruments qualifying for separate derivative accounting because companies
will not be required to assess whether the contingent event, such as change in control or an IPO,
is related to interest rates or credit risks. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. We are evaluating the impact
of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Oil equivalent is based on six mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil or one barrel of NGL. This
ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency.
Beginning in the 2015 fourth quarter, we reclassified our presentation of third party oil, natural
gas and NGL gathering, processing and transportation costs to report the costs as a
component of operating expenses in the accompanying statements of operations. Previously,
these costs were reflected as deductions to oil, natural gas and NGL sales. The net effect of
this reclassification did not impact our previously reported net income, stockholders’ equity or
cash flows; however, previously reported oil, natural gas and NGL sales and consequently
total revenues have increased from the previously reported amounts, and total operating
expenses have increased by these same amounts.
Realized gains (losses) include the following items: (i) settlements of undesignated derivatives
related to current period production revenues, (ii) prior period settlements for option premiums
and for early-terminated derivatives originally scheduled to settle against current period
production revenues, and (iii) gains (losses) related to de-designated cash flow hedges
originally designated to settle against current period production revenues. Unrealized gains
(losses) include the change in fair value of open derivatives scheduled to settle against future
period production revenues offset by amounts reclassified as realized gains (losses) during
the period.
Includes revenue and operating costs. See Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets
under Results of Operations for details of the depreciation and amortization associated with
our marketing, gathering and compression segment.
For the Current Quarter and the Current Period, we recorded unrealized losses of $37 million
and $17 million, respectively, on the fair value of our supply contract derivative. See Note 8 of

terminated trades are reflected in realized (gains) losses over the original life of the hedged

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Overview
We own interests in approximately 32,400 oil and natural gas wells and produced an average of
approximately 657 mboe per day in the Current Quarter, net to our interest. We have a large and
geographically diverse resource base of onshore U.S. unconventional natural gas and liquids
assets. We have leading positions in the liquids-rich resource plays of the Eagle Ford Shale in
South Texas; the Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania; the Anadarko Basin in northwestern
Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle; and the Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in
Wyoming. Our natural gas resource plays are the Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern
Louisiana and East Texas; the Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in
Pennsylvania; and the Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin of north-central Texas. We also own
oil and natural gas marketing and natural gas gathering and compression businesses.
Our Strategy
Chesapeake’s strategy is focused on maximizing liquidity, improving margins and improving the
value of our significant positions in premier U.S. onshore resource plays. We continue to apply
financial discipline to all aspects of our business with the goal of increasing financial and
operational flexibility through lower spending. Our capital program is focused on efficient
investments that can improve our cash flow generating ability in a depressed commodity price
environment. We are utilizing fewer rigs in 2016 than we utilized in 2015; however, to improve
cash flow, we are increasing completion crews to capitalize on prior investments and generate
revenues from initial production on new wells. We expect the suspension of dividend payments
on our convertible preferred stock, the recent amendment to our senior revolving credit facility
and the sale of assets that do not fit in our strategic priorities will provide additional liquidity. In
addition, we are strengthening our balance sheet and improving our liquidity position by
continuing to exchange or repurchase, at a discount, certain of our debt instruments.
Our substantial inventory of hydrocarbon resources, including our undeveloped acreage,
provides a strong foundation to create future value. We have seen and continue to see increased
efficiencies and operational improvements, including increased well productivity from larger
completions and lower production declines due to a greater focus on strengthening our base
production. Building on our strong and diverse asset base, we believe that our dedication to
financial discipline, the flexibility of our capital program, and our continued focus on safety and
environmental stewardship will provide opportunities to create value for Chesapeake and its
stakeholders.
Operating Results
Our Current Quarter production of 60 mmboe consisted of 8 mmbbls of oil (14% on an oil
equivalent basis), 269 bcf of natural gas (75% on an oil equivalent basis) and 7 mmbbls of NGL
(11% on an oil equivalent basis). Our daily production for the Current Quarter averaged
approximately 657 mboe, a decrease of 7% from the Prior Quarter. Compared to the Prior
Quarter, average daily oil production decreased by 24%, or approximately 29 mbbls per day;
average daily natural gas production decreased by 2%, or approximately 66 mmcf per day; and
average daily NGL production decreased by 8%, or approximately 6 mbbls per day. Our oil and
NGL production decreased primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our Cleveland and
Tonkawa assets in 2015 and a significant reduction in drilling activity. Adjusted for asset sales,
our total daily production was flat in the Current Quarter compared to the Prior Quarter. Our oil,
natural gas and NGL revenues (excluding gains or losses on oil and natural gas derivatives)
decreased approximately $380 million to $884 million in the Current Quarter compared to $1.264
billion in the Prior Quarter, primarily due to significant decreases in the prices received for oil,
natural gas and NGL sold in addition to lower volumes sold. See Results of Operations below for
additional details.
Our Current Period production of 121 mmboe consisted of 17 mmbbls of oil (14% on an oil
equivalent basis), 546 bcf of natural gas (75% on an oil equivalent basis), and 13 mmbbls of NGL
(11% on an oil equivalent basis). Our daily production for the Current Period averaged
approximately 665 mboe, a decrease of 4% from the Prior Period. Compared to the Prior Period,
average daily oil production decreased by 23% or approximately 28 mbbls per day; average daily
natural gas production increased by 1%, or approximately 19 mmcf per day; and average daily
NGL production decreased by 7%, or approximately 6 mbbls per day. Our oil and NGL production
decreased primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our Cleveland and Tonkawa assets in
2015 and a significant reduction in drilling activity. Adjusted for asset sales, our total daily
production increased 1% in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period. Our oil, natural gas
and NGL revenues (excluding gains or losses on oil and natural gas derivatives) decreased
approximately $950 million to $1.696 billion in the Current Period compared to $2.646 billion in
the Prior Period, primarily due to significant decreases in the prices received for oil, natural gas
and NGL sold in addition to lower volumes sold. See Results of Operations below for additional
details.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Capital Expenditures
Our drilling and completion capital expenditures during the Current Quarter were approximately
$337 million and capital expenditures for the acquisition of unproved properties, geological and
geophysical costs and other property and equipment were approximately $56 million, for a total
of approximately $393 million. In the Current Quarter, we operated an average of nine rigs, a
decrease of 17 rigs, or 65%, compared to the Prior Quarter. As a result of lower drilling and
completion activity, drilling and completion expenditures decreased approximately $450 million
in the Current Quarter compared to the Prior Quarter.
Our capitalized interest was approximately $63 million and $114 million in the Current Quarter
and the Prior Quarter, respectively. Including capitalized interest, total capital investments were
approximately $456 million in the Current Quarter compared to $957 million for the Prior Quarter,
a decrease of 52%.
Our drilling and completion capital expenditures during the Current Period were approximately
$618 million and capital expenditures for the acquisition of unproved properties, geological and
geophysical costs and other property and equipment were approximately $70 million, for a total
of approximately $688 million. In the Current Period, we operated an average of nine rigs, a
decrease of 31 rigs, or 78%, compared to the Prior Period. As a result of lower drilling and
completion activity, drilling and completion expenditures decreased approximately $1.5 billion in
the Current Period compared to the Prior Period. The level of capital expenditures for the
acquisition of unproved properties, geological and geophysical costs and other property and
equipment decreased approximately $49 million compared to the Prior Period.
Our capitalized interest was approximately $132 million and $237 million in the Current Period
and the Prior Period, respectively. Including capitalized interest, total capital investments were
approximately $820 million in the Current Period compared to $2.4 billion for the Prior Period, a
decrease of 66%.
Based on planned activity levels for the remainder of 2016, we project that 2016 capital
expenditures for drilling and completions, leasehold, geological and geophysical and other
property and equipment will be $1.3 - $1.8 billion, inclusive of capitalized interest. The decrease
from the $3.6 billion spent in 2015 is primarily driven by reduced activity as a result of continued
lower forecasted oil and natural gas prices for the remainder of 2016. See Liquidity and Capital
Resources for additional information on how we plan to fund our capital budget.
Strategic Developments
In the Current Quarter, we further amended our revolving credit facility agreement. Pursuant to
the amendment, our borrowing base was reaffirmed in the amount of $4.0 billion and our next
scheduled borrowing base redetermination date was postponed until June 15, 2017, with the
consenting lenders agreeing not to exercise their interim redetermination right prior to that date.
The amendment also modifies the credit agreement to provide for, among other things, (i) the
suspension or modification of certain financial covenants, and (ii) the granting of liens and
security interests on substantially all of our assets, including mortgages encumbering 90% of our
proved oil and gas properties that constitute borrowing base properties, all hedge contracts and
personal property subject to certain agreed upon carve outs. See Note 3 of the notes to our
condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I for further discussion of
the terms of our revolving credit facility.
In the Current Period, in addition to the repayment upon maturity of $259 million principal amount
of our 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately $181
million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for $151 million and $118 million
principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for $63 million.
Additionally, we privately negotiated exchanges of approximately $290 million principal amount
of our outstanding senior notes for 53,923,925 shares of our common stock and $287 million
principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for 55,427,782 shares of
our common stock. We recorded a gain of approximately $168 million associated with these
purchases and exchanges.
In the Current Period, we amended certain of our firm transportation agreements in the
Haynesville, Barnett and Eagle Ford operating areas, which will reduce our firm transportation
volume commitments and fees. We estimate a benefit of approximately $650 million gross ($415
million net) over the term of the contracts, including $80 million gross ($50 million net) in lower
unused demand charges for the underutilized capacity and lower transportation fees in 2016.
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the Current Period, we sold certain of our noncore assets for net proceeds of approximately
$964 million after post-closing adjustments. Additional consideration of approximately $106
million was withheld subject to certain title, environmental and other standard contingencies. In
conjunction with certain of these sales, we purchased four of our VPP transactions for
approximately $259 million. A majority of the acquired interests were part of the asset divestitures
discussed above and we no longer have any further commitments or obligations related to these
VPPs. The asset divestitures cover various operating areas. We continue to pursue the sale of
assets that do not fit in our strategic priorities.
In the Current Period, we suspended dividend payments on our convertible preferred stock to
provide additional liquidity in the currently depressed commodity environment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Overview
Our ability to grow, make capital expenditures and service our debt depends primarily upon the
prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sell. Substantial expenditures are required
to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Historically, oil and natural
gas prices have been very volatile, and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The
substantial decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices from 2014 levels has negatively affected
the amount of cash we have available for capital expenditures and debt service.
As of June 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of approximately $4 million compared to $825
million as of December 31, 2015, and we had a net working capital deficit of approximately
$2.573 billion, compared to a net working capital deficit of approximately $1.205 billion as of
December 31, 2015. Based on our cash balance, forecasted cash flows from operating activities
and availability under our revolving credit facility, we expect to be able to fund our planned
capital expenditures budget, meet our debt service requirements and fund our other commitments
and obligations for the next 12 months. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices have a material impact
on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and quantities of reserves that may be
economically produced. If depressed prices persist throughout 2017 and we are unable to
restructure or refinance our debt or generate additional liquidity through other actions, our ability
to comply with the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and to make scheduled
debt payments could be adversely impacted.
As discussed in Strategic Developments above and in Note 3 of the notes to our condensed
consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report, we further amended
our revolving credit agreement in April 2016 to reaffirm our borrowing base, postpone our next
scheduled borrowing base redetermination date and modify or suspend certain credit agreement
financial covenants.
As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $8.679 billion principal amount of debt outstanding,
of which $1.382 billion matures or can be put to us in 2017 (including $337 million of maturities in
January 2017, $730 million which can be put to us in May 2017 and $315 million of maturities in
August 2017) and $846 million that matures or can be put to us in 2018. As of June 30, 2016, we
had $100 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and had utilized
approximately $813 million of the credit facility for various letters of credit (including the $461
million supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation). As of June 30, 2016, we had
$3.087 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. See Note 3 of the
notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report
for further discussion of our debt obligations, including principal and carrying amounts of our
notes.
As operator of a substantial portion of our oil and natural gas properties under development, we
have significant control and flexibility over the development plan and the associated timing,
enabling us to reduce at least a portion of our capital spending as needed. We have reduced our
budgeted 2016 capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized interest, to $1.3 - $1.8 billion, a
significant reduction from our 2015 capital spending level of $3.6 billion. We currently plan to use
cash flow from operations, cash on hand, proceeds from assets sales and our revolving credit
facility to fund our capital expenditures during 2016. We expect to generate additional liquidity
with proceeds from future sales of assets that we determine do not fit our strategic priorities.
Management continues to review operational plans for the remainder of 2016 and beyond, which
could result in changes to projected capital expenditures and revenues from sales of oil, natural
gas and NGL. We closely monitor the amounts and timing of our sources and uses of funds,
particularly as they affect our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our
revolving credit facility.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Since December 2015, Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
have significantly lowered our credit ratings. Some of our counterparties have requested or
required us to post collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual
arrangements, such as gathering, processing, transportation and hedging agreements. As of
August 1, 2016, we have received requests and posted approximately $274 million in collateral
under such arrangements (excluding the supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes). We
may be requested or required by other counterparties to post additional collateral in an aggregate
amount of approximately $664 million, which may be in the form of additional letters of credit,
cash or other acceptable collateral. However, we have substantial long-term business
relationships with each of these counterparties, and we may be able to mitigate any collateral
requests through ongoing business arrangements and by offsetting amounts that the counterparty
owes us. Any posting of additional collateral consisting of cash or letters of credit, which would
further reduce availability under our revolving credit facility, will negatively impact our liquidity.
In addition, during 2016, we may be required to pay up to $439 million in connection with the
judgment against us related to the redemption at par value of our 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019.
In connection with our appeal of the decision by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York regarding the redemption, we posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of $461
million in July 2015, which is reflected as an outstanding letter of credit under our credit facility.
This contingent payment is fully accrued on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
We may seek to access the capital markets or otherwise incur debt to refinance a portion of our
outstanding indebtedness and improve our liquidity.
To add more certainty to our future estimated cash flows by mitigating our downside exposure to
lower commodity prices, as of August 1, 2016, we have downside price protection, through open
swaps, on approximately 71% of our projected remaining 2016 oil production at an average price
of $46.60 per bbl. We also have downside price protection, through open swaps and collars, on
approximately 74% of our projected remaining 2016 natural gas production at an average price of
$2.77 per mcf, of which 3% is hedged under two-way collar arrangements based on an average
bought put NYMEX price of $3.00 per mcf. In addition, in exchange for a higher price on certain of
our oil and natural gas swaps, we have sold certain call options that allow the counterparty to
double the notional amount on existing fixed-price swaps. We also have downside price
protection, through open swaps, on approximately 32% of our projected remaining 2016 NGL
production at average prices of $0.17 per gallon of ethane and $0.46 per gallon of propane.
We have taken measures to mitigate the liquidity concerns facing us for the next 12 months,
including mitigating a portion of our downside exposure to lower commodity prices through
derivative contracts, the suspension of dividend payments on our convertible preferred stock, the
April 2016 amendment to our revolving credit facility and divesting assets to increase our
liquidity; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will satisfy our needs.

Cash used in operating activities was $326 million in the Current Period compared to $737
million of cash provided by operating activities in the Prior Period. The decrease in cash
provided by operating activities from the Current Period to the Prior Period is primarily the result
of lower realized prices for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sold, partially offset by decreases in
certain of our operating expenses. Changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the
same factors that affect our net income, excluding various non-cash items such as depreciation,
depletion and amortization, impairments, gains or losses on sales of fixed assets, deferred
income taxes and mark-to-market changes in our derivative instruments. See further discussion
below under Results of Operations.

Net of $51 million in drilling and completion carries received from our joint venture partners
during the Prior Period.
Our primary use of funds is for capital expenditures for drilling and completion costs on our oil
and natural gas properties. Our drilling and completion costs decreased primarily as a result of
significantly decreased activity. During the Current Period, our average operated rig count was
nine rigs compared to an average operated rig count of 40 rigs in the Prior Period.
In the Current Period, we used $472 million of cash to reduce $558 million principal amount of
debt. In addition to the repayment at maturity of $259 million principal amount of our 3.25%
Senior Notes due 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately $118 million principal
amount of our 2037 Notes (that could have been put to us in May 2017) for $63 million, $122
million principal amount of our 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016 for $115 million (prior to maturity)
and $59 million principal amount of our 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 for $36 million.
We paid dividends on our preferred stock of $86 million in the Prior Period and we paid
dividends on our common stock of $118 million in the Prior Period. We eliminated common stock
dividends effective in the 2015 third quarter and suspended preferred stock dividends effective in
the 2016 first quarter.
Revolving Credit Facility
We have a $4.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019. As
of June 30, 2016, we had $100 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and had
used $813 million of the credit facility for various letters of credit (including the $461 million
supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation). See Liquidity Overview above for
additional information on our collateral postings. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a
variable rate. We are required to secure our obligations under the facility with liens on certain of
our oil and natural gas properties, with the liens to be released upon the satisfaction of specific
conditions. The applicable interest rates under the facility fluctuate based on the percentage of
the borrowing base used. In April 2016, we amended
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
our credit facility to provide covenant relief and affirm our $4.0 billion borrowing base. See Note 3
of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item I of Part 1 for
further discussion of the terms of the credit facility and the April 2016 amendment. As of June 30,
2016, our interest rate coverage ratio was approximately 2.02 to 1.0. As of June 30, 2016, we
were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement.
Hedging Arrangements
In February 2016, our multi-counterparty secured hedging facility was terminated and all liens on
the collateral securing the hedging facility were released. In April 2015, we began using bilateral
hedging arrangements. For discussion of our bilateral hedging agreements, see Note 8 of the
notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this
report.

Credit Risk
Derivative instruments that enable us to manage our exposure to oil, natural gas and NGL prices,
as well as to interest rate and foreign currency volatility, expose us to credit risk from our
counterparties. To mitigate this risk, we enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties
that are rated investment grade and deemed by management to be competent and competitive
market makers, and we attempt to limit our exposure to non-performance by any single
counterparty. As of June 30, 2016, our oil, natural gas, NGL, interest rate and supply contract
derivative instruments were spread among 15 counterparties. Additionally, the counterparties
under our commodity hedging arrangements are required to secure their obligations in excess of
defined thresholds.
Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil, natural gas and NGL ($697 million
as of June 30, 2016) and exploration and production companies that own interests in properties
we operate ($172 million as of June 30, 2016). This industry concentration has the potential to
impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers
and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or
other conditions. We generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from
parties which are judged to have sub-standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be
mitigated. During the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period,
we recognized $3 million, $1 million, $4 million and $2 million, respectively, of bad debt expense
related to potentially uncollectible receivables.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
From time to time, we enter into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to contractual
obligations and off-balance sheet commitments. As of June 30, 2016, these arrangements and
transactions included (i) operating lease agreements, (ii) volumetric production payments (VPPs)
(to purchase production and pay related production expenses and taxes in the future), (iii) open
purchase commitments, (iv) open delivery commitments, (v) open drilling commitments,
(vi) undrawn letters of credit, (vii) open gathering and transportation commitments, and
(viii) various other commitments we enter into in the ordinary course of business that could result
in a future cash obligation. See Notes 4 and 9 of the notes to our condensed consolidated
financial statements included in Item 1 of this report for further discussion of commitments and
VPPs, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Results of Operations – Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 vs. June 30, 2015
General. For the Current Quarter, Chesapeake had a net loss of $1.750 billion, or $2.48 per
diluted common share, on total revenues of $1.622 billion. This compares to a net loss of $4.090
billion, or $6.27 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $3.521 billion for the Prior
Quarter. The net losses in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter were primarily driven by
impairments of our oil and natural gas properties. See Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas
Properties below. The decrease in total revenues in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter
was primarily driven by unrealized hedging losses of $544 million and $301 million, respectively.
Additionally, the decrease in total revenues in the Current Quarter was driven by decreases in
the prices we received for our oil, natural gas and NGL production and the prices our marketing
affiliate received for oil, natural gas and NGL production sold on behalf of third-party producers.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Sales. During the Current Quarter, oil, natural gas and NGL sales were
$440 million compared to $1.216 billion in the Prior Quarter. In the Current Quarter, Chesapeake
sold 60 mmboe for $884 million at a weighted average price of $14.76 per boe (excluding the
effect of derivatives), compared to 64 mmboe sold in the Prior Quarter for $1.264 billion at a
weighted average price of $19.77 per boe (excluding the effect of derivatives). The decrease in
the price received per boe in the Current Quarter compared to the Prior Quarter resulted in a
$297 million decrease in revenues, and decreased sales volumes resulted in an $83 million
decrease in revenues, for a total decrease in revenues of $380 million (excluding the effect of
derivatives).
For the Current Quarter, our average price received per barrel of oil (excluding the effect of
derivatives) was $43.00, compared to $54.69 in the Prior Quarter. Natural gas prices received per
mcf (excluding the effect of derivatives) were $1.63 in the Current Quarter and $2.09 in the Prior
Quarter. NGL prices received per barrel (excluding the effect of derivatives) were $13.37 in the
Current Quarter and $13.02 in the Prior Quarter.
Losses from our oil and natural gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil, natural gas and
NGL revenues of $444 million in the Current Quarter and a net decrease of $48 million in the
Prior Quarter, respectively. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk in Part I of this report for a complete listing of all of our derivative instruments as of June 30,
2016.
A change in oil, natural gas and NGL prices has a significant impact on our revenues and cash
flows. Assuming our Current Quarter production levels and without considering the effect of
derivatives, an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or
decrease in Current Quarter revenues of approximately $8 million, an increase or decrease of
$0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in Current Quarter
revenues of approximately $27 million and an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of NGL
sold would result in an increase or decrease Current Quarter revenues of $7 million.

Average sales prices exclude gains (losses) on derivatives. The decrease in the average
sales price for our oil sold in the Current Quarter as compared to the Prior Quarter was
primarily driven by lower crude oil prices. The decrease in the average sales price for our
natural gas sold in the Current Quarter as compared to the Prior Quarter was primarily driven
by lower natural gas prices. The decrease in the average sales price for our NGL sold in the
Current Quarter as compared to the Prior Quarter was primarily driven by lower NGL prices.
Our Southern Division includes the Eagle Ford and Anadarko Basin liquids plays and the
Haynesville/Bossier and Barnett natural gas shale plays. The Eagle Ford Shale accounted for
approximately 24% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015.
Eagle Ford Shale production for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter was 8.3 mmboe and
9.6 mmboe, respectively.
Our Northern Division includes the Utica and Niobrara liquids plays and the Marcellus natural
gas play. The Utica Shale accounted for approximately 18% of our estimated proved reserves
by volume as of December 31, 2015. Utica Shale production for the Current Quarter and the
Prior Quarter was 12.4 mmboe and 11.3 mmboe, respectively. The Marcellus Shale accounted
for approximately 17% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015.
Marcellus Shale production for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter was 12.3 mmboe,
and 12.7 mmboe, respectively.
Our average daily production of 657 mboe for the Current Quarter consisted of approximately 91
mbbls of oil (14% on an oil equivalent basis), approximately 3 bcf of natural gas (75% on an oil
equivalent basis) and approximately 73 mbbls of NGL (11% on an oil equivalent basis). Oil
production decreased by 24% year over year primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our
Cleveland and Tonkawa assets in 2015 and a significant reduction in drilling activity. Natural gas
production decreased by 2% and NGL production decreased by 8%.
Excluding the impact of derivatives, our percentage of revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL is

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Marketing, Gathering and Compression Revenues and Expenses. Marketing, gathering and
compression revenues consist of third-party revenues as well as fair value adjustments on our
supply contract derivatives (see Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial
statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for additional information on our supply
contract derivatives). Expenses related to our marketing, gathering and compression operations
consist of third-party expenses and exclude depreciation and amortization, general and
administrative expenses, impairments of fixed assets and other, net gains or losses on sales of
fixed assets and interest expense. See Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets below for
the depreciation and amortization recorded on our marketing, gathering and compression assets.
Chesapeake recognized $1.182 billion in marketing, gathering and compression revenues in the
Current Quarter, of which $37 million related to unrealized losses on the fair value of our supply
contract derivative, with corresponding expenses of $1.207 billion, for a net loss before
depreciation of $25 million. This compares to revenues of $2.305 billion, of which $220 million
related to unrealized gains on the fair value of our supply contract derivative, with corresponding
expenses of $2.096 billion, for a net margin before depreciation of $209 million in the Prior
Quarter. Revenues and expenses decreased in the Current Quarter compared to the Prior
Quarter primarily as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices paid and received in our
marketing operations. The margin decrease in the Current Quarter as compared to the Prior
Quarter was primarily the result of an unrealized gain on the fair value adjustment on our supply
contract derivative in the Prior Quarter as well as lower compression margins as a result of the
sale of a significant portion of our compression assets in 2015.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs
and ad valorem taxes, were $182 million in the Current Quarter, compared to $276 million in the
Prior Quarter. On a unit-of-production basis, production expenses were $3.05 per boe in the
Current Quarter compared to $4.32 per boe in the Prior Quarter. The absolute and per unit
decrease in the Current Quarter was primarily the result of operating efficiencies across most of
our operating areas. Production expenses in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter included
approximately $15 million and $31 million, or $0.25 and $0.48 per boe, respectively, associated
with VPP production volumes. We anticipate a continued decrease in production expenses
associated with VPP production volumes as the contractually scheduled volumes under our VPP
agreements decrease and operating efficiencies generally improve. Additionally, in connection
with certain divestitures in the Current Quarter, we purchased the remaining oil and natural gas
interests previously sold in connection with four of our VPPs and a majority of the oil and gas
interests purchased were subsequently sold and one of our VPPs expired in 2015.
Oil, Natural Gas, and NGL Gathering, Processing and Transportation Expenses. Oil, natural gas
and NGL gathering, processing and transportation expenses were $481 million in the Current
Quarter compared to $488 million in the Prior Quarter. On a unit-of-production basis, gathering,
processing and transportation expenses were $8.04 per boe in the Current Quarter compared to
$7.64 per boe in the Prior Quarter. Certain of our gathering agreements require us to pay the
service provider a fee for any production shortfall below certain annual minimum gathering
volume commitments and we anticipate incurring shortfall fees in the 2016 fourth quarter based
on current production estimates. A summary of oil, natural gas and NGL gathering, processing
and transportation expenses by product is shown below.

Production Taxes. Production taxes were $19 million in the Current Quarter compared to $34
million in the Prior Quarter. On a unit-of-production basis, production taxes were $0.32 per boe in
the Current Quarter compared to $0.52 per boe in the Prior Quarter. In general, production taxes
are calculated using value-based formulas that produce lower per unit costs when oil, natural gas
and NGL prices are lower. The absolute and per unit decrease in production taxes in the Current
Quarter was primarily due to lower prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL. Production taxes
in both the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter included approximately $1 million, or $0.02 per
boe, associated with VPP production volumes. We anticipate a continued decrease in production
tax expenses associated with VPP production volumes as the contractually scheduled volumes
under our VPP agreements decrease.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $61 million in
the Current Quarter and $69 million in the Prior Quarter, or $1.02 and $1.08 per boe, respectively.
The absolute and per unit expense decrease in the Current Quarter was primarily due to reduced
overhead as a result of our workforce reduction in the 2015 third quarter and our continuing
efforts to reduce other administrative expenses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with oil
and natural gas property acquisition, drilling and completion activities are capitalized. We
capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with the acquisition of leasehold, as well as
drilling and completion activities, and do not include any costs related to production, general
corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $35 million and $65 million of internal
costs in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively, directly related to our leasehold
acquisition and drilling and completion efforts.
Restructuring and Other Termination Costs. We recorded expense of $3 million in the Current
Quarter and credits of $4 million in the Prior Quarter for restructuring and other termination costs.
The Current Quarter amount primarily related to the reduction in workforce in connection with the
restructuring of our compressor manufacturing subsidiary and approximately $1 million was
related to PSU fair value adjustments. The Prior Quarter amount was primarily related to negative
fair value adjustments to PSUs granted to former executives of the Company, which
corresponded to a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.
Provision for Legal Contingencies. In the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, we recorded $82
million and $334 million, respectively, for legal contingencies. The Current Quarter provision
consists of accruals for loss contingencies primarily related to royalty claims. See Note 4 of the
notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report
for further discussion of royalty claims. The Prior Quarter amount relates to the $339 million
charge for litigation regarding our early redemption of our 2019 Notes, partially offset by $5
million related to certain royalty claimants that opted out of a settlement agreement.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization (DD&A) of oil, natural gas and NGL properties was $265 million and $601 million in
the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. The average DD&A rate per boe, which is
a function of capitalized costs, future development costs and the related underlying reserves in
the periods presented, was $4.43 and $9.39 in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter,
respectively. The absolute and per unit decrease in the Current Quarter was the result of a lower
amortization base, which is due to the 2015 and 2016 impairments of our oil and natural gas
properties.
Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets
was $29 million in the Current Quarter compared to $34 million in the Prior Quarter. On a unit-of-
production basis, depreciation and amortization of other assets was $0.48 per boe in the Current
Quarter compared to $0.52 per boe in the Prior Quarter. Property and equipment costs are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following
table shows depreciation expense by asset class for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter
and the estimated useful lives of these assets.

Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to
quarterly full cost ceiling tests. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated
amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of
the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated
future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any
related income tax effects. For the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, capitalized costs of oil
and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling, resulting in impairments of the carrying value of
our oil and natural gas properties of $1.045 billion and $5.015 billion, respectively. Cash flow
hedges related to future periods increased the ceiling test impairment by $160 million and $190
million in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of June 30, 2016, the present value of estimated future net revenue of our proved reserves,
discounted at an annual rate of 10%, was $3.055 billion. Estimated future net revenue represents
the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of
estimated production, gathering, processing, transportation and future development costs, using
prices and costs under existing economic conditions as of that date. The prices used in the
present value calculation as of June 30, 2016 were $43.12 per bbl of oil and $2.24 per mcf of
natural gas, before price differential adjustments. Based on the first-day-of-the-month index
prices we have received over the 11 months ended August 1, 2016, as well as the current strip
price for September 2016, we reasonably expect a decrease of approximately $1.44 per barrel of
oil and increase of $0.04 per mcf of natural gas in the prices we will be using to calculate the
estimated future net revenue of our proved reserves as of September 30, 2016, and such
decreases and increases are expected to reduce the present value of estimated future net
revenue of our proved reserves by less than $150 million in the 2016 third quarter (including the
effects of expected negative price-related revisions to reserve volumes discussed below). This
decrease is expected to result in a write-down in the third quarter of 2016. The actual impairment
in the third quarter of 2016 could be greater or less than the decrease in estimated discounted
future net revenues, or mitigated by the impact of anticipated divestitures or other factors. Further
write-downs in subsequent quarters could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices
continue to fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters.
Deterioration in commodity prices also impacts estimated quantities of proved reserves. In the
Current Quarter, we recognized negative reserve revisions to our year-end 2015 estimated
proved reserves of approximately 12% due to lower commodity prices. Based on first-of-the-
month index prices for July and August 2016, as well as the current strip prices for September
2016, we reasonably expect negative price-related revisions to our September 30, 2016
estimated total proved reserves (developed and undeveloped) of approximately 2.5%, and if
prices continue to decline we expect to have additional negative price-related revisions in the
future. We do not expect these negative price-related revisions and 2016 production to be fully
offset by reserve additions.
Impairments of Fixed Assets and Other. In the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, we
recognized $6 million and $84 million, respectively, of fixed asset impairment losses and other
charges. The Current Quarter amount primarily related to charges incurred for terminating drilling
contracts as a result of the decline in oil and natural gas prices. The Prior Quarter amount
consisted of a loss contingency related to contract disputes, an impairment related to third-party
rental compressors, an impairment of a note receivable and charges incurred for terminating
drilling contracts.
Net (Gains) Losses on Sales of Fixed Assets. In the Current Quarter, net gains on sales of fixed
assets were $1 million compared to net losses of $1 million in the Prior Quarter. The Current
Quarter and the Prior Quarter amounts primarily related to the sale of buildings, land and other
property and equipment.

(a)
(b)
The decrease in capitalized interest resulted from a lower average balance of our unproved oil
and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. The decrease in
senior note interest expense is primarily due to interest on our second lien notes being
accounted for as a reduction in the carrying value of debt instead of interest expense as a result
of troubled debt restructuring accounting rules. Interest expense, excluding unrealized gains or
losses on interest rate derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was $1.00 per boe in the
Current Quarter and $1.12 in the Prior Quarter.
Losses on Investments. Losses on investments of $2 million in the Current Quarter were related
to our equity investment in Sundrop Fuels, Inc. Losses on investments of $17 million in the Prior
Quarter were primarily related to our equity investments in FTS International, Inc. and Sundrop
Fuels, Inc.
Gains on Purchases or Exchanges of Debt. In the Current Quarter, we privately negotiated
exchanges of approximately $275 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for
51,367,946 shares of our common stock and $197 million principal amount of our outstanding
contingent convertible senior notes for 40,728,414 shares of our common stock. We recorded a
gain of approximately $68 million associated with these debt exchanges.
Other Income (Expense). Other income was $3 million in the Current Quarter and consisted of
miscellaneous income. In the Prior Quarter, we recorded $1 million of other expense that
consisted of $1 million of interest income and $2 million of miscellaneous expense.
Income Tax Benefit. Chesapeake recorded an income tax benefit of $1.506 billion in the Prior
Quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 0.0% in the Current Quarter and 26.9% in the Prior
Quarter. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from the Prior Quarter to the Current
Quarter is primarily due to the tax benefit at expected rates being fully offset by a change in our
valuation allowance. Further, our effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of the impact of state
income taxes and permanent differences. See Note 12 of the notes to our condensed
consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a discussion of
income taxes.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. Chesapeake recorded net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests of $18 million in the Prior Quarter. This amount was
primarily related to dividends paid on preferred stock of our CHK C-T subsidiary. The decrease
from the Prior Quarter to the Current Quarter is due to the repurchase of all of the preferred shares
of CHK C-T from third-party shareholders in August 2015.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Results of Operations – Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 vs. June 30, 2015
General. For the Current Period, Chesapeake had a net loss of $2.671 billion, or $3.97 per
diluted common share, on total revenues of $3.575 billion. This compares to a net loss of $7.810
billion, or $11.99 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $6.739 billion for the Prior
Period. The net losses in the Current Period and the Prior Period were primarily driven by
impairments of our oil and natural gas properties. See Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas
Properties below. The decrease in total revenues in the Current Period and the Prior Period was
primarily driven by unrealized hedging losses of $586 million and $575 million, respectively.
Additionally, the decrease in total revenues in the Current Period was driven by decreases in the
prices we received for our oil, natural gas and NGL production and the prices our marketing
affiliate received for oil, natural gas and NGL production sold on behalf of third-party producers.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Sales. During the Current Period, oil, natural gas and NGL sales were
$1.433 billion compared to $2.759 billion in the Prior Period. In the Current Period, Chesapeake
sold 121 mmboe for $1.696 billion at a weighted average price of $14.01 per boe (excluding the
effect of derivatives), compared to 126 mmboe sold in the Prior Period for $2.646 billion at a
weighted average price of $21.04 per boe (excluding the effect of derivatives). The decrease in
the price received per boe in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period resulted in a $100
million decrease in revenues, and decreased sales volumes resulted in an $850 million
decrease in revenues, for a total decrease in revenues of $950 million (excluding the effect of
derivatives).
For the Current Period, our average price received per barrel of oil (excluding the effect of
derivatives) was $35.98, compared to $49.48 in the Prior Period. Natural gas prices received per
mcf (excluding the effect of derivatives) were $1.69 in the Current Period and $2.50 in the Prior
Period. NGL prices received per barrel (excluding the effect of derivatives) were $12.43 in the
Current Period and $15.64 in the Prior Period.
Gains and losses from our oil and natural gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil, natural
gas and NGL revenues of $263 million in the Current Period and a net increase of $113 million in
the Prior Period, respectively. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk in Part I of this report for a complete listing of all of our derivative instruments as of June 30,
2016.
A change in oil, natural gas and NGL prices has a significant impact on our revenues and cash
flows. Assuming our Current Period production levels and without considering the effect of
derivatives, an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or
decrease in Current Period revenues of approximately $17 million, an increase or decrease of
$0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in Current Period
revenues of approximately $55 million and an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of NGL
sold would result in an increase or decrease Current Period revenues of $13 million.

Average sales prices exclude gains (losses) on derivatives. The decrease in the average
sales price for our oil sold in the Current Period as compared to the Prior Period was primarily
driven by lower crude oil prices. The decrease in the average sales price for our natural gas
sold in the Current Period as compared to the Prior Period was primarily driven by lower
natural gas prices. The decrease in the average sales price for our NGL sold in the Current
Period as compared to the Prior Period was primarily driven by lower NGL prices.
Our Southern Division includes the Eagle Ford and Anadarko Basin liquids plays and the
Haynesville/Bossier and Barnett natural gas shale plays. The Eagle Ford Shale accounted for
approximately 24% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015.
Eagle Ford Shale production for the Current Period and the Prior Period was 16.6 mmboe and
19.8 mmboe, respectively.
Our Northern Division includes the Utica and Niobrara liquids plays and the Marcellus natural
gas play. The Utica Shale accounted for approximately 18% of our estimated proved reserves
by volume as of December 31, 2015. Utica Shale production for the Current Period and the
Prior Period was 25.0 mmboe and 21.2 mmboe, respectively. The Marcellus Shale accounted
for approximately 17% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015.
Marcellus Shale production for the Current Period and the Prior Period was 25.4 mmboe, and
25.2 mmboe, respectively.
Our average daily production of 665 mboe for the Current Period consisted of approximately 93
mbbls of oil (14% on an oil equivalent basis), approximately 3 bcf of natural gas (75% on an oil
equivalent basis) and approximately 72 mbbls of NGL (11% on an oil equivalent basis). Oil
production decreased by 23% year over year primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our
Cleveland and Tonkawa assets in 2015 and a significant reduction in drilling activity. Natural gas
production increased by 1% and NGL production decreased by 7%.
Excluding the impact of derivatives, our percentage of revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL is

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Marketing, Gathering and Compression Revenues and Expenses. Marketing, gathering and
compression revenues consist of third-party revenues as well as fair value adjustments on our
supply contract derivatives (see Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial
statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for additional information on our supply
contract derivatives). Expenses related to our marketing, gathering and compression operations
consist of third-party expenses and exclude depreciation and amortization, general and
administrative expenses, impairments of fixed assets and other, net gains or losses on sales of
fixed assets and interest expense. See Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets below for
the depreciation and amortization recorded on our marketing, gathering and compression assets.
Chesapeake recognized $2.142 billion in marketing, gathering and compression revenues in the
Current Period, of which $17 million related to unrealized losses on the fair value of our supply
contract derivative, with corresponding expenses of $2.149 billion, for a net loss before
depreciation of $7 million. This compares to revenues of $3.980 billion, of which $220 million
related to unrealized gains on the fair value of our supply contract derivative, with corresponding
expenses of $3.796 billion, for a net margin before depreciation of $184 million in the Prior
Period. Revenues and expenses decreased in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period
primarily as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices paid and received in our marketing
operations. The margin decrease in the Current Period as compared to the Prior Period was
primarily the result of an unrealized gain on the fair value adjustment on our supply contract
derivative in the Prior Period as well as lower compression margins as a result of the sale of a
significant portion of our compression assets in 2015.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs
and ad valorem taxes, were $388 million in the Current Period, compared to $575 million in the
Prior Period. On a unit-of-production basis, production expenses were $3.21 per boe in the
Current Period compared to $4.58 per boe in the Prior Period. The absolute and per unit
decrease in the Current Period was primarily the result of operating efficiencies across most of
our operating areas. Production expenses in the Current Period and the Prior Period included
approximately $28 million and $63 million, or $0.23 and $0.50 per boe, respectively, associated
with VPP production volumes. We anticipate a continued decrease in production expenses
associated with VPP production volumes as the contractually scheduled volumes under our VPP
agreements decrease and operating efficiencies generally improve. Additionally, in connection
with certain divestitures in the Current Quarter, we purchased the remaining oil and natural gas
interests previously sold in connection with four of our VPPs and a majority of the oil and gas
interests repurchased were subsequently sold and one of our VPPs expired in 2015.
Oil, Natural Gas, and NGL Gathering, Processing and Transportation Expenses. Oil, natural gas
and NGL gathering, processing and transportation expenses were $963 million in the Current
Period compared to $946 million in the Prior Period. On a unit-of-production basis, gathering,
processing and transportation expenses were $7.96 per boe in the Current Period compared to
$7.52 per boe in the Prior Period. Certain of our gathering agreements require us to pay the
service provider a fee for any production shortfall below certain annual minimum gathering
volume commitments and we anticipate incurring shortfall fees in the 2016 fourth quarter based
on current production estimates. A summary of oil, natural gas and NGL gathering, processing
and transportation expenses by product is shown below.

Production Taxes. Production taxes were $37 million in the Current Period compared to $62
million in the Prior Period. On a unit-of-production basis, production taxes were $0.31 per boe in
the Current Period compared to $0.49 per boe in the Prior Period. In general, production taxes
are calculated using value-based formulas that produce lower per unit costs when oil, natural gas
and NGL prices are lower. The absolute and per unit decrease in production taxes in the Current
Period was primarily due to lower prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL. Production taxes
in the Current Period and the Prior Period included approximately $2 million and $3 million, or
$0.02 and $0.03 per boe, respectively, associated with VPP production volumes. We anticipate a
continued decrease in production tax expenses associated with VPP production volumes as the
contractually scheduled volumes under our VPP agreements decrease.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $109 million
in the Current Period and $125 million in the Prior Period, or $0.90 and $1.00 per boe,
respectively. The absolute and per unit expense decrease in the Current Period was primarily
due to reduced overhead as a result of our workforce reduction in the 2015 third quarter and our
continuing efforts to reduce other administrative expenses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with oil
and natural gas property acquisition, drilling and completion activities are capitalized. We
capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with the acquisition of leasehold, as well as
drilling and completion activities, and do not include any costs related to production, general
corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $72 million and $113 million of internal
costs in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively, directly related to our leasehold
acquisition and drilling and completion efforts.
Restructuring and Other Termination Costs. We recorded expense of $3 million in the Current
Period and credits of $14 million in the Prior Period, respectively, for restructuring and other
termination costs. The Current Period amount was primarily related to the reduction in workforce
in connection with the restructuring of our compressor manufacturing subsidiary and
approximately $1 million was related to PSU fair value adjustments. The Prior Quarter amount
was primarily related to negative fair value adjustments to PSUs granted to former executives of
the Company, which corresponded to a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.
Provision for Legal Contingencies. In the Current Period and the Prior Period, we recorded $104
million and $359 million, respectively, for legal contingencies. The Current Period provision
consists of accruals for loss contingencies primarily related to royalty claims. See Note 4 of the
notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report
for further discussion of royalty claims. The Prior Period amount includes $25 million related to
the resolution in April 2015 of litigation we were defending against the state of Michigan and
$339 million related to litigation involving our early redemption of our 2019 notes, partially offset
by $5 million related to certain royalty claimants that opted out of a settlement agreement.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization (DD&A) of oil, natural gas and NGL properties was $536 million and $1.285 billion
in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively. The average DD&A rate per boe, which
is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs and the related underlying reserves in
the periods presented, was $4.43 and $10.22 in the Current Period and the Prior Period,
respectively. The absolute and per unit decrease in the Current Period was the result of a lower
amortization base, which is due to the 2015 and 2016 impairments of our oil and natural gas
properties.
Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets
was $58 million in the Current Period compared to $69 million in the Prior Period. On a unit-of-
production basis, depreciation and amortization of other assets was $0.48 per boe in the Current
Period compared to $0.55 per boe in the Prior Period. Property and equipment costs are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following
table shows depreciation expense by asset class for the Current Period and the Prior Period and
the estimated useful lives of these assets.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to
quarterly full cost ceiling tests. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated
amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of
the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated
future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any
related income tax effects. For the Current Period and the Prior Period, capitalized costs of oil
and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling, resulting in impairments of the carrying value of
our oil and natural gas properties of $1.898 billion and $9.991 billion, respectively. Cash flow
hedges related to future periods increased the ceiling test impairment by $326 million and $385
million in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016, the present value of estimated future net revenue of our proved reserves,
discounted at an annual rate of 10%, was $3.055 billion. Estimated future net revenue represents
the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of
estimated production, gathering, processing, transportation and future development costs, using
prices and costs under existing economic conditions as of that date. The prices used in the
present value calculation as of June 30, 2016 were $43.12 per bbl of oil and $2.24 per mcf of
natural gas, before price differential adjustments. Based on the first-day-of-the-month index
prices we have received over the 11 months ended August 1, 2016, as well as the current strip
price for September 2016, we reasonably expect a decrease of approximately $1.44 per barrel of
oil and increase of $0.04 per mcf of natural gas in the prices we will be using to calculate the
estimated future net revenue of our proved reserves as of September 30, 2016, and such
decreases and increases are expected to reduce the present value of estimated future net
revenue of our proved reserves by less than $150 million in the 2016 third quarter (including the
effects of expected negative price-related revisions to reserve volumes discussed below). This
decrease is expected to result in a write-down in the third quarter of 2016. The actual impairment
in the third quarter of 2016 could be greater or less than the decrease in estimated discounted
future net revenues, or mitigated by the impact of anticipated divestitures or other factors. Further
write-downs in subsequent quarters could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices
continue to fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters.
Deterioration in commodity prices also impacts estimated quantities of proved reserves. In the
Current Period, we recognized negative reserve revisions to our year-end 2015 estimated proved
reserves of approximately 22% due to lower commodity prices. Based on first-of-the-month index
prices for July and August 2016, as well as the current strip prices for September 2016, we
reasonably expect negative price-related revisions to our September 30, 2016 estimated total
proved reserves (developed and undeveloped) of approximately 2.5%, and if prices continue to
decline we expect to have additional negative price-related revisions in the future. We do not
expect these negative price-related revisions and 2016 production to be fully offset by reserve
additions.
Impairments of Fixed Assets and Other. In the Current Period and the Prior Period, we
recognized $44 million and $88 million, respectively, of fixed asset impairment losses and other
charges. The Current Period amount primarily related to impairments of certain of our buildings,
land and compressors as well as charges incurred for terminating drilling contracts as a result of
the decline in oil and natural gas prices. The Prior Period amount consisted of a loss contingency
related to contract disputes, an impairment related to third-party rental compressors, an
impairment of a note receivable and charges incurred for terminating drilling contracts.
Net (Gains) Losses on Sales of Fixed Assets. In the Current Period, net gains on sales of fixed
assets were $5 million compared to net losses of $4 million in the Prior Period. The Current
Period and the Prior Period amounts primarily related to the sale of gathering systems, buildings,
land and other property and equipment.

Includes settlements related to the interest accrual for the current period and the effect of
(gains) losses on early-terminated trades. Settlements of early-terminated trades are reflected
in realized (gains) losses over the original life of the hedged item.
Includes changes in the fair value of open interest rate derivatives offset by amounts
reclassified to realized (gains) losses during the current period.
(a)
(b)
The decrease in capitalized interest resulted from a lower average balance of our unproved oil
and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. The decrease in
senior note interest expense is primarily due to interest on our second lien notes being
accounted for as a reduction in the carrying value of debt instead of interest expense as a result
of troubled debt restructuring accounting rules. Interest expense, excluding unrealized gains or
losses on interest rate derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was $0.99 per boe in the
Current Period and $1.05 per boe in the Prior Period.
Losses on Investments. Losses on investments of $2 million in the Current Period were primarily
related to our equity investment in Sundrop Fuels, Inc. Losses on investments of $24 million in
the Prior Period were primarily related to our equity investments in FTS International, Inc. and
Sundrop Fuels, Inc.
Loss on Sale of Investment. In the Current Period, we sold certain of our mineral interests and
assigned our partnership interest in Mineral Acquisition Company I, L.P. to KKR Royalty
Aggregator LLC. As a result of the transaction, we wrote off our equity investment and recognized
a $10 million loss.
Gains on Purchases or Exchanges of Debt. In the Current Period, we repurchased in the open
market approximately $181 million principal amount of our senior notes for $151 million and $118
million principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes for $63 million. Additionally, in
the Current Period, we privately negotiated exchanges of approximately $290 million principal
amount of our outstanding senior notes for 53,923,925 shares of our common stock and $287
million principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for 55,427,782
shares of our common stock. We recorded a gain of approximately $168 million associated with
these debt purchases and exchanges.
Other Income. Other income was $6 million in the Current Period, consisting of $1 million of
interest income and $5 million of miscellaneous income. In the Prior Period, other income was $5
million and consisted of $3 million of interest income and $2 million of miscellaneous income.
Income Tax Benefit. Chesapeake recorded an income tax benefit of $2.878 billion in the Prior
Period. Our effective income tax rate was 0.0% in the Current Period and 26.9% in the Prior
Period. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from the Prior Period to the Current Period
is primarily due to the tax benefit at expected rates being fully offset by a change in our valuation
allowance. Further, our effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of the impact of state income
taxes and permanent differences. See Note 12 of the notes to our condensed consolidated
financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a discussion of income tax
expenses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. Chesapeake recorded net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests of $37 million in the Prior Period. This amount was
primarily related to dividends paid on preferred stock of our CHK C-T subsidiary. The decrease
from the Prior Period to the Current Period is due to the repurchase of all of the preferred shares
of CHK C-T from third-party shareholders in August 2015.

We caution you not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this
report, which speak only as of the filing date, and we undertake no obligation to update this

ITEM 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Derivatives
Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil, natural
gas and NGL. To mitigate a portion of our exposure to adverse price changes, we have entered
into various derivative instruments. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty
the effective prices to be received for our share of production. We believe our derivative
instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives.
Our general strategy for protecting short-term cash flow and attempting to mitigate exposure to
adverse oil, natural gas and NGL price changes is to hedge into strengthening oil and natural
gas futures markets when prices reach levels that management believes are unsustainable for
the long term, have material downside risk in the short term or provide reasonable rates of return
on our invested capital. Information we consider in forming an opinion about future prices
includes general economic conditions, industrial output levels and expectations, producer
breakeven cost structures, liquefied natural gas trends, oil and natural gas storage inventory
levels, industry decline rates for base production and weather trends.
We use derivative instruments to achieve our risk management objectives, including swaps and
options. All of these are described in more detail below. We typically use swaps for a large
portion of the oil and natural gas price risk we hedge. We have also sold calls, taking advantage
of premiums associated with market price volatility. In 2012 and 2013, we bought oil and natural
gas calls to, in effect, lock in sold call positions. Due to lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, we
were able to achieve this at a low cost to us. In some cases, we deferred the payment of the
premium on these trades to the related month of production.
We determine the volume potentially subject to derivative contracts by reviewing our overall
estimated future production levels, which are derived from extensive examination of existing
producing reserve estimates and estimates of likely production from new drilling. Production
forecasts are updated at least monthly and adjusted if necessary to actual results and activity
levels. We do not enter into derivative contracts for volumes in excess of our share of forecasted
production, and if production estimates were lowered for future periods and derivative
instruments are already executed for some volume above the new production forecasts, the
positions would be reversed. The actual fixed price on our derivative instruments is derived from
the reference NYMEX price, as reflected in current NYMEX trading. The pricing dates of our
derivative contracts follow NYMEX futures. All of our commodity derivative instruments are net
settled based on the difference between the fixed price as stated in the contract and the floating-
price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
We review our derivative positions continuously and if future market conditions change and
prices are at levels we believe could jeopardize the effectiveness of a position, we will mitigate
this risk by either negotiating a cash settlement with our counterparty, restructuring the position or
entering into a new trade that effectively reverses the current position. The factors we consider in
closing or restructuring a position before the settlement date are identical to those we review
when deciding to enter into the original derivative position. Gains or losses related to closed
positions will be recognized in the month of related production based on the terms specified in
the original contract.
We have determined the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices,
volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to counterparty valuations
for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be
unable to meet their obligations. This non-performance risk is considered in the valuation of our
derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives.
Future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been partially
mitigated under our commodity hedging arrangements which require counterparties to post
collateral if their obligations to Chesapeake are in excess of defined thresholds. The values we
report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these
estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors.
See Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of
this report for further discussion of the fair value measurements associated with our derivatives.
As of June 30, 2016, our oil and natural gas derivative instruments consisted of the following:
Swaps: Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty
for the hedged commodity. In exchange for higher fixed prices on certain of our swap trades, we
granted options that allow the counterparty to double the notional amount.
Options: Chesapeake sells, and occasionally buys, call options in exchange for a premium. At
the time of settlement, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, Chesapeake
pays the counterparty the excess on sold call options, and Chesapeake receives the excess on
bought call options. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call options, no
payment is due from either party.
Collars: These instruments contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market
price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the
fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the put and the call strike
prices, no payments are due from either party.
Basis Protection Swaps: These instruments are arrangements that guarantee a fixed price
differential to NYMEX from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives the fixed price
differential and pays the floating market price differential to the counterparty for the hedged
commodity.
As of June 30, 2016, we had the following open oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments:

The change in oil and natural gas prices during the Current Period decreased the liability related
to our derivative instruments by $246 million. This unrealized loss is recorded in oil, natural gas
and NGL sales. We settled contracts in the Current Period that were in an asset position for $318
million. We terminated contracts that were in a liability position for $5 million. Realized gains and
losses will be recorded in oil, natural gas and NGL sales in the month of related production.
Interest Rate Derivatives
The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by
expected maturity dates, using the earliest demand repurchase date for contingent convertible
senior notes. As of June 30, 2016, we had total debt of $8.679 billion, including $7.630 billion of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit
facility and our floating rate senior notes. All of our other indebtedness is fixed rate and, therefore,
does not expose us to the risk of fluctuations in earnings or cash flow due to changes in market
interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt.
From time to time, we enter into interest rate derivatives, including fixed-to-floating interest rate
swaps (we receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating market rate) to mitigate our exposure to
changes in the fair value of our senior notes and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps (we receive
a floating market rate and pay a fixed interest rate) to manage our interest rate exposure related
to our revolving credit facility borrowings. As of June 30, 2016, there were no interest rate
derivatives outstanding.
As of June 30, 2016, we had $33 million of net gains related to settled derivative contracts that
will be recorded within interest expense as realized gains or losses once they are transferred
from our senior note liability or within interest expense as unrealized gains or losses over the
remaining seven-year term of our related senior notes.
Realized and unrealized (gains) or losses from interest rate derivative transactions are reflected
as adjustments to interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Foreign Currency Derivatives
In December 2006, we issued €600 million of 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017.
Concurrent with the issuance of the euro-denominated senior notes, we entered into cross
currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the
term of the senior notes. In May 2011, we purchased and subsequently retired €256 million in
aggregate principal amount of these senior notes following a tender offer, and we simultaneously
unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount. In December 2015, we
exchanged and subsequently retired €42 million in aggregate principal amount of these senior
notes, and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount.
Under the terms of the remaining cross currency swaps, on each semi-annual interest payment
date, the counterparties pay us €9 million and we pay the counterparties $15 million, which
yields an annual dollar-equivalent interest rate of 7.491%. Upon maturity of the notes, the
counterparties will pay us €302 million and we will pay the counterparties $403 million. The
terms of the cross currency swaps were based on the dollar/euro exchange rate on the issuance
date of $1.3325 to €1.00. Through the cross currency swaps, we have eliminated any potential
variability in our expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore
the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The fair values of the cross currency swaps are
recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as liabilities of $64 million and $52
million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The euro-denominated debt in
long-term debt has been adjusted to $337 million as of June 30, 2016, using an exchange rate of
$1.1106 to €1.00.
Supply Contract Derivatives
As discussed in Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included
in Item 1 of Part I of this report, we enter into supply contracts in the normal course of business
under which we commit to deliver a predetermined quantity of natural gas to certain
counterparties in an attempt to earn attractive margins. Under certain contracts, we receive a
sales price that is based on the price of a product other than natural gas thereby creating an
embedded derivative. The prices of the products other than natural gas are unobservable. We
engage an independent third-party valuation firm to value these supply contracts. The products
being valued other than natural gas are sensitive to pricing fluctuations and some of these
fluctuations could be material. Changes to the value of these contracts are recorded as mark-to-
market adjustments to marketing, gathering and compression revenues in our condensed
consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4.Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive
and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Chesapeake’s
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(b). Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016, which materially affected, or was reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
PART II
ITEM 1.Legal Proceedings
Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings (including those
described below). Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of them seek or may
seek damages and penalties, the amount of which is currently indeterminate. See Note 4 of the
notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report
for information regarding our estimation and provision for potential losses related to litigation and
regulatory proceedings.
2016 Shareholder Litigation. On April 19, 2016, a derivative action was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and current and former directors
and officers of the Company alleging, among other things, violation of and conspiracy to violate
the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, breach of fiduciary duties, waste
of corporate assets, gross mismanagement and violations of Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of
the Exchange Act related to actions allegedly taken by such persons since 2008. The lawsuit
seeks certification as a class action, damages, attorneys’ fees and other costs.
Regulatory Proceedings. The Company has received, from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)
and certain state governmental agencies and authorities, subpoenas and demands for
documents, information and testimony in connection with investigations into possible violations
of federal and state antitrust laws relating to our purchase and lease of oil and natural gas rights
in various states. The Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state
subpoenas seeking information on the Company’s royalty payment practices. Chesapeake has
engaged in discussions with the DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state agency representatives and
continues to respond to such subpoenas and demands.
Redemption of 2019 Notes. See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial
statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a description of pending litigation
regarding our redemption in May 2013 of our 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes).
Business Operations. Chesapeake is involved in various other lawsuits and disputes incidental
to its business operations, including commercial disputes, personal injury claims, royalty claims,
property damage claims and contract actions. With regard to contract actions, various mineral or
leasehold owners have filed lawsuits against us seeking specific performance to require us to
acquire their oil and natural gas interests and pay acreage bonus payments, damages based on
breach of contract and/or, in certain cases, punitive damages based on alleged fraud. The
Company has successfully defended a number of these failure-to-close cases in various courts,
has settled and resolved other such cases and disputes and believes that its remaining loss
exposure for these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Regarding royalty claims, Chesapeake and other natural gas producers have been named in
various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayment. The suits against us allege, among other things,
that we used below-market prices, made improper deductions, used improper measurement
techniques and/or entered into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of
royalties in connection with the production and sale of natural gas and NGL. The Company has
resolved a number of these claims through negotiated settlements of past and future royalties
and has prevailed in various other lawsuits. We are currently defending lawsuits seeking
damages with respect to royalty underpayment in various states, including, but not limited to,
Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. These lawsuits include cases
filed by individual royalty owners and putative class actions, some of which seek to certify a
statewide class. The Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state subpoenas
seeking information on the Company’s royalty payment practices.
Chesapeake is defending numerous lawsuits filed by individual royalty owners alleging royalty
underpayment with respect to properties in Texas. On April 8, 2015, Chesapeake obtained a
transfer order from the Texas Multidistrict Litigation Panel to transfer a substantial portion of these
lawsuits filed since June 2014 to the 348th District Court of Tarrant County for pre-trial purposes
(the “MDL”). These lawsuits, which primarily relate to the Barnett Shale, generally allege that
Chesapeake underpaid royalties by making improper deductions and using incorrect production
volumes. In addition to allegations of breach of contract, a number of these lawsuits allege fraud,
conspiracy, joint venture and antitrust violations by Chesapeake. The lawsuits seek direct
damages in varying amounts, together with exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and
interest. Chesapeake has entered into a settlement agreement with MDL plaintiffs representing
over 97% of the hydrocarbons at issue by volume and, on July 22, 2016, the plaintiffs who
accepted the settlement filed to dismiss such lawsuits. Chesapeake funded the settlement
amount of approximately $29 million in cash and signed a $10 million, three-year promissory
note in July 2016, which is accrued for as of June 30, 2016. Additional plaintiffs are continuing to
accept the settlement on a rolling basis. Chesapeake expects that additional lawsuits filed by
plaintiffs not participating in the settlement will continue to be pursued and that new plaintiffs will
file other lawsuits making similar allegations.
On December 9, 2015, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by the Office of Attorney General,
filed a lawsuit in the Bradford County Court of Common Pleas related to royalty underpayment
and lease acquisition and accounting practices with respect to properties in Pennsylvania. The
lawsuit, which primarily relates to the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, alleges that Chesapeake
violated the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL) by
making improper deductions and entering into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in
underpayment of royalties. The lawsuit seeks statutory restitution, civil penalties and costs, as
well as temporary injunction from exploration and drilling activities in Pennsylvania until
restitution, penalties and costs have been paid and permanent injunction from further violations
of the UTPCPL. On February 8, 2016, the Office of Attorney General amended the complaint to,
among other things, add an additional UTPCPL claim and antitrust claim alleging that a joint
exploration agreement to which Chesapeake is a party established unlawful market allocation for
the acquisition of leases. In response to Chesapeake’s preliminary objections, the Office of
Attorney General filed a second amended complaint on May 3, 2016, alleging further violations of
the UTPCPL based upon alleged predicate violations of the federal Sherman Act and the
Federal Trade Commission Act. Chesapeake removed the case to the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on May 27, 2016.
Putative statewide class actions in Pennsylvania and Ohio and purported class arbitrations in
Pennsylvania have been filed on behalf of royalty owners asserting various claims for damages
related to alleged underpayment of royalties as a result of the Company’s divestiture of
substantially all of its midstream business and most of its gathering assets in 2012 and 2013.
These cases include claims for violation of and conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for an unlawful market allocation agreement for
mineral rights. One of the cases includes claims of intentional interference with contractual
relations and violations of antitrust laws related to purported markets for gas mineral rights,
operating rights and gas gathering sources.
The Company is also defending lawsuits alleging various violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act
and state antitrust laws. In 2016, putative class action lawsuits have been filed in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and in Oklahoma state courts, and an
individual lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court of Kansas, in each case against the
Company and other defendants. The lawsuits generally allege that, since 2007 and continuing
through April 2013, the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress the market for the
purchases of oil and natural gas leasehold interests and properties in the Anadarko Basin
containing producing oil and natural gas wells. The lawsuits seek damages, attorney’s fees,
costs and interest, as well as enjoinment from adopting practices or plans which would restrain
competition in a similar manner as alleged in the lawsuits.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In April 2016, a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of the Company’s 6.875% Senior Notes
due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) was filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Company’s December
2015 debt exchange, whereby the Company privately exchanged newly issued 8.00% Senior
Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 (Second Lien Notes) for certain outstanding senior
unsecured notes and contingent convertible notes. The lawsuit alleges that the Company
violated the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
by benefiting themselves and a minority of noteholders who are qualified institutional buyers
(QIBs). According to the lawsuit, as a result of the Company’s private debt exchange in which
only QIBs (and non-U.S. persons under Regulation S) were eligible to participate, the Company
unjustly enriched itself at the expense of class members by reducing indebtedness and reducing
the value of the 2020 Notes and the 2022 Notes. The lawsuit seeks damages and attorney’s
fees, in addition to declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the liens created for the benefit
of the Second Lien Notes are null and void and that the debt exchange effectively resulted in a
default under the indentures for the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes. In June 2016, the lawsuit
was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.
Environmental Proceedings
Our subsidiary Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC (CALLC) is engaged in discussions with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) regarding potential violations of the permitting
requirements of the federal Clean Water Act, the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law and the
Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act in connection with the placement of dredge
and fill material during construction of certain sites in Pennsylvania. CALLC identified the
potential violations in connection with an internal review of its facilities siting and construction
processes and voluntarily reported them to the regulatory agencies. Resolution of the matter may
result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.
CALLC and the PADEP are also engaged in discussions regarding alleged violations of the
Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act and the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law in connection with
contamination in the vicinity of one of CALLC’s well pads in Sullivan County,
Pennsylvania. Resolution of the matter may result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.
On January 12, 2016, we were named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in state
district court in Logan County, Oklahoma alleging that we and the other defendants, all
exploration and production companies have operated produced water disposal wells in a manner
that has caused earthquakes. The proposed class would consist of all Oklahoma residents
whose property has been so damaged. The petition sought an unspecified amount of actual and
punitive damages. The case was subsequently moved to the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Oklahoma. On July 21, 2016, the plaintiffs dismissed the case.
On February 16, 2016, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit brought in the U.S. District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma by the Sierra Club. The complaint alleges that we and
the other defendants, all exploration and production companies, have violated the federal
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act by operating produced water disposal wells in a
manner that has caused earthquakes. It requests a court order requiring substantial reduction of
the amounts of produced water disposed of in such manner, the creation of an earthquake
prediction center, and the reinforcement of purportedly vulnerable structures that could be
impacted by earthquakes.

ITEM 3.Defaults Upon Senior Securities
In January 2016, our Board of Directors determined to suspend dividend payments on our
preferred stock. Suspension of the dividends did not constitute an event of default under our
revolving credit facility or bond indentures. However, as a result of such suspension, we are in
arrears in the payment of dividends with respect to our 5.75% Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock, 5.75% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (series A), 5.00% Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock (series 2005B) and 4.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. The table
