<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth 
session from 3 to 14 October 2011.  The review of Iceland was held at the 11th meeting on 
10 October 2011. The delegation of Iceland was headed by Ogmundur Jonasson, Minister 
of the Interior. At its 15th meeting, held on 12 October 2011, the Working Group adopted 
the report on Iceland. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Iceland: Angola, Austria and Jordan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Iceland: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/ISL/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ISL/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ISL/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, 
Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to 
Iceland through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that it was an honour to attend the universal periodic review 
on behalf of the Government of Iceland and indicated that it was grateful for the 
opportunity to provide information on the human rights situation in Iceland. The review 
would make, and had already made, a positive impact on the dialogue on human rights in 
Iceland.  
</p>
<p>6. As laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights are and 
should be universal and inalienable. The Member States of the United Nations have a duty 
to support each other in this regard, to have the courage to speak out when breaches of 
human rights occur and, of no less importance, to commend States that have taken steps to 
improve the lives of their citizens. 
</p>
<p>7. In general, it was safe to say that the human rights situation in Iceland was 
reasonably good. However, there was room for improvement and Iceland would not shy 
away from any constructive criticism. Indeed, it looked forward to the interactive dialogue 
and to receiving advice and recommendations.  
</p>
<p>8. Iceland placed great emphasis on human rights and the Government was currently 
working on a new and extensive human rights policy that will be in compliance with 
fundamental international human rights conventions and agreements. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that the Constitution of Iceland prescribed that human rights 
applied to all members of society and that there was general consent regarding this in the </p>


<p>country. Nevertheless, Iceland was faced with various challenges, not least in connection 
with tremendous economic and socio-political turbulences and upheavals before and after a 
catastrophic financial crash in the fall of 2008.  
</p>
<p>10. The demonstrations in Iceland during 2008 and 2009 led to the fall of the 
Government and new elections two years earlier than scheduled. The new Government was 
faced with challenging tasks following a drastic fall in State and municipal revenues and 
subsequent budgetary restraints. In addition, the Government was not entirely sovereign in 
this task. The arrival of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had a direct and indirect 
effect on budgetary and fiscal governing in Iceland, but the intermediary of the IMF proved 
to be a necessary precondition for inter-State loan agreements undertaken by the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>11. Protecting human rights in difficult times, while challenging, is the most important 
task of any Government. In recent decades a notable shift of emphasis has occurred, 
whereby human rights are defined in the context of market interests and ownership 
entitlements at the cost of public interests. This should be discussed by the international 
community in a forum similar to the present review. The delegation indicated that when 
faced with a choice between property and financial rights on the one hand and the rights of 
disabled persons and socially vulnerable on the other, priority should be given to rights of 
the latter. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation highlighted that the present Government was formed with the 
specific mission to safeguard and protect the welfare system in times of crisis. Budgetary 
cuts have impacted the provision of services and consequently peoples&#8217; lives. However, by 
</p>
<p>constantly drawing attention to the effect budgetary restraint has on the welfare systems and 
on vulnerable groups in society, the negative impact has been reduced.  
</p>
<p>13. In time of crisis, the general trend was to direct budget cuts to public services, such 
as the health, welfare and educational sectors, while at the same time strict demands were 
made on Governments to create jobs in other sectors, such as in transport and the 
construction industry. As a consequence, there was always a tendency to create jobs for 
men while women were driven away from the labour market. This tendency has been 
experienced in Iceland. However, the Government has taken special measures to avoid this 
pattern developing by, for example, initiating gender-response budgeting.  Furthermore, the 
Welfare Watch, a government entity, was established to monitor the economic conditions 
of families and individuals and to propose measures to address the needs of households, and 
it, as well as the Debtors Ombudsman has proved to be useful in dealing with the 
unavoidable consequences of the financial crisis.  
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that comparative studies had shown that children were on 
average pleased and happy, notably more so than before the crisis, which might indicate 
that the market- and money-driven lifestyle did not necessarily serve the well-being of 
children. However, children who were vulnerable before the crisis were considered to be at 
a higher risk now, which remains an important challenge for the Government and society in 
general.  
</p>
<p>15. Despite difficult times, the Government has taken important steps to improve the 
rights of individuals and groups. For example, in 2010 Parliament unanimously adopted 
legislation providing for a gender-neutral definition of marriage, ensuring the same legal 
status for heterosexual and same-sex married couples. Important steps are also being taken 
to improve the legal status of transgender people. However, equal legal status does not 
ensure equality.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation indicated that promoting gender equality and ensuring that women 
and men enjoyed equal rights and status in all respects has been a key priority of the 
Government. Iceland has been successful in many areas of gender equality. This was </p>


<p>reflected in the World Economic Forum&#8217;s Global Gender Gap Report, in which Iceland had  
been ranked first the two previous years. Although Icelandic women&#8217;s participation in the 
formal labour market is among the highest in the world and they were well educated, the 
gender pay gap persisted.   
</p>
<p>17. Sexual and domestic violence against women was a global concern. The 
uncomfortable and ugly reality of such violence was openly discussed in Iceland, because 
of the work of the Icelandic women&#8217;s movement which was the first step towards dealing 
</p>
<p>with this problem. The Government was doing its utmost to stimulate and encourage this 
development.  
</p>
<p>18. The delegation pointed out that only a small number of rape victims file charges and 
only few of these cases lead to indictments or convictions. In this regard, a comprehensive 
consultation process involving the representatives of the judiciary, police, prosecutors, civil 
society organizations and victims associations, was initiated. Recommendations emanating 
from this initiative were being followed-up.  
</p>
<p>19. Further important steps in eliminating violence and discrimination against women 
included the establishment of a special task force by the Government to deal with human 
trafficking. Penalties for such crimes have been increased. Furthermore, Parliament has 
passed legislation criminalising prostitution and also declaring strip clubs illegal. 
</p>
<p>20. Iceland is in the process of ratifying the European Convention on the Protection of 
Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. Also, the Government Agency for 
Child Protection operated The Children&#8217;s House, which has become a model internationally 
</p>
<p>for a child-friendly justice environment. It has also contributed to more numerous 
complaints, prosecutions and convictions for acts of sexual violence against children. 
However, preventive measures have not been sufficiently systematic but the Minister of the 
Interior indicated that he has placed particular focus on ensuring improvement in that area, 
in cooperation with other ministries. 
</p>
<p>21. Protecting human rights was not only a domestic issue but also an important aspect 
of Iceland&#8217;s foreign policy. The Government wanted its development policy to be rooted in 
the fundamental rights of all people as set out in the Charter of the United Nations and the 
Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>22. The delegation stated that there is an Icelandic saying &#8220;Gl&#246;ggt er gests auga&#240;&#8221;, 
which when translated into English means &#8220;the guest has a sharp eye&#8221;, referring to the fact 
that a visitor can often notice things that residents cannot. This can be applied to all spheres 
of society &#8211; injustice can be taking place in one&#8217;s backyard without one noticing it. In this 
respect, international cooperation for human rights is an important factor in implementing 
and ensuring global and universal human rights. In this regard, many examples were cited 
including the guidance received from the United Nations human rights treaty bodies, which 
has had a positive impact on the protection of human rights in Iceland. The delegation 
stated that it looked forward to the important and constructive dialogue that followed.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>23. During the interactive dialogue, 25 delegations made statements. Many delegations 
expressed appreciation for the national report and the comprehensive presentation made by 
delegation of Iceland. Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in 
section II of this report.  
</p>
<p>24. Algeria expressed appreciation for the participatory process undertaken in the 
preparation of the report. It noted Iceland&#8217;s commitment to adapting its national legislation 
</p>
<p>to international human rights standards. It also took note of rising immigration and growing </p>


<p>intolerance and of the effects of the global financial crisis. Additionally it noted that Iceland 
has always been supportive of the efforts of developing countries. Algeria made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>25. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted that Iceland had 
signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but that it had not yet 
been ratified. It also noted that gender inequality still existed in the areas of pay gap and 
women in leadership roles. The United Kingdom found worrying the statistic that in 2009 
over half the population believed racial discrimination to be common. It raised concerns 
about the absence of a public authority to monitor violence and sexual abuse against 
children and welcomed the decision to build a new prison facility. The United Kingdom 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>26. Ghana applauded the active participation and strong representation of women in 
important public institutions in Iceland. It also expressed appreciation for Iceland&#8217;s 
educational output in which women constituted 66 per cent of first-degree graduates, 60 per 
cent of master&#8217;s degree graduates and 54 per cent of doctoral graduates. Ghana noted, 
however, the concern by the Committee on the Rights of the Child about the high drop-out 
rate of immigrant children. It also noted the 16 per cent gender pay gap, as indicated in the 
national report. Ghana made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. The United States of America commended Iceland for launching its first anti-
trafficking action plan in 2009. It highlighted legislation passed in 2011 which increased 
the penalty for human trafficking, and constructive changes made to the country&#8217;s asylum 
</p>
<p>laws. The United States remained concerned by gender pay gap and gender-based violence. 
It noted the efforts made by Iceland to guarantee the rights of people of foreign origin. The 
United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Australia<b> </b>commended Iceland for passing amendments to the Act on Foreigners in 
2008 and the establishment of the Multicultural and Information Centre (MCI). It expressed 
concern that there was no definition of racial discrimination in Icelandic legislation. It was 
also concerned about reports of incarceration of juveniles and adults and of pretrial 
detainees and convicted prisoners in the same cells. Finally, Australia expressed concern 
about lenient sentences in cases of domestic violence, which acted as a disincentive to 
women who reported violent crimes to the authorities. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>29. Canada<b> </b>applauded the commitment made to promote human rights in line with the 
major United Nations human rights instruments. It highlighted achievements in terms of 
gender equality in the cabinet noting the example of Ms. Sigur&#240;ard&#243;ttir, Iceland&#8217;s first 
woman prime minister. It also noted concerns by the Committee against Torture about 
asylum procedures and by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) regarding the Aliens Act which, as amended, did not provide for an 
independent and impartial appeal process. Canada made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>30. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed its concern over a number of human rights 
issues in Iceland, including racism and xenophobia, sexual violence and abuse of children, 
domestic violence, ethnic-based social inequalities, and the existence of substandard jails. It 
inquired about the root causes of these issues and concrete measures taken by the Iceland to 
address them. Iran made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>31. France<b> </b>noted that the Iceland had signed the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance in 2008 and inquired about 
obstacles to its ratification. It also noted that the establishment of a national human rights 
institution was under review and it asked for details on the envisaged timeline regarding 
this. Bearing in mind the persistent gender pay gap in the country and inequality in 
representation of women in leadership roles, France enquired what additional measures 
Iceland planned to take to correct this situation. France made recommendations. </p>


<p>32. Finland<b> </b>noted that lack of adequate resources in the prison system resulted in 
detainees having to wait to serve their sentences. It indicated that the European Committee 
for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) had observed that some prisons did not conform to the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Finland noted that Iceland was 
planning to build a new reception and custody prison that would improve the conditions. 
Finland made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>33. Norway stated that it was following with interest the reform of the Icelandic 
Constitution. It expressed its trust that the Icelandic democratic system of government and 
constitutional framework will continue to form the basis of the enjoyment of all rights. It 
took note of the legislation to increase female representation in management positions and 
expressed concern that only a small portion of rape victims file charges, and a few of them 
lead to indictments or convictions. It expressed interest in learning how the new action plan 
would examine gender-based violence and their prosecution and handling in the judicial 
system. Norway made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>34. Mexico<b> </b>noted the action taken by Iceland to promote gender equality, develop the 
right to a healthy environment and to prevent trafficking in persons. It also welcomed the 
inclusive process undertaken in the review of the country&#8217;s Constitution and expressed the 
</p>
<p>hope that this exercise would result in a comprehensive normative framework that 
incorporated international standards for the protection and promotion of human rights. 
Mexico made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>35. Brazil congratulated Iceland for ensuring public participation in the review process 
of its Constitution. It noted progress made in the area of gender equality. It also 
commended recent legislation removing legal impediments to same-sex marriages, and 
strengthening the independence of the judiciary and freedom of expression. Nonetheless, 
Brazil noted that the impact of the global financial crisis and increased unemployment have 
resulted in challenges on the welfare system. In line with the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, it requested Iceland to ensure that child victims of prostitution were treated as 
victims not offenders.  Brazil made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>36. Germany noted concerns relating to prison conditions and regarding the lack of 
separation between juvenile and adult prisoners, men and women prisoners and pretrial and 
convicted prisoners. It requested information regarding measures taken to abolish these 
precarious conditions. Noting reports of lack of room to house prisoners, Germany also 
asked what steps had been taken to overcome the scarcity of prison capacity. Finally, 
Germany noted concerns regarding the lack of procedures and gaps in legislation 
concerning stateless persons and asked if any steps had been taken to ratify the 1961 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.   
</p>
<p>37. Slovakia thanked the delegation for its report and stressed the commitment of 
Iceland to the major international human rights instruments. Slovakia noted the work and 
functioning of the Multicultural and Information Centre, the Intercultural Centre and the 
Immigrant Council, the establishment of the Ombudsman for Children and the introduction 
of the human rights education in the national school curriculum. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Slovenia asked how Iceland intended to improve its data collection on the use and 
effectiveness of restraining orders, particularly with regard to domestic and sexual violence 
and how it planned to raise awareness of the judiciary and police regarding this issue. It 
also asked how the Government planned to strengthen the provision of human rights 
education in schools, including through the school curricula and by ensuring the training of 
teachers. Additionally, Slovenia inquired how the Government intended to diminish the 
high drop-out rate of immigrant children, particularly in secondary education. Slovenia 
made recommendations. </p>


<p>39. The delegation stated that it was illegal to pay migrant workers less and to grant 
them fewer rights than those negotiated by the labour unions for other similar workers. As 
regards the Children&#8217;s House, it was stated that following its establishment in 1998, there 
</p>
<p>had been a dramatic increase in the level of social awareness of the sexual abuse of 
children. The child-friendly and professional environment at the Children&#8217;s House had 
facilitated a positive attitude toward reporting cases to the local Children&#8217;s Protection 
</p>
<p>Services, which in turn referred individual cases to the Children&#8217;s House for investigation. 
The Government Agency for Child Protection had also introduced additional measures in 
relation to violence against children and a pilot project aimed at supporting children in 
situations of domestic violence and ensuring their voices were heard.  
</p>
<p>40. Iceland recently adopted the so-called &#8220;Austrian model&#8221; which permitted the police 
to remove a violent person from the home in order to protect other members of the 
household.  This was a fundamental change from the previous approach, which had been to 
remove the women and children and place them in women&#8217;s shelters.  
</p>
<p>41. There were challenges in relation to custody and visitation in the area of domestic 
violence. A bill on a new children&#8217;s act, which will be before Parliament later in 2011, will 
address this matter. Judges and District Commissioners will be conferred the responsibility 
to access whether the child will be at the risk of violence. The bill will also incorporate the 
general principles from the Convention on the Rights of the Child into Iceland&#8217;s law.  
</p>
<p>42. The delegation stated that prostitution was a crime, but it was the purchase, 
advertising and facilitation of the act that was illegal in that the prostitute, child or grown-
up was always treated as a victim and not as an offender. On the issue of gender equality, 
the delegation stated that there was advancement towards gender equality. However, gender 
inequality persisted. Women were greatly underrepresented in management positions in 
private companies. Also, there was a gender pay gap despite legislation on equal pay for 
equal work. The Government has taken various measures to address this challenge. Gender-
budgeting would be a key concern in budget preparation and economic policy.     
</p>
<p>43. On the issue of prison conditions, it was reiterated that a new prison would be built 
and completed in the next few years. Once completed, the small and inadequate prisons 
could be closed. The new prison will have separate facilities for women, and prisoners 
could be separated in groups based on their different needs. A very small number of 
persons under the age of 18 could serve an unconditional sentence. Also, changes in the 
Execution of Sentences Act would result in prisoners completing their sentences by doing 
community service or they could be monitored electronically 
</p>
<p>44. In answer to questions on the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with disabilities it was stated that ratification was being prepared and was scheduled to take 
place in 2012. 
</p>
<p>45. In response to questions on discrimination on the base of race or ethnicity it was 
stated that various projects to fight discrimination had been launched in recent years and 
more comprehensive legislation was being prepared. 
</p>
<p>46. Regarding the challenge of preservation of the welfare system during the financial 
crisis, the important role of the Welfare Watch in monitoring the welfare service and 
making recommendations to the government was underlined.   
</p>
<p>47. The delegation discussed efforts in the school system and a new school legislation 
and curriculum as well as efforts to minimize the high drop-out rate of immigrant from the 
upper secondary-schools.  
</p>
<p>48. Further, the delegation mentioned efforts to strengthen the independence of the 
judiciary.  </p>


<p>49. Spain<b> </b>noted steps taken by Iceland to recognize same-sex marriage and to grant the 
judiciary greater independence. It noted that article 62 of the Constitution determined that 
the Government should support and protect the Lutheran Evangelical Church while article 
65 established the equal treatment of all persons regardless of their religion. Spain asked if 
the current wording of the Constitution could be seen as implying discrimination against 
other religions and whether it wouldn&#8217;t be desirable to adopt a neutral formulation that 
avoided Government action in that area. Spain made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>50. Argentina commended Iceland for the application of positive measures in the areas 
of the fight against discrimination and smuggling of persons as well as the adoption of 
programmes for the resettlement of refugees. Argentina made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>51. Chile<b> </b>noted that Iceland had a comprehensive legal human rights protection 
framework. It also noted the participation of women in the institutional and political life of 
the country and the high level or their participation in the work force. Chile additionally 
took note that Iceland was one of the first countries to be affected by the world financial 
crisis, and that this hampered aspects of its welfare society. It asked for more information 
on the steering Committee, known as Welfare Watch, appointed by the Government to 
monitor welfare issues following the crisis. Chile made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>52. Sweden<b> </b>welcomed the efforts made by Iceland to promote human rights. With 
regards to the inadequate capacity in the prison system, Sweden welcomed the plans to 
expand capacity by constructing a new prison. It noted concerns that State church priests 
were introducing Christian beliefs to children, often without parental consent. Sweden 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>53. Hungary<b> </b>noted, with satisfaction, the attention given by Iceland to the promotion of 
gender equality. However, recent surveys indicated that a significant gender-based salary 
gap continued to exist. It asked what concrete action was being considered to reduce this 
gap and to address stereotypes and attitudes on the traditional roles and responsibilities of 
men and women. Hungary also took positive note of action on the rights of persons with 
disabilities and in particular the fact that Icelandic Sign Language had been recognized as 
the first language of deaf people. Hungary made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>54. Thailand acknowledged the commitment of Iceland in ratifying the core 
international human rights instruments and the monitoring roles played by the ombudsman 
and other institutions. It applauded legislation promoting gender equality. Thailand 
appreciated the efforts made to combat violence against women, especially domestic 
violence and sex trafficking and to improve prison facilities. In this regard, it called on 
Iceland to consider the recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women to strengthen efforts to assist victims and the 
recommendations of the Committee against Torture regarding the improvement of prison 
facilities. Thailand made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55. Uruguay welcomed the Iceland&#8217;s decision to give priority to combating violence 
against women and the action plan to combat sexual and domestic violence against women 
and children. It noted, however, that domestic violence continued to be a problem. Uruguay 
highlighted the work of the State and of the Ombudsman for Children. Uruguay expressed 
its concern at the high number of cases of violence and sexual abuse of children. It noted 
the high number of international human rights instruments ratified. Uruguay made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>56. Afghanistan noted that Iceland&#8217;s system of law incorporated its international legal 
obligations into national legislation, ensuring implementation of human rights. 
Furthermore, Afghanistan acknowledged Iceland&#8217;s legislation on gender equality and its 
</p>
<p>efforts to combat discrimination and racism against minority groups, persons with 
disabilities and immigrants. Afghanistan made recommendations.  </p>


<p>57. The Republic of Moldova commended Iceland for developing mechanisms for the 
protection of human rights, including its consideration of the possibility of establishing a 
national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. It acknowledged 
efforts to promote gender equality and to fight domestic sexual violence, including through 
the National Action Plan against Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence and the work of 
the Emergency Reception Centre for Rape Victims. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>58. Israel noted efforts made by Iceland regarding education, health care, child care, 
gender equality, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, and the rights of 
persons with disabilities. Noting information given in the national report regarding 
challenges faced by Iceland due to the financial crisis, Israel raised concerns about the 
rights of vulnerable groups. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>59. The delegation emphasized that Iceland considered the dialogue and the reporting 
process to be an important contribution to its further enhancement of human rights 
protection. This process would serve as an important foundation for further work in the 
field of human rights. The delegation expressed its gratitude to those civil society 
organizations that sent submissions on the human rights situation in Iceland. Iceland placed 
great emphasis on an active dialogue with civil society organizations and highly valued the 
input received in preparation for the review. The delegation thanked member and observer 
States for the comments and recommendations received.
