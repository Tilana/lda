<p><i>Summary 
</i> At the invitation of the Government, the independent expert on the question of 
human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, undertook a mission to 
Ireland from 10 to 15 January 2011. The independent expert focuses her report on the 
impact of the economic and financial crises in Ireland, and the effect of recovery measures 
on the level of enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert recognizes the difficult situation faced by Ireland. However, 
the impact of the crises has been severe, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of 
Irish society. The independent expert reiterates that Ireland&#8217;s human rights obligations 
apply even during times of economic hardship, and that recovery measures must not 
disproportionately impact the poorest segments of society. 
</p>
<p> In this report, the independent expert looks at the enjoyment of human rights, in 
particular economic, social and cultural rights, by the most vulnerable individuals and 
groups, and provides concrete recommendations on how to implement a human rights-
based recovery in Ireland.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the independent expert on the question of 
human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, visited Ireland from 10 
to 15 January 2011. During this mission, the independent expert collected first-hand 
information on the human rights situation of people living in poverty and experiencing 
social exclusion. She focused in particular on the impact of the recent economic and 
financial crises, and the Government&#8217;s efforts to alleviate poverty and social exclusion at 
domestic and international levels. Her findings are documented in this report. 
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the independent expert met with various Government 
authorities, including the Minister for Equality, Human Rights and Integration, and 
representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach (Prime Minister), Foreign Affairs, 
Community, Equality and Gaeltacht (Irish language) Affairs; Social Protection; Justice and 
Law Reform; Health and Children; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and 
Education and Skills. She also met with representatives of the Irish Human Rights 
Commission, the Equality Authority, the Family Support Agency, the National Disability 
Authority, the Training and Employment Authority (F&#193;S), the Irish Naturalisation and 
Immigration Service, and the Reception and Integration Agency, as well as the office of the 
Ombudsman for Children. The independent expert and her team also held meetings with 
representatives of the Oireachtas (Parliament); the Parliamentary Sub-Committee on 
Overseas Development and the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs; 
representatives of Irish Aid; coordinators of the RAPID programme, based in Limerick; 
City Council; and the Dublin Homeless Consultative Forum.  
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert met with representatives of international organizations, non-
governmental organizations, community activists and academic independent experts. The 
Independent expert also met with numerous people living in poverty and experiencing 
social exclusion, who shared their personal experiences.  
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert thanks the Government of Ireland for its invitation and for 
the extensive and full support provided to her mission. She also extends her thanks to the 
departments and agencies for their efforts to provide her with the information and materials 
she needed, and to the civil society organizations and individuals for their substantial 
contribution to the mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  The legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>5.  The 1937 Irish Constitution guarantees a number of &#8220;fundamental rights&#8221;; primarily 
traditional civil and political rights such as equality before the law (art. 40(1)), the right to 
life, and freedoms of expression, assembly and association (art. 40(6)), as well as family 
rights (art. 41), property rights (art. 43), and the right to education (art. 42). Additionally, 
the Constitution refers to &#8220;directive principles of social policy,&#8221; which represent a 
commitment to realizing social justice. However, according to the Constitution, these 
&#8220;directive principles&#8221; should guide the making of laws and &#8220;shall not to be cognisable by 
any Court under any of the provisions of this Constitution&#8221; (art. 45).  
</p>
<p>6. In addition to the rights explicitly provided for in the Constitution, Irish courts have 
identified a number of rights which, although not expressly referred to, are nonetheless 
implied by the Constitution, such as the freedom from torture,1 the right to privacy2 and the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 <i>The State (C.) v. Frawley</i> [1976] IR 365. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>right to earn a livelihood.3 However, Irish courts have adopted a restrictive view of the role 
of the judiciary in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, in light of the 
constitutional &#8220;separation of powers&#8221; doctrine.4  
</p>
<p>7. Regardless of the limited protection accorded to economic, social and cultural rights 
in the Constitution, Ireland has voluntarily assumed several obligations under international 
law by signing and ratifying human rights treaties.5 Considering that under the Irish 
Constitution, international treaties do not have direct applicability unless they have been 
transposed into legislation by the Oireachtas,6 the independent expert calls on the 
Government to ensure that all rights protected under international human rights treaties, in 
particular economic, social and cultural rights, are given full effect in domestic law. The 
independent expert reminds Ireland that, given the character of international human rights 
obligations and the principle of good faith elaborated in the Vienna Convention on the Law 
of Treaties, it should comply with its treaty obligations in all spheres of activity, at the 
national and international levels, whether or not the specific wording of the treaty has been 
incorporated in domestic laws.  
</p>
<p>8. The independent expert stresses the need for Ireland to further its human rights 
commitments by ratifying and incorporating into domestic law international treaties to 
which it is not yet a party, such as the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment.  
</p>
<p>9. The independent expert commends Ireland for putting in place several legislative 
reforms and institutional arrangements to protect the human rights of the Irish people, such 
as the Civil Aid Act (1995), the National Human Rights Commission (2000), the Equality 
Authority and Equality Tribunal, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, 
Sexual and Gender-based Violence, and the Ombudsman Commission (2007) of the Garda 
S&#237;ochan&#225; (Police Service). These initiatives are crucial for the protection of those living in 
poverty, although there is still much room for improvement. 
</p>
<p>10. The legal aid scheme provided for under the Civil Aid Act (1995) plays an important 
role in enabling people living in poverty to access affordable legal assistance. Nevertheless, 
the independent expert is concerned that several areas of law that are particularly relevant 
for people living in poverty, such as eviction proceedings and local authority housing 
issues, are not included in the Act. The legal aid scheme does not provide for representation 
before the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The 
independent expert recommends that the Government consider including these tribunals in 
the legal aid scheme, as legal representation before them is vital for those living in poverty.

</p>
<p>11. The independent expert is concerned that recent budgetary cuts have affected the 
Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC), the Equality Authority (the main statutory body 
tasked with monitoring the implementation of equality legislation7), the Ombudsman for 
Children and the National Disability Authority. These cuts have substantially reduced 
Ireland&#8217;s capacity to protect the most disempowered segments of Irish society at a time 
when they are particularly susceptible to violations of their rights, and will have a negative 
impact on their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in the long-term. The 
Government should take all measures to provide these institutions with adequate resources 
to enable them to efficiently and effectively exercise their duties and functions, which 
become even more significant during times of crisis. 
</p>
<p>12. The independent expert is also concerned about the dismantling of the Combat 
Poverty Agency, which played a key role in increasing awareness and understanding of 
poverty, and influencing government policies. While this agency was integrated into the 
Social Inclusion Division of the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, 
the Government must ensure that the full range of the agency&#8217;s functions is transferred to 
the new division. In particular, the dissolution of the agency should not result in a reduction 
in the availability of independent research and evaluation of Government policies.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Poverty in Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>13. Since 1997, Ireland has been implementing a strategic approach to alleviating 
poverty and social exclusion. At the time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit, the strategy was 
guided by the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAP Inclusion), the 
National Development Plan 2007-2013, and the National Social Partnership Agreement, 
&#8220;Towards 2016&#8221;<i>.</i> Together, these plans set out a coherent and comprehensive programme 
of action to address poverty and social exclusion, while concentrating on a small number of 
high-level goals targeting long-standing social problems using a life-cycle approach. The 
independent expert welcomes these comprehensive plans, which were prepared in 
consultation with social partners (particularly Towards 2016). While the independent expert 
acknowledges that these strategies may need to be adapted to take into account the 
worsening economic situation, she encourages the Government to ensure as a minimum that 
the 23 high-level goals of Towards 2016 continue to be the primary target for its policies. It 
is essential that significant progress in the implementation of these goals continues and is 
periodically measured, even if full implementation of the goals is delayed due to current 
financial constraints. 
</p>
<p>14. The independent expert based her assessment of Ireland on the concept of poverty 
used by the Government: &#8220;people are living in poverty if their income and resources 
(material, cultural and social) are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard 
of living which is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally.&#8221;8 This definition refers 
to a relative concept of poverty that sets the threshold for assessment. Obviously, different 
countries have different levels of resources and their different circumstances must be taken 
into account when assessing efforts to combat existing levels of poverty and social 
exclusion. To assess compliance with economic, social and cultural rights obligations, the 
level of scrutiny for developed States, such as Ireland, is higher than for middle-income or 
low-income countries.  
</p>
<p>15. There are a number of indicators to measure progress in reducing poverty and social 
exclusion. The best known indicator at the European level is the &#8220;at risk of poverty&#8221; rate 
</p>
<p>  
 7 Employment Equality Act (1998), Equal Status Act (2000), and Equality Act (2004).

</p>
<p>that measures the proportion of people receiving income at levels below 60 per cent of the 
median income. The officially approved measure used in Ireland is &#8220;consistent poverty&#8221; 
which identifies the proportion of people with an income below 60 per cent of the median 
income who are deprived of two or more goods or services considered essential for a basic 
standard of living in Ireland. The consistent poverty measure clearly identifies those who 
are most vulnerable, and therefore are the primary concern of the independent expert.  
</p>
<p>16. According to the latest Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC),9 in 2009, 
the percentage of people &#8220;at risk of poverty&#8221; in Ireland was 14.1 per cent, while the 
percentage of people in &#8220;consistent poverty&#8221; was 5.5 per cent, an increase of 1.3 percentage 
points from the previous year.10 The most notable change in 2009 was the increase in the 
number of people experiencing two or more forms of deprivation, rising from 29.3 per cent 
in 2008, to 38.8 per cent in 2009.11  
</p>
<p>17. The target set by the NAP Inclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing 
consistent poverty to between 2 to 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating 
consistent poverty by 2016. The independent expert welcomes the fact that the draft 
national reform programme for Ireland under the Europe 2020 Strategy for recovery from 
the global economic and financial crises adopts this target.12 During the visit, the 
Government reiterated that the targets in the NAP Inclusion remained a Government 
priority.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Protecting human rights in times of budgetary constraints 
</b></p>
<p>18. For many years Ireland benefited from significant economic growth, enabling the 
government to make sustained investments in the social protection system and significantly 
reduce the prevalence of poverty. Since 2007, however, growth has slowed dramatically 
due to a number of factors related to the global economic and financial crises, such as the 
collapse of the Irish construction sector and associated property bubble, the collapse of the 
banking system, and the subsequent over-commitment of State resources to the 
recapitalization of Irish banks.13 Ireland&#8217;s economic and financial crises have wrought 
havoc on the country, with grave implications for the Irish people, increasing numbers of 
whom are unemployed and living in poverty and social exclusion. By the end of 2010, it 
was expected that Ireland would maintain an underlying deficit of 11.7 per cent of GDP.14 
Undoubtedly, Ireland faces real challenges in meeting the commitments of its poverty 
reduction strategies and improving levels of enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights, particularly by the most vulnerable in Irish society. 
</p>
<p>19. In order to address the serious impact of the crises, Ireland has agreed to an 
assistance programme (loan) provided by the European Union (EU) and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), as part of which, it is required to take serious steps towards 
rectifying Ireland&#8217;s budget imbalances. Accordingly, in November 2010, the Government 
laid out a National Recovery Plan for 2011-2014 (NRP), which proposed a range of 
budgetary adjustments designed to reduce the annual deficit to less than 3 per cent by 2014.

</p>
<p>The adjustments were to be front-loaded, with the Government intending to undertake 40 
per cent of the adjustment in 2011. Two-thirds of all budgetary adjustments will take the 
form of reductions in public expenditure; one-third will be comprised of tax- and revenue-
raising measures.15 
</p>
<p>20. On 7 March 2011, the new Government published their Programme for Government 
and National Recovery 2011-2016 (PGNR), to guide Ireland&#8217;s economic and social 
recovery from the crises. The PGNR sets out a program of adjustments and policies, 
introducing a number of new initiatives and retaining some of the previous recovery 
policies. The PGNR indicates that the Government has chosen to delay the achievement of 
a 3 per cent deficit to 201516 and to seek the renegotiation of the EU/IMF loan, particularly 
the applicable interest rate. 
</p>
<p>21. From a human rights perspective, many of the recovery measures proposed and 
pursued in successive budgets and recovery plans are concerning. While human rights do 
not dictate exactly what policy and budgetary measures States should pursue, such 
measures must comply with States&#8217; international human rights obligations. Human rights 
are not a policy option, dispensable during times of economic hardship. It is vital, therefore, 
that Ireland immediately undertakes a human rights review of all budgetary and recovery 
policies and ensures that it complies with the following fundamental human rights 
principles. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Using the maximum resources available  
</b></p>
<p>22. States must devote the maximum available resources to ensure progressive 
realization of all economic, social and cultural rights by its population, as expeditiously and 
effectively as possible.17 According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights (CESCR) (general comment No. 3, para. 12), this is so even during &#8220;times of severe 
resources constraints whether caused by a process of adjustment, economic recession, or by 
other factors.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>23. Despite its economic troubles, Ireland remains an affluent country with a relatively 
high GNP per person. An assessment of whether or not a State is using the maximum 
available resources to ensure compliance with economic, social and cultural rights 
obligations depends on how the State generates and mobilizes resources. In this context, the 
independent expert is concerned about the low level of taxation in Ireland, indeed lower 
than most other European countries.18 Low levels of domestic taxation revenue can be a 
major obstacle to a State&#8217;s ability to meet obligations to realize economic, social and 
cultural rights. The Government must ensure that the recovery policies, which to date have 
mainly focused on instituting cuts to public expenditure without significantly altering the 
taxation rate,19 are the most effective means of protecting the economic, social and cultural 
rights of the population, particularly the most disadvantaged groups in society. 
</p>
<p>24. While the State is entitled to decide the scale and pace of adjustments, the 
independent expert notes that seeking to achieve adjustments primarily through expenditure 
cuts rather than tax increases might have a major impact on the most vulnerable segments 
</p>
<p>

 17  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art. 2.  
 18 Ireland&#8217;s total tax take is around 30 per cent of GDP. The only countries in the EU-27 with a lower 
</p>
<p>percentage of GDP in tax revenue are Latvia, Slovakia and Romania. See <i>Taxation Trends in the 
European Union</i> (Eurostat, 2010), pp. 208-211 and 292.

</p>
<p>of society. Reductions in public expenditure affect the poorest and most vulnerable with the 
most severity, whereas some increase in taxation rates could place the burden on those who 
are better equipped to cope. It is critically important that Ireland adopt taxation policies that 
adequately reflect the need to harness all available resources towards the fulfilment of its 
economic, social and cultural rights obligations, while avoiding measures that might further 
endanger the enjoyment of human rights by those most at risk. By increasing its tax take, 
Ireland would decrease the need for cuts to public services and social protection, and 
thereby help to protect the most vulnerable from further damage. 
</p>
<p>25. Taxation reform that comes in the form of cuts, exemptions and waivers may also 
disproportionately benefit the wealthier segments of society, and discriminate against those 
living in poverty. In this respect, the independent expert welcomes some of the policy 
commitments in the PGNR that would ensure progressive taxation.20  
</p>
<p>26. The independent expert welcomes the efforts of the new Government to seek a 
reduction of the interest rate of the EU/IMF loan. A reduction in the interest rate would 
increase the funds available to Ireland to protect those most in need. The independent 
expert reminds member States of the European Union that, according to their obligations 
under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, they must do 
everything possible to ensure that their lending policies do not have a detrimental impact on 
the enjoyment of the Covenant&#8217;s rights by those living in poverty in the concerned 
country.21 She calls on members of the European Union to seriously consider acceding to 
Ireland&#8217;s request for a reduction in the interest rate. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Ensuring minimum essential levels of economic, social and cultural 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>27. As a State party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, Ireland has an immediate minimum core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at 
the very least, minimum essential levels of all economic, social and cultural rights.22 
</p>
<p>28. This principle obliges Ireland to ensure that any programmes or policies which are 
integral to delivering essential services (e.g. health care and social assistance) are protected, 
to the greatest extent possible, from reduced expenditure. In this context, reductions to 
disability services, community and voluntary services, and Traveller supports, as well as 
cuts to social protection, all have the potential to impede the delivery of essential services 
to the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>29. Even during times of severe resource constraints, Ireland must demonstrate that 
every effort has been made to use all resources that are at its disposal, in an effort to satisfy, 
as matter of priority, minimum essential levels of human rights.23 
</p>
<p><b> C. Avoiding deliberately retrogressive measures </b></p>
<p>30. Deliberately retrogressive measures that affect the level of enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights are, prima facie, a violation of the Covenant.24 In this context, the

<p>independent expert notes with concern the recent drastic budgetary reductions to, inter alia, 
the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth 
Affairs, Education and Skills, Equality Proofing, Disability Projects, and the Community 
and Voluntary Sector. These reductions have the potential to significantly undermine the 
effective and efficient functioning of health and education services and the social protection 
system, all of which are crucial for providing minimum essential levels of enjoyment of 
human rights, and protecting the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable members of 
society. 
</p>
<p>31. The independent expert welcomes the new Government&#8217;s commitment to 
overturning the reduction in the minimum wage. Any reduction in the minimum wage has 
the potential to have wide-ranging detrimental ramifications for the poorest and most 
excluded, and thus would be at great risk of constituting a retrogressive measure in 
violation of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Ensuring non-discrimination and equality </b></p>
<p>32. Ireland must ensure enjoyment of human rights equally and without discrimination 
of any kind. This is a fundamental pillar of the human rights framework. The scarcity of 
resources in times of economic hardship is not an acceptable justification for failing to 
implement the duty of non-discrimination, which must take precedence, both formally and 
substantively, in all recovery measures. These principles require Ireland to take special and 
positive measures to protect groups in society that have suffered from structural 
discrimination and to diminish or eliminate conditions that cause or help to perpetrate 
discrimination.25  
</p>
<p>33. In the Irish context, despite a strong body of equality legislation, several groups 
remain particularly vulnerable to discrimination and exclusion, including single mothers, 
children, Travellers, persons with disabilities, migrants, asylum-seekers and the homeless. 
In accordance with the human rights framework, Ireland should be particularly mindful that 
policies do not exacerbate the situation of such groups, and should take positive measures 
to help these vulnerable segments regain their equal footing with the rest of the society.  
</p>
<p>34. A number of recent measures are concerning in this respect, especially reductions in 
child benefits and benefits for job seekers, carers, single parent families, persons with 
disabilities and blind persons. The impact of these measures will be exacerbated by funding 
reductions for a number of social services which are essential for the same vulnerable 
people, including disability, community and voluntary services, Travellers supports, drug 
outreach initiatives, rural development schemes, the Revitalising Areas by Planning, 
Investment and Development (RAPID) programme and Youthreach.  
</p>
<p>35. By adopting these measures, Ireland runs a high risk of excluding those most in need 
of support and ignoring the needs of the most vulnerable. In particular, due to multiple 
forms of entrenched discrimination, women are especially vulnerable to the detrimental 
effects of reductions in social services and benefits. The independent expert notes the 
commitment in the PGNR to refrain from further reducing social protection benefits,26 but 
urges the State to take immediate steps to put in place protections to ensure that the 
situation of the most excluded and disadvantaged groups do not deteriorate further as a 
result of these measures.  
</p>

<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b> E. Allowing for participation, transparency and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>36. At the core of the human rights framework is an overarching requirement that all 
States take into consideration the principles of participation, transparency and 
accountability in the design, implementation and evaluation of State policies.27 These 
principles are integral both to ensuring effectiveness of the adopted policy, and responding 
to the obligations of States with regard to the rights to take part in public life, seek and 
receive information, and have access to effective remedies in cases of violation.  
</p>
<p>37. It is of real concern that Ireland did not undertake any meaningful efforts to ensure a 
broad national dialogue, with effective and meaningful participation of civil society and 
members of the public, when formulating its budgetary responses to the crises, and entering 
into the EU/IMF loan. This is particularly so given that a number of well-designed 
participatory mechanisms are already in place in Ireland which allow for the voices of the 
most vulnerable to be taken into account in the formulation of policy. Failure to ensure 
participation and transparency in the design of national policies seriously jeopardizes the 
State&#8217;s ability to respond to its human rights obligations, undermines the effectiveness of 
budgetary adjustment policies, and prevents the needs of the poorest and most excluded 
from being taken into account.  
</p>
<p>38. The independent expert welcomes the new Government&#8217;s commitment to making 
the budget process fully transparent and open to public scrutiny going forward, and 
encourages the utilization, support and strengthening of permanent structures and pathways 
for consultation with individuals, civil society, trade unions, community organizations, 
grassroots movements, and the academic community. She also urges the Government to 
reverse reductions in funding to the voluntary sector, and local and community 
development programmes, which further impede participation and thus compromise 
Ireland&#8217;s compliance with human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Providing international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>39. State parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
have a clear collective obligation to provide international assistance and cooperation 
towards the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. Developed States have a 
particular obligation to do so.28 While there is no concrete legal requirement for States to 
provide any specific type or amount of overseas development assistance (ODA), States 
have repeatedly affirmed their commitment to achieving ODA of 0.7 per cent of GNP, as an 
initial objective. The successful achievement of the target should not be an excuse for those 
States with available resources to evade their ongoing obligations regarding international 
assistance and cooperation. Additionally, States must make efforts to increase their ODA, 
even during times when resources are constrained.  
</p>
<p>40. The independent expert commends Ireland for its impressive efforts to comply with 
its international assistance obligations. Irish Aid, the programme which administers the 
provision of Irish ODA, has a laudable reputation in the international donor community.29 
The independent expert welcomes the strong focus of Irish Aid programmes on social 
infrastructure and social protection initiatives, but recommends that Ireland strengthen its

</p>
<p>ODA provision by further incorporating human rights principles into its policy guidelines 
and strategies.  
</p>
<p>41. The great value that Irish society accords to international development assistance is 
reflected in the considerable efforts to increase Ireland&#8217;s investments in ODA, which is now 
equivalent to 0.53 per cent of its gross national product (GNP).30 In light of the important 
contribution made by Irish Aid, it is unfortunate that there has been a reduction in the 
budgetary allocation to ODA.31 However, the independent expert welcomes the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to continue to work towards the achievement of 0.7 per cent 
ODA by 2015.32 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Measures that pose a potential threat to the human rights of 
the most vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p>42. The independent expert recognizes the serious economic and financial difficulties 
that Ireland confronts at this time. However, these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse 
to disregard human rights obligations or prioritize other issues over the realization of 
human rights. The following measures may pose a specific threat to the enjoyment of 
human rights by the most vulnerable sectors of society. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Eroding the social protection system  
</b></p>
<p>43. Ireland must be commended for its considerable efforts over the last decade to 
expand and improve the social protection system, which encompasses both contributory 
payments and non-contributory social assistance. From 2000 to 2009, total social welfare 
expenditure in Ireland increased more than three-fold. The beneficial impact of this on the 
prevalence of poverty and exclusion in Ireland is demonstrably clear: in 2009, social 
transfers decreased the number of people at risk of poverty by 69 per cent, and around one 
third of all people in Ireland were benefiting from some form of social transfer.33  
</p>
<p>44. The vital role that social protection systems play in facilitating the enjoyment of 
multiple economic, social and cultural rights has been detailed extensively by the 
independent expert in her previous reports,34 and the importance of comprehensive social 
protection systems in overcoming the impact of the global economic and financial crises is 
elaborated at length in the independent expert&#8217;s main report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/17/34). Reductions in the levels of social protection benefits will impede Ireland&#8217;s 
ability to comply with its legally binding human rights obligations. By undermining social 
protection, the Government limits the enjoyment of minimum levels of economic, social 
and cultural rights by all groups in society.  
</p>
<p>45. The independent expert welcomes the indication in the PGNR that the Government 
will not further reduce the level of social protection benefits. She also calls on the 
Government to review some of the previous cuts in social protection and to address some 
pre-existing features of the system that restrict the ability of the poor and disadvantaged to 
enjoy their human right to social security. Of utmost concern is the requirement that many 
beneficiaries of social transfers must be &#8220;habitually resident&#8221; in Ireland in order to qualify

</p>
<p>to receive benefits.35 The habitual residency status requirement represents a considerable 
obstacle for members of vulnerable groups, particularly people experiencing homelessness, 
Travellers, asylum-seekers and refugees, migrant workers and returning Irish migrants, to 
access services to which they are entitled. Any unfair exclusion from the protection of 
social transfers is unacceptable from a human rights perspective.  
</p>
<p>46. The independent expert notes the Government&#8217;s decision to amalgamate 
employment and training services and social protection measures under an all-inclusive 
National Employment and Entitlements Service within the Department of Social Protection, 
replacing the Irish National Training and Employment Authority (F&#193;S).36 It is vital that the 
Government ensures that this Service is designed and implemented from a human rights 
perspective, such that it improves beneficiaries&#8217; access to assistance and does not create 
further administrative barriers to claiming their entitlements. The independent expert 
recommends that the Government ensure widespread consultation with beneficiaries when 
establishing the Service in order for it to adequately respond to their needs.  
</p>
<p>47. The independent expert is concerned about the lack of standard implementation of 
eligibility criteria in the social protection system, which results in a large number of appeals 
to the Social Welfare Appeals Office being ultimately decided in favour of the appellant.37 
The transparency of the social protection system should be enhanced so that beneficiaries 
have access to clear information about the criteria and process by which decisions are 
made. The decisions of the Social Welfare Appeals Office should be published in a form 
which allows for broad dissemination and understanding among existing and potential 
beneficiaries. Efficiency in making and publishing decisions should be a priority, thus the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to clearing the backlog of appeals pending before the Office is 
a welcome move. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Undermining public service delivery 
</b></p>
<p>48. While reforming the public service to ensure that resources are utilized effectively 
and services delivered efficiently is an essential measure, particularly in times of crisis, 
States must ensure that such measures do not impact on the quality and availability of 
services provided to the most vulnerable segments of society.  
</p>
<p>49. The independent expert stresses that considerable reductions in public sector staff 
and wages may severely impede the delivery of social services. Limited or decreased staff 
numbers, and reduction in remuneration to the providers of public services, particularly 
education and health care, could drastically impact on individuals&#8217; ability to easily and 
effectively access such services. These measures may impact disproportionately on people 
living in poverty, particularly those in rural areas and the most disadvantaged, who already 
face numerous barriers in accessing health care and education services. By adopting such 
policies, Ireland may jeopardize its ability to enable the widest possible enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights, and runs a risk of violating the prohibition against 
unjustified retrogressive measures.

</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Regressive taxation policies 
</b></p>
<p>50. As described above, the Government must ensure that taxation policies protect the 
most vulnerable from further disadvantage and do not take a disproportionate toll on those 
already experiencing poverty and exclusion. The independent expert notes with concern the 
introduction of the Universal Social Charge.38  
</p>
<p>51.   While the independent expert encourages Ireland to rethink the extent to which 
taxation revenue is maximized in order to provide for the realization of economic, social 
and cultural rights, the Government must be vigilant in balancing the need to increase 
taxation revenue with its responsibilities to protect the most vulnerable and prevent against 
further engenderment of inequality. The independent expert welcomes the commitment of 
the new Government to review the Universal Social Charge and reduce some tax benefits, 
as well as ensure implementation of a minimum effective tax rate for very high income 
earners.39 
</p>
<p><b> D. Adopting employment activation policies </b></p>
<p>52. Widespread unemployment has been one of the most harmful consequences of the 
economic and financial crises in Ireland. By January 2011, 13.4 per cent of the population 
of Ireland were unemployed, 116,400 more people than in January 2009.40 This drastic 
increase has had many negative ramifications for Ireland&#8217;s economy and society, including 
a marked enlargement in the number of people relying on unemployment benefits and other 
forms of income support provided by the social protection system. 
</p>
<p>53. As a means of addressing the added burden on public expenditure generated by 
increased unemployment, Ireland has taken measures to implement new, and scale-up 
existing, employment and training activation schemes that require participants to participate 
in community employment or training programs in order to receive unemployment benefits. 
While the independent expert welcomes the Government&#8217;s efforts to tackle unemployment 
by addressing skills development and reinserting people into the labour market, she reminds 
the Government that employment activation policies must be implemented from a human 
rights approach. 
</p>
<p>54. States should recall the obligations of non-discrimination and equality which oblige 
them to ensure that activation policies do not represent a larger burden to certain 
individuals or groups in society, such as single parents and persons with disabilities. This is 
particularly important when individuals are required to enter the job market in times of 
recession and high unemployment. The State must also ensure that vulnerable groups have 
equal access to training programmes, and that gender concerns are taken into account.  
Considering that women undertake a disproportionately large share of child care and 
household tasks, measures must be in place to ensure that they are not unjustifiably 
excluded from programmes. Activation policies should be designed to increase the  
participation of women in the labour market, while enabling them (in particular, single 
mothers) to balance employment and parenting. Employment schemes and training 
programmes must provide child-care and after-school facilities. Furthermore, activation 
policies should be complemented by participatory mechanisms through which individuals 
can provide feedback and input. Information about activation policies must be widely

<p>disseminated in order to ensure that participants understand their responsibilities and 
entitlements. 
</p>
<p>55. While job creation is an integral part of any economic recovery, it is vital that 
Ireland direct its efforts towards generating opportunities for sustainable, productive, decent 
work in which individuals can exercise and realize their human rights. To this end, the 
independent expert welcomes the introduction of the Commission of Taxation and Social 
Welfare to examine the interaction between employment and social protection to ensure 
that work is financially worthwhile. 
</p>
<p><b> VI.  The situation of people vulnerable to poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Children 
</b></p>
<p>56. Historically, Ireland has had a relatively high rate of income poverty among 
children, by international standards. The Government has made laudable efforts to address 
this situation, resulting in significant decreases in the prevalence of child poverty and 
deprivation for most of the past decade.41 The primary factor in the reduction of child 
poverty has been the considerable investments in social protection measures, including the 
tripling of child benefit payments between 2000 and 2007,42 increasing payments to single-
parent families, and introducing the Early Childcare Supplement. The proportion of 
children living below the 60 per cent threshold fell by 20 per cent from 2005 to 2009, and 
the consistent poverty rate among children decreased between 2006 and 2008.43 
</p>
<p>57. In recent years significant policy attention has been given to addressing child 
poverty, which is reflected in the NAP Inclusion&#8217;s identification of &#8220;adequate income 
support for children&#8221; as a high-level goal.44 However, despite the advances made, since 
2008, child poverty has again been on the increase. Today, children are the group most 
vulnerable to poverty in Ireland. In 2009, 8.7 per cent of children were living in consistent 
poverty, an increase of 38 per cent over the previous year.45 One in every six children in 
Ireland (18.6 per cent) is at risk of poverty.46  
</p>
<p>58. The independent expert is concerned that recent budgetary adjustments will pose an 
additional threat to the already precarious situation of children in Ireland. According to 
UNICEF, were it not for government intervention in the form of social transfers and taxes, 
child poverty rates in Ireland would triple.47 The reduction of the child benefit payment by 
15 per cent in 2011 (on top of a 10 per cent cut in 2010) will undoubtedly lead to an 
additional increase in child poverty rates. While measures have been taken to compensate 
families with low incomes for the reduction in child benefits,48 these payments are 
subjected to restricted eligibility criteria that may exclude children in need of support.

</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>Moreover, these cuts represent a move away from the universal child benefits, which have 
been an effective and non-stigmatizing tool to address child poverty.  
</p>
<p>59. While cuts are affecting all families with children (across all income brackets) they 
will have a disproportionate impact on children living in households that rely on other 
forms of social protection assistance, particularly those with single parents, jobless 
households and households with persons with disabilities. These households are hit harder 
by the cumulative impact of reductions to a range of social protection payments and the 
rising costs of child-related expenditures.49  
</p>
<p>60. Combating child poverty requires a set of comprehensive measures, including 
adequate income support and investments in public services such as education and health. 
Reduction in funding to public services will impact the accessibility and quality of health 
and education services for children. For instance, the recent cuts to the school transport 
scheme, and the introduction of additional fees for post-primary pupils, will place 
additional financial burden on struggling families.  
</p>
<p>61. The independent expert notes that Ireland has allocated additional funds in recent 
budgets to meet the rising demand for medical cards, an initiative that improves access to 
health services for children living in low-income families. However, the introduction of a 
50-cent charge on all prescription medicines means that families with children who require 
regular prescription medication for chronic illnesses will pay more for vital medication 
each month.  
</p>
<p>62. As a State party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Ireland must ensure, 
inter alia, that each and every child in the country has a standard of living adequate for 
his/her physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, and full access to the best 
available health-care services, free primary education and social protection (arts. 24, 26-
28). The State must comply with these obligations to the maximum extent of its available 
resources (art. 4), even during times of economic hardship.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Older persons 
</b></p>
<p>63. Older people, the majority of whom are women, constitute 11 per cent of Ireland&#8217;s 
population;50 by 2050, they will be 29 per cent.51 Due to a substantial increase in recent 
years in contributory and non-contributory pensions received by older people, they have 
among the lowest level of poverty of any group in Ireland. The protection offered by 
pensions and other social transfers is so significant that it represents 60 per cent of older 
persons&#8217; income, and reduces their risk of poverty rate from 88 per cent to 9.6 per cent.52 
</p>
<p>64. Considering the vital role of social protection in providing older people with income 
security, and the great dependency of older people on the provision of quality social 
services (such as health services, home-care packages and accommodation), it is crucial 
that Ireland maintain its investments in social protection benefits, as well as the provision of 
public services provided to older people. In this regard, the independent expert notes with 
concern proposals to progressively reduce pensions paid to public service pensioners53 at 
the same time as immediately increasing the pension age to 66 and gradually to 68. There is

<p>real concern that these measures will have a major impact on poverty rate among older 
people.  
</p>
<p>65. Moreover, many older people will suffer the cumulative effect of several austerity 
measures, including the introduction of a prescription charge, means-tested access to 
medical cards, reduction in home-care hours and services, and in day care services. These 
measures will have a disproportionate impact on older people who depend on these services 
in order to enjoy a minimum essential standard of living and to remain in their own homes 
and communities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>66. A significant number of people with disabilities in Ireland are living in consistent 
poverty.54 Persons with disabilities face discrimination in the education system and in the 
labour market. They are significantly under-represented in the labour market and in the 
achievement of educational qualifications, which constitute significant areas of exclusion, 
making them especially vulnerable to poverty, particularly due to the other social and 
financial burdens that they encounter. 
</p>
<p>67. Poverty and social exclusion among persons with disabilities is an ingrained, 
structural problem in Ireland, requiring a comprehensive approach from the State. In this 
regard, the independent expert welcomes the comprehensive approach of Ireland&#8217;s National 
Disability Strategy (NDS), which includes many of the rights and obligations enunciated in 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. For example, there have been 
significant developments in special education over the last decade, through enhanced 
provision, and new structural and legislative frameworks for the delivery of services to 
pupils with special educational needs. However, further efforts must be made to ensure that 
the NDS is fully and effectively implemented. In this regard, the independent expert 
welcomes the commitment in the PGNR to publishing a realistic plan for the 
implementation of the NDS. 
</p>
<p>68. The need for a fully implemented comprehensive NDS is particularly pressing in 
light of the clear threat that Ireland&#8217;s budgetary adjustments pose to the human rights of 
persons with disabilities. The decision to reduce the disability allowance, in conjunction 
with other budgetary measures that disproportionately affect the poorest and most 
vulnerable, will have serious consequences for persons with disabilities. Of particular 
concern are the successive reductions in funding to the community and voluntary sector, 
which provides nearly 60 per cent of health and personal support services to persons with 
disabilities.55  
</p>
<p>69. The Government is urged to heed the advice of the National Disability Authority to 
establish a statutory framework of standardization and regulation of residential services for 
persons with disabilities. The independent expert also calls on the Government to meet 
other commitments in relation to persons with disabilities, including increasing the 
employment, training and education of persons with disabilities in order to ensure they 
receive adequate levels of income, as committed to in the NAP Inclusion,56 and developing 
a Recession Implementation Plan for the NDS in order to ensure its continued delivery.

</p>
<p><b> D. Single parents </b></p>
<p>70. Approximately one in six children in Ireland lives in a single-parent household,57 86 
per cent of which are headed by single mothers.58 Poverty rates among single-parent 
households are alarming: in 2009 almost 17 per cent of people living in single-parent 
households were in consistent poverty, the highest consistent poverty rate for any 
household category in Ireland.59 People living in single-parent households were also the 
most vulnerable to poverty, experiencing the highest risk of poverty rate (35.5 per cent) in 
2009.60  
</p>
<p>71. The One Parent Family Payment (OPFP), the single parents&#8217; weekly means-tested 
social welfare payment, has been subject to consecutive reductions over the past two years, 
and in January 2011, it was cut by a further 4 per cent. In a climate of rising unemployment 
and scarce job opportunities, and in combination with cuts to other social welfare payments 
relied upon by single parent families, this substantial loss of income will undoubtedly affect 
the vulnerability of single-parent households to poverty, and seriously diminish the 
possibilities of these parents to provide for their children&#8217;s basic material needs.  
</p>
<p>72. The independent expert notes that the new Government intends to gradually phase 
out the OPFP, and replace it with a parental allowance, in order to eliminate disincentives 
to taking up employment or getting married which are inherent in the OPFP. She cautions 
the Government to ensure that implementation of the parental allowance does not result in 
the exclusion of beneficiaries or the creation of further barriers for them.  
</p>
<p>73. Single mothers, representing the vast majority of single parents in Ireland, encounter 
specific obstacles preventing them from participating on an equal basis in the work market. 
Research shows that even during times of economic growth in Ireland, single mothers with 
pre-school children were one of the few exceptions to the general rising tide of labour-
market participation.61 One of the major obstacles to employment for single parents is the 
cost of child-care services in Ireland, which are among the highest in Europe. In this 
context, the independent expert welcomes the recent introduction of the one-year Early 
Childhood Education Scheme, and calls on the Government to ensure that the universal pre-
school year is of high quality, fully implemented and expanded.  
</p>
<p>74. An additional area of concern for single-parent families is the issue of adequate 
housing. In 2008, 36 per cent of all single-parent households were on the waiting list for 
social housing. One fifth of all people who relied on a rent supplement to meet their rental 
costs were single parents.62 The independent expert calls on the State to ensure that single 
parents have access to adequate housing as a matter of priority, and to eliminate 
requirements of the rent supplement payment that could disproportionately impact them.

<p><b> E. Travellers </b></p>
<p>75. Many social stereotypes and prejudices against Travellers persist in Irish society, 
and are manifested in discrimination that greatly restricts their access to social and

<p>economic opportunities.  Despite policy efforts in recent years, the Traveller community 
continues to suffer from structural discrimination that causes and perpetuates their 
vulnerability to poverty. Particularly striking is their unequal health situation. According to 
recent studies, Traveller men can expect to die 15 years earlier than the average Irish 
male,63 and Traveller infants are 3.6 times more likely to die than infants in the general 
population.64 This level of inequality is simply unacceptable in Ireland, and must be the 
immediate focus of State action.  
</p>
<p>76. It is not sufficient to simply rely on mainstreaming Travellers in the Irish health 
system; addressing structural disadvantage requires affirmative action to eliminate 
conditions which have caused or helped to perpetrate inadequate access to health services in 
the past. The independent expert urges Ireland to develop, with the meaningful participation 
of the Traveller community, a new National Traveller Health Strategy in order to support 
the Traveller community&#8217;s enjoyment of the right to health on equal footing with the rest of 
Irish society.  
</p>
<p>77. One factor contributing to the diminished health status of Traveller communities is 
the lack of well-equipped halting sites accessible by nomadic Traveller groups. Some 
Travellers are forced to halt on unauthorized halting sites with poor conditions and 
minimum sanitary facilities,65 which impedes their enjoyment of an adequate standard of 
living, and places them at risk of criminal charges<i>.</i>66 The Government should ensure that 
local authorities take steps to provide safe, authorized halting sides with adequate 
amenities, in consultation with Traveller organizations and groups.  
</p>
<p>78. Another crucial area of concern is the Traveller community&#8217;s lack of access to, and 
equal participation in, the education system. More than two thirds of Travellers aged 15 or 
over have no secondary or tertiary education.67 While the independent expert acknowledges 
the Government&#8217;s well-intentioned efforts to mainstream Traveller children in the 
education system, she stresses that mainstreaming is not sufficient to rectify the serious 
structural lack of inclusion which leads to the imbalance in access to education. The 
independent expert recognizes that in many cases Travellers make a conscious decision, 
based on a number of cultural and social factors, not to remain in higher education. The 
State should be respectful of this decision while removing barriers to education and 
encouraging Traveller children to remain in education where possible. Ireland should also 
support efforts by adult Travellers who wish to return to education or training. 
</p>
<p>79. Lower education outcomes are one of the main barriers to greater levels of 
employment for Travellers. The drastic rise in general unemployment, as a result of the 
economic and financial crises, will undoubtedly exacerbate this situation even further, 
particularly because Travellers are generally employed in informal or seasonal jobs which 
are more vulnerable during times of economic hardship. Ireland should take measures to 
ensure that training and employment initiatives are available, and are economically and 
socially accessible by members of the Traveller community. The introduction of 
employment activation policies with respect to social protection benefits should take into 
account the difficulties that Travellers will experience meeting activation obligations, 
particularly those Travellers who continue to live a nomadic and extended family lifestyle.  
</p>
<p>80. To assist Travellers in overcoming the entrenched discrimination that they suffer, 
the independent expert echoes the recommendation of the Committee on the Elimination of

<p>Racial Discrimination that the Irish Government should adopt the principle of self-
identification and officially recognize the Traveller community as an ethnic group 
(CERD/C/IRL/CO/3-4). This may help to enhance the respect and legitimacy accorded to 
Travellers and to minimize the social exclusion they experience. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Migrants </b></p>
<p>81. The migrant population in Ireland has increased dramatically over the last decade, 
with migrants now representing over 10 per cent of Ireland&#8217;s total population 
(CERD/IRL/C/3-4, para. 16). Because migrants tend to be in informal employment, under 
often precarious conditions, they have been particularly exposed to wage decreases and lay-
offs during the crises, especially since many migrants were attracted to Ireland by the boom 
in the construction sector, and were thus vulnerable to the burst of the housing bubble. The 
situation of migrants in Ireland, in the aftermath of the crises, is even more precarious as 
they suffer from a lack of access to social protection due to the requirement that 
beneficiaries be habitually resident in Ireland. Without adequate income to support them in 
Ireland or enable them to return to their home countries, many migrants have fallen into 
poverty and even homelessness since the onset of the crises.  
</p>
<p>82. The Government must ensure that special measures are in place to support and assist 
the migrant population in Ireland, a process which should begin with ratification of the 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. The independent expert welcomes the Intercultural Education Strategy 2010-2015 
(IES) aimed at developing an intercultural learning environment, based on inclusion and 
integration throughout the education system.68 Education is a key means of ensuring 
poverty reduction and social inclusion, and the Government should continue to pursue 
policies which facilitate the education and integration of Ireland&#8217;s migrant children, who 
comprise 6 per cent of the total child population of Ireland.69 The Government should also 
ensure that budgetary adjustments do not adversely affect the migrant population who are 
already experiencing economic and social disadvantage. Recent measures to reduce the 
number of language-support teachers in schools stand in blunt contrast to the high-level 
goals of the IES, and jeopardize migrant children&#8217;s chances of attaining sufficient 
educational support and social integration. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Homeless people and people living in substandard housing conditions </b></p>
<p>83. The need for social housing in Ireland has escalated dramatically in recent years, so 
that in 2008, 56,249 households were in need of social-housing support (an increase of 30 
per cent from 2005) but were not currently receiving it.70 This urgent need is still not being 
met and waiting lists continue to grow as the ramifications of the crises are felt by the most 
vulnerable. The fact that such waiting lists exist in the context of a housing crisis which has 
created a large surplus of housing stock throughout the country, is evidence of the 
complexity of the problem.

</p>
<p>84. The recent 36-per-cent reduction in the allocation to social housing71 will impact 
significantly on the capacity of local authorities and housing associations to both finish 
existing projects and provide new housing to those who have lost their jobs and their 
homes, as well as groups with special needs, at a time when demand for social housing is 
soaring.  
</p>
<p>85. Ensuring that everyone in the country enjoys adequate accommodation is an 
obligation with which Ireland must comply without delay, giving priority to vulnerable 
groups, such as families headed by single parents, persons with disabilities, older people 
and the homeless. Doing so will require innovative and comprehensive solutions, including 
greater utilization of existing housing stock, provision of additional units by local 
authorities, and greater use of private, voluntary and cooperative housing sectors. In this 
respect, the independent expert is pleased that the Government has indicated its intention to 
introduce a staged purchase scheme to increase the stock of social housing, and to enable 
larger housing associations and local authorities to access private-sector funding for social 
housing.72 
</p>
<p>86. The independent expert appeals to the Government to fully implement its existing 
strategy to address the root causes of homelessness.73 In particular, she stresses that the 
State must honour the commitment made in Towards 2016 to eliminate &#8220;long-term 
homelessness&#8221; (people in emergency accommodation for more than six months) by the end 
of 2010. The independent expert also welcomes the recent decision to reduce reliance on 
the rent supplement and move eligible applicants to the Rental Accommodation Scheme 
(RAS), an additional housing option enabling local authorities to provide accommodation. 
She calls on the State to ensure that this process is done efficiently and in accordance with a 
human rights approach. 
</p>
<p>87. Despite current financial constraints, Ireland must take measures to solve the long-
term housing needs in the country from a rights-based approach, which necessitates focus 
on the type and quality of accommodation being provided. In this vein, the independent 
expert is alarmed by the information that she received during her mission on the 
substandard housing conditions in some of the rent-supplement accommodations, and urges 
the Government to ensure the effective enforcement of the Housing (Standards for Rental 
Houses) Regulations 2008 and 2009. 
</p>
<p>88. During her mission, the independent expert visited the Fatima regeneration project 
in Dublin. This project provides a good example of community participation in the 
decision-making process that should be ensured in other projects, such as the Dolphin 
House project in the Rialto area. The State should consider adopting a legislative 
framework for a National Public Housing Estates Regeneration Programme to ensure that 
international human rights standards and community participation are ensured in all 
regeneration projects in the country. The independent expert also calls on the Government 
to ensure sustained funding and support to homeless centres, such as Sundial House and the 
Focus Ireland Coffee Shop and Housing Advice Centre in Dublin, which provide vital 
support and assistance to the homeless community.

<p><b> H. Asylum-seekers and refugees </b></p>
<p>89. Ireland has historically displayed considerable solidarity towards asylum-seekers 
and refugees. While welcoming this generosity, the independent expert is concerned about 
some aspects of the situation of asylum-seekers.  
</p>
<p>90. The independent expert is concerned that today, more than one third of asylum-
seekers supported by the Direct Provision System (DPS) &#8211; which provides asylum-seekers 
with accommodation and support at all stages of the asylum process and beyond, up to 
resolution of the case, and which was originally designed to support asylum-seekers for 
short period of time (up to 6 months) only &#8211;, spend more than three years in such 
accommodations.74 While the facilities are generally reported to be in good condition, and 
asylum-seekers receive full-board accommodation and a small weekly allowance,75 the 
DPS limits the autonomy of asylum-seekers and impedes their family life, as most 
accommodation centres have not been designed for long-term reception of asylum-seekers 
and are not conducive to family life.76 Moreover, asylum-seekers under the DPS are denied 
access to social welfare (e.g. rent supplement and child benefit) and the right to work.77 
Ensuring access to the labour market is an essential element of complying with the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 6), which set outs 
compulsory obligations for all States and which should take priority over political concerns 
such as the &#8220;pull factor&#8221; for new asylum-seekers.  
</p>
<p>91. Living under such conditions for an extended period of time severely affects the 
social inclusion of asylum-seekers, as well as their capacity to return to work (in Ireland or 
in their country of origin), and could have a major impact on the realization of their right to 
physical and mental health. The independent expert reminds Ireland that asylum-seekers 
and refuges must be guaranteed the enjoyment of all human rights, including the right to 
privacy and family life78, an adequate standard of living,79 and adequate standards of 
physical and mental health,80 rights that complement the provisions of the 1951 Refugee 
Convention.  
</p>
<p>92. The independent expert calls on the Government to quickly adopt a single procedure 
for determining refugee and subsidiary protection claims, with strong protection elements, 
and to ensure that asylum-seekers enjoy the full range of economic, social and cultural 
rights, including the right to work. She also calls on the State to fully implement the 
</p>
<p>  
 74 In December 2010, an estimated 2,778 of the 6,107 people living in Direct Provision Centres had 
</p>
<p>been there for more than 36 months, and more than 1,200 had been there for between 24 to 36 
months.  See RIA Monthly Report, December 2010, pp. 8 and 20. 
</p>
<p> 75 The Direct Provision allowance is &#8364;19.10 per adult, and &#8364;9.60 per child. In addition to this allowance, 
asylum-seekers receive a medical card providing free medical services for them and their family 
members.  
</p>
<p> 76 Most of the centres were not built for the purpose of accommodating asylum-seekers and only 8 per 
cent of residents are in self-catering centres where they are allowed to cook their own food. See RIA 
Value for Money Report, May 2010, p. 21.

</p>
<p>93. The independent expert is also concerned about the impact that the consecutive cuts 
to the budget of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) may have on the 
status determination procedure for asylum-seekers. She calls on the State to ensure that it 
has the appropriate resources to deal with all cases in a timely and fair manner.   
</p>
<p>94. The independent expert welcomes the recent introduction of provisions to place 
unaccompanied separated children in foster care,82 and calls on the State to ensure that 
appropriate training and monitoring mechanisms are in place to ensure the best interests of 
the child are given priority in all matters affecting asylum-seeking and refugee children.   
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The independent expert recognizes the difficult situation that Ireland faces in 
the aftermath of the economic and financial crises, but reminds the State of its 
continuing obligations to comply with human rights standards. While Ireland has 
made impressive advances in poverty reduction over the past decade, these gains will 
be reversed if those living in poverty and social exclusion are not protected during the 
recovery. The crises provide an opportunity for Ireland to put human rights at the 
heart of the recovery, and to meet some of its long-standing social goals. The burden 
of the crises must be shared by all segments of Irish society, while those living in 
poverty and social exclusion must be protected as a matter of priority.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The report includes detailed recommendations in each of its sections, but the 
independent expert would like to especially urge Ireland to take the following steps:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Strengthen the legal and institutional framework by giving domestic 
legal effect to Ireland&#8217;s international human rights obligations, and ratifying and 
incorporating into domestic law international, treaties to which it is not yet party; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Review its Programme for Government and National Recovery to ensure 
that it complies with human rights principles, particularly the obligation to use the 
maximum resources available and to not take retrogressive measures in the protection 
of economic, social and cultural rights, and consider reversing those measures which 
will disproportionately impact on the most vulnerable and excluded, particularly 
reductions in social protection payments and funding to public services; and 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Strengthen the social protection system, infrastructure and social 
services to ensure the full enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights of the 
population, and remove barriers that prevent the most vulnerable segments of society 
from accessing their entitlements. 
</b></p>
