<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 24/31, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a report1 on the 
activities undertaken by the Office, other relevant United Nations agencies and, where 
applicable, regional organizations, to support efforts by States to promote and protect the 
rights of persons with disabilities in their national legislation, policies and programmes, 
including to mainstream disability in development efforts.2 
</p>
<p>2. To this end, OHCHR invited contributions from all United Nations agencies and 
regional organizations, and received three responses: two from agencies,3 namely the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO), and one from a regional organization, namely the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). OHCHR also consulted separately the 
technical secretariat of the United Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, which is managed by the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP). The full texts of all submissions received are available on the OHCHR website.4 
</p>
<p><b> II. Technical cooperation on the rights of persons 
with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was adopted by the 
United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 2006 and entered into force on 3 May 
</p><p>2008. As of 30 March 2014, it had been ratified by 142 States and the European Union.5 
The purpose of the Convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal 
enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, 
and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.6 
</p>
<p>4. Technical cooperation is embedded in the spirit and purpose of the Convention. The 
Convention, and in particular its article 32 &#8211; in which States parties recognize the 
importance of international cooperation in support of national efforts for the realization of 
the purpose and objectives of the Convention, in partnership with relevant international and 
regional organizations and civil society, in particular organizations of persons with 
disabilities &#8211;, serves as a platform for the United Nations to provide technical assistance on 
issues related to the Convention and its provisions. 
</p>
<p>5. Important steps to this end have been taken in the context of the post-2015 United 
Nations development agenda, guided by the High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The present report was prepared by OHCHR in direct consultation with the technical secretariat of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other United Nations 
agencies and regional organizations. The information compiled herein reflects the available 
information in the internal reporting system of OHCHR and the contributions from other United 
Nations agencies.

 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, art. 1, para. 1. </p>


<p>on Disability and Development (23 September 2013). The Meeting&#8217;s outcome document 
stresses the importance of ensuring accessibility for and inclusion of persons with 
disabilities in all aspects of development, with a view to enhancing cooperation and to 
providing relevant technical assistance to Member States upon their request, and underlines 
the need to achieve full application and implementation of the international normative 
framework on disability and development by encouraging the ratification and 
implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>6. Technical cooperation is an integral component of the work of OHCHR. Through 
technical cooperation and advisory services, OHCHR helps in identifying and addressing 
knowledge and capacity gaps by facilitating constructive dialogue and positive change. 
Sound and efficient technical cooperation and capacity-building programmes need to be 
based on thorough understanding and analysis of a specific human rights situation and the 
multifaceted challenges related to it. This is achieved through independent and credible 
monitoring activities in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders &#8211; allowing OHCHR, in 
cooperation with relevant stakeholders, to establish needs, to put such needs at the centre of 
the Office&#8217;s planning and to identify the most suitable strategies to achieve progress 
towards results. 
</p>
<p>7. The response by OHCHR to the requests for technical cooperation and advice, 
which is guided by the recommendations from treaty bodies and special procedures and 
from the universal periodic review, has seen a significant increase in recent years, including 
on the rights of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>8. Countering discrimination, in particular racial discrimination, discrimination on the 
grounds of sex, religion and discrimination against others who are marginalized, is one of 
the thematic priorities in the OHCHR Management Plan 2014-17. Within this framework, 
the Office works towards increased compliance of national legislation, policies, 
programmes and institutions with international human rights standards to combat 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>9. Since the adoption of the Convention in 2006, OHCHR has gradually stepped up its 
work on the rights of persons with disabilities. As part of its technical cooperation and 
advisory services, the Office supports efforts to ensure ratification of the Convention and 
compliance of national legislation, policies, programmes and institutions with the 
Convention and other instruments relevant to the promotion and protection of the rights of 
persons with disabilities. The Office also seeks to ensure that persons with disabilities claim 
their rights by supporting efforts to facilitate their use of national protection systems and 
their participation in public processes. At the international level, OHCHR seeks to ensure 
that States uphold their human rights obligations by supporting their engagement with the 
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other relevant human rights 
mechanisms. Finally, OHCHR also seeks to ensure the integration of a human rights-based 
approach to disability in policies and programmes of the United Nations, including 
adequate attention and support to the promotion and protection of the rights of persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>10. In December 2011, six United Nations entities (the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), OHCHR, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United 
Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), UNDP and the World Health 
Organization (WHO)) launched the UN Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, administered by the UNDP Multi-Partner 
Trust Fund Office.7 The Partnership plays an important role in ensuring the effective use of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 See http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/fund/RPD00. </p>


<p>international human rights mechanisms to promote the human rights of persons with 
disabilities. The aim of the Fund is to sponsor projects led by United Nations Country 
Teams to develop the capacities of national stakeholders, particularly governments and 
organizations of persons with disabilities, for the effective implementation of the 
Convention, including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed 
development goals. A first call for proposals launched in May 2012 led to the identification 
of 11 joint United Nations programmes benefiting a total of 14 countries in multiple areas 
of Convention implementation. The projects are described below. 
</p><p>11. To ensure adequate coordination and appropriate attention to the promotion and 
protection of the rights of persons with disabilities, OHCHR has an Advisor on Human 
Rights and Disability, based in Geneva, in the Human Rights and Economic and Social 
Issues Section of the Research and Right to Development Division. The Advisor&#8217;s mandate 
is broad and includes mainstreaming the rights of persons with disabilities in OHCHR and 
generally in the United Nations; providing technical assistance to States, National Human 
Rights Institutions and civil society organizations, and promoting ratification and 
implementation of the Convention and its Optional Protocol at the national level. His team 
currently consists of one additional person8 and has a small amount of extra-budgetary 
funds to perform its activities. The team provides expert advice to OHCHR field presences 
and directly to States on demand. The limited availability of resources poses a challenge to 
advancing the agenda on the rights of persons with disabilities in a coordinated and 
sustained manner. 
</p>
<p>12. OHCHR serves as Secretariat of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. The role of the Secretariat, which comes under the Groups in Focus Section of 
the Human Rights Treaties Division, is to support the Committee in performing its tasks. 
This treaty body provides, in its concluding observations, substantial guidance to States 
Parties to the Convention on its implementation and the domestication of its provisions. 
These recommendations should be a primary source of consultation when providing 
technical cooperation and assistance, in particular when they refer to legal and policy 
harmonization. The Committee has, to date, held 11 sessions and reviewed the following 13 
countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Hungary, 
Paraguay, the Peoples&#8217; Republic of China, Peru, Spain, Sweden and Tunisia.9 Regarding 
technical assistance, the Committee is encouraging countries to engage with its members to 
increase cooperation, in particular, on legal and policy reform and design under the 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>13. While not exhaustive, the following sections provide an overview of the type of 
activities in the area of technical cooperation and advisory services that are supported by 
OHCHR and/or by relevant international partners at the country and regional levels.

<p><b> 1. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
</b>14. <b>Cameroon:</b> OHCHR has participated in activities aiming at raising awareness 
among persons with disabilities of their right to participate in political life on an equal basis 
with others. As a result of the advocacy efforts of OHCHR, an Election Management Body 
has made polling stations accessible for persons with disabilities during elections in 
October 2011.

<p>15. <b>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire:</b> The Human Rights Division of the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire has participated actively, through the provision of technical advice, in the Task 
Force for the ratification of the Convention established by the Conf&#233;d&#233;ration des 
organisations des personnes handicap&#233;es de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (COPHCI), a coalition of non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and associations working for the protection and 
promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities, including efforts to support the Ministry 
of Justice, Human Rights and Public Liberties. As a result of these joint efforts, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire ratified the Convention on 10 January 2014. The Human Rights Division has also 
widely disseminated the Convention and provided training/briefing sessions for 
representatives of NGOs specializing in the rights of persons with disabilities, and will 
continue to support advocacy for the establishment of a coordination mechanism for 
monitoring the implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>16. <b>Ethiopia</b>: OHCHR organized two disability equality training sessions in cooperation 
with ILO to support government officials and service providers on the human rights-based 
approach to disability and the Convention. 
</p>
<p>17. <b>Guinea-Bissau</b>: The Human Rights Section of the United Nations Integrated 
Peacebuilding Office in Guinea Bissau (UNIOGBIS) supported extensively the signing and 
ratification of the Convention, holding several meetings to explain the importance of 
acceding to the Convention and recognizing the treaty body monitoring mechanisms. As a 
result, the National Popular Assembly signed the Convention and its Optional Protocol in 
September 2013, with the intention of submitting the two instruments for ratification after 
general elections in April 2014. 
</p>
<p>18. <b>Liberia</b>: OHCHR supported the National Commission on Disabilities with 
developing a National Strategy for the Implementation of the Convention in the context of 
the Agenda for Transformation and the National Human Rights Action Plan, which as a 
result was validated in September 2013 and launched in December 2013. OHCHR is 
providing technical assistance through bi-monthly working sessions with members of a 
Human Rights and Disability Task Force on its roll-out and monitoring. OHCHR is also 
participating in the coordination of field offices of the United Nations Mission in Liberia to 
conduct capacity-building activities for government and civil society on evaluating, 
measuring and monitoring progress on the implementation of the Convention; advocacy 
and budget monitoring; and applying a human rights-based approach to United Nations 
programming and national development frameworks. This has contributed to the adoption 
of (i) human rights and (ii) persons with disabilities and disadvantages as two new cross-
cutting themes in the country&#8217;s second Poverty Reduction Strategy (2013-2017). 
19. <b>Niger</b>: In order to ensure an improved understanding by the public of national, 
regional and international norms protecting the rights of persons with disabilities and 
promote further review, the collective of organizations defending human rights and 
democracy and the Niger Federation of Persons with Disabilities held awareness-raising 
activities in March 2013 on the rights of persons with disabilities. The activities were 
organized in partnership with the OHCHR Human Rights Advisor&#8217;s unit in Niger and the 
Ministry of Justice, with funding by UNDP. Awareness-raising campaigns and conferences 
were organized on national and international legislation on the rights of persons with 
disabilities in six regions of the country. 
</p>
<p>20. <b>Senegal</b>: During 2013, the OHCHR West Africa Regional Office in partnership with 
Handicap International and other stakeholders provided technical advice and facilitated 
training sessions to authorities in relation to the Convention and its Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>21. <b>Sierra Leone</b>: The Human Rights Component of the United Nations Integrated 
Peacebuilding Mission in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL), in collaboration with OHCHR, 
supported the Government in the process of drafting a persons with disabilities Act. The </p>


<p>Act constitutes an important step towards the elimination of discrimination against persons 
with disabilities and the facilitation of their participation and inclusion in society. It 
contains important provisions on promoting their enjoyment of human rights, particularly 
the rights to education, employment, health and political participation, and establishes clear 
responsibilities in eliminating barriers preventing equal access to the physical environment, 
transport, and services. The Human Rights Component of UNIPSIL also supported the 
Government in the process of establishing a National Commission for Persons with 
Disabilities in 2012 and provided support in operationalizing the Commission, including by 
assisting in the development of its three-year strategic plan and through training and 
workshops. It is also working on a legislative review given that disability is a prohibited 
ground of discrimination in the Constitution.10 
</p>
<p>22. <b>Southern Africa:</b> The OHCHR Regional Office for Southern Africa, with the 
support of headquarters, provided the Government, national human rights institutes and 
civil society organizations, including organizations of persons with disabilities, with the 
necessary information to conduct an informed and constructive discussion on the need for 
an African instrument to protect the rights of persons with disabilities to supplement the 
Convention. The Regional Office has also worked closely with the Secretariat of the 
African Decade on Persons with Disabilities to strengthen the capacity of organizations of 
persons with disabilities in the promotion and monitoring of the Convention. The advocacy 
efforts undertaken by the Regional Office in 2011 led to the ratification of the Convention 
and its Optional Protocol by Mozambique.  
</p>
<p>23. <b>Sudan</b>: The Human Rights Section of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid 
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) carried out intensive work on the Convention with a focus 
on children with disabilities. The aim of these efforts is to contribute to the creation of a 
safe, accessible and appropriate academic environment which promotes and protects the 
rights of children with disabilities. Three workshops were held, aimed at changing policy 
and practice at school level. They were designed for civil society advocates, union leaders, 
government officials and local disability advocacy groups, in order to impact State 
legislation and provide social services that will respect, protect and promote the rights of 
persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>24. <b>Uganda</b>: OHCHR has supported national authorities and civil society organizations 
in raising awareness on Convention domestication and initial reporting to the Committee. 
Since 2010, the Office has trained national authorities such as the Equal Opportunities 
Commission and the National Council for Disabilities, specialized departments in the 
Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development and civil society organizations on 
Convention protection standards. Further, the Office has supported the Ministry of Health 
and civil society in the review of the Mental Health Treatment Act by providing a human 
rights commentary to the Mental Health Bill and convening meetings to discuss elements of 
the proposed legislation. In 2014-15, with the support of Norwegian funding, OHCHR will 
continue providing technical assistance to the National Council for Disability on monitoring 
the implementation of the Convention. To this end, the Office is organizing training on 
combating discrimination under the Convention for selected district disability councils. In 
liaison with national authorities, the Office will also undertake a comparative analysis of 
Ugandan legislation to identify obstacles to realizing the rights of persons with disabilities.

<p><b> 2. United Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>Mozambique</b>: UNDP and UNICEF are employing a twin-track approach involving 
both targeted and mainstreaming interventions. The work undertaken with the National 
Institute of Statistics is an example of mainstreaming, whereby indicators on issues related 
to persons with disabilities will be incorporated in a quarterly national survey to improve 
data collection as a prerequisite for defining more accurate policies and programmes related 
to persons with disabilities. On the other hand, the collaboration between UNDP, Handicap 
International and the Rede de Assist&#234;ncia as Vitimas de Minas  is a targeted intervention, 
which seeks to empower the often marginalized group of mine survivors to claim their 
rights. One of the activities of the project involves the review of the existing legislative and 
policy framework. 
</p>
<p>26. <b>South Africa</b>: OHCHR, UNDP and UNICEF are jointly involved with the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UN Women in a programme that was developed by 
the United Nations country team in collaboration with the Department of Women, Children 
and Persons with Disability. The programme aims at establishing a Convention compliant 
legal and policy framework in South Africa. While UNDP is the lead agency and 
responsible for the overall coordination and technical support of the programme, UNICEF 
provides technical expertise on issues related to children with disabilities and OHCHR 
focuses on international legislation and standards on the rights of persons with disabilities. 
UNFPA and UN Women will fund efforts to acquire technical expertise on the needs for 
women with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>27. <b>Togo</b>: The Partnership programme focuses on inclusive education in the Savanes 
and Kara regions. This joint UNICEF, WHO and OHCHR project started in early 2013. 
The main legal framework, namely the 2007 Child Code, the 2004 Law on the Social 
Protection of Persons with Disabilities, and other relevant instruments, such as the 2006 
Labour Code and the 1968 Ordinance on the General Statute of Public Servants and 
strategic documents such as the Education Sector Plan, are being reviewed on their 
compliance with the international human rights instruments ratified by Togo. Under this 
programme, Braille and sign language manuals have been developed and tested together 
with a training manual on inclusive education endorsed by the Ministry of Education in 
2012, used for the training of a large number of teachers and administrators. The 
programme expands on already successful efforts related to the provision of suitable 
educational opportunities to primary school-aged children with disabilities. This partnership 
with government and non-governmental organizations will strive to put in place a 
sustainable collaborative and efficient response to the challenge of providing education for 
all, including children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Asia-Pacific 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>Cambodia</b>: OHCHR provided technical advice throughout the process of 
ratification of the Convention, inter alia through translating and publishing the Convention 
in Khmer and providing support for the drafting of a statement promoting ratification of the 
Convention, which was presented before Parliament. OHCHR further organized two 
training sessions for government representatives &#8211; on the main features of the Convention 
and another, more specifically, on reporting under the Convention, with the aim of 
increasing their awareness on the Government&#8217;s responsibilities under the Convention. 
</p>
<p>29. <b>Papua New Guinea</b>: OHCHR continues to provide technical support to the 
Department of Community Development and other relevant government bodies on the 
implementation and domestication of the Convention. </p>


<p>30. <b>Timor-Leste:</b> The Human Rights Adviser&#8217;s Unit is implementing a capacity 
development programme for civil society, including for the Timor-Leste Disability 
Association &#8211; a network of more than 20 NGOs working on disability &#8211; and its individual 
members, to increase their use of national and international systems to protect the rights of 
discriminated groups. The Unit intends to assist organizations of persons with disabilities to 
strengthen their monitoring, reporting and advocacy skills, and continues to support efforts 
towards the ratification of the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The Partnership 
</b></p>
<p>31. <b>Cook Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu and</b> <b>Papua New Guinea</b>: ILO, UNICEF, WHO, 
ESCAP and United Nations Volunteers are implementing a range of activities with the 
overall goal of improving the lives and opportunities of persons with disabilities in these 
selected Pacific Island Countries. The activities are targeted towards assisting with 
legislative drafting and policy development in countries that have ratified, or are about to 
ratify, the Convention. The project further promotes employment of persons with 
disabilities at both policy and programme level &#8211; including advocacy to support employers 
and targeted skills development. Additionally, a pilot project on early detection will provide 
a strong basis for efforts to be replicated throughout the Pacific. Finally, the lack of reliable 
data on disability prevalence in the Pacific is addressed through work on statistics, in 
particular through census and national survey processes. This will draw from global and 
regional expertise and strengthen ongoing efforts undertaken by the Pacific Statistics 
Steering Committee. In addition, research will be conducted to explore the barriers to the 
ratification of the Convention in countries in the region. 
</p>
<p>32. <b>Indonesia</b>: ILO and WHO, together with UNESCO and UNFPA, are implementing 
a project aimed at strengthening the capacity of the national institutions in charge of 
coordinating the implementation of the Convention. This initiative supported nationwide 
high-level policy dialogues with mayors and the creation of a Network of Inclusive Cities, 
which aims to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and resources on the inclusion of 
persons with disabilities. Memorandums of understanding have been signed with the 
governments of Banda Aceh City and Yogyakarta City, with the aim of reaching out to 
other cities at a later stage. The project has supported the drafting of a framework for 
identifying key criteria in the process of building inclusive cities for persons with 
disabilities. The framework has been tested and applied in four cities, resulting in the 
drafting of strategic plans and the allocation of funds to address the social inclusion of 
persons with disabilities. These efforts will provide the basis for a yearly appraisal of cities 
in Indonesia, which is expected eventually to include a disability inclusion award. 
</p>
<p>33. <b>Viet Nam</b> is actively considering ratification of the Convention and ILO Convention 
No. 159 concerning Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Persons) (1983), 
and is currently finalizing a national action plan to support persons with disabilities, with 
the final aim of developing a national legal framework in line with the Convention and 
other international standards. One of the main objectives of the Partnership funded project 
is to support the participation of organizations of persons with disabilities in these 
processes. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Americas 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p>34. <b>Colombia</b>: The Office&#8217;s efforts focus on Convention domestication and the 
involvement of authorities in adopting a national policy on persons with disabilities. To this 
effect, the Government has convened 15 regional meetings with relevant stakeholders and a 
national meeting, in December 2012. Additionally, with the support of OHCHR, the State </p>


<p>has adopted legislation that provides certain guarantees for the realization of the human 
rights of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>35. <b>Guatemala</b>: Since 2013, OHCHR has been leading, efforts to promote the 
understanding of the rights of persons with disabilities among government actors. 
</p>
<p>36. <b>Haiti</b>: With the support of OHCHR, the State Secretary on Integration of Disabled 
Persons has developed a workplan to implement a framework law on persons with 
disabilities. OHCHR provides technical assistance to the State Secretary on the Integration 
of Disabled Persons, focusing on (i) raising awareness on universal accessibility and (ii) the 
harmonization of the Labour Code with the framework law. 
</p>
<p>37. <b>Honduras</b>: OHCHR supported the approval of the National Policy on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. The Office is also supporting the Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
Population in the drafting of a National Policy Strategic Plan by hiring a national expert and 
by directly advising the Directorate General for People for Disabilities, which is in charge 
of implementing public policies on the rights of persons with disabilities in compliance 
with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>38. <b>Mexico:</b> As a result of advocacy efforts towards the Senate undertaken by OHCHR, 
UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration, Mexico has withdrawn its two 
interpretive declarations regarding the Convention. The Office further promoted internal 
policy and/or legislative changes to remove obstacles hindering the withdrawal of 
reservations and interpretative declarations.  
</p>
<p>39. <b>Paraguay</b>: The engagement of the National Secretariat for the Human Rights of 
People with Disabilities (SENADIS) in the implementation of human rights standards and 
recommendations has increased through its commitment to design a human rights-based 
public policy on the rights of persons with disabilities and human rights indicators. With 
technical assistance provided by the OHCHR Human Rights Advisor, SENADIS initiated 
this process through the collection of baseline material on the situation of persons with 
disabilities. The material will be further used in a consultative process with government and 
civil society actors, aimed at designing the policy. The Human Rights Advisor has further 
supported the State in developing an inter-institutional mechanism to follow up on 
recommendations made by international human rights mechanisms, including the 
Committee. These efforts have included the organization of an inter-institutional thematic 
round table aimed at empowering persons with disabilities to claim their rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The Partnership 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>Costa Rica</b>: ILO and UNDP are collaborating with the Ministry of Labour and 
social partners to promote the right to work of persons with disabilities. With support from 
this project, the Costa Rican National Business Association has established a Network of 
Inclusive Enterprises, which already has a membership of 37 businesses with a total 
workforce of more than 15,000 employees across Costa Rica. In collaboration with key 
public sector institutions and civil society organizations, the members of the Network are 
working to create job opportunities for persons with disabilities and will take steps to make 
their business processes more inclusive and accessible.

<p><b> 1. OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>Libya</b>: The Human Rights Component of the United Nations Support Mission in 
Libya has supported the Government with furthering its efforts to ratify the Convention. 
While the General National Congress has already passed the ratification of the Convention </p>


<p>with a general reservation, the ratification instrument has yet to be deposited. In the 
aftermath of the 2011 conflict, the General National Congress has also adopted new 
legislation addressing the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>42. <b>Iraq</b>: A consultation with representatives of persons with disabilities took place in 
order to discuss necessary amendments to the law on persons with disabilities to bring it in 
line with the Convention. Human rights officers have undertaken extensive work with the 
Government of Iraq in partnership with Iraqi organizations of persons with disabilities, civil 
society organizations and international partners, ensuring ratification of the Convention was 
part of a National Action Plan adopted by the Government in December 2011 with a view 
to implementing the recommendations of the universal periodic review conducted in 
February 2010. As a result of these efforts, Iraq ratified the Convention on 20 March 2013. 
The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, the Human Rights Parliamentary 
Committee and the Iraqi Alliance for Disability Organizations have jointly proposed a 
series of legislative amendments to the Government, particularly in relation to the 
requirement for an independent mechanism to oversee and monitor its implementation, with 
a view to aligning Iraqi legislation with the Convention. 
</p>
<p>43. <b>Occupied Palestinian territories</b>: OHCHR has worked closely with the 
Government of the State of Palestine to produce the Guidance Document on Integrating 
Human Rights in Palestinian Development Plans, which outlines concrete targets and 
interventions to be integrated into the Palestinian National Development Plan, the 
overarching national development framework. This document identifies actions to ensure 
the rights of persons with disabilities, including the right to education, social security, and 
work. The Office will work closely with the Government, the NHRI, and NGOs and civil 
society organizations in monitoring implementation of the National Development Plan from 
a human rights-based viewpoint, including rights of persons with disabilities as an integral 
part of this monitoring. The first ever United Nations Development Assistance Framework 
(UNDAF) for Palestine was also finalized, and the Office played an active role in ensuring 
that the rights-based approach was central to United Nations development assistance plans. 
Planned United Nations programmes for persons with disabilities are featured in the 
Framework. 
</p>
<p>44. <b>Tunisia</b>: OHCHR is promoting the adoption of legislation and policies in 
compliance with international human rights standards in the area of employment for 
persons with disabilities. The Office is planning to provide technical assistance through a 
two-day seminar with members of parliament and five ministerial departments on State 
obligations regarding persons with disabilities, and five one-day study days with ministerial 
departments on mainstreaming the rights of persons with disabilities into policies. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The Partnership 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>Occupied Palestinian territories</b>: ILO, UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UNESCO, UNFPA and WFP have 
joined their efforts in a programme aimed at raising awareness of the rights of persons with 
disabilities and developing capacities to mainstream disability in the education, health, 
employment, and social sectors. The goal of the programme is to enhance respect for the 
human rights of persons with disabilities through legislation, services, and social and 
economic empowerment in compliance with the Palestinian Disability Law and the 
Convention, through a close partnership between relevant ministries, United Nations 
agencies, international donors, organizations of persons with disabilities and other key 
stakeholders. On the basis of the above, the programme has three main expected outcomes: 
(a) review of legislation, policies and practices of six key ministries for their compliance 
with the Convention and the Palestinian Disability Law; (b) creation of equal opportunities 
for children with disabilities in selected pilot schools (selected by the Ministry of </p>


<p>Education); and (c) improved access to job creation programmes and business development 
schemes for women and men with disabilities. Special attention is given to ensuring the full 
participation of women and girls with disabilities in programme activities.  
</p>
<p>46. <b>Tunisia</b>: The Partnership programme&#8217;s main objective is the inclusion of persons 
with disabilities from a human rights perspective, strengthening stakeholders&#8217; capacities in 
advocating, respecting and fulfilling the rights of persons with disabilities and developing a 
shared new national vision on disability. The programme has four thematic priorities: 
rights-based advocacy for persons with disabilities; survey, statistics and assessment of 
social protection mechanisms for persons with disabilities; school inclusion and protection 
of children with disabilities; and employment of youth with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Europe and Central Asia 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>Georgia</b>: In February 2013 OHCHR joined a working group on legislative changes 
for the development of a social integration strategy for persons with disabilities for 2013-
2016. The ratification of the Convention by the Georgian parliament was a result of 
advocacy efforts undertaken by OHCHR, other United Nations agencies and civil society. 
The OHCHR Senior Human Rights Advisor supported the Speaker of the parliament and 
the Head of the Human Rights Committee of the parliament in the process of ratification.  
</p>
<p>48. <b>Kosovo</b>: OHCHR is working on reviewing legislation related to combating 
discrimination in line with international human rights standards, addressing the issue of 
discrimination against persons with disabilities when exercising their legal capacity. 
</p>
<p>49. <b>Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</b>: OHCHR contributed to bringing the 
Convention higher up the national agenda and closer to the rights-holders. The Office 
promoted ratification of the Convention through bringing key government and disability-
related actors together to develop a plan of action towards ratification, using 2009 universal 
periodic review recommendations and relevant OHCHR thematic studies as a substantive 
framework. These efforts contributed to the Macedonian ratification of the Convention on 
29 December 2011. OHCHR has since continued to provide sustained strategic support for 
the implementation of the Convention, including through supporting the establishment of a 
national implementation mechanism in line with article 33 of the Convention, and training 
its staff, and for the participatory preparation of the State&#8217;s initial report to the Committee. 
</p>
<p>50. <b>Moldova:</b> As a result of sustained work from 2009 to present, breakthroughs were 
achieved during the current biennium in laws, government regulations and specific official 
scenarios (such as segregated school districts) were brought substantially into compliance 
with relevant international law and standards in the field of non-/anti-discrimination. The 
creation of a comprehensive anti-discrimination law, for instance, was the result of 
OHCHR support for government and civil society. Further, the OHCHR Human Rights 
Adviser worked with government counterparts to develop the Law on the Social Inclusion 
of Persons with Disabilities, aimed at incorporating the Convention&#8217;s provisions into 
domestic legislation. Adopted in 2012, the Law sets out, for the first time, rights to equal 
legal capacity and reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities under Moldovan 
domestic law. Efforts have also focused on the development of school settings inclusive of 
Roma children and children with disabilities in strategically selected municipalities. 
OHCHR supported the Ministries of Health, Justice and Labour, Social Protection and 
Family to establish an inter-ministerial working group to review domestic legislation and 
policies under article 12 of the Convention, which requires States Parties to move from 
substituted decision-making to assisted decision-making systems. Activities were fostered 
to support regulatory and budget amendments to this end. OHCHR also supported, in </p>


<p>cooperation with UNDP and the national human rights institution, the Ministry of Health 
and other government entities in improving protection of the rights of persons with 
psychosocial disabilities held in mental institutions, resulting in an agreement to establish 
an independent institutional complaint review mechanism, namely an Ombudsperson in 
psychiatric institutions. A pilot Office of the Ombudsperson was created to cover three 
main psychiatric hospitals. 
</p>
<p>51. <b>The</b> <b>Regional office for Europe: </b>At the regional level, the Regional Office has 
engaged European Union institutions and member States in the region, particularly on the 
rights of persons with disabilities. The Regional Office has identified common ground 
between the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  and the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child &#8211; namely the issue of independent living for persons with 
disabilities (article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) and the 
issue of alternative care of children. Through its active membership in a coalition of NGO 
and inter-governmental organization stakeholders representing NGOs and inter-
governmental organizations  (the European Expert Group on Transition from Institutional 
to Community-based Care), the Regional Office has contributed significantly to policy 
changes at the level of the European Union, including policy documents guiding the use of 
European Union Structural Funds and the regulations for the Structural Funds. These 
Regulations represent a significant achievement in terms of increased compliance by the 
European Union with international human rights standards, including the Convention. The 
Regulations contain specific language on the promotion of transition to community-based 
services, and include an ex-ante conditionality that will serve as a basis to take measures for 
the shift from institutional to community-based care, and one to ensure implementation of 
article 9 of the Convention, in the context of European Structural Funds investments. As a 
member of the European Expert Group, the Regional Office supported these changes, and 
provided technical assistance, vis-&#224;-vis relevant officials at European Union and national 
levels. The Regional Office, moreover, has taken an active role in organizing European 
Expert Group seminars, in close cooperation with national authorities and the European 
Commission, on the use of European Union Structural Funds to support the transition from 
institutional to community-based care. Such events took place in Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, 
Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Poland, and will be organized in the Czech 
Republic, Lithuania, Slovenia, Greece and Serbia in 2014. The European Regional Office 
2012 publication on the implications of article 19 of the Convention for the use of European 
Union Structural Funds was actively disseminated and used as a tool in raising awareness 
among European Union officials and national authorities as well as civil society and rights 
holders. The Regional Office participated in a regional consultation in preparation for the 
High Level Meeting on Disability and Development, emphasizing the importance of using 
the Convention as the framework for all European Union input to the High Level Meeting. 
The final written contribution of the European Union to the High Level Meeting included 
language proposed by OHCHR and the Regional Office.  
</p>
<p>52. <b>The</b> <b>Russian Federation</b> ratified the Convention in 2012, upon which began a 
process of amending Russian legislation in accordance with Convention provisions. The 
establishment of a national implementation and monitoring mechanism as stipulated in the 
Convention is still under discussion by Russian stakeholders. OHCHR provides technical 
support and guidance in these processes. Through partnership with OHCHR, the Regional 
Organization of Persons with Disabilities, Perspektiva, and its partners were able to 
increase awareness amongst over 400 stakeholders &#8211; government officials, education 
professionals, legislators, organizations of persons with disabilities, civil society 
organizations and experts, journalists, students, people with disabilities and members of 
their families &#8211; about the Convention, in particular article 24, and current Russian 
legislation and policies which require amendments. Following advocacy efforts undertaken 
by OHCHR, a new federal law on education contains language on inclusive education and </p>


<p>equal access to education for all. The law requires regional and city-level administrations to 
create the necessary conditions for high-quality education without discrimination against 
persons with disabilities. Federal legislators are currently developing concrete 
implementation standards for inclusive education, including curricular and infrastructural 
modifications. Inclusive schools are envisaged in the framework of the &#8220;Accessible 
Environment&#8221; State programme. More than 5,000 accessible schools providing conditions 
for the education of children with disabilities had already been created by the end of 2013. 
The goal is to create 10,000 such schools by the beginning of 2016.  
</p>
<p>53. <b>Serbia</b>: The Protector of Citizen&#8217;s Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and the OHCHR Human 
Rights Advisor have been successful in influencing the discourse on deinstitutionalization 
in order for it to include a human rights perspective in line with the norms and standards of 
the Convention. In 2013, they held two sessions presenting a draft deinstitutionalization 
road map to local self-governments and representatives of residential institutions, and two 
high level expert round tables at which national policy in this domain was discussed. By the 
end of 2013, the draft road map was presented to all relevant stakeholders. The road map, 
prepared by a national expert group, is to be finalized, endorsed by the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
office and officially proposed to the Government in 2014. 
</p>
<p>54. <b>Ukraine:</b> In 2012, Ukraine adopted anti-discrimination legislation improving 
compliance with the Convention, a requirement contained in recommendations of various 
United Nations human rights mechanisms. Throughout 2013, OHCHR worked on 
amendments to the law. An expert discussion focusing on implementing equality and non-
discrimination legislation and policies was organized in Ukraine, and a training workshop 
was held on measuring progress on the implementation of equality and non-discrimination 
legislation. These activities involved representatives of the Ministries of Justice and 
Interior, the parliament, the judiciary, NGOs and the Ombudsman&#8217;s office. Several draft 
amendments were drawn up, partly addressing the comments of OHCHR and international 
experts.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. The Partnership 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Moldova</b>: OHCHR, UNDP, UNICEF and WHO are working closely to bring about 
catalytic change with regard to rights to equal legal capacities, access to justice, the right to 
live independently in the community, inclusive education; the strengthening of civil 
society; and improved monitoring of Convention implementation. As a result of this 
project, significant advances have been made in establishing justice oversight over 
previously closed institutions and there is much greater awareness, in Moldovan psychiatry, 
about Convention provisions. At the same time, policy dialogue has advanced significantly 
on issues such as legal capacity reform, adult deinstitutionalization and the formal 
establishment, under the State budget, of an Ombudsperson for Psychiatry. In addition, an 
NGO of users and survivors of psychiatry was established for the first time in 2013 as a 
direct result of the project. 
56. <b>Ukraine</b>: In Ukraine, the rights of persons with disabilities are among the priority 
areas of a Partnership Framework between the United Nations and the Government (2012-
2016). The Partnership-funded programme, developed by UNDP, UNICEF, ILO and WHO 
in cooperation with the Government and civil society organizations in Ukraine, aims to 
promote the application of accessibility and universal design standards as enablers of 
inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities. It focuses on existing barriers that 
prevent or limit equal access to services and facilities intended for the general public, 
including law and policy.  </p>


<p><b> F. Technical cooperation undertaken by other United Nations agencies  
and regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 
</b></p>
<p>57. The past two Asian and Pacific Decades of Disabled Persons (1993-2002 and 
2003-2012) and the adoption of the Convention in 2006 acted as catalysts for a shift from a 
charity-based to a rights-based approach to disability in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2013, 
the region entered a new phase of promoting the full realization of the rights of persons 
with disabilities and disability-inclusive development with the adoption of the Ministerial 
Declaration on the Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, 2013-2022, and 
the Incheon Strategy to &#8220;Make the Right Real&#8221; for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the 
Pacific.11 The Incheon Strategy is a pioneering policy framework derived from the 
experiences of the ESCAP region and provides the Asian and Pacific region with a set of 
regionally agreed disability-inclusive development goals.  
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group on the Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, 
an ESCAP consultative and governing mechanism composed of representatives of 15 
governments and 15 civil society organizations for, and of, persons with disabilities, met in 
Incheon, Republic of Korea, to review and adopt a draft road map for the implementation of 
the Incheon Strategy. ESCAP provided technical assistance in the launch of the Incheon 
Strategy in a number of countries and in building capacities to develop national strategies 
and action plans. 
</p>
<p>59. <b>Cambodia:</b> In May 2013, ESCAP provided technical input for the development of a 
National Disability Strategy by the Government of Cambodia, to align it with the principles 
of the Convention. Consequently, an Official Launching on Commitment of 
Implementation of the Convention and the Incheon Strategy and Continuation of National 
Disability Strategy Plan (2014-2018) took place in Phnom Penh. 
60. The ESCAP-Sasakawa Award for Disability-Inclusive Business in Asia and the 
Pacific12 has been developed as a good practice for promoting engagement of the private 
sector in a global effort to eradicate poverty for all, including persons with disabilities. This 
award is based on a disability-inclusive business model, which views persons with 
disabilities as an untapped workforce with a range of skills and a market possessing 
significant purchasing power.  
</p>
<p>61. In preparing for the Asian and Pacific Conference on Gender Equality and Women&#8217;s 
Empowerment: Beijing +20 Review, to be held in Bangkok in November 2014, ESCAP 
mainstreamed disability concerns into the pre-Conference survey for its member States. 
This is seen as an opportunity to initiate efforts towards mainstreaming disability in the 
global process of Beijing+20 and the outcome documents that will result from the process.  
</p><p>62. ESCAP developed a project document in 2013 to support its member States&#8217; 
strengthening of national capacity for better planning of disability-inclusive access and to 
promote the harmonization of domestic legislation concerning the physical environment, 
public transport, and information and communication with the Convention, and its 
implementation. The project, with funding from the Government of China and supported by 
Hong Kong and Macao, will be implemented in multiple phases starting from 2014.

<p>63. Disability prevalence in Asia and the Pacific is estimated at 4.6 per cent, which is 
significantly lower than the global estimate of 15 per cent.13 With a view to addressing this 
discrepancy, ESCAP is undertaking efforts to gather baseline data to track progress towards 
achieving the Incheon Strategy. In 2013, ESCAP organized an Expert Group meeting on 
effective data generation for the Incheon Strategy Indicators. The meeting &#8211; attended by 
experts from national statistical offices and disability focal agencies of 19 
countries/territories in the region &#8211; identified progress, gaps and capacity-development 
needs with regard to data collection, and reviewed the draft guidebook on data generation 
for the Incheon Strategy Indicators, prepared by the ESCAP secretariat. ESCAP will 
publish a guide on generating data for the Indicator<i>s</i> aimed at providing guidance on how to 
construct and use the Indicators to monitor progress in the implementation of the Strategy, 
assist its member States to review their existing national statistical systems and develop 
action plans to collect data for the Incheon Strategy Indicators. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. International Labour Organization 
</b></p>
<p>64. Since 2002, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has provided technical 
cooperation under a programme funded by the Government of Ireland. Support has been 
provided in several countries for the review of existing disability specific and general 
employment legislation from a disability perspective; support for consultations with key 
stakeholders about the proposed new laws and policies; and technical commentary and 
support to the dissemination of information about newly adopted laws, where appropriate. 
Such support has been provided in Botswana, China, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mongolia, , 
Thailand, Viet Nam, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. More recently, 
in some countries the focus has shifted to supporting implementation of legislation. 
</p>
<p>65. In the context of these technical cooperation efforts, guidelines on achieving equal 
employment opportunities for people with disabilities through legislation were developed in 
2007 and have been widely distributed in 15 languages. An updated edition is in 
preparation, for publication in 2014. In addition, a curriculum on disability-related 
legislation has been developed, with a pilot tested in collaboration with universities in 
several countries of Asia and Africa, and support provided in introducing disability 
legislation as a topic in the curricula of law faculties of selected universities, so that future 
generations of lawyers and judges will be familiarized with disability issues in law.14 
</p><p>66. As part of the ILO Disability Inclusion strategy, a pilot project was tested from 2010 
to 2012 and is now being rolled out. A range of measures have been undertaken to promote 
the inclusion of persons with disabilities in ILO technical cooperation projects and in the 
work of ILO more generally. Inter alia, a checklist of considerations to be borne in mind in 
including persons with disabilities in technical cooperation projects is available on the ILO 
technical cooperation website and a &#8220;How To&#8221; guide providing more detailed guidance is 
currently under preparation. Practical guides to the inclusion of disability rights 
considerations in different technical areas have been prepared and made available to ILO 
staff, along with a knowledge-sharing platform on topics relating to equal opportunities for 
persons with disabilities. Many ILO manuals in widespread use in technical cooperation 
projects have been revised to include consideration of the inclusion of persons with 
disabilities. Advice is provided by ILO disability specialists regarding the inclusion of 
persons with disabilities in a number of technical cooperation projects. Sensitization of 
technical cooperation staff and partners to disability rights issues through disability equality

</p>
<p>67. In addition to support provided to countries in the development of labour legislation, 
ILO advises constituents on laws relating to the training, employment and social protection 
of persons with disabilities as part of ongoing work with constituents, including a focus on 
implementation and enforcement. Capacity-building on disability-related laws, policies, 
programmes and services is provided in collaboration with the ILO International Training 
Centre, Turin, Italy. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. World Intellectual Property Organization 
</b></p>
<p>68. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has recently started a process 
of working with Member States at the national level in order to develop the legislative and 
regulatory framework necessary to ratify and implement the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate 
Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired,15 or Otherwise 
Print Disabled (Marrakesh VIP Treaty), which was adopted by the Diplomatic Conference 
to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons 
and Persons with Print Disabilities in Marrakesh, on 27 June 2013. The Marrakesh VIP 
Treaty is the latest addition to the body of international copyright treaties administered by 
WIPO. It has a clear human rights and social development dimension and its main goal is to 
create a set of mandatory limitations and exceptions for the benefit of persons with 
disabilities. The Treaty&#8217;s development was motivated in part by the adoption of the 
Convention, which provides, inter alia, that laws protecting intellectual property must not 
pose a discriminatory or unreasonable barrier limiting access to cultural materials.16<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>69. <b>The role of United Nations agencies and regional organizations is crucial in 
promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. Using the Convention 
to its full potential &#8722; that is, as a human rights instrument with elements crucial to 
sustainable development &#8722;, United Nations agencies and regional organizations can 
contribute to legal and policy reform under the specific expertise of their mandates. 
States are therefore encouraged to strengthen the capacities of the United Nations 
system, including those of OHCHR, to respond positively to the increasing demands 
from stakeholders for technical assistance and advisory services at the country level 
for the ratification of the Convention and its Optional Protocol and for the effective 
implementation of its provisions. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Due to the multifaceted implications of the issues related to the promotion and 
protection of the rights of persons with disabilities, including the improvement of their 
living conditions, States and other stakeholders should increase engagement with the 
United Nations to ensure compliance with international human rights standards in the 
development of national legislation, policies and programmes. Such engagement 
should take place through close consultation with, and the active involvement of, 
persons with disabilities, in full compliance with article 4(3) of the Convention. 
</b>71. <b>The United Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities has proven to be an effective mechanism for increasing technical

<p><b>cooperation in line with the Convention. The ongoing national projects are providing 
good practices and innovative solutions on legal and policy reform and beyond in the 
realization of the rights of persons with disabilities. States should consider 
contributions to the Partnership Multi Donor Trust Fund as a means to facilitate and 
promote this engagement. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The ongoing shaping of sustainable development goals beyond 2015 constitutes 
a critical opportunity to develop goals, targets and indicators that address inequalities 
and that are firmly based in the international human rights framework. In the spirit 
of building a post-2015 development agenda which ensures accessibility for and 
inclusion of persons with disabilities and a full realization of their human rights, there 
is a need to move swiftly towards universal ratification and effective implementation 
of the Convention and its Optional Protocol. To this end, States should support the 
involvement of United Nations agencies in capacity-building efforts for duty-bearers 
and other stakeholders including the business sector, aimed at supporting ratification 
processes and at implementing legislation and policies on the rights of persons with 
disabilities in compliance with the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Appropriate attention should be given to monitoring the implementation of the 
Convention at the national and international levels in compliance with the 
Convention&#8217;s provisions thereon. The jurisprudence developed by the Committee 
through its dialogue with States parties provides valuable guidance for technical 
assistance, and should be used to its full potential. States are further encouraged to 
request technical assistance on legal and policy reform and design from the 
Committee, pursuant to article 37 of the Convention. All stakeholders are called upon 
to support and cooperate with the newly appointed Secretary General Special Envoy 
on disability and accessibility and any other special procedures mandate or 
mechanism created to monitor the rights of persons with disabilities.
