Eos Petro, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION
Organization and Business
The Company was organized under the laws of the state of Nevada in 2007. On October 12,
2012, pursuant to the Merger Agreement entered into by and between the Company, Eos Global
Petro, Inc. ("Eos"), and Eos Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company ("Company Merger Sub"), dated July 16, 2012, Company Merger Sub
merged into Eos, with Eos being the surviving entity and the Company the legal acquirer (the
"Merger"). As a result of the Merger, Eos became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
Effective as of May 20, 2013, the Company changed its name to Eos Petro, Inc. (it previously had
been named "Cellteck, Inc.").
The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Eos and Eos Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Eos Delaware"), which was formed as an acquisition vehicle for potential
transactions. Eos itself also has two subsidiaries: Plethora Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eos ("Plethora Energy"), and EOS Atlantic Oil & Gas Ltd., a
Ghanaian corporation ("EAOG"), which is also 10% owned by one of the Company's Ghanaian-
based third party consultants. Plethora Energy also owns 90% of Plethora Bay Oil & Gas Ltd., a
Ghanaian corporation ("PBOG"), which is also 10% owned by the same Ghanaian-based
consultant.  Eos, Eos Delaware, PBOG, Plethora Energy and EAOG are collectively referred to
as the Company's "Subsidiaries."
Business
The Company is in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing oil and gas-related
assets.
Basis of Presentation
 
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Eos Petro,
Inc. (the "Company"), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals and adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly
present the financial condition of the Company and its operating results for the respective
periods. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived
from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally present in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have
been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and footnotes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year ending December 31, 2016.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption
that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such assumption contemplates the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a stockholders' deficit of $24,444,090 and
$28,087,526, respectively; for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and for the year ended
December 31, 2015, reported a net loss of $12,052,513 and $35,453,024, respectively; and had
negative cash flows from operating activities of $317,515 and $1,420,003, respectively. In
addition, the Company may have become obligated to pay a $5.5 million termination fee under
the "Dune Merger Agreement," as defined in Note 9 below (the "Parent Termination Fee," as
more fully defined in the Dune Merger Agreement) (see Note 9) and $4 million that may be due
under a structuring fee with GEM Global Yield Fund ("GEM").  Furthermore, $8,250,000 of
LowCal Convertible and Promissory Notes became due on May 1, 2016 and are therefore now
due and payable. Management estimates the Company's capital requirements for the next twelve
months, including drilling and completing wells for the Company's oil and gas "Works Property"
located in Illinois and possible acquisitions, will total approximately $2,500,000, excluding any
amounts that may be due to Dune Energy, Inc. under the Dune Merger Agreement or a $4 million
structuring fee that may be due to GEM. Errors may be made in predicting and reacting to
relevant business trends and the Company will be subject to the risks, uncertainties and
difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies. The Company may not be able to
successfully address any or all of these risks and uncertainties. Failure to adequately do so could
cause the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition to suffer. As a
result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern.  In addition, the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm, in its report on the Company's December 31, 2015 consolidated financial
statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any
adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
7
The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is an issue due to its net losses and
negative cash flows from operations, and its need for additional financing to fund future
operations. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is subject to its ability to obtain
necessary funding from outside sources, including the sale of its securities or obtaining loans
from investors or financial institutions. There can be no assurance that such funds, if available,
can be obtained on terms reasonable to the Company. Any debt financing or other financing of
securities senior to common stock that the Company is able to obtain will likely include financial
and other covenants that will restrict the Company's flexibility. At a minimum, the Company
expects these covenants to include restrictions on its ability to pay dividends on its common
stock in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for stockholders in the case of
convertible debt and equity financing. Any failure to comply with these covenants would have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned and majority
owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Management evaluates its investments on an individual basis for purposes of determining
whether or not consolidation is appropriate.
Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share
Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with the ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share. Basic
earnings-per-share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings-per-share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible notes, stock
options and warrants were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury
stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the
beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were
used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.  The following
potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per
share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Management Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements include,
but are not limited to, amortization and depletion allowances, the recoverability of the carrying
amount and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, asset retirement obligations, the valuation
of equity instruments issued in connection with financing transactions and share-based
compensation, and assumptions used in valuing derivative liabilities. Changes in facts and
circumstances may result in revised estimates.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Full Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Properties
The Company has elected to utilize the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities.
In accordance with the full cost method of accounting, the Company capitalizes all costs
associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves,
including leasehold acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenditures, lease rentals on
undeveloped properties and costs of drilling of productive and non-productive wells into the full
cost pool on a country by country basis. Capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the
estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production
method using estimates of proved reserves once proved reserves are determined to exist.
Capitalized oil and gas property costs within a cost center are amortized on an equivalent unit-of-
production method. The equivalent unit-of-production rate is computed on a quarterly basis by
dividing production by proved oil and gas reserves at the beginning of the quarter then applying
such amount to capitalized oil and gas property costs, which includes estimated asset retirement
costs, less accumulated amortization, plus the estimated future expenditures (based on current
costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves, net of estimated salvage values.
Full Cost Ceiling Test
Oil and gas properties without estimated proved reserves are not amortized until proved reserves
associated with the properties can be determined or until impairment occurs. At the end of each
reporting period, the unamortized costs of oil and gas properties are subject to a "ceiling test"
which limits capitalized costs to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved
reserves, discounted at 10% per annum to present value, based on current economic and
operating conditions, adjusted for related income tax effects. If the net capitalized costs exceed
the cost center ceiling, the excess is recognized as an impairment of oil and gas properties. An
impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher
oil and gas prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.
The estimated future net revenues used in the ceiling test are calculated using average quoted
market prices for sales of oil and gas on the first calendar day of each month during the
preceding 12-month period prior to the end of the current reporting period. Prices are held
constant indefinitely and are not changed except where different prices are fixed and
determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. Prices used in
the ceiling test computation do not include the impact of derivative instruments because the
Company elected not to meet the criteria to qualify its derivative instruments for hedge
accounting treatment.
The Company assesses oil and gas properties at least quarterly to ascertain whether impairment
has occurred. In assessing impairment, the Company considers factors such as historical
experience and other data such as primary lease terms of the property, average holding periods
of unproved property, and geographic and geologic data. Through June 30, 2016, the Company
has not experienced any impairment of its capitalized oil and gas properties.
The Company recorded depletion expense of $10,709 and $22,322 for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
9
Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are recognized as a reduction of capitalized oil
and gas property costs with no gain or loss recognized, unless the sale significantly alters the
relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost
center. Through June 30, 2016, the Company has not had any sales of oil and gas properties that
significantly alter that relationship.
Asset Retirement Obligation
The Company accounts for its future asset retirement obligations ("ARO") by recording the fair
value of the liability during the period in which it was incurred. The associated asset retirement
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The increase in
carrying value of a property associated with the capitalization of an ARO is included in proven oil
and gas properties in the balance sheets. The ARO consists of costs related to the plugging of
wells, removal of facilities and equipment, and site restoration on its oil and gas properties. The
asset retirement liability is accreted to operating expense over the useful life of the related asset.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had an ARO of $97,138 and
$92,512, respectively.
Oil and Gas Revenue
Revenues are recognized when hydrocarbons have been delivered, the customer has taken title
and collection is reasonably assured.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees
in capital raising transactions, for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for
share-based payments under the guidance as set forth in the Share-Based Payment Topic of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, officers,
directors, and consultants, including employee stock options, based on estimated fair values.
The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards to employees and
directors on the date of grant using an option-pricing model, and the value of the portion of the
award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the required service
period in the Company's Statements of Operations. The Company accounts for stock option and
warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative
guidance where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as
determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) the date at
which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Stock-based
compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated
forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, as necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
ASC 820-10 defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures
of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The
three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
 ·
active markets.
Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and
 ·
liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
 ·
measurement.
10
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents
and current liabilities, including notes payable and convertible notes, each qualify as financial
instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time
between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current
market rate of interest.
The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the warrant derivative
liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a probability weighted average Black-
Scholes-Merton pricing model based on various assumptions. The Company's derivative
liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in
the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.
Concentrations
The Company maintains cash balances at a bank in California.  The account is insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 per institution. At June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company did not have amounts on deposit that exceeded the FDIC-
insured limits.
The future results of the Company's oil and natural gas operations will be affected by the market
prices of oil and natural gas. The availability of a ready market for oil and natural gas products in
the future will depend on numerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including
weather, imports, marketing of competitive fuels, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas
pipelines and other transportation facilities, any oversupply or undersupply of oil, natural gas and
liquid products, the regulatory environment, the economic environment, and other regional and
political events, none of which can be predicted with certainty.
One customer accounts for 100% of oil sales for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015.  The Company's oil and gas properties are located in Illinois.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
 
The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives
or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that
are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is
then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of
operations. The Company uses a probability weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton model to
value the derivative instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether
such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each
reporting period.  Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or
non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be
required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 is a
comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue
recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for
determining revenue recognition.  ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue
based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract.  The ASU also
will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in
judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  ASU 2014-09
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.   Early adoption is
permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods therein.  Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a
cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  The Company is in the process of
evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.
11
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases. 
ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability
on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  ASU 2016-02 is effective
for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is
permitted.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and
operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period
presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  The Company
is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statements
and disclosures.
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance
on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial
statements.  ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of
an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial
statements are issued.  An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise
substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU 2014-15 is
effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. 
Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
ASU 2014-15 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues
Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and
Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on
the Company's present or future financial statements.
NOTE 3 - LOWCAL CONVERTIBLE AND PROMISSORY NOTES PAYABLE
LowCal convertible and promissory notes payable at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are
as follows:

December 31, 
 
  2015
On February 8, 2013, and as subsequently amended through August 14, 2015, the Company and
Eos entered into: (i) a Loan Agreement and Secured Promissory Note; (ii) a Lock-Up/Leak-Out
Agreement; (iii) a Guaranty; (iv) a Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement;
and (v) a Leasehold Mortgage, Assignment, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (collectively
referred to as the "Loan Agreements"), with LowCal Industries, LLC and LowCal [EOS/Petro],
LLC (collectively referred to as " LowCal ").   Pursuant to the Loan Agreements, LowCal agreed
to purchase from Eos, for $4,980,000, promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$5,000,000 (of which $1,500,000 was advanced in 2014 and $3,500,000 in prior years), with
interest at 10% per annum (the "LowCal Loan"). At LowCal's option, LowCal can elect to convert
any part of the principal of the LowCal Loan into shares of the Company's common stock at a
conversion price of $2.50 per share.    On January 13, 2015, the Company and LowCal amended
the Loan Agreements, including the LowCal Loan, and entered into a new unsecured promissory
note in the principal amount of $3,250,000, with interest at 10% per annum (the "Second LowCal
Note"), $750,000 of which was advanced to the Company in 2014 and was recognized as
included in the principal amount of the Second LowCal Note. As part of the amendment, LowCal
forgave approximately $667,000 of accrued interest on the LowCal Loan and eliminated all
interest on the LowCal Loan going forward.  As amended, there was no remaining accrued and
outstanding interest on the LowCal Loan.
The LowCal Loan is secured by: (i) a mortgage, lien on, assignment of and security interest in
and to oil and gas properties; (ii) a guaranty by the Company as a primary obligor for payment of
Eos' obligations when due; and (iii) a first priority position or call right for an amount equal to the
then outstanding principal balance of and accrued interest on the LowCal Loan on the first draw
down by either Eos or the Company from a commitment letter entered into with a prospective
investor, should the Company or Eos be in a position to draw on this facility.
 
12
As amended, the maturity dates of both the LowCal Loan and the Second LowCal Note are May
1, 2016.  The LowCal Loan and the Second LowCal Note are currently in default.   The Second
LowCal Note must also be repaid upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the Company closing certain
potential acquisition transactions, or (ii) the Company closing a financing for a minimum of
$20,000,000. The parties have agreed that, upon repayment in full of the Second LowCal Note,
LowCal will forever release, cancel and terminate all of its mortgages and any other liens against
the Company.
 
On March 11, 2016, the Company and LowCal amended the LowCal Agreements (the "Seventh
Amendment to the LowCal Agreements").  Under the Seventh Amendment to the LowCal
Agreements: (i) the maturity dates of the LowCal Loan and Second LowCal Note was extended
to May 1, 2016; (ii) the expiration date of LowCal's warrants was extended to May 1, 2020; (iii) the
Company will issue to LowCal [EOS/PETRO], LLC ("LowCal") an additional 75,000 restricted
shares of the Company's common stock; and (iv) the parties agreed that if: (1) the Company pays
off the $3,250,000 principal balance of the Second LowCal Note in full, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest, and (2) either: (A) the Company closes a transaction where it acquires at least
$10,000,000 in additional assets, through an asset purchase, stock purchase, merger, or other
similar transaction, which shall be determined by generally accepted accounting principles, or
(B) the Company successfully uplists its common stock to a national exchange market (NASDAQ
or  the New York Stock Exchange), then the following will automatically occur: (1) the conversion
price of the LowCal Loan will be reduced from $2.50 per share to $2.00 per share, and (2) any
outstanding principal and interest due on the LowCal Loan will be converted at a price of $2.00
per share into restricted shares of the Company's common stock, which shall be issued to
LowCal.
The value of the 75,000 shares issued with the Seventh Amendment to the LowCal Agreements
was $300,000 which was the fair value of the shares on March 11, 2016.  The $300,000 was
charged to financing cost during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  In addition, the Company
took a charge to earnings of $188,378 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 related to the
extension of the expiration date of 1,000,000 warrants previously issued to LowCal.  The charge
is the difference in fair value of the warrants using the old expiration date and the new expiration
date using the Black-Scholes option- pricing model for options with the following assumptions:
·Expected life of 2.81 to 4.14 years;
 ·Volatility of 174%;
 ·Dividend yield of 0%; and
 ·Risk free interest rate of 1.16%.

(1) On February 16, 2012, and as amended through January 1, 2016, Eos entered into a Secured
Promissory Note with Vatsala Sharma ("Sharma") for a secured loan for $600,000 at an interest
rate of 18% per annum (as amended, the "Sharma Loan"). The Sharma Loan is secured by a
blanket security interest in all of Eos' assets, and newly acquired assets, a mortgage on the
Works Property, a 50% security interest in Nikolas Konstant's personal residence, and his
personally held shares in a non-affiliated public corporation.  As amended, the maturity date of
the Sharma Loan is July 1, 2016.  As additional consideration for entering into the Sharma Loan,
the Company issued 400,000 shares of common stock.  Under the terms of the Sharma Loan,
Sharma will receive an additional 275,000 shares of the Company's common stock as of January
1, 2016.  The value of the 275,000 shares issued to Sharma was $1,100,000, which was the fair
value of the shares on January 1, 2016.  Such amount was charged to financing cost during the
six months ended June 30, 2016.  This note is currently in default.
(2)  On September 30, 2014, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to Bacchus
Investors, LLC ("Bacchus") for $323,000, with interest at 4%. During 2015, the Company issued

in 2016, the Company issued additional unsecured promissory notes of $200,000 to Bacchus
with interest at 10% for a total outstanding of $653,000 at June 30, 2016. The unsecured
promissory notes are due upon demand.
(3)  On October 9, 2014, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to Ridelinks, Inc. for
$200,000, with interest at 2% and a maturity date of March 15, 2015 that was extended to June
15, 2015 and includes an exit fee of $30,000.   The maturity date has subsequently been
extended to April 30, 2016.  In consideration for extending the due date of this note per an
agreement dated March 25, 2016, the Company issued to Ridelinks 40,000 shares of the
Company's common stock. The value of the 40,000 shares issued to Ridelinks was $150,000
which was the fair value of the shares on March 26, 2016.  The $150,000 was charged to

the remaining principal due on July 1, 2016.  This note is currently in default.
(8) On May 19, 2016, the Company issued two secured promissory notes for $37,500 each, with
interest at 1% and a maturity date of July 6, 2016.  In connection with these promissory notes, the
Company also issued to the noteholders 750,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued
at $870,000.    In addition, for one note, Plethora Enterprises, LLC ("Plethora"), the Company's
majority stockholder, issued the noteholder 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock
valued at $290,000.  The value of the common stock was based on the closing stock price on the
date of the agreements and was recorded as a discount of $75,000 and the reminder of
$1,085,000 was charged to financing costs.  The discount of $75,000 will be amortized over the
term of the notes.  In July 2016, $20,000 of these notes were repaid.  These notes are currently in
default.
(9) On June 27, 2016, the Company issued a secured promissory note to an investor for
$200,000, with interest at 10% and a maturity date of October 31, 2016.  In connection with this
promissory note, the Company also issued to the investor 200,000 warrants to purchase shares
of the Company's common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 per share with a fair value of
$173,787 and 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $300,000.
14
The fair values of the warrants were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions:
·Expected life of 3.0 years
·Volatility of 174%;
·Dividend yield of 0%;
·Risk free interest rate of 0.71%
The aggregate relative fair value of the warrants were valued at $92,987 and was recorded as a
discount on the promissory note and as additional paid in capital.  The value of the common
stock of $300,000 first recorded as a discount of $107,012, with the balance of $192,987 was
charged to financing costs.  The combined total discount is $200,000, and will be amortized over
the term of the note.
During six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded valuation discount of $275,000
and recognized amortization of debt discounts of $70,387 which is included in interest expense
in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.  As of June 30, 2016, the
unamortized valuation discount was 204,613.
The weighted average interest rate at June 30, 2016 for the outstanding notes payable is 11.4%
NOTE 5 – NOTES PAYABLE, RELATED PARTY
The Company has been receiving advances from Plethora Inc, a company wholly owned by
Nickolas Konstant, the Company's majority shareholder and CEO. All of the loans extended by
Plethora to the Company accrue interest at an annual rate of 10%, and are due on July 1, 2016. 
At December 31, 2015, the aggregate principal balance due under these notes was $1,208,160. 
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, the entire balance due on this note payable was converted into
shares of common stock.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, Plethora sold an aggregate of 351,515
and 750,000 of its shares of the Company's restricted common stock in private sales.  Following
the private sales transactions, Plethora loaned all of the aggregate proceeds from the private sale
of stock of to the Company, and concurrently, the Company issued Plethora separate unsecured
promissory notes for the aggregate principal amount received. The proceeds from these sales of
$125,000 were loaned to the Company.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, of the shares of common stock sold by
Plethora as discussed above, 251,515 and 750,000 shares were sold to either affiliates of the
Company, vendors, or individuals with whom the Company had a past business relationship. 
The Company considered the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") Topic 5T,
Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholders, and determined that the
difference between the quoted market price of the shares and the sales price to the buyers as
additional compensation cost and a contribution to capital by a major related party stockholder
(Plethora).  As such, the Company recorded charges of $931,060 and 3,675,000 during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 relating to the difference between the sales price and the
fair market price of the shares on the date of the transaction
NOTE 6 – DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
Under authoritative guidance used by the FASB on determining whether an instrument (or
embedded feature) is indexed to an entity's own stock, instruments which do not have fixed
settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments.  In August 2014, the Company
issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,775,000 shares of the Company's common stock,
to a former note holder and certain other related parties. The warrant agreements included an
anti-dilution provision that would reduce the exercise price if the Company were to issue
additional equities at a price below the exercise price which is in effect at the time of the issuance
of the additional equities. The Company determined that these warrants met the definition of a
derivative and are to be re-measured at the end of each reporting period with the change in fair
value reported in the statement of operations.
 
15
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the derivative liabilities were valued using a
probability weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model with the following
assumptions:

The risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. The
Company uses the historical volatility of its common stock to estimate the future volatility for its
common stock. The expected life of the warrants was determined by the expiration dates of the
warrants. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid
dividends to its common stockholders in the past and does not expect to pay dividends to its
common stockholders in the future.
The Company recorded an adjustment to the fair value of derivative liabilities of $5,105,765 and
$5,936,900 for six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
NOTE 7 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Plethora Enterprises, LLC

In connection with Mr. Alan Gaines' employment as the Company's President, the Company and
Mr. Gaines entered into a Stock Option Agreement, signed on December 16, 2015 and effective
January 11, 2016 ("Effective Date"), whereby the Company granted Mr. Gaines options to
purchase up 4,500,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock, all of which have an
exercise price of $1.00 per share and expire in five years.  The Company determined the total fair
value at grant date was $17,627,047, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The options vest as follows: 1,500,000 of the shares vested on the Effective Date; 1,500,000 of
the shares shall vest on the first anniversary of the Effective Date; and 1,500,000 of the shares
shall vest on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model for options are as follows:
·Expected life of 5.0 years;
·Volatility of 179%;
·Dividend yield of 0%; and
·Risk free interest rate of 1.58%.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $10,040,072 and
$4,673,412, respectively, of share based compensation relating to the vesting of options granted
in 2016 and other previously granted options.  As of June 30, 2016, the unamortized balance
related to future stock based compensation for options previously granted but not vested is
$7,586,975.
 
 
17
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company extended the terms of 50,000 option
by five years.  The change in fair value between the fair value of the options using the old
expiration date and the new expiration date was $93,714.  This amount was recorded as an
expense during the period as the options have fully vested.

NOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Dune Merger Agreement
 
On September 17, 2014 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Dune
Energy Inc. ("Dune") and Eos Delaware, dated as of September 16, 2014, as subsequently
amended (the "Dune Merger Agreement"), and on the terms and subject to the conditions
described therein, Eos Delaware agreed to conduct a cash tender offer to purchase all of Dune's
issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a price of $0.30 per share in cash, without
interest, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Dune Merger Agreement.
Due to the severe decline in oil prices, the Company's sources of capital for the merger and
tender offer were withdrawn, and the Company was unable to complete the merger and tender
described in the Dune Merger Agreement on the terms originally negotiated. After a series of
amendments to the Dune Merger Agreement while the parties continued to try to negotiate
financing terms, the tender offer ultimately expired on February 27, 2015.
Subsequently, on March 4, 2015, Dune provided the Company with notice of its decision to
terminate the Dune Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, and demanded the
Parent Termination Fee (as defined in the Dune Merger Agreement) of $5,500,000 in cash, and
reimbursement for certain unidentified expenses incurred by Dune.  Dune has threatened to bring
litigation to collect these amounts in connection with its contention that the Company breached
the Dune Merger Agreement and is entitled to the Parent Termination Fee. The Company has
accordingly recorded a liability for $5,500,000 related to the Parent Termination Fee. No lawsuit
has been filed to date against the Company for the Parent Termination Fee, and the Company
would vigorously defend itself, should any action ever be brought. The Company believes that it
has equitable and legal defenses against payment of all or a portion of the Parent Termination
Fee.
GEM Global Yield Fund
Pursuant to the financing commitment, dated August 31, 2011, and the Common Stock Purchase
Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, both dated as of July 11, 2013, entered into
between the Company and GEM (collectively referred to as the "Commitment Agreements"), the
Company was required to use commercially reasonable efforts to uplist to the NYSE, NASDAQ
or AMEX stock exchange within 270 days of July 11, 2013, and then to file a registration
statement covering the shares and warrants referenced in the Commitment Agreements within 30
days of uplisting. The Company further agreed to pay to GEM a structuring fee equal to $4
million, which was to be paid on the 18 month anniversary of July 11, 2013 regardless of whether
the Company had drawn down from the Commitment at that time. At the Company's election, the
Company may elect to pay the structuring fee in registered shares of its common stock of the
Company at a per share price equal to 90% of the average closing trading price of the
Company's common stock for the thirty-day period immediately prior to the 18-month anniversary
of July 11, 2013. As of January 11, 2015, the 18-month anniversary date of the agreement, the
Company had not met this requirement and may now become liable for payment of this
structuring fee to GEM.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded an accrued
structuring fee of $4 million.
NOTE 11– SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Company converted $2,371,646 of debt into 2,371,646 shares
of the Company's common stock.

Operations
Forward Looking Statements
This Report contains projections, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions,
descriptions of future events or performances and other similar statements that constitute
"forward looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our
control. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases
such as "may," "should," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result," "expect," "will
continue," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "projection," "would" and "outlook,"
and similar expressions. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this
Report regarding our expectations, objectives, assumptions, strategy, future operations, financial
position, estimated revenue or losses, projected costs, prospects and plans and objectives of
management are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of
June 30, 2016. Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in
such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those
set forth in this Report. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections
include, but are not limited to, for example: adverse economic conditions, inability to raise
sufficient additional capital to operate our business, delays, cancellations or cost overruns
involving the development or construction of oil wells, the vulnerability of our oil-producing assets
to adverse meteorological and atmospheric conditions, unexpected costs, lower than expected
sales and revenues, and operating defects, adverse results of any legal proceedings, the
volatility of our operating results and financial condition, inability to attract or retain qualified
senior management personnel, expiration of certain governmental tax and economic incentives,
and other specific risks that may be referred to in this Report. It is not possible for management to
predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to
update any forward-looking statements or other information contained herein. Stockholders and
potential investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by the
forward-looking statements in this Report are reasonable, we cannot assure stockholders and
potential investors that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. These cautionary
statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our
behalf.
 
Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in
any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
 
You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations

statements included in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that
reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those

Overview
On October 12, 2012, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, entered into by and between the
Company, Eos and Company Merger Sub, dated July 16, 2012, Company Merger Sub merged
into Eos, with Eos being the surviving entity in the Merger. As a result of the Merger, Eos became
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon the closing of the Merger, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock of Eos was automatically converted into the right to receive
one share of our Series B preferred stock. At the closing, we issued 37,850,044 shares of Series
B preferred stock to the former Eos stockholders, subject to the rights of the stockholders of Eos
to exercise and perfect their appraisal rights under applicable provisions of Delaware law to
accept cash in lieu of shares of the equity securities of the Company.
 
Effective as of May 20, 2013, the Company changed its name to Eos Petro, Inc. (it previously had
been named "Cellteck, Inc. ").
 
 
20
We are presently focused on the acquisition, exploration, development, mining, operation and
management of medium-scale oil and gas assets. Our primary activities as of June 30, 2016,
have centered on organizing activities but have also included the acquisition of existing assets,
evaluation of new assets to be acquired, and pre-development activities for existing assets.
Our continuing development of oil and gas projects will require the acquisition of land rights,
mining equipment and associated consulting activities required to convert the fields into revenue
generating assets. Generally, financing is available for these initial project costs where such
financing is secured by the assets themselves. From time to time. However, our activities may
require senior credit facilities, convertible securities and the sale of common and preferred equity
at the corporate level.
 
In connection with our business, we will likely engage consultants with expertise in the oil and
gas industries, project financing and oil and gas operations.
 
The financial statements included as part of this Report and the financial discussion reflect the
performance of Eos and the Company, which primarily relates to Eos' Works Property oil and gas
assets located in Illinois.
 
On September 17, 2014, we entered into the Dune Merger Agreement with Dune, and Eos
Delaware agreed to conduct a cash tender offer to purchase all of Dune's issued and outstanding
shares of common stock at $0.30 per share.  In addition, we agreed to provide Dune with
sufficient funds to pay in full and discharge all of Dune's outstanding indebtedness and agreed to
assume liability for all of Dune's trade debt, as well as fees and expenses related to the Dune
Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated therein.  At the commencement of the merger
and tender offer, we estimated that the total amount of cash required to complete the
contemplated transactions was approximately $140 million dollars.  The tender offer was not
subject to a financing contingency.  Following successful completion of the offer, Eos Delaware
would have been merged into Dune, with Dune surviving as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company.
Due to the severe decline in oil prices, our sources of capital for the merger and tender offer were
withdrawn, and we were unable to complete the merger and tender described in the Dune
Merger Agreement on the terms originally negotiated. After a series of amendments to the Dune
Merger Agreement while the parties continued to try to negotiate financing terms, the tender offer
ultimately expired on February 27, 2015. After the expiration of the tender offer, Dune was
notified by us that shares of Dune's common stock would be returned to the tendering
stockholders.
Subsequently, on March 4, 2015, Dune provided us with notice of its decision to terminate the
Dune Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, and demanded the Parent
Termination Fee (as defined in the Dune Merger Agreement) of $5,500,000 in cash, and
reimbursement for certain unidentified expenses incurred by Dune.  Dune has threatened to bring
litigation to collect these amounts in connection with its contention that the Company breached
the Dune Merger Agreement and is entitled to the Parent Termination Fee. The Company has
accordingly recorded a liability for $5,500,000 related to the Parent Termination Fee. No lawsuit
has been filed to date against the Company for the Parent Termination Fee, and the Company
would vigorously defend itself, should any action ever be brought. The Company believes that it
has equitable and legal defenses against payment of all or a portion of the Parent Termination
Fee.

Revenue
We primarily generate revenue from the operation of any oil and gas properties that we own or
lease and the sale of hydrocarbons delivered to a customer when that customer has taken title.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our primary revenue has come from one
source, the Works Property, located in Southern Illinois. Revenue for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $17,091 and $70,900, respectively.  The decrease in revenues for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 is due to a decrease in the price per barrels sold and a
decrease in the number of barrels sold.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we sold 501
barrels at an average price of $34 per barrel, compared to 1,548 barrels at an average price of
$46 per barrel for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease in the barrels produced
in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to the wells being shut down in June 2016 due to non-payment
to our operator. As disclosed below, our current financial resources are not sufficient to allow us
to meet the anticipated costs of our business plan for the next 12 months and we will require
additional financing in order to fund our business activities.
Lease operating expenses
Lease operating expenses for oil and gas assets were primarily made up of the Works Property.
Lease operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9,655 and
$53,228, respectively.  The decrease in operating expenses was due to lower cost due to the
wells being shut down for longer periods of time in 2016. 
 
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were
$3,726,252 and $6,702,470, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses have
primarily been made up of professional fees (legal and accounting services) required for our
organizing activities, acquisition agreements and development agreements. We recognized
approximately $515,000, $670,000, and $2,452,000 in professional fees, consulting fees and
compensation, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  We recognized
approximately $411,000, $3,825,000, and $2,328,000 in professional fees, consulting fees and
compensation, respectively for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  Other expenses included
are temporary professional staffing, rent, utilities, and other overhead expenses.  During the three
months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded compensation expense of $2,203,000 related to
options that were granted to our new CEO in January 2016 and vesting through January
2018.   During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded compensation expense of
$2,238,000 related to options that were issued to our CEO in August 2014 and vesting though
June 2015.  In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized financing
cost of $3,675,000 due to our majority stockholder selling shares of common stock to a consultant
at a significant discount to market.
Other income (expenses)
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, net other income was $2,984,799, consisting of
interest and finance costs of $1,515,304 and a gain on change in fair value of derivative liability
of $4,500,103.   Interest and financing costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 includes a
charge to earnings of $1,277,987 related to common stock and warrants being issued with notes
payable financing agreements.  For the three months ended June 30, 2015, net other income
was $3,100,947 consisting of interest and finance costs of $250,933 and a gain on change in fair
value of derivative liability of $3,351,880.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our primary revenue has come from one

30, 2016 and 2015 was $36,519 and $130,959, respectively.  The decrease in revenues for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 is due to a decrease in the price per barrels sold and a
decrease in the number of barrels sold.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we sold 1,211
barrels at an average price of $30 per barrel, compared to 2,818 barrels at an average price of
$46 per barrel for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease in the barrels produced in
2016 compared to 2015 is due to shutting down the production of the wells for a longer period of
time in early 2016 due to cold weather related issues and the wells being shut down in June
2016 due to non-payment to our operator. As disclosed below, our current financial resources are
not sufficient to allow us to meet the anticipated costs of our business plan for the next 12 months
and we will require additional financing in order to fund our business activities.
Lease operating expenses
Lease operating expenses for oil and gas assets were primarily made up of the Works Property.
Lease operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $42,329 and
$64,657, respectively.  The decrease in operating expenses was due to lower cost due to the
wells being shut down for longer periods of time in 2016. 
 
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were
$13,713,233 and $17,584,220, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses have
primarily been made up of professional fees (legal and accounting services) required for our
organizing activities, acquisition agreements and development agreements. We recognized
approximately $1,182,000, $1,727,000, and $10,617,000 in professional fees, consulting fees
and compensation, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  We recognized
approximately $526,000, $11,800,000, and $4,910,000 in professional fees, consulting fees and
compensation, respectively for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The increase in
professional fees was due primarily to costs associated with due diligence for potential
acquisitions and financings.  The decrease in consulting fees was due primarily to the fact that
during the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded consulting fees of approximately
$8,036,000 associated with warrants to be issued. The increase in compensation was due
primarily to the fact that during the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded compensation
expense of $10,040,000 related to options that were granted to our new CEO in January 2016
and vesting through January 2018.  Also, during the six months ended June 30, 2016, we
recognized costs of $931,060 due to our majority stockholder selling shares of common stock to
entities with which we have current business relationships at a significant discount to
market.   During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded compensation expense of
$4,476,000 related to options that were issued to our CEO in August 2014 and vesting though
June 2015.   Other expenses included are temporary professional staffing, rent, utilities, and other
overhead expenses.
 
 
23
Structuring fee
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a charge to earnings related to a
structuring fee of $4 million due to GEM.  There was no such charge during the six months ended
June 30, 2016.
 
Acquisition termination fee
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a charge to earnings of $5.5 million
related to the Parent Termination Fee associated with our proposed acquisition of Dune.  There
was no such charge during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Other income (expenses)
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net other income was $1,666,530, consisting of interest
and finance costs of $3,439,235 and a gain on change in fair value of derivative liability of
$5,105,765.   Interest and financing costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 includes i) a
charge of $488,378 related to the Seventh Amendment to the LowCal Agreements for the
issuance of 75,000 shares of common stock, and the extension of the warrant expiration date; ii)
a charge of $1,250,000 for the value of an aggregate of 315,000 shares of common stock issued
for debt extensions; and iii) a charge to earnings of $1,277,987 related to common stock and
warrants being issued with notes payable financing agreements.  For the six months ended June
30, 2015, net other income was $5,545,110 consisting of interest and finance costs of $391,790
and a gain on change in fair value of derivative liability of $5,936,900.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have financed operations through consulting and service agreements
with limited cash requirements, made up of stock compensation and various debt instruments as
more fully described in Stock Based Compensation, Commitments and Contingencies, Material
Agreements and Related Party Transactions. Our business calls for significant expenses in
connection with the operation and acquisition of oil and gas related projects. In order to maintain
our corporate operations and to significantly expand our operations and corresponding revenue
from our Works Property, we must raise a significant amount of working capital and capital to
fund improvements to the Works Property. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash in the amount of
$69,037. At June 30, 2016, we had total liabilities of $25,667,824. Our current financial resources
are not sufficient to allow us to meet the anticipated costs of our business plan for the next 12
months and we will require additional financing in order to fund these activities. In addition, our
Auditors in their audit report for the year ending December 31, 2015 included a statement in their
report to express a going concern uncertainty.
 
Management estimates the Company's capital requirements for the next twelve months, including
drilling and completing wells for the Works Property, will total approximately $2,500,000,
excluding any amounts that may be due to Dune under the Parent Termination Fee or a $4
million structuring fee that may be due to GEM.  No assurance can be given that any future
financing will be available, or if available, that it will be on terms satisfactory to the
Company.  Any debt financing or other financing of securities senior to common stock that the
Company is able to obtain will likely include financial and other covenants that will restrict the
Company's flexibility. At a minimum, the Company expects these covenants to include
restrictions on its ability to pay dividends on its common stock in the case of debt financing, or
cause substantial dilution for stockholders in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.
Any failure to comply with these covenants would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
To finance our operations, we have issued notes payable.  At June 30, 2016, we had the
following outstanding debt:
24
$8,250,000 in convertible and promissory notes payable to LowCal.  These loans were due on
·
May 1, 2016 and are currently past due and in default;
$2,008,000 in notes payable due to 10 note holders.  These notes bear interest ranging from 2%
·
to 18% and have maturity dates ranging from April 30, 2016 to January 1, 2017.  A majority of 
these notes are currently past due and in default; and
$1,256,535 of notes payable to Plethora Enterprises, a related party.  These notes bear interest
·
at 10% and are due on July 1, 2016.  These notes are currently paid due.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we received additional proceeds of $625,000
($168,190 of which the proceeds were paid directly to our vendors) from issuing notes payable
as described below.
On January 27, 2016, February 9, 2016 and February 26, 2016, we issued three unsecured
promissory notes to Bacchus Investors, LLC, for $50,000, $50,000 and $100,000, respectively,
each with an interest rate of 10% per annum and due on demand.
We issued a series of unsecured promissory notes to Plethora Enterprises for an aggregate
amount of $125,000, with an interest rate of 10% per annum and due on July 1, 2016.   Nikolas
Konstant, our CFO and Chairman of the Board, is the sole member and manager of Plethora
Enterprises.
On April 6, 2016, we issued an unsecured promissory notes to an investor for $100,000 with an
interest rate of 10% per annum and due on January 1, 2017.
On May 19, 2016, we issued two secured promissory notes to two investors for $37,500 each
with an interest rate of 1% per annum and due on July 6, 2016.  In addition, to we also issued
750,000 shares of common stock and Plethora issued 250,000 shares of common stock to the
two investors in connection with these two notes.
On June 27, 2016, we issued a secured promissory notes to an investor for $200,000 with an
interest rate of 10% per annum and due on October 31, 2016.  In addition, to we also issued
300,000 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock
with an exercise price of $1.00 per share to the investors in connection with this note.
We do not currently have sufficient financing arrangements in place to fund our operations, and
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing in an amount sufficient
to meet our needs or on terms that are acceptable to us.
 
In addition to funding our operations, we may become liable to pay certain other contractual
obligations, such as a structuring fee to GEM of $4,000,000 under the financing commitment,
dated August 31, 2011, and the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights
Agreement, both dated as of July 11, 2013, entered into between the Company and GEM
(collectively referred to as the "Commitment Agreements"), whereby GEM would provide and
fund the Company with up to $400 million dollars for the Company's African acquisition activities.
Pursuant to the GEM Commitment Agreements, the Company was required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to uplist to the NYSE, NASDAQ or AMEX stock exchange within 270 days of
July 11, 2013, and then file a registration statement covering the shares and warrants referenced
in the Commitment Agreements within 30 days of uplisting. The Company further agreed to pay
to GEM a structuring fee of $4,000,000, which was to be paid on the 18-month anniversary of July
11, 2013, regardless of whether the Company had drawn down from the Commitment at that time.
At the Company's election, the Company may elect to pay the structuring fee in common stock of
the Company at a per share price equal to 90% of the average closing trading price of the
Company's common stock for the thirty-day period immediately prior to the 18-month anniversary
of July 11, 2013. As of January 11, 2015, the 18-month anniversary date of the agreement, the
Company had not met this requirement and may now become liable for payment of this
structuring fee to GEM.
 
25
In connection with the asserted claim by Dune of the alleged breach of contract by the Company
of the Dune Merger Agreement, upon a termination of such agreement, a demand letter was
received from Dune on March 4, 2015 demanding payment of $5.5 million in the form of the
Parent Termination Fee, plus additional costs and expenses which were undefined.  The
Company has recorded this liability of $5.5 million as of December 31, 2015. No lawsuit has
been filed to date against the Company for the Parent Termination Fee, and the Company would
vigorously defend itself, should any action ever be brought. The Company believes that it has
equitable and legal defenses against payment of all or a portion of the Parent Termination Fee.
 
Obtaining additional financing is subject to a number of other factors, including the market prices
for the oil and gas. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional
financing unavailable to us. If adequate funds are not available or if they are not available on
acceptable terms, our ability to fund our business plan could be significantly limited and we may
be required to suspend our business operations. We cannot assure you that additional financing
will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. The failure to obtain such a financing would
have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
As a result, one of our key activities is focused on raising significant working capital in the form of
the sale of stock, convertible debt instrument(s) or a senior debt instrument to retire outstanding
obligations and to fund ongoing operations. It is expected that stockholders may face significant
dilution due to any such raise in any of the forms listed herein. New securities may have rights
and preferences superior to that of current stockholders. If we raise capital through debt
financing, we may be forced to accept restrictions affecting our liquidity, including restrictions on
our ability to incur additional indebtedness or pay dividends.
 
For these reasons, the report of our auditor accompanying our audited financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2015 included a statement that these factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern
will be dependent on our raising of additional capital and the success of our business plan.
  
We have retained consultants to assist us in our efforts to raise capital. The consulting
agreements provide for compensation in the form of cash and stock and result in additional
dilution to shareholders.
Cash Flows

Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon
consolidated financial statements and condensed consolidated financial statements that we have
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. We base our
estimates on historical information, when available, and assumptions believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
 
26
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and
resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and
circumstances. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of
recent accounting pronouncements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or
future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Not Applicable
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2016. Based upon such evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2016,
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the framework stated
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, due
to our financial situation, we will be implementing further internal controls as we become
operative so as to fully comply with the standards set by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Our Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes,
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a
system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Based on its evaluation as of June 30, 2016, our management concluded that our internal
controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of June 30, 2016. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
 
27
The material weaknesses relate to the following:
·Lack of an independent audit committee; 
·Lack of formal approval policies by the Board of Directors;  
·Lack of adequate oversight over individuals responsible for certain key control activities; 
Insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control monitoring activities,
·
including the recognition of risks and complexities of its business operations; 
An insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of GAAP knowledge and
·
experience or training in the application of GAAP commensurate with the Company's financial
reporting requirements.
The Company intends to remedy these material weaknesses by hiring additional employees,
officers, and perhaps directors, and reallocating duties, including responsibilities for financial
reporting, among our officers, directors and employees as soon as there are sufficient resources
available. However, until such time, these material weaknesses will continue to exist.
Further, in order to mitigate these material weaknesses to the fullest extent possible, all financial
reports are reviewed by an outside accounting firm that is not our audit firm. All unexpected
results are investigated. At any time, if it appears that any control can be implemented to continue
to mitigate such weaknesses, it will be immediately implemented.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
Dune Termination Fee
 
On March 4, 2015, Dune provided us with notice of its decision to terminate the Dune Merger
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(c)(i) of the Dune Merger Agreement. Dune's letter
terminating the Dune Merger Agreement demanded the Parent Termination Fee (as defined in
the Dune Merger Agreement) of $5,500,000 in cash, and reimbursement for certain unidentified
expenses incurred by Dune.  Dune has threatened to bring litigation to collect these amounts in
connection with its contention that the Company breached the Dune Merger Agreement and is
entitled to the Parent Termination Fee.  The Company has accordingly recorded a liability for
$5,500,000 related to the Parent termination Fee. No lawsuit has been filed to date against the
Company for the Parent Termination Fee, and the Company would vigorously defend itself,
should any action ever be brought. The Company believes that it has equitable and legal
defenses against payment of all or a portion of the Parent Termination Fee.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the
factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, which to our knowledge have not materially changed.  Those
risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, are not the
only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and/or operating results.
