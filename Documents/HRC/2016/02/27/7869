<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comments of the Greek government on the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Mr 
Francois Crepeau, following his visit to Greece 
(25 November </b>&#8211;<b> 3 December 2012) 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Greek Government thanks the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, Mr Francois Crepeau, for his visit to Greece and for the constructive discussions 
held with the competent Greek authorities during this visit. The protection and promotion 
of democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute the defining principles of 
the Greek Constitution and an integral part of national legislation. Being party to almost all 
major relevant international instruments, Greece considers active involvement into the 
various international organizations as a cornerstone for the effective protection of all human 
rights, through openness, transparency and international scrutiny.  Greece is fully aware of 
the need for constant efforts in the area of protection of human rights of migrants, bearing 
in mind that it faces a particularly strong mixed migratory pressure and carries a 
disproportionate burden, due to its geographic position at the external border of the EU, its 
extensive land and sea borders, its proximity with main countries of origin and transit of 
irregular migrants and asylum seekers. The Greek government strives to implement its 
obligation under international law to protect and promote the human rights of every person 
residing in Greece. Despite the extremely severe and unprecedented economic 
circumstances, the authorities make a consistent effort to protect the human rights of 
migrants. The Government of Greece would like to take the opportunity to submit certain 
comments on the Special Rapporteur's Report to the Human Rights Council, regarding 
Greece's position on a number of issues raised in that Report (Contributions by Ministries 
of: Public Order &amp; Citizens&#8217; Protection / Justice, Transparency &amp; Human Rights / Interior / 
Labour, Social Security &amp; Welfare / Shipping, Maritime Affairs and the Aegean). 
</p>
<p>2. <b>Paragraphs 6 and 7</b>. The referred police operations under the code names 
&#8220;ASPIDE&#8221; and &#8220;XENIOS ZEUS&#8221; had as purpose the apprehension and the adduction of 
immigrants for various criminal offenses, who are either arrested for various penal offences 
or are detained with the intention of their administrative deportation, according to the 
relevant provisions and with the aim to seal the Turkish - Greek border, which is also the 
border of the EU, from where we receive the greater immigration pressure. The above 
mentioned police operations which were carried out in August 2012, have had a positive 
impact on the protection of human rights of the immigrants who enter and live illegally in 
our country, since the Greek Police and its competent services and bodies may, mutatis 
mutandis, handle, more effectively the needs of reception and management of illegal 
immigrants in conditions of absolute respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>3. <b>Paragraph 8.</b> The dynamics of the phenomenon of racist and xenophobic violence 
which has been observed led the Greek Government to take additional measures in order to 
isolate behaviours that led to such phenomena (see par. 71 and 72). 
</p>
<p>4. <b>Paragraph 9.</b> The reported estimate is the minimum that can be given. Regarding 
the other points, we agree with the diagnosis, which, as stated in the text, is due to the 
relevant European policy on this subject (Dublin, etc.), which our country is trying to 
improve. 
</p>
<p>5. <b>Paragraph 10</b>. As part of our obligations under the Schengen Treaty, we are 
working closely with the Italian Authorities to prevent any illegal immigrants who want to 
leave Greece, the country of first entry, so as not to cross over to the rest of Europe via </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>Italy. On the assumption that Greece is an EU border-state, the key component of the 
Hellenic Coast Guard&#8217;s strategy for the integrated maritime border management is to regard 
the Greek territory as a single border area i.e. to adopt a zone-centered rather than the 
borderline-centered approach when applying blue border control measures; hence, the 
HCG&#8217;s maritime border management activities are developed in 3 basic zones: the Eastern 
Aegean zone, where intense migratory pressures are exerted mainly because of the close 
proximity with the Turkish coastlines; the Central Aegean zone, which comprises the rest 
of the Aegean islands and the Eastern seaboard of mainland Greece; and, finally, the 
western seaboard of Greece. 
</p>
<p>6. <b>Paragraphs 17 and 88:</b> It should be stressed that in the framework of 
decriminalization of immigrants as &#8220;victims of exploitation&#8221; by the organised crime 
networks that facilitate illegal migrants, the local public prosecutors abstain from 
prosecuting illegal migrants, thus placing special emphasis on the dismantling of organised 
crime networks and the imposition of penal and administrative sanctions on their members 
(carriers &#8211; traffickers). In this respect, we consider advisable to include in the report a 
reference to article 48 par. 4 of Law 3772/2009 (Official Gazette of the Hellenic 
Government 112 A&#900;/10-07-2009), replacing article of 88 Law 3386/2005, that foresees 
stricter administrative and penal sanctions on the carriers &#8211; traffickers and renders their 
criminal behaviour a felony. 
</p>
<p>More specifically, article 48 of Law 3772/2009 foresees penal sanctions of at least  
fifteen (15) years incarceration and monetary sanctions at least two hundred thousand 
(200.000 &#8364;) Euros for each transported person, if the action could expose the transported 
person to danger. Moreover, if the transported person dies, the said article stipulates life-
term incarceration as well as monetary sanction of at least seven hundred thousand 
(700.000 &#8364;) Euros for each deceased transported person. 
</p>
<p>7. <b>Paragraph 19</b>: We request the correction of the title &#8220;Ministry of Merchant Marine&#8221; 
to the correct &#8220;Ministry of Shipping, Maritime Affairs and the Aegean. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>Paragraph 24</b>: We consider as one of the basic reasons for the increase of migratory 
flows at Greek-Turkish land borders in 2010 and as of August 2012 at the Greek-Turkish 
maritime borders, the VISA-liberalization policy of Turkey towards citizens of North and 
West Africa countries, which, in combination with low cost airlines connecting Turkey 
with these African countries, gave them the possibility of easier access -by air- to Istanbul, 
and therefrom to attempt to illegally cross the Greek-Turkish land and/or maritime borders. 
</p>
<p>9. <b>Paragraph 27</b>: Regarding the discontinuation of EU Joint Operation &#8220;POSEIDON- 
Maritime Borders&#8221;, because of the deployment of Frontex RABIT teams at the Greek-
Turkish land borders, we would like to clarify that the EU Joint Operation &#8220;POSEIDON- 
Maritime Borders&#8221;, has developed uninterrupted ever since 5 May 2008. The EU Joint 
Operation &#8220;POSEIDON - Land Borders&#8221; was interrupted for the duration of Operation 
RABIT 2010 and continued after its termination.  
</p>
<p>Additionally, in the framework of EU Joint Operation &#8220;POSEIDON- Maritime 
Borders 2013&#8221; a Frontex Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) is planned to visit the 
Headquarters of the Hellenic Coast Guard. His task is to submit comments &#8211; observations 
and give directions for inclusion in the operational plan of the said Operation, as regards the 
respect of human rights of migrants and the prevention of any behaviour that may violate 
their rights. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>Paragraph 29</b>: We highlight the major importance that the Hellenic Coast Guard 
attaches to the respect of human rights of nationals of third countries and the prevention of 
any degrading behaviour of its officers that violates or breaches this respect. In view of the 
forthcoming EU Joint Operation &#8220;POSEIDON- Maritime Borders 2013&#8221;, appropriate orders 
shall be issued to HCG local Authorities requiring the full respect of human rights of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>nationals of third countries and the prevention of actions or omissions threatening to violate 
them. The deterrence of entry from Turkey into Greece is conducted in compliance with the 
relevant procedures. Frontex which operates on the land and sea border of our country, in 
the context of joint operations, has not noticed anything related to those mentioned in the 
report. 
</p>
<p>11. <b>Paragraph 30</b>. The creation of the fence built by Greek resources is not the solution 
of the problem. But it is a measure, an option with a powerful symbolism, a message that 
shall reach nationals of third countries, smugglers and traffickers who want to use our 
country as a transit country for their migration to the countries of European Union. 
</p>
<p>12. <b>Paragraphs 31-32 (and in combination with paragraph 10):</b> We want to stress 
the fact that the modalities of application by the Italian Authorities, of the provisions of the 
Greek -Italian Readmission Protocol and the methodology of readmission of numerous 
third countries nationals, can be greatly improved, taking into consideration the 
fundamental principles of EU with respect to solidarity and burden-sharing, the respect of 
human rights (especially, of sensitive groups, such as minors), as well the respect of 
international provisions for asylum or international protection. In this context, we consider 
as advisable the examination of the possibility to revise the provisions of the Greek -Italian 
Readmission Protocol, so that both parties improve their performance on human rights 
issues and restore the reciprocity in the discharge of their responsibilities. For ease of 
reference, it is mentioned that the Italian Authorities returned to Greece, with the method of 
direct readmissions (outside the scope of the Protocol) 2.556 nationals of third countries in 
2010, 1.984 in 2011 and 1.600 in 2012. 
</p>
<p>13. <b>Paragraph 33.</b> The Greek-Turkish Readmission Protocol under reference was  
already signed 11 years ago, and the cooperation of the Turkish authorities has disappointed 
the Greek side. Of course the Greek State, apart from those mentioned in the Protocol, 
respects the terms of international conventions on non-refoulement. 
</p>
<p>14. <b>Paragraph 35:</b> We would like to add that, besides the Greek &#8211; Turkish Readmission 
Protocol signed in 2002, the Prime Ministers of the two countries signed on 14-05-2010 a 
Joint Declaration, designating the ports of Mytilini (Greece) and the port of Dikili (Turkey), 
as readmission points for third country nationals arrested while crossing the maritime 
borders of the two countries (up to 40 persons every two weeks). However, the re-
admission procedure foreseen in the said Joint Declaration never took effect on a permanent 
basis, since it was put to practice only twice involving the readmission of a very limited 
number of third country nationals returned by boat to the port of Dikili (Turkey). 
</p>
<p>15. <b>Paragraph 38. It</b> is inaccurate that there is no possibility of judicial review of 
detention and deportation decisions. Under current legislation applied by our Authorities, 
every foreigner, upon the issue of the detention decision, has the right to appeal against it 
before the competent Administrative Court, and is also entitled to appeal against the 
expulsion decision, within five days before the competent police officer . Furthermore this 
decision can be challenged before the administrative courts. The presence of translators and 
lawyers is provided for. See also our answers below to paragraphs 54,56, and 58. 
</p>
<p>16. <b>Paragraph 40</b>. Regarding the voluntary repatriation of third country nationals, we 
would like to note the absence of reference to the important work being performed by the 
Greek Police Force in conjunction to that of the IOM. In particular, the number of assisted 
voluntary returns of illegal immigrants by the Greek Police Force for the year 2012 
amounted to 4.236 persons. 
</p>
<p>17. <b>Paragraphs 42 </b>&#8211;<b> 47</b>: The Ministry of Labour (Directorate of Social Welfare &amp; 
Solidarity) recognizing that the detention conditions need to be improved, finances in every 
annual program and emergency measures implemented under the European Refugee Fund 
(ERF), actions aiming to provide services to people held in those centers. (Specifically, we </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>mention all actions implemented in the detention centers for the years 2011, 2012 and 
2013). 
</p>
<p>18. <b>Paragraph 42</b>. Law 3386/2005 applies to persons illegally entering our country. 
The European Directive aims at facilitating the return of illegal migrants, already present in 
the country under a regime of tolerance. 
</p>
<p>19. <b>Paragraph 43.</b> The reported &#8220;<i>less restrictive detention measures</i>&#8221;, are implemented 
through the service already established by the law 3907/2011, called the <i>First Reception 
Service</i>, which manages the newly arrested illegal aliens (identification, citizenship 
verification, registration, medical check-up, information about their rights, care for 
vulnerable groups etc.).The existing immigrants under tolerance, for which the return 
Directive applies, are detained, until the return process is completed (issuance of travel 
documents, consultation with the authorities of their country, international organizations 
etc.).  
</p>
<p>20. <b>Paragraph 44: </b>Concerning the health problems of the immigrants, investigations of 
the competent health authorities show that these are not related to detention but are due to 
chronic infectious diseases (tuberculosis, syphilis, skin diseases, etc.). In order to address 
problems in the detention facilities, patients under detention are provided with necessary 
medical care, including by NGOs, while serious cases are sent for treatment to Hospitals or 
other appropriate medical institutions, so as these patients do not become threat to public 
health. 
</p>
<p>21. <b>Paragraph 45:</b> One of the key principles of the policy of the Ministry of Public 
Order and Citizen Protection and of the Hellenic Police Headquarters is the establishment 
of new standards, regarding the conditions of the Centres, capable of addressing the needs  
of reception and detention of illegal immigrants entering or residing in our country, with 
due respect to human rights. The long-term detentions which are mentioned in the text, are 
mainly a result of the delays which occur due to the lack of cooperation of the embassies of 
the countries of origin of the detainees. 
</p>
<p>22. <b>Paragraph 46:</b> In accordance with the aforementioned legal provisions, <i>&quot;the 
maximum detention period may not exceed six months, which can be extended for a limited 
</i></p>
<p><i>time, not exceeding twelve (12) months, in cases where, despite the reasonable efforts of the 
</i></p>
<p><i>competent authorities, the removal process is likely to last longer because: (a) the third 
</i></p>
<p><i>country national refuses to cooperate or (b) there are delays in obtaining the necessary 
</i></p>
<p>documentation from third countries&#8221;. The reference in the draft report of eighteen (18) 
months is therefore inaccurate. 
</p>
<p>23. <b>Paragraph 47:</b> Whenever it becomes obvious that there is no prospect of removal of 
detainees for legal or other reasons or when the terms of Article 30&#167; 1 <i>(risk of escape, etc.)</i> 
cease to apply, the detention measure is lifted and the third country national is immediately 
released (and a certificate of postponement of removal is provided).According to articles 24 
and 37 of Law 3907/2011, third-country nationals whose removal has been postponed, may 
enjoy a temporary right of residence in Greece. Moreover, in case the competent authorities 
fail to ensure minimum decent conditions of temporary accommodation in appropriate 
facilities, those third country nationals may be granted a permit for employment in specific 
sectors and regions. A Presidential Decree proposed by the Ministers of Interior, Labour 
and Public Order and Citizen Protection will specify the sectors and regions of 
employment, as well as the terms and conditions for the issuance of residence permits, for 
insurance matters and any other relevant issues. 
</p>
<p>24. <b>Paragraphs 48 and 49: </b>Despite the serious financial difficulties, Greece is making 
serious and significant efforts in order to protect human rights of detainees and all other 
rights which are provided for. The creation of pre-departure detention Centers of foreigners 
contributes among others:  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>(a) to increase dramatically the capacity of detainees (the efforts of 
apprehensions and prevention made daily by the Border Guard Stations and Immigration 
Services inside the country).  
</p>
<p>(b). to achieve uniform and orderly operation of the detention centers, with 
respect for the human rights of those detained. 
</p>
<p>(c) not to detain foreigners entering or persons living illegally in our country in 
police stations, but in detention centers with facilities that meet standards for lengthy 
detention. 
</p>
<p>(d) To have yard facilities and to provide a programme for carrying out activities 
for them. 
</p>
<p>(e) To have exact listings of detention registers and registers of movements of 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>(f) To have proper facilities (toilets, showers) which serve directly the needs of 
persons under detention without delay. 
</p>
<p>(g) To have a continuous and uninterrupted presence of doctors in order to 
ensure that necessary health care and psychosocial diagnosis and support by medical, 
nursing and other professional staff of public or non-governmental organizations or other 
organizations and agencies is provided. 
</p>
<p>25. In March this year, an &#8220;<i>Internal Regulation of Operation of the Security Services of 
Immigration Detention Facilities</i>&#8221; has been created in order to achieve a uniform and 
smooth operation of these centers and in order to regulate in the most convenient manner 
the needs arising from the detention of migrants. 
</p>
<p>26. <b>Paragraph 50:</b> In the Aegean islands it was decided to reopen the detention centers 
of Chios and Samos islands. Transitional units of First Reception will operate in these 
centres. The contractual works of maintenance and repair of these facilities have been 
completed, and the centres will reopen depending on the volume of migration flows. 
</p>
<p>27. <b>Paragraph 51:</b> In the facilities of guard detention at Petrou Ralli there exists a wing 
for women and temporary residing children (until transferred to juvenile facilities in 
Amygdaleza or to reception structures of the Ministry of Health and of non-governmental 
organizations) so as to ensure conditions of detention &quot; <i>that guarantee the safety, health and 
protection of the personality of the detainee</i>&quot; and care is taken &quot;<i>for</i> <i>avoiding mixing men 
with women, minors with adults, to the maximum possible degree</i>&quot;. 
</p>
<p>28. <b>Paragraph 52:</b> Detainees are allowed to circulate in to a specially formed yard, on a 
daily basis. 
</p>
<p>29. <b>Paragraph 53:</b> The important issue of vulnerable groups is getting careful 
consideration (for example women, single-parent families) and especially refugee minors 
(by implementing the provisions of Law 3907/2011 by which Greek legislation was 
adjusted to the provisions of the European Directive 2008/115/EC), and is a subject of 
particular concern for our Services, in the context of the social role and mission they 
perform, so that the required protection is always being provided, with care and sensitivity. 
Special attention is given to training police officers on human rights and vulnerable groups 
issues. For this purpose training seminars are being conducted annually, co-financed by the 
External Borders Fund and the Return Fund. 
</p>
<p>30. <b>Paragraphs 54, 56 and 58</b>: The presence of a lawyer is provided for in every part of 
both penal and administrative procedures, according to the provisions of our National 
Legislation. The detained migrants are visited by relatives and friends, and also by 
representatives of Diplomatic and Consular Authorities of their country of origin. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>Designated representatives of the Greek Council of Refugees are granted access in every 
detention facility every day, they communicate with the illegal migrants and provide them 
with legal assistance, in order to ensure their access to the asylum procedure. Their legal 
representation is assured throughout the procedure of the request examination. The above-
mentioned procedure is also being applied to representatives of international organizations 
(UNHCR etc.), as well as of other non-governmental organizations that deal with migration 
issues. The presence of an interpreter is also provided for and effort is being made to cover 
the needs of interpretation in every Service involved, by making use of interpreters 
appointed by the Greek State or interpreters provided by non-governmental organizations.In 
the annual programs of 2009-2010-2011-2012 of the European Return Fund, actions for 
employing interpreters to inform the detainees in a language they understand, have been, 
are being and will continue to be implemented. At the same time, scientific personnel 
(psychologists, social workers, interpreters) have also been employed by the Hellenic 
Police in order to cover the huge needs which arise daily. All the above mentioned actions 
are being implemented according to the international obligations of our country and the best 
practices that are applied by other countries, to serve the purpose of the security of the 
detainees and the personnel.  
</p>
<p>31. <b>Paragraph 55:</b> Detention is normally taking place in special facilities and separately 
from prisoners of Common Criminal Law.  Every apprehended migrant is being given 
an &#8220;information sheet&#8221;, by which they are informed about their rights (in a language they 
understand), on detention and the asylum procedure.The relevant and competent national, 
international and non-governmental Organizations and Bodies, can visit the facilities in 
which migrants under removal are being detained. The detained migrants are being 
systematically informed about the internal regulation of the detention facility, as well as 
about their rights and obligations, including their right to communicate with the above 
mentioned Organizations. Therefore, in every detention facility, relevant informative 
documents are being posted in a conspicuous position.It is noted that the procedures of 
removal are subject to external monitoring taking place with the care of the Independent 
Authority of the &#8220;Greek Ombudsman&#8221;, which cooperates, for this purpose, with 
International and non-governmental Organizations. 
</p>
<p>32. <b>Paragraph 59</b>: According to applicable rules, for safety reasons, the possession and 
use of mobile phones and any other electronic device by the detainees, is forbidden. The 
detained migrants can use card-phones that are placed in the detention facilities, with care 
of the competent Service. In case of an emergency that concerns relatives of the detainees, 
after the confirmation of the fact by the Service, the detainee concerned is facilitated to 
communicate by phone with their relatives, at any time. 
</p>
<p>33. <b>Paragraph 60:</b> In the framework of the utilization of the European Funds (External 
Borders, Return and Refugees) educational seminars on readmission, expulsion and return 
(escorted or not), the treatment of vulnerable groups and the protection of human rights, are 
being conducted (see last sentence of comments to par. 53). 
</p>
<p>34. <b>Paragraph 61</b>: With respect to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture (OPCAT), we would like to note that the process of submission 
of a draft ratification law to the Greek parliament has already been initiated. 
</p>
<p>35. <b>Paragraph 63:</b> In case of massive arrivals of illegal migrants in the area of North 
Aegean, especially in view of the upcoming summer season, the reopening of Chios and 
Samos Detention Centers, in which transitional first reception services will operate, will 
serve the needs of reception and detention of the newly arrived irregular migrants, for the 
island of Lesvos as well. 
</p>
<p>36. <b>Paragraph 66:. </b>First Reception Centers constitute the competent authority for the 
screening procedure of all irregular migrants and accommodation centers at the same time. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>By no means, do they constitute detention centers; the irregular migrants who are hosted 
within the premises of First Reception Centers, can only stay there up to 15 days, that is the 
maximum number of days that is required for the referral to be issued. By all means, an 
immigrant may leave the centre earlier if all procedures have been completed. Only in 
exceptional circumstances for which due reasons have been given, can the time of residence 
be extended up to 25 days. They are guarded centers, yet all accommodated migrants have 
the right to apply for a leave at any time, so FRCs cannot be characterized as closed centers. 
</p>
<p>37. <b>Paragraph 67. </b>All matters concerning the guarding of First Reception Centers &#8211; 
that is code of conduct and disciplinary measures &#8211; are to be included in the services 
contract that private security companies will sign. The contract will explicitly indicate the 
role, the scope and the tasks of the personnel working for the security company but also the 
limits of their competence and the measures to be applied towards the personnel or the 
company in case of inappropriate behavior. A draft Ministerial Decision that lays down 
training issues, emphasizing on human rights, of such personnel is ready to be signed. 
</p>
<p>38. <b>Paragraph 71:</b> The observed dynamics of the phenomenon of racist and xenophobic 
violence led the Greek state to adopt additional actions in order to isolate the behaviour that 
led to this kind of phenomena. In particular, the actions developed so far by the Greek 
police to deal with the racist phenomena can be summarized in the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) The creation of a network for the registration of alleged incidents of racist 
violence 
</p>
<p>(b) The establishment of criteria for ascertaining the existence of a racist motive 
and the provision of special instructions to the police staff for the relevant investigation 
</p>
<p>(c) The coordination with local and non-governmental entities and training of 
police staff 
</p>
<p>(d) The existence of an operational action plan for dealing with the racist 
phenomena 
</p>
<p>(e) Departments dealing with racist violence have been created through the 
whole country. 
</p>
<p>(f) From 25-01-2013 to 02-02-2013, 200 members belonging to the department 
of confrontation of racist violence have been trained. 
</p>
<p>(g) By Order of the Greek Police Chief, a competent monitoring Office examines 
relevant complaints as a matter of utmost priority. 
</p>
<p>(h) Also for the effective protection of the rights of the citizens against arbitrary 
actions of state organs, on the one hand, criminal provisions have been created which 
provide strict sentences for possible violations of human rights. On the other hand, there is 
constant administrative control of police staff, which is guaranteed by the particularly strict 
disciplinary law (Presidential Decree no. 120/2008) and the punishment  of delinquent 
behaviours takes place with the greatest possible speed. All cases with suspected racist 
motive, such as the above, have been registered by he competent services of the Greek 
police and have been referred to the prosecuting authorities.As far as the alleged risk of 
detention and deportation faced by illegal migrants if they report racist crimes is concerned, 
we would like to note that Greek law and practice provide effective protection to all racist 
and other hate crime complainants for as long as the criminal proceedings are pending. 
Pursuant to the &#8216;&#8217;Fourth Article&#8217;&#8217; of Law 3875/2010 (amending Article 44 of immigration 
law 3386/2005), complainants and victims of criminal offences are exempt from forced 
removal and granted a residence permit. This provision (and the implementing Ministerial 
Decision 21897/11) provides that a residence permit may be granted to victims of criminal 
offences provided for by Law 927/1979, on condition that a prosecution has been initiated. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>The residence permit may be valid until the delivery of a court&#8217;s decision on the case or 
until the termination of the victim&#8217;s medical treatment as applicable. It is also to be noted 
that under Article 79 par.3 of the Penal Code, as amended by Article 66 of Law 4139/2013, 
when a criminal act is committed on grounds related to ethnic, racial or religious hatred, the 
sentence imposed may not be suspended. Furthermore, the legislative framework on the 
prosecution of racist and xenophobic offences is currently being reinforced with th e 
impending adoption of a law implementing the EU framework decision on combating 
racism and xenophobia through penal law in the member states of the EU.  
</p>
<p>39. <b>Paragraph 72:</b> See above. The use of the phrase &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221; is provided 
for in Treaties and legislative acts of the European Union (ex. Art. 63a of the Treaty of 
Lisbon) 
</p>
<p>40. <b>Paragraph 74:</b> The issue of family reunification is very complicated because many 
minors wish to go to another European country where their relatives reside. However, in 
every case measures are taken which aim to satisfy the best interests of the minors and their 
families. 
</p>
<p>41. <b>Paragraph 75:</b> The determination of the age of the unaccompanied foreign minors 
is confirmed by the doctors who work in the detention centres of immigrants in 
coordination with the non governmental organizations and after proper interview with 
specialized police staff. The creation of permanent and stable structures of reception and 
detention of immigrants will solve the problem of verification of age effectively with sole 
criterion the best interests of the child. 
</p>
<p>42. <b>Paragraph 77</b>: For the unaccompanied minors Criminal Law no 220/2007 applies, 
which incorporated Directive 9/2003, and provides specific information to prosecutors of 
misdemeanours whether asylum application is submitted or not. The prosecutor is 
designated as temporary legal guardian, and afterwards in coordination with non 
governmental organizations and social services the Permanent Legal Guardian is 
designated, who usually is a social worker. If the designated Guardians do not meet 
expected duties, they can be replaced by order of the Prosecutor. In cooperation with non 
governmental organizations and the ministry of health, minors are transferred to special 
accommodation areas for minors, which they nevertheless sometimes abandon arbitrarily 
after some time. The issue of guardianship is of great concern to the Greek government and 
a topic under consideration in the Action Plan on Human Rights, which is being drafted. 
We cooperate on this issue with the UNHCR, the Ombudsman and NGOs working with 
unaccompanied minors. We would like to note that on 20 March 2013 the General 
Secretariat of Transparency and Human Rights of the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and 
Human Rights organized a one-day Conference on &#8216;Unaccompanied minors&#8217;. The 
conclusions thereof are expected to shed light, on a first level, on the imminent solutions 
available in these children&#8217;s best interest. 
</p>
<p>43. <b>Paragraph 78 and 110</b>: It should be underlined that national legislation on 
migration ensures the exercise of fundamental migrants&#8217; rights and their specificities within 
a system based on social justice, with particular respect for children rights. Specifically, the 
national legislation concerning migrant children may be summarized as follows: According 
to Art. 72 and 84 of law 3386/05 not only children who legally reside in Greece, but also 
children under refugee status or under the protection of the UNHCR or asylum seekers or 
just living in Greece, even if their legal residence status is still pending, are able to access 
education and have full access to the health care system, without any restrictions, regardless 
of their residence status or that of their parents. 
</p>
<p>44. <b>Paragraphs 82 and 116</b>: The Greek authorities do not share the view that CSOs 
should be financed directly from the EU budget. The decision and distribution of EU funds 
among Member States follow very strict financial Regulations. These funds are used to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>finance both EU and national multiannual projects in the framework of migration and 
asylum policies for which (projects) Member states are primarily responsible and co &#8211;
contributors. Consequently, the liability for the proper use of EU budget should remain with 
the Member States, independently of any possible improvement of the bureaucratic 
discrepancies. 
</p>
<p>45. <b>Paragraph 88 until 112:</b> Finally it is known that according to the preliminary 
recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, our country, despite the observed deficiencies, 
is moving to the right direction making every effort to keep and improve situations which 
ensure the necessary respect of human rights, according to the provisions of international 
treaties and regulations. 
</p>
<p>46. <b>Paragraph 109: (</b>and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s proposal for having all resources 
dealing with migration management rigorous ly trained in human rights issues):  
</p>
<p>The Hellenic Coast Guard is in the process of incorporating the Frontex Common Core 
Curricula in the educational programme of its Schools of Basic Training and at the same 
time it takes advantage of every educational opportunity to train its officers in the relevant 
thematic object, provided either from Frontex or from any other national and/or Community 
institution. 
</p>
<p><b>  Contribution provided by the newly established Greek Asylum Service  
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>Returns:</b> The number of Dublin II returns increased in 2012 in comparison to the 
previous year. More specifically, the Dublin Unit of the Aliens Division of the Hellenic 
Police Headquarters processed 739 outgoing requests and 314 persons were transferred to 
other EU Member States. In addition, the sum total of non-Dublin returns also increased 
from 17,279 in 2011 to 22,117 in 2012. Of the returns in 2012, 10,531 were voluntary, and 
of these 6,324 were assisted by the IOM (<b>an impressive jump from the 760 IOM assisted 
returns in 2011</b>). This significant increase is a consequence of the vigorous return 
programmes operated by IOM and the Greek government, and the high interest shown by 
the irregular migrants themselves, who are stuck in Greece, to return to their countries of 
origin. 
</p>
<p>48. <b>Staffing </b>&#8211;<b> recruitment of new Asylum Service and Appeals Authority:</b> A crucial 
decision was taken in the last quarter of 2012: the assignment to the Asylum Service and 
the Appeals Authority of 145 newly appointed civil servants from the register of candidates 
together with the budgetary allocation for their salaries. This decision, which was taken in 
conditions of unprecedented economic depression and fiscal austerity and which will 
address the staffing gaps of the two new services, is a powerful and eloquent sign of 
Greece&#8217;s commitment to the complete reform and rationalization of its asylum system. As 
of 6 March 2013, <b>of the total of 292 posts for both services, 122 have been filled</b>. By the 
end of March, the staffing level is expected to reach 187. 
</p>
<p>49. A multiplicity of ERF funded projects were implemented in Greece in 2012. The 
<b>total funding attached to these projects w</b>as in excess of &#8364; 11 million. These projects 
were implemented by a large number of Greek NGOs, international NGOs (e.g. Doctors 
Without Borders), the Greek Refugee Council, the Greek Red Cross, the UNHCR, and 
Greek state actors. The implemented projects concerned a whole raft of activities targeting 
refugees, asylum seekers and irregular migrants, and included among others: the provision 
of reception and hostel facilities, of medical care, of psychosocial support, of language 
education and vocational training, of legal aid and advice. The ERF funded projects were 
centred on Athens, the port city of Patra, other large cities, and the Evros region adjoining 
the Greek-Turkish border.  </p>
