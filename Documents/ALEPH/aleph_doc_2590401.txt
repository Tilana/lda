NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
These notes are an integral part of the financial statements of Murphy Oil Corporation and
Consolidated Subsidiaries (Murphy/the Company) on pages 2 through 6 of this Form 10-Q report.
Note A – Nature of Business and Interim Financial Statements
NATURE OF BUSINESS – Murphy Oil Corporation is an international oil and gas company that
conducts its business through various operating subsidiaries.  The Company produces oil and
natural gas in the United States, Canada and Malaysia and conducts oil and natural gas
exploration activities worldwide.  The Company sold its interest in a Canadian synthetic oil
operation in the second quarter of 2016.  The Company acquired 70% interest in Duvernay Shale
and a 30% interest in liquids rich Montney properties during the second quarter 2016.
INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – In the opinion of Murphy's management, the unaudited
financial statements presented herein include all accruals necessary to present fairly the
Company's financial position at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the results of
operations,  cash flows and changes in stockholders’ equity for the interim periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S.).  In preparing the financial statements of the Company in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., management has made a
number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results may differ from
the estimates.
Financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q
report should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2015 Form 10-K report, as certain notes
and other pertinent information have been abbreviated or omitted in this report.  Financial results
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of future results.
Note B – Property, Plant and Equipment
Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for companies that use the successful
efforts method of accounting, exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized when the
well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and
the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had total capitalized exploratory well costs pending the
determination of proved reserves of $128.1 million.  The following table reflects the net changes
in capitalized exploratory well costs during the
six-month periods ended June 30,  2016 and 2015.

Exploratory well costs capitalized more than one year at June 30, 2016 are in Brunei, and
development options are under review for these multiple gas discoveries.
In April 2016, a Canadian subsidiary of the Company signed a purchase and sale agreement for
the sale of its five percent, non-operated working interest in Syncrude Canada Ltd.  (“Syncrude”)
asset to Suncor Energy Inc. (“Suncor”), subject to closing adjustments.  The sale was completed
in June 2016 and the Company received net cash proceeds of $739.1 million.  The Company
recorded an after-tax gain of $71.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the
Syncrude divestiture.
In April 2016, a Canadian subsidiary of the Company completed its transaction to divest natural
gas processing and sales pipeline assets that support Murphy’s Montney natural gas fields in the
Tupper area of northeastern British Columbia.  Total cash consideration received by Murphy
upon closing of the transaction was $414.1 million.  A gain on sale of approximately $187 million
is being deferred and recognized over the next 20 years in the Canadian operating segment.
 The Company amortized $1.8 million of the deferred gain in the second quarter of 2016.  The
remaining deferred gain is included as a component of deferred credits and other liabilities on the
Company’s consolidated Balance Sheet.
In a separate transaction, the same Canadian subsidiary signed a definitive agreement to
acquire a 70 percent operated working interest (WI) of Athabasca Oil Corporation’s (Athabasca)
production, acreage, infrastructure and facilities in the Kaybob Duvernay lands, and a 30 percent
non-operated WI of Athabasca’s production, acreage, infrastructure and facilities in
the liquids rich Montney lands in Alberta, the majority of which is unproved.  Under the terms of
the joint venture the total consideration amounts to approximately $375 million, of which Murphy
paid $206.7 million in cash at closing, subject to normal closing adjustments, and the remaining
$168.0 million in the form of a carried interest for a period of up to five years.  The transaction
closed in the second quarter of 2016.
During the first quarter of 2016, declines in crude oil and natural gas prices from year end 2015
provided indications of possible impairments in certain of the company’s producing properties.
 As a result of management’s assessments, the Company recognized pretax non-cash
impairments charges of $95.1 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, to reduce the
carrying value to their estimated fair value for its Terra Nova field offshore Canada and its
Western Canada onshore heavy oil producing properties.  The fair values were determined by
internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices from futures
exchanges, estimates of future costs, and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those
used by principal market participants in the region.
During the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, the Company completed the sale of 10% of its
oil and gas assets in Malaysia and received net cash proceeds of $417.2 million.  The Company
recorded an after-tax gain of $199.5 million on the sale in the 2015 six-month period.

Note D – Financing Arrangements and Debt
The Company has a $2.0 billion committed credit facility with a major banking consortium that
expires in June 2017.  Borrowings under the facility bear interest at 1.45% above LIBOR based
on the Company’s current credit rating as of June 30, 2016.  In addition, facility fees of 0.30% are
charged on the full $2.0 billion commitment.  At June 30, 2016, the company had no borrowings
under this committed facility.  The Company also had outstanding letters of credit of
approximately $88 million issued under its revolving credit facility at June 30, 2016, which
reduced the available borrowing capacity under the agreement.  At June 30, 2016, the Company
also had uncommitted credit lines that had an estimated total borrowing capacity of
approximately $195 million of which no amounts were outstanding under these uncommitted
credit lines.    If necessary, the Company believes it could borrow funds under all or certain of
these uncommitted lines with various financial institutions in future periods.    The Company also
has a shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that
permits the offer and sale of debt and/or equity securities through October 2018.
The Company and its partners are parties to a 25-year lease of production equipment at the
Kakap field offshore Malaysia.  The lease has been accounted for as a capital lease, and
payments under the agreement are to be made over a 15-year period through June
2028.  Current maturities and long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included
$20.0 million and $202.7 million, respectively, associated with this lease at June 30, 2016.

Note F – Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans
The Company has defined benefit pension plans that are principally noncontributory and cover
most full-time employees.  All pension plans are funded except for the U.S. and Canadian
nonqualified supplemental plans and the U.S. directors’ plan.  All U.S. tax qualified plans meet
the funding requirements of federal laws and regulations.  Contributions to foreign plans are
based on local laws and tax regulations.  The Company also sponsors health care and life
insurance benefit plans, which are not funded, that cover most active and retired U.S.
employees.  Additionally, most U.S. retired employees are covered by a life insurance benefit
plan.  The health care benefits are contributory; the life insurance benefits are noncontributory.
The table that follows provides the components of net periodic benefit expense for the three-

Note G – Incentive Plans
The costs resulting from all share-based payment transactions are recognized as an expense in
the Consolidated Statements of Income using a fair value-based measurement method over the
periods that the awards vest.
The 2012 Annual Incentive Plan (2012 Annual Plan) authorizes the Executive Compensation
Committee (the Committee) to establish specific performance goals associated with annual cash
awards that may be earned by officers, executives and other key employees.  Cash awards
under the 2012 Annual Plan are determined based on the Company’s actual financial and
operating results as measured against the performance goals established by the
Committee.  The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2012 Long-Term Plan) authorizes the
Committee to make grants of the Company’s Common Stock and other stock-based incentives to
employees.  These grants may be in the form of stock options (nonqualified or incentive), stock
appreciation rights (SAR), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSU), performance units,
performance shares, dividend
equivalents and other stock-based incentives.  The 2012 Long-Term Plan expires in 2022.  A
total of 8,700,000 shares are issuable during the life of the 2012 Long-Term Plan, with annual
grants limited to 1% of Common shares outstanding.  The Company has an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan that permits the issuance of up to 980,000 shares through September
30,2017.  The Company also has a Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors that permits the
issuance of restricted stock and stock options or a combination thereof to the Company’s
Directors.
In February 2016, the Committee granted stock options for 862,000 shares at an exercise price of
$17.57 per share.  The Black-Scholes valuation for these awards was $5.03 per option.  The
Committee also granted 394,000 performance-based RSU and 200,000 time-based RSU in
February.  The fair value of the performance-based RSU, using a Monte Carlo valuation model,
ranged from $12.21 to $16.34 per unit.  The fair value of time-based RSU was estimated based
on the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant, which was $17.57 per
share.  Additionally, the Committee granted 708,200 SAR and 507,470 units of cash-settled RSU
(RSU-C) to certain employees.  The SAR and RSU-C are to be settled in cash, net of applicable
income taxes, and are accounted for as liability-type awards.  The initial fair value of these SAR
was equivalent to the stock options granted, while the initial value of RSU-C was equivalent to
equity-settled restricted stock units granted.  Also in February, the Committee granted 85,679
shares of time-based RSU to the Company’s Directors under the Non-employee Director Plan. 
These shares vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. The estimated fair value of these
awards was $19.26 per unit on date of grant.  In April 2016, the Company awarded an additional
217,500 time-based RSU.  The fair value of these time-based RSU was estimated based on the
fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant, which was $24.075 per share.
Amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to share-based plans are as follows:

Note I – Income Taxes
The Company’s effective income tax rate is calculated as the amount of income tax expense
divided by income before income tax expense.  For the three-month and six-month periods in
2016 and 2015, the Company’s effective income tax rates were as follows:
2015  
Three months ended June 30102.2% 19.2% 
50.4%  62.5% 
Six months ended June 30
2016
The effective tax rates for most periods where earnings are generated, generally exceed the U.S.
statutory tax rate of 35% due to several factors, including:  the effects of income generated in
foreign tax jurisdictions, certain of which have income tax rates that are higher than the U.S.
Federal rate; U.S. state tax expense; and certain expenses, including exploration and other
expenses in certain foreign jurisdictions, for which no income tax benefits are available or are not
presently being recorded due to a lack of reasonable certainty of adequate future revenue
against which to utilize these expenses as deductions.  Conversely, the effective tax rates for
most periods where losses are incurred generally are lower than U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%
due to similar reasons.  The effective tax rate for both the three-month and six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 was above the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to deferred tax benefits
recognized related to the Canadian asset dispositions and income tax benefits on investments in
foreign areas.  The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 was less
than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a deferred tax expense associated with an
enacted increase in the statutory tax rate in Alberta.  The effective tax rate for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2015 was above the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a deferred tax
benefit associated with the sale of Malaysian assets, partially offset by other expenses in foreign
jurisdictions for which no tax benefits were recognized and the enacted increase in statutory rate
in Alberta.
The Company’s tax returns in multiple jurisdictions are subject to audit by taxing
authorities.  These audits often take years to complete and settle.  Although the Company
believes that recorded liabilities for unsettled issues are adequate, additional gains or losses
could occur in future years from resolution of outstanding unsettled matters.  As of June 30, 2016,
the earliest years remaining open for audit and/or settlement in our major taxing jurisdictions are
as follows: United States – 2011; Canada – 2008; Malaysia – 2009; and United Kingdom – 2014.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Contd.)
Note J – Financial Instruments and Risk Management
Murphy often uses derivative instruments to manage certain risks related to commodity prices,
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  The use of derivative instruments for risk
management is covered by operating policies and is closely monitored by the Company’s senior
management.  The Company does not hold any derivatives for speculative purposes and it does
not use derivatives with leveraged or complex features.  Derivative instruments are traded
primarily with creditworthy major financial institutions or over national exchanges, such as the
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).  The Company has a risk management control system
to monitor commodity price risks and any derivatives obtained to manage a portion of such
risks.  For accounting purposes, the Company has not designated commodity and foreign
currency derivative contracts as hedges, and therefore, it recognizes all gains and losses on
these derivative contracts in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Certain interest rate
derivative contracts were accounted for as hedges and the net payment upon settlement
recording the fair value of these contracts was deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Loss.  This deferred cost is being reclassified to Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations over the period until the associated notes mature in 2022.
Commodity Purchase Price Risks
The Company is subject to commodity price risk related to crude oil, natural gas liquids and
natural gas it produces and sells.  The Company had open derivative contracts at June 30, 2016
and 2015.  The impact from marking to market these commodity derivative contracts increased
the loss before income taxes by $2.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 and
reduced the loss before income taxes by $7.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30,
2015.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risks
The Company is subject to foreign currency exchange risk associated with operations in
countries outside the U.S.  At June 30, 2016 and 2015 short-term derivative instruments were
outstanding in Canada for approximately $5.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively, to manage
the currency risks of certain U.S. dollar accounts receivable associated with sale of Canadian
crude oil.  The impact from marking to market these foreign currency derivative contracts was
insignificant for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
After signing an agreement to sell its five percent non-operated working interest in Syncrude, the
Company’s Canadian subsidiary entered into forward sales contracts for C$1.0 billion at a fixed
rate to lock in the U.S. dollar value of the proceeds and protect the Company from exposure to
weakening of the Canadian dollar.  Upon completion of the sale and settlement of the forward
sale contracts, the Company recognized income of approximately $26.8 million in the second
quarter of 2016 due to weakening of the Canadian dollar subsequent to entering into the
contracts.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of derivative instruments not designated

Interest Rate Risks
In 2011 the Company entered into a series of derivative contracts known as forward starting
interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with $350 million of 10-year notes that
were sold in May 2012.  These interest rate swaps matured in May 2012.  Under hedge
accounting rules, the Company deferred the net cost associated with these contracts to match the
payment of interest on these notes through 2022.  During each of the six-month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, $1.5 million of the deferred loss on the interest rate swaps was charged
to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The remaining loss deferred on
these matured contracts at June 30, 2016 was $11.3 million, which was recorded, net of income
taxes of $6.1 million, in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.  The Company expects to charge approximately $1.5 million of this deferred loss to
Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the remaining six months of
2016.
Fair Values – Recurring
The Company carries certain assets and liabilities at fair value in its Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  The fair value hierarchy is based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, with
Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality.  Level 1 inputs are quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are observable inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which
reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants.
The carrying value of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 are presented in the following table.

Note J – Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Contd.)
The fair value of WTI crude oil derivative contracts was determined based on active market
quotes for WTI crude oil at the balance sheet date.  The fair value of foreign exchange derivative
contracts in each year was based on market quotes for similar contracts at the balance sheet
dates.  The income effect of changes in the fair value of crude oil derivative contracts is recorded
in Sales and Other Operating Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations while the
effects of changes in fair value of foreign exchange derivative contracts is recorded in Interest
and Other Income.  The nonqualified employee savings plan is an unfunded savings plan
through which participants seek a return via phantom investments in equity securities and/or
mutual funds.  The fair value of this liability was based on quoted prices for these equity
securities and mutual funds.  The income effect of changes in the fair value of the nonqualified
employee savings plan is recorded in Selling and General Expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.  The Company offsets certain assets and liabilities related to
derivative contracts when the legal right of offset exists.  There were no offsetting positions
recorded at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Fair Values – Nonrecurring
As a result of significantly lower commodity prices in early 2016, the Company recognized

impaired properties is presented in the following table.

Note L – Environmental and Other Contingencies
The Company’s operations and earnings have been and may be affected by various forms of
governmental action both in the United States and throughout the world.  Examples of such
governmental action include, but are by no means limited to: tax increases and retroactive tax
claims; royalty and revenue sharing increases; import and export controls; price controls;
currency controls; allocation of supplies of crude oil and petroleum products and other goods;
expropriation of property; restrictions and preferences affecting the issuance of oil and gas or
mineral leases; restrictions on drilling and/or production; laws and regulations intended for the
promotion of safety and the protection and/or remediation of the environment; governmental
support for other forms of energy; and laws and regulations affecting the Company’s relationships
with employees, suppliers, customers, stockholders and others.  Because governmental actions
are often motivated by political considerations and may be taken without full consideration of
their consequences, and may be taken in response to actions of other governments, it is not
practical to attempt to predict the likelihood of such actions, the form the actions may take or the
effect such actions may have on the Company.
Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state,
local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment. Violation of federal or state
environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and
criminal penalties, injunctions and construction bans or delays.  A discharge of hazardous
substances into the environment could, to the extent such event is not insured, subject the
Company to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations
and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and
property damage that might result.
The Company currently owns or leases, and has in the past owned or leased, properties at which
hazardous substances have been or are being handled. Although the Company has used
operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous
substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased
by the Company or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal.
In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and
disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were
not under Murphy’s control. Under existing laws the Company could be required to remove or
remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners
or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to
perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination.  Certain of these historical
properties are in various stages of negotiation, investigation, and/or cleanup and the Company is
investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses.  The
Company has retained certain liabilities related to environmental matters at formerly owned U.S.
refineries that were sold in 2011.  The Company also obtained insurance covering certain levels
of environmental exposures related to past operations of these refineries.  The Company
believes costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on Murphy’s net
income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period.
During 2015, the Company’s subsidiary in Canada identified a leak or leaks at an infield
condensate transfer pipeline at the Seal field in a remote area of Alberta.  The pipeline was
immediately shut down and the Company’s emergency response plan was activated.  In
cooperation with local governmental regulators, and with the assistance of qualified consultants,
an investigation and remediation plan is progressing as planned and the Company’s insurers
have been notified.  The Company has not yet established a complete estimate of the costs
to remediate the site.  Based on the assessments done to date, the Company recorded
$43.9 million in other expense during 2015 associated with the estimated costs of remediating
the site.  The Company has spent $32.7 million to date associated with this event.  Further
refinements in the estimated total cost to remediate the site are anticipated in future periods,
including possible fines from regulators and insurance recoveries.  It is possible that the ultimate
net remediation costs to the Company associated with the condensate leak or leaks will exceed
the amount of expense recorded through June 30, 2016.
There is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently
unidentified sites, and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known
sites. However, based on information currently available to the Company, the amount of future
remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s future net income, cash flows or liquidity.
Murphy and its subsidiaries are engaged in a number of other legal proceedings, all of which
Murphy considers routine and incidental to its business.  Based on information currently
available to the Company, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future
period.

Note M – Commitments
The Company has entered into forward sales contracts to mitigate the price risk for a portion of its
2016 to 2020 natural gas sales volumes in Western Canada.  The natural gas sales contracts
call for deliveries during the last six months of 2016 of approximately 99 million cubic feet per day
(MMCFD) at C$3.00 per MCF and 40 MMCFD at C$2.71 per MCF from January 2017 through
December 2020.    In July 2016, the Company entered into an additional 19 MMCFD of natural
gas sales contracts for the January 2017 through December 2020 period at C$3.00 per MCF. 
These natural gas contracts have been accounted for as normal sales for accounting purposes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Contd.)
Note O – New Accounting Principles and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) to increase transparency and comparability among companies by
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements.  The main difference between previous generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and this ASU is the recognition of lease assets and
lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous
GAAP.  The new standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early
adoption is permitted for all entities.  The Company anticipates adopting this guidance in 2019
and is currently evaluating the standard and its impact on its consolidated financial statements
and footnote disclosures.
Compensation-Stock Compensation
In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU intended to simplify the accounting for share-based
payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification within the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this
ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim period or
annual period.  The Company will adopt this guidance in 2017 and is currently evaluating the
impact on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606),  a  comprehensive new revenue recognition standard for contracts with customers that will
supersede most current revenue recognition requirements and industry-specific guidance.  The
codification was amended through additional ASUs and, as amended, requires an entity to
recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or
services.  The Company is required to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018 using
either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company has not yet
selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the standard and the impact on its
consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
Note P – Subsequent Event
On August 3, 2016, the Board of Directors of Murphy Oil Corporation declared a quarterly cash
dividend on its common stock of $0.25 per share.  The dividend is payable September 1, 2016 to
holders of record August 15, 2016.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overall Review
During the first half of 2016, worldwide benchmark oil and natural gas prices have been
significantly below average comparable benchmark prices during 2015.  These lower oil and
natural gas prices coupled with a property impairment in the 2016 period have led the Company
to incur losses from operations in the first six months of 2016.  Although the Company has been
aggressively attacking its overall cost structure, a continuation of very low commodity prices
would likely lead to further adverse effects on the Company’s income and cash flow in future
periods.

Murphy’s net earnings in the second quarter of 2016 was $2.9 million ($0.02 per diluted share)
compared to net loss of $73.8 million ($0.42 per diluted share) in the second quarter of
2015.  Income from continuing operations was $2.9 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in the 2016
quarter compared to a loss of $89.0 million ($0.51 per diluted share) in 2015.  In the 2016 second
quarter, the Company’s exploration and production continuing operations earned $32.2 million
compared to a loss of $51.2 million in the 2015 quarter.  The net income in the 2016 quarter was
favorably impacted by lower lease operating expenses, lower depreciation expense, lower
exploration costs and higher income tax benefits related to capital gains tax treatment on
Canadian asset dispositions and income tax benefits recognized on investments in foreign
areas.  These were offset in part by lower revenues due to significantly weaker realized oil and
natural gas sales prices and lower volumes sold.  The corporate function had after-tax costs of
$29.3 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to after-tax costs of $37.8 million in the 2015
period with the favorable variance in the current period mostly due to higher benefits from foreign
exchange effects offset in part by higher net interest costs.  The 2016 second quarter
included only minor income from discontinued operations compared to income of $15.2 million
($0.09 per diluted share) in the 2015 period.  Discontinued operations in the prior period included
an adjustment to the impairment previously recognized for refining and marketing operations in
the U.K., the final components of which were sold at the end of the second quarter 2015.
For the first six months of 2016, net loss totaled $195.9 million ($1.14 per diluted share)
compared to a net loss of $88.3 million ($0.50 per diluted share) for the same period in
2015.  Continuing operations had a loss of $196.6 million ($1.14 per diluted share) in the first six
months of 2016, compared to a loss of $85.5 million ($0.48 per diluted share) in the same period
of 2015.  In the first half of 2016, the Company’s exploration and production operations incurred a
loss of $124.4 million compared to a loss of $32.5 million in the same period of
2015.  Exploration and production loss in 2016 was higher than the 2015 period primarily due to
lower revenues resulting from significantly lower realized oil and natural gas sales prices and
lower volume sold, impairment expenses in Canada in 2016 and lower after-tax gains on assets
sold.  These were partially offset by lower lease operating expenses and production taxes, lower
depreciation expense, lower exploration costs and lower expenses for environmental
costs.  Corporate after-tax costs were $72.2 million in the 2016 period compared to after-tax costs
of $53.0 million in the 2015 period as the current period had lower gains for the effects of foreign
currency exchange and higher net interest costs, partially offset by lower administrative
costs.  Net loss in the first half of 2016 included income from discontinued operations of $0.7
million ($0.00 per diluted share) compared to a loss of $2.8 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in
the 2015 period.  Discontinued operations in both periods primarily consists of costs related to
winding down of all operations in the U.K.  The final components of the refining and marketing
operations were sold at the end of the second quarter 2015.

Second quarter 2016 vs. 2015
United States exploration and production operations reported a loss of $65.7 million in the
second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $16.5 million in the 2015 quarter.  Results were
lower by $49.2 million in the 2016 quarter compared to the 2015 period as revenue in the U.S.
fell $196.2 million in the current period due to both lower oil and natural gas realized sales prices
and lower volumes sold. Lower supply costs and lower exploration expenses partially offset the
decline in revenues.  Lease operating expenses decreased by $24.1 million due to lower costs in
Eagle Ford Shale and offshore Gulf of Mexico compared to same quarter in 2015 with most of the
reduction due to the Company aggressively attacking its cost structure.  Severance and ad
valorem taxes in the 2016 quarter were $5.1 million lower than the 2015 period primarily due to
weaker average commodity prices and lower volume sold.  Depreciation expense decreased
$50.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower volume sold and lower unit rate in Eagle
Ford Shale in the 2016 period.  Exploration expenses were down $29.9 million in the second
quarter of 2016 primarily related to lower dry hole costs of $18.5 million and lower undeveloped
lease amortization compared to the 2015 quarter.
Operations in Canada had earnings of $55.3 million in the second quarter 2016 compared to a
loss of $32.2 million in the 2015 quarter.  Canadian results of operations improved by $87.5
million in the 2016 quarter.  Results for conventional operations improved $20.9 million in 2016
due to lower production costs, higher natural gas volumes produced in the Tupper area of
Western Canada, income tax benefits associated with divestiture of Montney midstream assets
and no repeat of a tax charge related to a 2% increase in the statutory tax rate in Alberta in
2015, offset in part by lower average realized sales prices for crude oil and natural gas and lower
oil volume sold.  Lease operating expenses associated with conventional operations were $7.7
million lower in the 2016 quarter due to both lower costs and a weaker Canadian dollar
exchange rate.  Depreciation expense in conventional operations decreased by $13.5 million in
the 2016 period due to lower unit rates, lower volume sold and a weaker Canadian dollar
exchange rate.  Synthetic operations earned $51.9 million in 2016 compared to a loss of $14.7
million in the 2015 period. The largest contributing factor to this 2016 improvement was a $71.7
million after-tax gain on sale of its non-operated interest in Syncrude completed at the end of the
second quarter 2016.  Normal synthetic operating results were $5.1 million lower in the 2016
period versus the 2015 quarter. Lower oil sales prices and lower volume sold in the 2016 period
were partially offset by lower lease operating expense and no reoccurrence of the 2015 tax
adjustment related to the aforementioned increase in the Alberta statutory tax rate.  Lease
operating expenses associated with synthetic operations were $11.7 million lower in the 2016
quarter due to lower variable costs and a weaker Canadian dollar exchange rate. Depreciation
expense was $8.5 million lower in the current period due to lower volumes and a weaker
Canadian dollar.  Synthetic production volumes and lease operating expense were significantly
impacted in 2016 by the facility being shut-in for 44 days of the quarter due to forest fires in the
area.
Malaysia operations reported earnings of $47.7 million in the 2016 quarter compared to earnings
of $27.6 million during the same period in 2015.  Results improved $20.1 million in 2016 in
Malaysia primarily due to lower lease operating expenses and lower depreciation expense,
partially offset by lower commodity prices received and lower volumes sold in the 2016
period.  Lease operating expenses decreased in the 2016 period by $27.5 million due to lower
costs and lower volume sold compared to 2015.  Depreciation expense was $78.1 million lower
in 2016 compared to the 2015 quarter primarily due to lower unit rates following 2015 impairment
charges at certain producing properties, and lower oil and natural gas volumes sold.

Results of Operations (Contd.)
Exploration and Production (Contd.)
Second quarter 2016 vs. 2015 (Contd.)
Other international operations reported a loss of $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2016
compared to a loss of $30.1 million in the 2015 quarter.  The $25.0 million improvement in the
2016 period was primarily related to a favorable adjustment of previously recorded exit costs
associated with ceasing production operations in Republic of Congo in the current period versus
a charge in the 2015 period for uncollectible receivables from partners in Republic of Congo.
Total hydrocarbon production averaged 168,642 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the 2016
second quarter, which represented a 16.5% decrease from the 201,952 barrels of oil equivalents
per day produced in the 2015 quarter.  Average crude oil and condensate production was 98,995
barrels per day in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 121,262 barrels per day in the second
quarter of 2015.  Crude oil production decreased 12,385 barrels in the Eagle Ford Shale area of
South Texas in 2016 due to well decline associated with significantly less drilling in the last half
of 2015 and early 2016 in response to lower prices.  Heavy oil production from the Seal area in
Western Canada was lower in 2016 primarily due to volumes shut-in associated with
uneconomic wells and natural decline.  Oil production offshore Eastern Canada was slightly
higher during 2016 primarily due to better uptime at the Hibernia field.  Synthetic oil production
was 6,036 barrels per day lower in the 2016 period due to the facility being shut in for 44 days
due to forest fires in the surrounding area.  Lower oil production in 2016 in Malaysia was
primarily attributable to less net oil volumes produced due to the sale of 10% of the Company’s
total interest in early 2015 coupled with natural decline.  On a worldwide basis, the Company's
crude oil and condensate prices averaged $44.42 per barrel in the second quarter 2016
compared to $56.49 per barrel in the 2015 period, a decline of 21% quarter to quarter.  Total
production of natural gas liquids (NGL) was 8,883 barrels per day in the 2016 second quarter
compared to 9,779 barrels per day in the same 2015 period.  The decrease in NGL production
was primarily associated with lower natural gas volumes produced in the U.S.  The average
sales price for U.S. NGL was $11.33 per barrel in the 2016 quarter compared to $12.64 per barrel
in 2015.  Natural gas sales volumes averaged 365 million cubic feet per day in the second
quarter 2016 compared to 425 million cubic feet per day in 2015.  Natural gas sales volumes
decreased in North America in 2016 due primarily to lower volumes produced offshore Gulf of
Mexico but partially offset by higher volumes in the Tupper area of Western Canada.  Natural gas
sales volumes in Malaysia decreased in the 2016 period due to more downtime in the 2016
period.  North American natural gas sales prices averaged $1.35 per thousand cubic feet (MCF)
in the 2016 quarter, 44% below the $2.42 per MCF average in the same quarter of 2015.  The
average realized price for natural gas produced in the 2016 quarter at fields offshore Sarawak
was $3.29 per MCF, compared to a price of $3.82 per MCF in the 2015 quarter.
Six Months 2016 vs. 2015
United States exploration and production operations reported a loss of $131.4 million in the first
half of 2016 compared to a loss of $110.4 million in the 2015 period.  The loss increased $21.0
million in 2016 compared to the 2015 period due to lower revenues partially offset by lower
production costs and lower exploration expenses.  Revenue in the U.S. fell $301.6 million in the
period due to both lower oil and natural gas realized sales prices and lower volumes sold.  Lease
operating expenses decreased by $70.4 million due to lower costs in Eagle Ford Shale and
offshore Gulf of Mexico compared to the same period in 2015, with most of the reduction due to
the Company aggressively attacking its cost structure coupled with lower variable costs based on
volumes produced.  Severance and ad valorem taxes in the first half of 2016 were $13.0 million
lower than the 2015 period primarily due to weaker average commodity prices and lower volume
sold.  Depreciation expense decreased $86.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower unit
rates in Eagle Ford Shale in the 2016 period and lower U.S. volume sold.  Exploration expenses
were down $86.1 million in the 2016 period primarily related to lower dry hole costs of $64.9
million and lower undeveloped lease amortization expense compared to the first half of 2015.
Operations in Canada had a loss of $31.9 million in the first half of 2016 compared to a loss of
$70.7 million in the 2015 six months.  Canadian results of operations improved by $38.8 million
in the 2016 period.  Results for conventional operations worsened by $27.7 million in 2016 due
to impairment expense, lower average realized sales prices for crude oil and natural gas and
lower oil volume sold.  These were partially offset by higher natural gas volumes produced, lower
production costs, no repeat of prior year charges for an environmental provision at the Seal
heavy oil area, income tax benefits recognized on the sale of certain Montney midstream assets
in 2016, and no repeat of a tax adjustment in 2015 for a 2% increase in the statutory tax rate in
Alberta.  Lease operating expenses associated with conventional operations were $15.6 million
lower in the first six months of 2016 due to both lower costs and a weaker Canadian dollar
exchange rate.  Depreciation expense was $28.7 million lower in the 2016 period compared to
2015 due primarily to lower unit rates and mix of volume sold.  Impairment expense was $95.1
million in 2016, as low oil prices led to a write down of heavy oil properties at Seal in Western

Canada and the Terra Nova field offshore East Coast Canada in the first quarter of the
year.  Synthetic operations generated $47.9 million in income in 2016 compared to a loss of
$18.6 million in the same period of 2015. A $71.7 million after-tax gain on sale of the Company’s
non-operated interest in Syncrude completed at the end of the second quarter was the primary
driver of the improvement.  Normal operating results were $5.2 million lower in the 2016 period
versus the 2015 quarter. Lower oil sales prices and lower volume sold in the 2016 period were
partially offset by lower supply costs and no reoccurrence of the 2015 adjustment related to the
aforementioned increase in the Alberta statutory tax rate.  Lease operating expenses associated
with synthetic operations were $17.6 million lower in the 2016 quarter due to lower variable costs
and a weaker Canadian dollar exchange rate.  Depreciation expense declined $8.9 million in the
2016 period due to lower unit rate and lower volume produced.  Production volumes, lease
operating expense and depreciation expense were significantly impacted by the facility being
shut-in for 44 days of the quarter due to forest fires in the area.
Malaysia operations reported earnings of $70.1 million in the first half of 2016 compared to
earnings of $250.7 million during the same period in 2015.  Results were down $180.6 million in
2016 in Malaysia primarily due to a $218.8 million after-tax gain on sale of a 10% interest in
Malaysian assets in the 2015 period.  Revenue declined by 351.4 million driven by lower
commodity prices received and lower volumes sold in the 2016 period, but this was partially
offset by lower lease operating expenses and lower depreciation expense.  Lease operating
expenses decreased in the 2016 period by $40.7 million due to lower maintenance costs and
cost cutting measures, and lower volume sold compared to 2015.  Depreciation expense was
$222.6 million lower in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to lower unit
rates following 2015 impairment charges at certain producing properties and lower oil and
natural gas volumes sold.
Other international operations reported a loss of $31.2 million in the first six months of 2016
compared to a loss of $102.1 million in the 2015 period.  The 2016 period included lower dry
hole costs of $23.9 million, with the higher 2015 costs primarily associated with unsuccessful
wildcat drilling offshore Australia.  Geological and geophysical costs were $12.6 million lower in
the 2016 period, primarily due to less seismic data acquired in Australia.  Other exploration
expenses were $6.7 million lower in the current year, mostly attributable to the Company closing
certain field offices beginning in late 2015 and aggressively attacking its cost structure.  Other
expenses were $21.0 million less in the 2016 period primarily related to an adjustment of
previously recorded exit costs in the current period associated with ceasing production
operations in Republic of Congo versus a charge in the 2015 period for uncollectible receivables
from partners in Murphy West Africa.
Total worldwide production averaged 182,604 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the six
months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease from 211,699 barrels of oil equivalent produced in the
same period in 2015.  Crude oil and condensate production in the first half of 2016 averaged
111,235 barrels per day compared to 130,778 barrels per day a year ago.  Crude oil production
decreased 9,933 barrels per day in the Eagle Ford Shale in 2016 due to well decline associated
with significantly less drilling beginning in the last half of 2015 and continuing into 2016 in
response to lower prices.  Heavy oil production in Canada declined in 2016 in the Seal area of
Western Canada primarily due to uneconomic well volumes shut-in caused by low sales prices,
and natural decline.  Synthetic oil production in Canada also was lower in 2016 due to impacts of
maintenance work and downtime associated with forest fires in the surrounding area.  Lower oil
production in 2016 in Malaysia was primarily attributable to natural well decline.  For the first six
months of 2016, the Company’s sales price for crude oil and condensate averaged $38.78 per
barrel, down from $51.26 per barrel in 2015.  Total production of natural gas liquids was 9,058
barrels per day in the 2016 period compared to 10,094 barrels per day a year ago. The sales
price for U.S. natural gas liquids averaged $9.80 per barrel in 2016 compared to $12.77 per
barrel in 2015.  Natural gas sales volumes decreased from 425 million cubic feet per day in 2015
to 374 million cubic feet per day in 2016. Natural gas sales volumes increased in North America
due to higher gas production volumes in the Tupper area in Western Canada and Eagle Ford
Shale area of South Texas, offset in part by lower gas volume in the Gulf of Mexico primarily in
the Dalmatian field.  The increase in North America was more than offset by lower production in
Malaysia due to unplanned downtime in both Sarawak and Block K.  The average sales price for
North American natural gas in the first six months of 2016 was $1.45 per MCF, down from $2.44
per MCF realized in 2015.  Natural gas production at fields offshore Sarawak was sold at an
average realized price of $3.52 per MCF in 2016 compared to $4.53 per MCF in 2015.
Additional details about results of oil and gas operations are presented in the tables on pages 26

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (Contd.)
Results of Operations (Contd.)
Corporate
Corporate activities, which include interest income and expense, foreign exchange effects, and
corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, had net cost of $29.3 million in the 2016
second quarter compared to a net cost of $37.8 million in the same 2015 quarter.  The $8.5
million lower cost in the 2016 period is primarily due to higher benefits from foreign currency
exchange and lower administrative costs, partially offset by higher net interest costs and lower
tax benefits.  An after-tax gain of $19.5 million occurred in 2016 on transactions denominated in
foreign currencies, while the 2015 quarter had an after-tax gain of $1.3 million.
For the first half of 2016, corporate activities reflected net costs of $72.2 million compared to net
costs of $53.0 million a year ago.  The $19.2 million increase in net cost in the current year is
primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange benefits and higher net interest cost.  An after-
tax gain of $21.3 million occurred in 2016 on transactions denominated in foreign currencies
compared to an after-tax gain of $35.1 million a year ago.
Discontinued Operations
The Company has presented all operations in the U.K. as discontinued operations in its
consolidated financial statements.  In June 2015, the Company completed an agreement to sell
the remaining U.K. downstream assets.
The after-tax results of the U.K. operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 are reflected in the following table.

Financial Condition
Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $113.4 million for the first six-months of
2016 compared to $715.2 million during the same period in 2015.  The decline in cash provided
by continuing operations activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to significantly lower
realized sales prices for the Company’s oil and gas production and lower volume sold during the
current year, offset in part by lower lease operating expenses.  Changes in noncash operating
working capital from continuing operations used cash of $86.8 million during the first six-months
of 2016, compared to generating cash of $107.2 million in 2015.  The use of cash in 2016
included $261.8 million associated with pay-off of cancelled deepwater rig contracts that were
previously charged to expense in 2015.  Proceeds from sales of property and equipment
generated cash of $1,153.3 million in 2016 compared to $423.1 million in 2015.  The 2016
proceeds are mainly attributable to the sale of the Company’s non-operated 5% interest in
Syncrude Canada Ltd. (“Syncrude”) for $739.1 million and the disposition of certain midstream
assets in the Tupper area of Western Canada for $414.1 million.  The prior year amount primarily
related to proceeds received upon sale of a 10% interest in Malaysian assets.  Other significant
sources of cash included $701.4 million in the 2016 period and $663.3 million in 2015 from
maturity of Canadian government securities that had maturity dates greater than 90 days at
acquisition.  The Company borrowed $823.0 million in the 2015 period to fund capital
expenditures and repurchase company stock.

Financial Condition (Contd.)
The uses of cash for property additions and dry holes, which including amounts expensed, were
$604.6 million and $1,433.6 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  Total cash dividends to shareholders amounted to $120.5 million in 2016 and
$124.6 million in 2015.  In the first six months of 2015, the Company expended $250.0 million to
acquire 5,236,709 shares of Common stock.  Also, the purchase of Canadian government
securities with maturity dates greater than 90 days at acquisition used cash of $651.2 million in
the 2016 period and $629.8 million in the 2015 period.  The Company repaid debt in the amount
of $600.0 million in the six-month period of 2016.  The debt repayment was funded using
proceeds from the sale of assets.  The Company had no borrowings outstanding on its $2.0
billion revolving credit facility at June 30, 2016.  The Company used $450.0 million of cash in the
2015 period to repay current maturities of long-term debt.
Total accrual basis capital expenditures were as follows:

The reduction in capital expenditures in the exploration and production business in 2016
compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to lower development drilling in the Eagle Ford
Shale area in the United States and offshore Malaysia and lower spending on exploration drilling
in the Gulf of Mexico and other international operations.  The 2016 capital expenditures included
$206 million to fund acquisition of Kaybob Duvernay and liquids rich Montney properties in
Canada.

Working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) at June 30, 2016 was $157.1
million, $383.3 million more than December 31, 2015, with the increase attributable to lower
accounts payable for deepwater rig contract exit cost and other operating activities.
At June 30, 2016, long-term debt of $2,435.5 million had decreased by $605.1 million compared
to December 31, 2015.  Long-term debt was paid down in 2016 using part of the sales proceeds
from Canadian asset disposition.  A summary of capital employed at June 30, 2016 and

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (Contd.)
Financial Condition (Contd.)
Cash and invested cash are maintained in several operating locations outside the United
States.  At June 30, 2016, cash, cash equivalents and cash temporarily invested in Canadian
government securities held outside the U.S. included U.S. dollar equivalents of approximately
$188.7 million in Canada and $81.4 million in Malaysia.  In certain cases, the Company could
incur taxes or other costs should these cash balances be repatriated to the U.S. in future
periods.  This could occur due to withholding taxes and/or potential additional U.S. tax burden
when less than the U.S. Federal tax rate of 35% has been paid for cash taxes in foreign
locations.  A lower cash tax rate is often paid in foreign countries in the early years of operations
when accelerated tax deductions are permitted to spur oil and gas investments; cash tax rates
are generally higher in later years after accelerated tax deductions in early years are
exhausted.  Canada collects a 5% withholding tax on any cash repatriated to the United States
through a dividend to the U.S. parent.
Accounting and Other Matters
Leases
In February 2016, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) to increase transparency and comparability among companies by
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements.  The main difference between previous generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and this ASU is the recognition of lease assets and
lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous
GAAP.  The new standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early
adoption is permitted for all entities.  The Company anticipates adopting this guidance in 2019
and is currently evaluating the standard and its impact on its consolidated financial statements
and footnote disclosures.
Compensation-Stock Compensation
In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU intended to simplify the accounting for share-based
payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification within the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this
ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim period or
annual period.  The Company will adopt this guidance in 2017 and is currently evaluating the
impact on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606), a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard for contracts with customers that will
supersede most current revenue recognition requirements and industry-specific guidance.  The
codification was amended through additional ASUs and, as amended, requires an entity to
recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or
services.  The Company is required to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018 using
either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company has not yet
selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the standard and the impact on its
consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
Outlook
Average worldwide crude oil prices in July 2016 are similar to the average prices during the
second quarter of 2016 with Brent and WTI trading at near parity.  Non-OPEC crude oil
production continues to slide, but total commercial inventories that remain at elevated levels will
be slow to clear.  Driven by strong seasonal power demand, North American natural gas prices
improved in July 2016 relative to the second quarter of 2016 as the U.S commercial inventory
excess to the prior year was trimmed by nearly 60% since the end of the withdrawal season in
March.  The Company expects its total oil and natural gas production to average 167,500 to
169,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter 2016.  The Company currently
anticipates total capital expenditures for the full year 2016 to be approximately $620  million,
excluding the cost to acquire the Kaybob Duvernay and liquids rich Montney interests in Canada.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (Contd.)
Outlook  (Contd)
The Company will primarily fund its capital program and property acquisitions in 2016 using
operating cash flow and proceeds from recent divestitures, but supplements funding where
necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities.  As of June 30, 2016, there were no
funds borrowed under its revolving credit facility.  The Company’s current 2016 outlook calls for
no borrowings under its revolving credit agreement during the second of half of 2016.  If oil and/or
natural gas prices weaken, actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced such
that unanticipated borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the
Company’s ongoing development projects.    The Company’s revolving credit facility matures in
June 2017, and the Company currently expects to execute a new agreement prior to expiry of the
existing facility.  A new credit facility may include different terms compared to the existing facility.
The significant reduction in the sales prices of crude oil has caused the Company to reduce
capital expenditures, including development drilling and completion operations in North
America.  The Company’s capital spending program in 2016 will be well below 2015 levels.  The
reduced level of capital expenditures, if it continues, could lead to lower production levels in
future periods.  A continuation of low oil and/or gas prices or further deterioration therein, could
lead to negative future effects on the Company, which could include reductions in proved
reserves, additional impairment charges, the necessity for further cost containment measures,
higher debt levels, and a reconsideration of the level of dividends on its Common stock.
As of August 3,  2016 the Company has entered into derivative or forward fixed-price delivery
contracts to manage risk associated with certain future oil and natural gas sales prices as

Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements, which express management’s current views
concerning future events or results, are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties.  Factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-
looking statements include, but are not limited to, the volatility and level of crude oil and natural
gas prices, the level and success rate of Murphy’s exploration programs, the Company’s ability to
maintain production rates and replace reserves, customer demand for Murphy’s products,
adverse foreign exchange movements, political and regulatory instability, adverse developments
in the U.S. or global capital markets, credit markets or economies generally and uncontrollable
natural hazards.  For further discussion of risk factors, see Murphy’s 2015 Annual Report on
Form 10-K on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and page 32 of this Form
10-Q report.  Murphy undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements.
ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil,
natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates.  As described in Note
J to this Form 10-Q report, Murphy makes use of derivative financial and commodity instruments
to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions.
There were commodity transactions in place at June 30, 2016 covering certain future U.S. crude
oil sales volumes in 2016 and 2017.  A 10% increase in the respective benchmark price of these
commodities would have decreased the recorded net asset associated with these derivative
contracts by approximately $36.4 million, while a 10% decrease in the benchmark price would
have increased the recorded net asset by a similar amount.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
(Contd.)
There were derivative foreign exchange contracts in place at June 30, 2016 to hedge the value of
the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar for certain U.S. dollar receivables to be collected in
April 2016.  A 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar would have
increased the recorded net liability associated with these contracts by approximately $0.5 million,
while a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have decreased the recorded net liability by
approximately $0.6 million.  Changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally
offset the financial statement impact of an equivalent volume of foreign currency exposures
associated with other assets and/or liabilities.
ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the direction of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, controls and
procedures have been established by the Company to ensure that material information relating to
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the officers who certify the
Company’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of
Directors.
Based on the Company’s evaluation as of the end of the period covered by the filing of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
Murphy Oil Corporation have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are
effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Murphy Oil Corporation in
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company continued to implement a new global
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which will handle the business and financial
processes within the company’s operations and its corporate and administrative functions. The
Company has modified its existing internal controls related to the ERP system
implementation.  While the Company believes that this new system and the related changes to
internal controls will ultimately strengthen its internal controls over financial reporting, there are
inherent risks in implementing a new ERP system and the Company will continue to evaluate
and test control changes in order to provide certification as of its fiscal year ending December 31,
2016 on the effectiveness, in all material respects, of its internal controls over financial reporting.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there were no other changes in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Murphy is engaged in a number of legal proceedings, all of which Murphy considers routine and
incidental to its business.  Based on information currently available to the Company, the ultimate
resolution of environmental and legal matters referred to in this note is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future
period.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
The Company’s operations in the oil and gas business naturally lead to various risks and
uncertainties.  These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors in its 2015 Form 10-K
filed on February 26, 2016.  The Company has not identified any additional risk factors not
previously disclosed in its 2015 Form 10-K report.
