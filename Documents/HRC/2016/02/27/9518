<p>2. Concerned by reports of trafficking in persons, especially of migrant workers for 
forced labour, the Special Rapporteur reiterates her interest in carrying out visits to Kuwait, 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Moreover, on the basis of information concerning 
trafficking in persons particularly for purposes of forced labour and sexual exploitation, the 
Special Rapporteur sent a second request to the Government of Nigeria for an invitation to visit 
in 2007. The Special Rapporteur has, moreover, accepted an invitation from the Government of 
Belarus to visit that country. She is furthermore in discussions with the Government of Thailand 
to carry out a visit, tentatively in September 2007, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child pornography and child prostitution. In addition, she reiterates her interest in 
visiting Japan.
