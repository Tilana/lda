<p><b>  Note by the secretariat</b> 
</p>
<p>1. In its resolution 22/16, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory 
Committee to prepare a research-based report on best practices and main challenges in the 
promotion and protection of human rights in post-disaster and post-conflict situations, with 
a focus on human rights mainstreaming in relief, recovery and reconstruction efforts, while 
respecting the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and 
independence and the needs-based approach of humanitarian assistance, in particular to 
foster the capacity of States in such efforts. The Council requested the Committee to 
present a progress report of the research-based report to the Council at its twenty-sixth 
session and the final report at its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>2. At its twelfth session, in February 2014, the Advisory Committee decided to 
recommend that the Human Rights Council extend the time schedule envisaged in order to 
allow the Committee to achieve better informed work by recirculating questionnaires to 
seek the views and inputs of the various stakeholders, and that the Committee be requested 
to submit the progress report to the Council at its twenty-seventh session and the final 
report at its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>3. The above-mentioned progress report of the Advisory Committee will therefore be 
finalized for the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council.
