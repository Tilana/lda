good governance, gender equality and equitable globalization. In line with the Declaration 
on the Right to Development, States have the primary responsibility to guarantee the full 
enjoyment of all human rights, including the right to development. The Union&#8217;s discourse is 
not within the realm of a legally-binding instrument. The draft set of criteria, once endorsed 
by the Working Group, should be used as a basis for the elaboration of a set of standards for 
the implementation of the right to development with the aim of mainstreaming the right to 
development in the policies of actors at all levels. They should be operationalized in terms 
of benchmarks and indicators with regard to the obligations of States to empower 
individuals as active agents in the development process.

UNCTAD commented that, in the light of the ongoing debate on whether a legally-binding 
document should be developed, the aim of the report takes great strides towards a 
consensus approach. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
referred to the view of some stakeholders that the right to development is achieved when all 
other rights are achieved, and suggested an approach that considers indicators for all other 
rights. WTO made detailed observations on the content of the study and enumerated issues 
on which its views differed from the latter&#8217;s findings. It noted that the TRIPS agreement 
had a broad potential, based on the understanding that all players should play an active role. 
With regard to innovation and technology transfer, WTO saw this relationship as mutually 
supportive. Its comments focused mostly on the relation between TRIPS-plus mechanisms 
and public health concerns, as reflected in indicators developed by the consultants. WIPO 
suggested that a possible fourth question would be &#8220;who will do the measurement&#8221;? It also 
stressed the importance of the independence of those using the criteria for evaluation 
purposes and the challenge of measuring development accurately and effectively in 
quantitative and qualitative terms.

the criteria should evolve into a set of standards or guidelines and who would monitor 
them, and underlined the fact that due regard should be given to any possible overlap with 
ongoing work by international institutions, treaty monitoring bodies and the Human Rights 
Council. Flavia Piovesan asked how the criteria could be applied to international 
organizations and drew attention to the particularity of the right to development in 
comparison to other human rights in terms of duty bearers, which are States acting 
individually and collectively, and rights holders, who are peoples and individuals. Ms. 
Fukuda-Parr suggested that the task force should consider what exactly is meant by 
measurement, and whether the aim was to obtain measurement or criteria, that is, the 
framework by which to measure. She stressed the need to clarify these two concepts, and 
stated that a coherent approach to develop indicators was to start with identifying what 
should be measured. Mr. Atuguba underlined the importance of the right to development as 
the &#8220;mother of all rights&#8221; entailing individual rights and global responsibilities. The 
Chairperson-Rapporteur emphasized that the objective of the task force was to develop 
usable, comprehensive and coherent tools at manageable proportions to assess the

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The high-level task force on the implementation of the right to development held its 
sixth session in Geneva from 14 to 22 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. The task force was established by the Commission on Human Rights in its 
resolution 2004/7 as endorsed by the Economic and Social Council in its decision 
2004/249, within the framework of the intergovernmental open-ended Working Group on 
the Right to Development, in order to assist it in fulfilling its mandate as reflected in 
paragraph 10 (a) of Commission resolution 1998/7.  
3. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 9/3, and the General Assembly, in its 
resolution 63/178, endorsed the workplan for the task force for the period 2008&#8211;2010, as 
recommended by the Working Group (A/HRC/9/17, para. 43). 
4. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 12/23, and the General Assembly, in its 
resolution 64/172, endorsed the recommendations of the Working Group (A/HRC/12/28, 
paras. 44&#8211;<footnote name="4">1. In the discussion that followed, the representative of WIPO stated that access to 
knowledge is a human right and intellectual property was made to build, not block, 
innovation and the rights of people. It is the responsibility of Governments to provide 
incentives for intellectual property, whereas the role of WIPO is to promote a culture for 
intellectual property and respect for indigenous, traditional and cultural knowledge and 
folklore. Regarding the realization of social and individual rights, WIPO drew attention to 
the importance of intellectual property in generating technologies that can help in 
protecting such indigenous knowledge and culture. Ms. Fukuda-Parr referred to the tension 
between public and private interests: incentivizing innovation by providing intellectual 
property protection on the one hand, and sharing and expanding that innovation on the 
other. The representative stated that market failures require Governments to intervene and 
address the needs of society, especially in the area of health. In that regard, WIPO pointed 
to TRIPs flexibilities, such as compulsory licensing, as a policy option to address the needs 
of society.

(A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.<footnote name="1">8. Mauritius associated itself with the statements made by Nigeria on behalf of the 
African Union and Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. It highlighted the 
constant widening of the gap between developed and developing countries, especially in 
Africa, which had worsened in the context of the food and economic crises, and the 
negative impact of climate change. The right to development was a fundamental human 
right that went beyond poverty eradication and was a bridge between economic, social and 
cultural rights and civil and political rights. There should be a genuine global partnership, 
in line with the contents of the Declaration on the Right to Development, in international 
cooperation.

together with corresponding operational sub-criteria (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2.Add.2), and 
outline suggestions for further work, including aspects of international cooperation not 
covered until then for the consideration of the Working Group at its eleventh session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b>5. The session was opened by the Director of the Research and Right to Development 
Division of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), Marcia V.J. Kran.  
6. At its first meeting, on 14 January 2010, the task force elected by acclamation 
Stephen Marks as Chairperson-Rapporteur, and adopted its agenda 
(A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/1); (see annex I) and programme of work.<footnote name="1">7. Bangladesh expected the task force, as an expert body, to provide expert opinions 
and not politically correct statements, which should be left to the Working Group as an 
intergovernmental body. It called for the finalization of the criteria and operational sub-
criteria, which it expected to be balanced, realistic and helpful to the realization of the right 
to development. These should be transformed into legally-binding norms. International 
support and solidarity are essential, as no country can achieve sustainable development by 
itself. 
</footnote> 
7. The task force focused on the implementation of the recommendations of the 
Working Group (see paragraph 4 above). The task force had before it a number of pre-
session and background documents to inform its deliberations (see annex III).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Statements by institutional members and observers 
</b>8. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) indicated that it was 
important for the task force to consider the evolution of the global economic context and 
evaluate its implications for the realization of the right to development. Developing 
countries have been seriously affected by the global financial and economic crises, and 
UNDP made efforts to ensure that countries were supported throughout the crises, and that 
endeavours to achieve the Millennium Development Goals were not undermined but rather 
accelerated to meet the 2015 targets.

focal point for trade and development issues within the United Nations system, found the

the need for political will. It was hopeful that the task force would complete its work, which 
should address the issue of the elaboration of a convention to raise the right to development 
to the level of other human rights.

</p>
<p>work of the task force relevant to its own work and at the heart of the priority concerns of 
its membership.  
</p>
<p>10. The African Union noted that development in Africa remains the foremost concern 
and objective of the Commission and States members of the Union. The first dialogue for 
Africa organized by the Commission in May 2009 in Geneva had concluded that, inter alia, 
the responsibility for development in Africa lies first and foremost with Africans. It is in 
this context that the African Union has embraced the right to development despite its 
challenges, including resource constraints, armed conflict, poverty, pandemics and 
vulnerability to climate change.  
</p>
<p>11. Egypt, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, welcomed the efforts made by the 
task force and acknowledged the progress made to date in refining the right to development 
criteria. Referring to previous Human Rights Council resolutions, it stressed the need for 
the task force to submit, in April 2010, a list of criteria and operational sub-criteria, and the 
Movement&#8217;s consistent position as outlined at several summits, particularly the Havana 
summit of 2006 and the Sharm El-Sheik summit of July 2009. These highlighted the 
commitment of the Movement&#8217;s members to work towards the elaboration and adoption of 
an international convention on the right to development, which should be on a par with 
other human rights and fundamental freedoms, following the principles of universality, 
interdependence, indivisibility and interrelatedness. Egypt reiterated that, in the current 
context of the global crises, the consequences of which are yet to be fully determined, and 
in the light of the failure of the climate conference in Copenhagen, it expected the refined 
criteria and operational sub-criteria to reflect and respond to these challenges and 
constraints to the realization of the right to development, at both the national and 
international levels, and also to adopt a balanced approach to the roles of national and 
international responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>12. The United States of America expressed its support for the work of the task force 
and the elaboration of criteria, while reiterating its concern with regard to the criteria 
evolving into a legally-binding instrument. It noted that development is a strategic, 
economic and moral imperative that should be viewed as an ongoing adaptive process and 
long-term endeavour.

context of other human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. Each 
criterion must be viewed within the global context, and good governance, democracy and 
the eradication of poverty are crucial to the realization of the right to development. 
Similarly, the Millennium Development Goals are closely linked to human rights and need 
to be addressed in the human rights context.

figures relating to wealth disparities within and across countries. It referred to a study by 
Michael Marmot of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, presented to 
the Economic and Social Council in July 2009, highlighting the 40-year gap in life 
expectancy between people living in the North and the South, which is illustrative of the 
failure of efforts made for equitable development. The speaker stressed that the right to 
development criteria should focus on results as opposed to implementation measures.

<p><b> IV. Presentations and discussion

<p>UNDP, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the World Bank and WHO, and that elements 
of development and equity permeate in its mission statement, as does the right to health, 
which is reaffirmed in the preamble to the WHO constitution and guides the work of the 
Programme. Within the context of the right to health, the director identified the underlying 
determinants of health, namely, water, sanitation, food and housing. He then underscored 
the fact that, in building availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality into the 
interface between these social determinants and access to health care, the underlying 
principles remained equality, non-discrimination, participation, inclusion, accountability 
and transparency. 
</p>
<p>28. The director of the Special Programme also emphasized three elements of Goal 8: 
global partnerships, cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, and a strategic approach 
to access to essential medicines. With regard to tropical diseases, he stressed the crucial 
importance of innovation and research to produce essential drugs and for these to be 
undertaken under agreements that facilitate availability and preferential pricing in 
developing countries. He also pointed out that facilitating access to medicines was more 
than a mere cost issue, and that often the delivery of essential drugs to those in need was a 
key problem. Evidence from the Special Programme indicates that, within certain 
programmes and systems, local communities may have an important role to play in 
collecting and distributing a drug (community-directed interventions) to ensure better 
distribution. The Special Programme expressed strong interest in continued collaboration 
with the task force. 
</p>
<p>29. The representative of the WHO Department of Ethics, Equity, Trade and Human 
Rights welcomed the mission of the task force and dialogue on access to essential 
medicines and the right to development. The Department works to mainstream human 
rights internally at WHO, and also to put health on the human rights agenda external to the 
Organization. WHO welcomed the opportunity to continue working with the task force and 
providing support for its efforts. 
</p>
<p>30. The director of the secretariat for Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property 
of WHO made a presentation, outlining that the Organization approached the right to health 
in a global framework within the context of the WHO constitution, which recognizes 
linkages with other global issues, including human rights. The Global Strategy and Plan of 
Action have explicit provision in the preamble for human rights and the right to health as 
important principles. Elements of the Strategy and Plan have express provisions on 
intellectual property and technology transfer. She reported on the various initiatives 
undertaken, individually or in collaboration with other institutions, such as UNCTAD and 
the European Union, which reflect such a comprehensive approach. The presentation 
concluded by emphasizing the key importance of global partnerships in addressing the right 
to health issues. 
</p>
<p>31. The director of the Pharmaceutical Management Unit of the Global Fund gave an 
overview of its work, and emphasized that the rationale for its existence is linked with the 
core principles underlying the right to development. The Global Fund expressed strong 
interest in and commitment to promoting human rights as a means of improving access to 
essential medicines as a component of the right to health. In this respect, the work of the 
Global Fund includes providing sustainable funding, establishing principles and policies, 
and providing technical assistance and capacity-building in order to strengthen countries&#8217; 
supplies and health systems. The Global Fund is engaged in monitoring and evaluation of 
access to essential medicines for the poor and vulnerable populations, through the use of 
access indicators as part of grant management, monitoring of procurement and quality data, 
and policy and market dynamics analysis, especially with regard to pricing. 
</p>
<p>32. In the ensuing discussion, the Chairperson-Rapporteur confirmed that the task force 
was aware that, as the technical mission report recognized, the Global Strategy and Plan of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-11443 
</p>
<p>Action process was not subject to change, but its implementation and interpretation 
provided opportunities to introduce human rights and right to development priorities. He 
also requested the Global Fund to update the task force on new developments in the 
promotion of innovation. The representative of the Global Fund referred in his response to 
patent pools that had been created, and also stated that the organization is committed to 
working with partners to improve access to essential medicines, and would make efforts to 
create incentives for manufacturers to collaborate to improve access to intellectual property 
and medicines.  
</p>
<p>33. In the interactive session with observers, Spain, on behalf of the European Union, 
commented that the dialogue initiated by the task force with global partnerships was 
beneficial to the implementation of the right to development, and emphasized that 
partnerships may also incorporate a human rights approach. 
</p>
<p>34. Egypt, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, referred to Council 
resolution 12/24, in which the Council requested OHCHR to organize an expert 
consultation on access to essential medicines, and stated that the outcome of the 
consultations should be linked to the right to development criteria. The United States of 
America, commenting on the mission report on access to essential medicines, expressed 
appreciation for the efforts made in information gathering. The United States took 
exception to the reference in the report to the right to development as &#8220;universally 
accepted&#8221;, since, in its view, this is not the case. In a clarification, the Chairperson-
Rapporteur explained that the reference in the report alluded to the repetition of 
commitment to this right in such consensus documents as the Vienna Declaration of 1993, 
the Millennium Declaration of 2000, the Monterrey Consensus of 2002, the World Summit 
Outcome of 2005 and various other world summits and conferences where the United 
States had joined consensus. He also respected the reservations and negative votes 
expressed by the United States in the past, and agreed that the political significance of 
agreeing to a long consensus text with a brief reference to the right to development should 
not be exaggerated. Nevertheless, universal acceptance (which does not imply any legal 
obligations) could be concluded from those consensus documents at the highest level. 
Egypt and Mauritius supported this viewpoint, adding that, in all human rights documents 
and resolutions, the right to development was always mentioned together with other human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Millennium Development Goal 8, target F, on technology transfer 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that the task force had proposed, and the 
Working Group had accepted, that the former would address target F of Goal 8 from the 
perspective of the potential contribution to the right to development of the WIPO 
Development Agenda and the Clean Development Mechanism of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, rather than information and communication 
technology.

<p>36. Ms. Fukuda-Parr presented the report of the technical mission to WIPO undertaken 
to initiate a dialogue on the WIPO Development Agenda from a right to development 
perspective. The importance of the agenda for development results from technology being a 
crucial element in creating an enabling environment for development, as technological 
innovation is an essential input to almost every area of human progress. The uneven global 
distribution of access and innovation is a defining challenge of the twenty-first century. The 
agenda is a major breakthrough in ensuring that the framework of intellectual property 
protection is managed to serve the public interest. 
</p>
<p>37. Ms. Fukuda-Parr recalled the key tensions between intellectual property systems and 
the right to development. While  intellectual property encourages innovation that produces </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11443 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>market returns, it does not always provide incentives for investments in technology that 
meet the basic needs of poor people and countries who have little purchasing power. The 
bulk of intellectual property rights are held by a few developed countries, hence the 
importance that developing countries catch up with innovation. Collaboration with other 
United Nations agencies should be considered in technical assistance so that intellectual 
property policies can be considered from broader development perspectives, and take 
account of diverse conditions in different countries that require an approach unique to 
meeting the country&#8217;s needs. Ms. Fukuda-Parr also stressed the significance of policy space 
and autonomy in creating an enabling environment for development. In this regard, an 
important issue to be addressed is how to maintain policy space given the constraints 
arising from international agreements such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Implementation of the Development Agenda is just 
beginning; from a human rights perspective, the implementation process requires a 
monitoring process that is yet to be established. 
</p>
<p>38. The head of the Innovation and Technology Transfer section at WIPO gave a 
presentation on intellectual property and technology transfer. He stated that development 
considerations form an integral part of the Organization&#8217;s work in this area. Nine of the 45 
recommendations of the Development Agenda focus on technology transfer and aim at 
developing the innovation capacity of developing countries so that they can exercise their 
right to development fully. WIPO also assists developing countries to enhance their ability 
to exercise their legitimate intellectual property rights on technological developments. 
Intellectual property protection can be made supportive, rather than restrictive, of 
development. The WIPO approach to transfer of technology is twofold and operates on two 
levels: macro and micro. At the macro level and in the long term, a favourable climate is 
promoted by generalizing a system of education that builds capacities in national priority 
development areas. In addition, assistance is provided for the development of an 
infrastructure for innovation promotion and technology transfer-efficient systems. This is 
accomplished through an intellectual property audit, assistance in the development of a 
national intellectual property strategy and institutional intellectual property policies for 
universities and research centres, and the creation of research and development networks 
and intellectual property hubs. At the micro-level and in the short term, WIPO offers 
technical support to bridge the gap between research and the productive cycle by providing 
capacity-building programmes in intellectual property management. Its strong commitment 
to broad cooperation and resolve to undertake activities in a transparent and inclusive 
fashion were also emphasized.  
</p>
<p>39. Marcos Orellana presented the findings of the study assessing the Clean 
Development Mechanism from a right to development perspective 
(A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/CRP.3/Rev.1). After outlining the main features and characteristics 
of the mechanism, a partnership for cooperation for sustainable development and 
greenhouse gas mitigation, Mr. Orellana elaborated on the main criticisms levelled against 
the mechanism in literature. In particular, the mechanism&#8217;s emphasis on emissions 
reductions does not ensure that the negative impact on human rights of peoples and 
communities is prevented or minimized. Further, the distribution of mechanism projects, 
which by and large benefit only a few developing countries such as Brazil, China and India, 
was not equitable. The decision on the Clean Development Mechanism at the Conference 
of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Copenhagen has 
taken some steps to promote a more equitable distribution of projects in developing 
countries. Mr. Orellana referred to the shortcomings of the mechanism with regard to its 
contribution to sustainable development and green technology transfer. In this context, he 
discussed the criticisms concerning additionality and environmental integrity issues, 
highlighting the problems that arise when certain mechanism projects do not generate real 
emissions reductions. These shortcomings are not in line with the right to development </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-11443 
</p>
<p>principles and criteria, including equality, equity, non-discrimination, participation, 
transparency and accountability. Right to development criteria require an open and 
inclusive decision-making process, but current determinations by national authorities on 
whether projects under the mechanism contribute to sustainable development are not 
subject to this standard. Furthermore, right to development criteria require equitable 
benefits of development within and among countries, but at this time projects under the 
mechanism benefit only a few developing countries. With respect to refining the right to 
development criteria, Mr. Orellana suggested that the criteria take into account a science-
based approach in decision-making, in line with the outcome of the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002. 
</p>
<p>40. The Manager of the Process Management Unit at the secretariat of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change gave an overview of the achievements 
of and developments in the mechanism and of its main activities, functions and bodies. He 
stated that the Clean Development Mechanism is a flexible market mechanism. He agreed 
that projects thereunder were mostly concentrated in a few developing countries, and a 
large majority were in the Asia-Pacific region, followed by a considerable number in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. This trend reflects the direction of foreign direct investment 
flows. He then referred to certain shortcomings of the mechanism, such as increasing delays 
in the rigorous approval process. Several measures had been taken recently to improve the 
methodology and the approval process, including steps to enhance transparency. The 
efficiency in the registration of projects and issuance of certified emissions reductions, as 
well as governance, transparency and communication with stakeholders, need to be 
enhanced. With regard to the contribution of projects to sustainable development, 
designated national authorities would be encouraged to publish their sustainable 
development criteria. The representative indicated interest in continuing the dialogue, and 
extended an invitation to the task force to participate in the Nairobi Framework, which 
brought together United Nations agencies and several other institutions with a view to 
promoting the involvement of African countries in the mechanism.

</b></p>
<p>the finding in the technical mission report that intellectual property was incompatible with 
the right to development. Intellectual property does not constitute a barrier to the realization 
of this right, being only one factor affecting access to technology.  
</p>
<p>44. The Philippines stressed the importance of introducing a right to development 
perspective to the Clean Development Mechanism, which constitutes an incentive for 
developed countries to invest in developing countries to reduce emissions, whereby the 
former gain credit as well as profit in the process. However, the mechanism could have the 
adverse effect of shifting the burden for emissions reduction to developing countries, which 
may have to change their production processes, while not necessarily bringing about a 
change in the production processes in developed countries to make them more 
environmentally friendly.  
</p>
<p>45. Egypt, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, stated that the Clean Development 
Mechanism helped developing countries to reduce emissions but did not induce change in 
their production processes, and therefore was not a mechanism conducive to a better and 
cleaner environment. Mauritius emphasized that the African continent was the most 
vulnerable to climate change. It inquired how the inequitable distribution of mechanism 
projects among developing countries could be dealt with so that Africa could benefit more 
from the mechanism. 
</p>
<p>46. In response to a request for further elaboration of the linkages among the Clean 
Development Mechanism, climate change and human rights, Mr. Orellana pointed to the 
OHCHR analytical study on human rights and climate change (A/HRC/10/61), which 
contained an analysis of the human rights implications of mitigation and adaptation 
measures taken within the context of climate change, and stressed the importance of 
considering human rights concerns therein. Human rights components could be integrated 
into the mechanism, taking advantage of the developments in Copenhagen in 2009. 
</p>
<p>47. With regard to the issue of shifting the burden, Mr. Orellana pointed to the 
mechanism&#8217;s potential in facilitating progress towards a decarbonized economy. In this 
regard, it could enable developing countries to avoid a carbon-intensive development path 
by incorporating green technology. It did not impose a burden, but provided an opportunity. 
Still, other measures in the climate change regime need to ensure that industrialized 
countries change their production patterns in order to meet the objective of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Concerning the inequitable 
distribution of mechanism projects, Mr. Orellana remarked that being a market-based 
mechanism, it suffered from market failures. Concerted action at the national and 
international levels is necessary to expand the reach of the projects across a wider range of 
developing countries. In this connection, the phasing out of subsidies for fossil fuels by 
export credit agencies in industrialized countries and the creation of programmes to support 
projects by such agencies could enhance the sustainable development and greenhouse gas 
mitigation benefits from the Clean Development Mechanism.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Millennium Development Goal 8, targets B and D, on debt relief 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-11443 
</p>
<p>49. In his introduction, the Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that the task force had 
already addressed the debt relief issue at its first session, in 2004, and at its fifth session, in 
2009, and had benefited from detailed presentations by representatives of IMF and the 
World Bank. Nevertheless, addressing debt relief at the current session was a welcomed 
opportunity to review in greater depth the implications of this issue for the right to 
development.  
</p>
<p>50. The representatives of the World Bank and IMF presented the debt relief issue in the 
context of their respective programmes, including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries 
initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the Debt Reduction Facility, the Debt 
Sustainability Framework, the Debt Management Facility and the International 
Development Association. After providing an overview of these initiatives, including their 
rationale, functioning, current status of implementation and contribution to poverty 
reduction, they explained how the initiatives had contributed to an increase in social 
expenditures. Both presentations provided examples of specific countries whose 
involvement in the initiatives have brought about tangible improvements in social sectors 
thanks to substantial increases in public expenditure. According to the World Bank, post- 
completion point countries were typically better off in terms of their capacity to address 
development challenges. The combined impact of the two main initiatives, on heavily 
indebted poor countries and multilateral debt relief, was approximately $100 billion.2 
51. The World Bank and IMF also acknowledged the challenges faced by these 
initiatives, including taking the remaining eligible countries, some of which were facing 
challenging political or security situations, through the completion point of the Heavily 
Indebted Poor Countries initiative; ensuring full participation of some groups of creditors, 
particularly non-Paris Club bilateral creditors, private creditors and smaller multilateral 
creditors; and ensuring that both initiatives are fully financed. They also cautioned that, 
while debt relief frees up resources that can be used for development objectives, it needs to 
be complemented by additional financing if the Millennium Development Goals are to be 
reached. In addition, debt relief cannot guarantee permanently the sustainability of debt for 
any given country. Reaching the goals and maintaining debt sustainability also greatly 
depend on policies and strategies to maximize the benefits derived from debt relief.  
</p>
<p>52. In his presentation, the independent expert critically assessed the performance of 
debt relief initiatives in the light of their contribution to the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals, the reduction of poverty and the creation of conditions for the full 
realization of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. Financial 
resources channelled to developing countries that benefited from such programmes were 
substantially below the pressing development needs of these countries. He challenged the 
claim that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and Multilateral Debt Relief initiatives and 
other debt relief initiatives had any notable impact on poverty reduction or that they 
induced a significant increase in public expenditure in social sectors. 
</p>
<p>53. The independent expert discussed several factors that explain the shortcomings of 
debt relief initiatives, among them, their lengthy conditionality requirements, lack of 
effective debtor country ownership, lack of additionality and a narrow conception of debt 
sustainability. Elaborating on the latter point, he stressed that the two initiatives under 
discussion excluded many heavily indebted and poor middle-income countries on the

</p>
<p> 
</p>

 The representative alluded to a more detailed analysis available in the proceedings of a conference on 
</p>
<p>debt relief and beyond, organized by the World Bank in 2008, drawing on contributions from 31 
experts. See Carlos A. Primo Braga and D&#246;rte D&#246;meland (eds.), <i>Debt Relief and Beyond. Lessons 
Learned and Challenges Ahead</i>, the World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2009.

<p>grounds that their debts were sustainable, and that the framework for assessing debt 
sustainability was based on the primacy of debt service and did not include an assessment 
of the needs to realize human rights or the Millennium Development Goals. Other 
important challenges, such as the effect of global climate change, have not been sufficiently 
addressed.  
</p>
<p>54. The independent expert presented and discussed several ideas to enhance the 
effectiveness of debt relief initiatives with regard to their contribution to poverty reduction 
and the fulfilment of human rights, including the need for debt relief strategies to be 
revisited, the extension of the initiatives to developing countries not meeting the Heavily 
Indebted Poor Countries threshold, the increase of financial flows to poor countries in the 
form of grants rather than loans, the design of a binding international framework for 
responsible lending and borrowing, improvement of the independence and credibility of 
debt sustainability assessments, regulation of the activities of &#8220;distressed debt&#8221; or &#8220;vulture 
funds&#8221; to reduce their potential to diminish debt relief gains, and far-reaching reforms of 
the global economic system (such as reform of the international financial institutions to 
reinforce transparency, accountability, democratic decision-making and respect for human 
rights, and the design of a globally managed exchange rate system). 
55. In the ensuing discussion, Nico Schrijver queried how the assessment of the 
contribution of debt relief initiatives to achieving economic and social development, 
especially in the context of the Millennium Development Goals, could incorporate human 
rights standards. Raymond Atuguba underscored the potential of the right to development 
criteria to play a positive role by helping to restore some balance with regard to the 
bargaining power of borrowers and creditors, which would allow for non-financial and 
economic concerns to be taken into account fully in their dealings.  
</p>
<p>56. UNCTAD supported the concerns raised by the independent expert, reiterated that 
human rights did not feature prominently in IMF and World Bank policy formulation, and 
queried whether the ways and means to address these concerns would be adequate in future 
lending decisions.  
</p>
<p>57. The IMF representative responded to queries and remarks, and commented on 
several statements made by the independent expert in his presentation. He acknowledged 
some of the points made by the expert such as the need for financing beyond debt relief to 
reach the Millennium Development Goals. He also identified and explained some of the 
constraints faced by the institution in addressing the issues highlighted, including the 
current mandate of IMF and available resources, which are set by the international 
community, particularly Member States. 
</p>
<p>58. The representatives of IMF and the World Bank outlined the progress already made 
towards openness to discussing how human rights concerns relate to their activities. Both 
expressed willingness to continue to work with relevant stakeholders on these issues.  
</p>
<p>59. At that point, The Chairperson-Rapporteur remarked that the reliance on article 3, 
section 5, of the Articles of Agreement to exclude human rights as a political consideration 
had been abandoned by the World Bank for some time, and that the task force had benefited 
from the active engagement of its institutional member from the bank, which had led to a 
special issue of a publication of the World Bank Institute,3 on which a Global Forum was 
based. Moreover, the current member of the task force from the bank is also a member of 
the Development Assistance Committee human rights task team of the Organization for

<p>60. In the interactive session with observers, Spain, on behalf of the European Union, 
expressed support for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, which had made 
significant progress, and outlined its efforts, as both donor and creditor, to address the issue 
of debt relief. Egypt, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, recognized that 
international financial institutions are constrained by their mandates to deal explicitly with 
human rights, but stressed that the aim is to draw from the experiences of those institutions 
to draft and refine the criteria and sub-criteria in a comprehensive way. Egypt emphasized 
that debt relief only focuses on poverty reduction, but the issue of development is much 
broader, and includes health, education and many other areas. Egypt concluded by 
advocating for a stronger voice for developing countries in the decision-making process of 
international financial institutions.  
</p>
<p>61. The representative of IMF, while drawing attention to the need for the Executive 
Board to determine whether and how human rights issues may enter into the work of the 
Fund and how to give more voice to developing countries, expressed satisfaction with the 
dialogue with the task force, and suggested that such dialogue continue in order to explore 
further concrete ideas of how to strengthen the linkages between all human rights, including 
the right to development and IMF activities. The representatives of both IMF and World 
Bank stressed that it is for Governments to decide how to sustain their commitment to the 
right to development when they sit on the boards of international financial institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to development criteria and corresponding operational sub-
criteria 
</b></p>
<p>62. Introducing the presentation of the consultant study on the criteria by Susan 
Randolph and Maria Green (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/CRP.5), the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
recalled that their report had been preceded by an expert meeting in January 2009 (see 
A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/CRP.7) and had been examined in detail at another expert meeting in 
December 2009 (see A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/CRP.4). He stressed that the consultants&#8217; paper 
was an independent study and did not reflect the views of the task force, which would draw 
on its findings, along with other materials it had accumulated on the criteria. 
</p>
<p>63. In her presentation, Ms Randolph identified three key questions: (a) what are we 
measuring? (b) why are we measuring? and (c) how are we measuring? The purpose of the 
first question was to identify the rights holders and duty bearers, as well as the normative 
content of the right to development. She characterized this right as one of both peoples and 
individuals, which entails obligations of all States, regardless of their level of development, 
towards those both within and outside their jurisdiction; and the obligations of States acting 
collectively. With regard to the specific normative content of the right to development, the 
study defined the general overarching principle of this right as the improvement in the well-
being of individuals and peoples, while the general obligation was defined as an enabling 
environment for development. 
</p>
<p>64. With regard to the second question, Ms. Randolph asserted that the right to 
development, when more fully operationalized through assessment tools, could contribute 
to international development practice and, accordingly, foster more rapid gains in global 
development. Emphasizing the strong influence of what is measured on development 
practice, she stated that the right to development criteria can offer a standard against which 
international policies, institutions, programmes and processes could be assessed. 
</p>
<p>65. The third question was addressed by reviewing the criteria, sub-criteria and 
indicators to tackle the essential features of the right to development, Millennium </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11443 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Development Goals and other priority concerns of the international community. The study 
followed the approach of OHCHR by identifying structural, process and outcome indicators 
with universal and contextual relevance. The selection of indicators was guided by a 
number of criteria, such as the validity, reliability, international and inter-temporal 
comparability, the availability of data by subgroup, the scope of indicators considered and 
the databases searched and assessed.   
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2

<p><b>16</b> GE.10-11443 
</p>
<p>rights, and therefore the national level of implementation should be given more 
consideration. 
</p>
<p>69. In response, Ms. Randolph clarified certain issues, and suggested that some 
comments should be deliberated by the task force and the Working Group. Regarding 
remarks on the multiplicity of indicators across organizations, she agreed that there could 
be harmonization. Development is a vast area; and while some argue that there are too 
many indicators, others claim that several issues remain unaddressed.  She clarified that the 
term &#8220;obligation&#8221; was used in the normative rather than the legal framework, and that the 
term &#8220;collective rights&#8221; was used to address situations where States act collectively within 
the framework of an international organization. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b>70.<b> The conclusions of the task force in relation to its dialogue with institutions 
concerned with access to essential medicines, technology transfer and debt relief are 
contained in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1), in the 
context of the consolidation of its findings on all aspects of its mandate. Its conclusions 
regarding the value of this dialogue for the right to development criteria and 
corresponding operational sub-criteria are reflected in another addendum 
(A/HRC/WG.2/TF/2/Add.2). 
</b></p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>As the task force completes the three-phase workplan assigned to it by the 
Working Group, it wishes to give careful consideration to the request from that body 
that it outline suggestions for further work, including aspects of international 
cooperation not covered until then, for the consideration of the Working Group at its 
eleventh session (A/HRC/12/28, para. 44). In formulating these suggestions, the task 
force has a single objective in mind, namely, to assist the Working Group in 
developing effective means and methods of implementing the right to development. 
The suggestions relate to (a) further action on the criteria; (b) thematic areas of 
international cooperation for consideration; and (c) mainstreaming the right to 
development. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Further action on the criteria 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Circulation of the criteria for comments 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The criteria, sub-criteria and indicators have gone through a process of 
refinement, fed by the lessons learned from their test-pilot application to selected 
global partnerships and professional research and analysis. The formulation of the 
criteria has benefited from the comments and suggestions made by the institutional 
members of the task force, but could be improved by further professional vetting. It is 
therefore proposed that the criteria list be sent to Governments, relevant international 
and national agencies responsible for trade and development, academic centres and 
civil society organizations for their comments and suggestions for improvement, 
including more recent and relevant data sources.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Preparation of a reporting template  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The application of criteria under any procedure, whether on an ad hoc or a 
standing basis, cannot be carried out until the enumeration of criteria and indicators </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11443 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>is transformed into a template that allows reporting countries or institutions to enter 
the required information in a convenient format, adapted according to the particular 
characteristics of the users. The validity and usefulness of the template should be 
pilot-tested with partnerships in the areas the Working Group might wish to select. 
That process could afford an opportunity to adjust the criteria further to achieve 
greater comprehensiveness and accuracy. One approach to pilot-testing the reporting 
template could include collecting data on the policies and practices of several States or 
of arrangements of particular development objectives; a blind analysis could then be 
made of the results. This approach would ensure the objectivity of the tool and the 
eventual elaboration of recommendations to bring policies and practices into greater 
conformity with the right to development without bias. Without such a tool, the task 
force is concerned that judgements regarding what may or may not contribute to the 
right to development run the risk of being speculative or politically motivated. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Consultations with regional institutions 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Working Group may wish to encourage initiatives and senior-level 
consultations involving regional institutions on the integration of right to development 
concerns and criteria into their policies and activities, as witnessed recently in 
Arusha.4 Such regional consultations, which might also include the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights and European human rights institutions, would allow those bodies to 
reflect on how their efforts to promote human rights within and in the context of their 
respective regions can build upon the work of the task force, particularly with regard 
to the effective realization of the right to development.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>A special modality of regional consultations could be organized with the new 
intergovernmental human rights bodies that came into existence in 2009 under the 
auspices of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the League of 
Arab States. The Working Group may wish to invite representatives of the ASEAN 
Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights and the Arab Human Rights 
Committee to explore how they might incorporate right to development concerns into 
their future work in promoting and protecting human rights in their respective 
member States. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Further development of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Working Group has expressed the intention to use the criteria to develop a 
comprehensive and coherent set of standards, which could take several forms. As a 
start, the Working Group might wish to seek information, properly analysed on 
existing examples used in the United Nations system, such as guidelines, codes of 
conduct or practice notes, and examine proposals for the structure and methods for 
drafting of a set of standards most suited to the right to development. A mechanism 
could then be put in place to formulate such a set of standards based on the criteria 
prepared by the task force. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>While differing views exist with regard to the timing, content and principle of a 
legal instrument of a binding character, the compromise language of paragraph 2 (b)

<p><b>has allowed the task force to work on practical efforts to promote the implementation 
of the right, without any expectation that the task force pronounce itself on this issue 
in formulating its suggestions for future work. It therefore does not make a suggestion 
one way or the other on the elaboration of a treaty. Task force members, in their 
individual capacity, have been contributing to reflections among legal scholars on this 
issue.5 Further work on a set of standards and regional consultations could be an 
opportunity to explore whether and to what extent existing treaty regimes could 
accommodate right to development issues within their legal and institutional settings, 
and thereby assist the Working Group in achieving consensus on whether, when and 
with what scope to proceed further in this matter. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Thematic areas of international cooperation for consideration 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The areas covered by the task force and reviewed in the consolidation of 
findings in addendum 1 relate to the Millennium Development Goals in general, 
impact assessments, and Goal 8 partnerships in aid, trade, debt, access to medicines 
and transfer of technology. The task force was particularly attentive to the importance 
that the Working Group attached to the fight against poverty, hunger and 
unemployment and the continued need for financial assistance to developing countries 
(A/HRC/12/28, para. 46 (d)). With reference to that concern, The Non-Aligned 
Movement explained that it looked forward to the task force providing criteria related 
to hunger, poverty, unemployment and financial assistance to developing countries.</b>6 
<b>The range of issues presented in the list of criteria, sub-criteria, and indicators covers, 
in the view of the task force, a significant array of aspects of international cooperation 
not previously covered. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>In this regard, the Working Group may wish to introduce into the high-level 
review of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and other 
international development goals, scheduled for September 2010, the concerns 
identified by the task force relating to both congruencies and deficiencies of the goals 
from the right to development perspective.

<p>80. <b>Should the Working Group wish to focus attention in future on issues not 
covered to date, the task force suggests that it work within the priority areas defined 
by the international community as constituting its development agenda. A convenient 
starting point could be the United Nations Development Agenda, which brings 
together all of the commitments of world conferences since 1990.</b>7 <b>The topics covered 
by the agenda are as follows:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) National development strategies: national ownership of country 
strategies; integrating economic, social and environmental policy; the enabling 
framework: peace, good governance and human rights; full and productive 
employment and decent work for all; economic policies;

<p><b> (b) Social progress: education and training; health, combating HIV/AIDS 
and other major diseases; housing and shelter; water and sanitation; social 
protection; combating drug abuse; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Social justice and inclusion: equity; reducing poverty; nutrition; social

</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Sustainable development: sustainable consumption and production;

</b></p>
<p><b> (e) An enabling international environment: external private financial 
capital flows, external borrowing and debt; official development assistance; innovative 
sources of finance; international trade; transfer of technology; migration;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Reducing inequality between countries: Africa; least developed 
countries; small island developing States; landlocked developing countries; systemic 
issues; global economic governance; the Economic and Social Council; international 
financial and economic institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The above issues are all relevant to the right to development. The Working 
Group might wish to draw upon expert advice available, for example, from the 
Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, in order to select areas where the 
opening of a dialogue with the processes already in place can be productive.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Mainstreaming the right to development 
</b></p>
<p> <b>1. Strengthened support for the mandate of OHCHR and the work of United Nations 
system organizations  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The General Assembly in its resolution 48/141 mandates the High 
Commissioner to promote and protect the realization of the right to development and 
to enhance support from relevant bodies of the United Nations system for that 
purpose. The Assembly, in its resolution 64/172, also requested the High 
Commissioner, in mainstreaming the right to development, to undertake effectively 
activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for development between 
Member States, development agencies and the international development, financial 
and trade institutions. It called upon the United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes, as well as the specialized agencies, to mainstream the right to 
development in their operational programmes and objectives, and stressed the need 
for the international financial and multilateral trading systems to mainstream the 
right to development in their policies and objectives. 
</b>83. <b>In this regard, the Working Group may wish to invite OHCHR and the 
stakeholders mentioned above to consider drawing upon the experience gained by the 
task force in their effective implementation of the above recommendations. In 
particular, the task force recommends the integration of the right to development into 
all aspects of the work of OHCHR, including in its activities at the country level. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Making the right to development an integral part of the work of United Nations 
human rights bodies and mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Working Group may wish to consider recommending that treaty bodies 
and other relevant human rights bodies, mechanisms and procedures include the right 
to development, where relevant, in their work. In particular, a reporting template (see </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-11443 
</p>
<p><b>paragraph 76 above) could be adapted to these procedures, and the bodies could 
include in their own reporting guidelines specific reference to the right to development 
and the criteria developed by the task force. This effort could focus on the criteria of 
particular relevance to each treaty body&#8217;s monitoring function, including through 
their integration into the ongoing support provided by OHCHR for the work of treaty 
bodies in the area of indicators for human rights, as well as reporting by States 
parties.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Working Group may also consider requesting that the right to 
development criteria be included in reporting under the universal periodic review. In 
the view of the task force, this suggestion seems useful for two reasons. First, the 
review process applies to all human rights; to date, the right to development has been 
neglected in the process. Second, the timing seems propitious in the light of both the 
ongoing review process and the possibility to introduce improvements in the universal 
periodic review once it starts its new cycle in 2011. Such an additional reporting 
requirement should not detract from the interactive discussion, and should involve 
non-governmental organizations and national human rights institutions.  </b></p>
