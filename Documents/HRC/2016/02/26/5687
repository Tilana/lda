<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a country-by-country 
basis, summaries of reliable and credible allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment that were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, 
and were transmitted to the Governments concerned. It also contains replies from Governments. 
This addendum does not illustrate the state of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment throughout the world, but rather reflects the state of information 
brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in transmitting these allegations to 
Governments, he does not make any judgement concerning the merits of the cases, nor does he 
support the opinion and activities of the persons on behalf of whom he intervenes. The 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a 
non derogable right, and every human being is legally and morally entitled to protection. When 
the Special Rapporteur receives reliable and credible information that gives grounds to fear that a 
person may be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment, he may transmit an urgent appeal 
to the Government concerned. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have a 
humanitarian and preventive purpose, and do not require the exhaustion of domestic remedies. 
Governments are requested to clarify the substance of the allegations, take steps to protect the 
person&#8217;s rights, and are urged to investigate the allegations and prosecute and impose appropriate 
sanctions on any persons guilty of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period 16 December 2007-14 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur 
sent 77 letters of allegations of torture to 48 Governments and 155 urgent appeals to 
49 Governments on behalf of persons who might be at risk of torture or other forms of 
ill-treatment. Government responses received up to 31 December 2008 have been included. The 
responses received after that date will be duly reflected in a future communications report. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the timely responses received from Governments to 
the letters and urgent appeals transmitted. He regrets that many Governments fail to respond, or 
do so selectively, and that responses to older cases remain outstanding in large part. 
</p>
<p>5. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has been obliged 
to reduce considerably details of communications sent and received, with attention given to 
information relating specifically to allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment. As a result, requests from Governments to publish their replies in their 
totality could not be acceded to. Moreover, attention is given to information in Government 
replies specifically relating to the allegations, particularly information on the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) What steps were taken to ascertain the veracity of the facts alleged?  
</p>
<p> (b) Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim?</p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.4 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p> (c) The details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the case. 
 (d) Full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken (e.g. penal, disciplinary 
or administrative sanctions imposed on the alleged perpetrator(s)). 
</p>
<p> (e) What compensation and rehabilitation have been provided to the victim or the family 
of the victim? </p>

<p>6. Australia 14/08/08 AL TOR <b>Transportation of prisoners</b>. In a number of 
instances in Western Australia, aboriginal 
prisoners in particular, have been subjected to 
cruel treatment while being transported between 
remote regions of the country. On 1 January 2008, 
eight prisoners were being transported from 
Broome to Roebourne and made to sit in an 
unairconditioned van for four hours. On 
27 January, Ian Ward died while being transported 
350 km through the desert, transported in a dark, 
sealed compartment with no fresh air or 
airconditioning in temperatures of around 43&#176;C. 
This follows a report by the Inspector of 
Custodial Services (See Report No. 43, Thematic 
Review of Custodial Transport Services in 
Western Australia, May 2007. See also, media 
release, &#8220;As a New Contractor Takes Over,

Messrs <b>Rasim Aliyev</b> and <b>Mirrehim Hasanov</b>, 
researchers for the organization. The IRFS is a 
non-governmental journalists&#8217; organization 
promoting freedom of expression. At midday on 
12 June 2008, Emin Huseynov was observing and 
filming a protest outside the Presidential 
Administration Building in Baku. He was 
approached by a number of men in civilian 
clothes who detained him and brought him into 
the building. He was then interrogated for two 
hours by men in military uniforms as to the 
reasons for filming, and regarding the work 
carried out by the IRFS and the origin of the 
organization&#8217;s funding. Upon his release, 
Mr.Huseynov&#8217;s confiscated documents and 
camera were returned to him. However, all of his 
photographs had been removed and he was 
threatened with arrest if he returned to that area. 
No explanation was given for his detention. On 
14 June 2008, Mr.Huseynov was again detained, 
along with Mr.Rasim Aliyev and Mr.Mirrehim 
Hasanov, following a raid by police of an event to 
mark the 80th birthday of Che Guevara, which the 
three men were monitoring. These three men, 
together with others detained at the event, were

Cultural Centre, and his son, Mr. <b>E. Mammadov</b>. 
Mr. Novruzali Mammadov is a defender of the 
cultural rights of the Talysh people in the south of 
Azerbaijan. On 2 February 2007, Mr. Novruzali 
Mammadov was called to the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, where he was interrogated about his 
participation at a science conference in Iran in 
2004 and beaten. He was released but detained 
again on the following day. He was sentenced to 
15 days&#8217; imprisonment for failing to cooperate 
with police officers. This sentence was passed 
despite the fact that Mr. Novrulazi Mammadov 
was already over 65 and, according to Article 30 
of the Administrative Code, citizens of that age

cannot be sentenced to punishment such as 
custodial placement. Mr. Novrulazi spent 15 days 
in the Investigation Isolation Centre of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and was physically 
and psychologically pressurized to confess to 
espionage. He did not have access to legal support 
and his whereabouts were unknown to his 
relatives. On 17 February 2007, he was accused 
under Article 274 of the Criminal Code of high 
treason and espionage. He has been in detention 
since then. On 24 June 2008, Mr. Novruzali 
Mammadov was sentenced to ten years&#8217; 
imprisonment following a closed trial. The 
charges were related to the gathering of 
information necessary to establish an 
administrative autonomy in Azerbaijani territories 
with dense Talysh population and the damaging 
of Azerbaijan&#8217;s image abroad through sending 
appeals to international organizations about 
human rights violations against Talysh people.

17 December 2007, a demonstration was held in 
the Sanabis area, organized to commemorate 
victims of torture. The demonstration was 
violently dispersed by members of the riot police 
and of the special security force. Tear gas and 
rubber bullets were employed by security forces 
and some participants were beaten. After the 
demonstration, Mr. Ali Jassim Meki returned to 
his home, where his condition rapidly 
deteriorated. He died some hours later on his way 
to hospital. The report of the autopsy conducted 
by government-assigned doctors stated that he 
died of natural causes. Mr. Ali Jassim Meki&#8217;s 
family requested a second opinion by an 
independent specialist, but was reportedly 
informed that there was none available in the 
country. The human rights defenders were 
arrested between 21 and 28 December. All of 
them have been accused of having taken part in an 
&#8220;illegal gathering and rioting&#8221; and &#8220;theft of a 
weapon and ammunition, and possession of a 
weapon and ammunition without permission&#8221;. For 
the first ten days of their detention they were 
denied access to their lawyers, and interrogations 
carried out inside the detention chambers and at 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office were conducted 
without the presence of a lawyer. The Public 
Prosecutor refused to pass a copy of the case files, 
detailing the charges, to a group of lawyers 
defending the activists. Some of the human rights

against the rioters and that the detainees had 
been taken to a forensic medical examiner, 
who had confirmed that none of them had been 
tortured and that all the measures taken with 
respect to them were in accordance with the 
law. 
The assertions in regard to the death of Mr. Ali 
Jasim Mohamed Maki, and the events that 
preceded and followed it are not accurate: the 
demonstrators not only gathered illegally but 
were also carrying iron spits and Molotov 
cocktails. They set a police car on fire and 
stole guns from it, and they also attempted to 
kill police officers, as some of the accused 
persons admitted when questioned by the 
Department of Public Prosecutions. No 
complaints have been lodged with the 
Department of Public Prosecutions concerning 
the persons named in the urgent appeal. When 
questioned by the Department of Public 
Prosecutions, the persons who had been 
arrested and placed in preventive detention 
said nothing about having been attacked. 
Nevertheless, the Department ordered that they 
be examined by the forensic medical examiner 
to determine whether they had any injuries, 
and the forensic report confirmed the absence 
of any injuries. </p>

<p>Regarding the death of Mr. Ali Jasim 
Mohamed Maki, on 17 December 2007 the 
competent security department was informed 
by the International Hospital of Bahrain that an 
individual had died there and that his body had 
been transferred to the morgue of Salmaniya 
hospital. Upon receipt of the report, the 
Department of Public Prosecutions examined 
the body and found no signs of injury. The 
Department of Public Prosecutions decided to 
form a tripartite commission chaired by the 
Department&#8217;s senior forensic pathologist, with 
two doctors from Salmaniya hospital as 
members, in order to ascertain the cause of 
death. After confirming that the body bore no 
injuries, the commission conducted an autopsy 
and found that the cause of death was sudden 
circulatory arrest. None of the relatives of the 
deceased asked the Department of Public 
Prosecutions for a second opinion from an 
independent specialist. The autopsy was 
conducted in the presence of relatives of the 
deceased. 
The Department of Public Prosecutions 
brought 15 accused persons - not human rights 
defenders - before the High Criminal Court on 
charges of unlawful assembly, setting a police 
car on fire, using force and violence 
against police officers, stealing firearms and 
parts thereof from cars, and concealing and

Department also brought two other accused 
persons before the Criminal Court, on charges 
of attempting to kill a police officer and 
attempting to set fire to a police car. The 
foregoing decisions by the Department of 
Public Prosecutions were based on a large 
amount of evidence in the form of confessions 
by several of the accused and testimony of 
several police officers, in addition to the 
results of the examinations, technical reports 
and pictures taken of the accused persons 
holding a gathering, setting fire to a police car 
and stealing weapons from it. All but one of 
the accused decided during questioning to 
forfeit the right to have a lawyer present; 
the lawyer of the one who did decide to ask for 
a lawyer was allowed to attend the 
examination proceeding. The Department of 
Public Prosecutions ordered that all the 
necessary facilities be provided to allow any 
family members or lawyers of the accused 
persons to visit them in their places of

<p>By letter dated 16/06/08, the Government 
informed that the allegations received are 
inaccurate. The individuals in question were 
arrested and detained in connection with 
criminal inquiries pursuant to specific articles 
of Bahrain&#8217;s criminal law. 
The investigations relate to a violent gathering 
on 20 December 2007, during which 
participants assaulted police officers, set fire to 
a police vehicle, and stole a weapon belonging 
to police officers. Following investigations, 
including eyewitness accounts, technical 
reports and analysis of pictures taken at the 
gathering, those responsible were identified, 
arrested, and brought before the Public 
Prosecution for questioning on suspicion of 
offences including attempted murder, assault, 
illegal assembly, carrying of weapons 
(including iron bars and Molotov cocktails), 
setting fire to a police vehicle and theft of a 
police firearm from that vehicle. The 
individuals in questions are suspected of 
offences which cannot in any way be linked to, 
or justified by reference to, activities as human 
rights defenders. Regardless of this 
self-claimed status, Bahrain&#8217;s Constitution and 
law apply in the usual manner to these 
individuals, who are entitled to all the rights 
and procedures set out therein. They have, for  </p>

<p>example, been accorded all their rights of 
visitation and legal representation, in 
accordance with the law. 
While no allegation of assault or mistreatment 
was made by these individuals when they first 
appeared before the Public Prosecution, 
medical examinations were nevertheless 
ordered at that time, which subsequently 
confirmed that none of the detainees had 
sustained any injuries. 
The allegation of torture or mistreatment of 
Mr. Sengais, Naji Ali Fateel, Hassan 
Abdulnabi Hassan, and/or Maytham Bader 
Jassim Al-Sheikh have been found by 
investigations to be completely without 
foundation. These investigations have included 
medical examinations, which concluded that 
no evidence could be found of any 
mistreatment or abuse. 
With regard to Mr. Al-Sengais, he appears to 
have been examined and treated at hospital on 
30 December 2005 for an earlier head injury 
unconnected to his arrest or detention, and it is 
believed that this injury may be behind his 
current condition.

However, following the intervention of the

on 25 November 2007. On 2 January 2008, the

out in the presence of the police. According to the 
authorities, when the BDR personnel tried to

injured himself by running into a tree. 
Furthermore they indicated that he died because 
he had drunk too much alcohol. However, the

their feet on his back. At the KGB detention 
centre in Minsk he was put in a small room of 2 
square metres, which resembled a grave, with no 
natural daylight and no ventilation. A small lamp 
remained switched on all the time. When he 
attempted to cover his eyes in order to be able to 
get some sleep, the guards came to prevent him 
from doing so. He could not leave the cell to go to 
the toilet and had to eat the low-quality food that 
he received in the same place where he relieved 
himself. At one instance several buckets with 
concentrated chlorine were put into the room and, 
although he was asking for help, they were not 
removed until he lost consciousness. He was 
repeatedly interrogated, at any time of the day, 
sometimes for long periods. After ten days at the 
KGB he was transferred to Minsk&#8217;s pre-trial 
detention centre (SIZO), which was overcrowded 
(40 persons in 12 square metres) and where 
officers beat those who did not immediately 
follow all orders. The food was of a poor quality 
and access to sanitary facilities was restricted. 
Together with about 19 persons, he was put in an 
8-seater minibus and taken to a train station. 
There, while being beaten by officers, they were 
moved into a railway wagon with dogs barking at 
them. For 12 hours they remained there without 
being given any water or being allowed to use a 
toilet. Novopolock correctional colony No. 10 is

and transfer of other information on behalf of a 
foreign intelligence service for use to the 
detriment of the interests of Belarus,

of espionage). 
V.A. Russkin was sentenced to ten years&#8217; 
imprisonment to be served in a penal colony 
under a strengthened regime and deprivation of 
the military rank of reserve senior lieutenant. 
V.A. Russkin began serving his term on 
14 September 2007. The period spent by 
V.A. Russkin in police custody and detention 
between 5 January and 14 September 2007 
will be deducted from the prison term. 
Three policemen were sentenced in this same 
case. The sentence entered into force as soon 
as it was handed down, as regular appeals or 
appeals in cassation may not be lodged against 
sentences of the Supreme Court. The law does 
offer an opportunity to appeal against 
sentences of the Supreme Court under the 
supervisory procedure, but the convicted 
person V.A. Russkin and his defence lawyer 
E.S. Chizhevskaya did not lodge such an 
appeal.

Hygiene and sanitation is insufficient, prisoners 
are allowed to shower only once per week, there 
is no hot water available in the living quarters. 
The food is of poor quality. For minor offences, 
persons are severely punished by being put in 
overcrowded cells with even worse conditions 
and with no possibility to appeal this decision. 
People are forced to work for 8 hours, 6 days a 
week for three Euros per month. If they refuse, 
they are subjected to punishment, such as denial 
of family visits, prolongation of prison terms (up 
to 10 additional years) and prolonged stays in 
punishment cells. On 14 September 2007, 
Mr. Russkin was convicted by the Military 
Chamber of the Belarus Supreme Court to ten 
years&#8217; imprisonment for treason under article 356 
of the Belarus Criminal Code and espionage 
under article 358. He did not have access to a 
lawyer of his choice at any stage of the criminal 
process including during the trial. The State 
provided a lawyer. All petitions Mr. Russkin filed 
with the courts were reportedly ignored. The trial 
protocol was falsified. The investigation and trial 
were biased and there was not enough time for the 
accused to study the case files. Mr. Russkin was 
not given the opportunity to call his own 
witnesses and to question witnesses of the 
prosecution. Finally, he was not given the 
opportunity to appeal the court&#8217;s decision.

lodge complaints against the actions and 
decisions of the authorities leading the 
criminal proceedings, were explained to 
V.A. Russkin, as his signing of the relevant 
records attests. 
He made statements acknowledging his guilt 
from the outset of the initial questioning and 
throughout the preliminary investigation. The 
accused was questioned during working hours 
only in the presence of a lawyer and for no 
longer than the standard period established 
under criminal procedure law. 
V.A. Russkin was in a remand centre of the 
Belarus State Security Committee (KGB) from 
6 January to 20 September 2007. Russkin bore 
no signs of bodily harm when he entered the 
centre. After completing the registration forms, 
Russkin was placed in a four-person cell 
measuring 10.5 square metres (article 13 of the 
Detention Procedures and Conditions Act sets 
the minimum prison cell living space at 
2.5 square metres per person). KGB detention 
centres have no cells measuring 
2 square metres.

letters and telegrams. The prisoner did not 
receive any short-term visits, since none of his 
close relatives and family members submitted 
any applications in writing to the remand 
centre administration. No parcels of any kind 
were sent to Russkin. 
The doctor on duty found no signs of bodily 
harm to Russkin during examinations when he 
entered and left the remand centre. Throughout 
the entire investigation Russkin did not file 
any complaint against the actions of the 
investigators or administration of the centre, 
nor did he register any complaint about the 
prison conditions with the procurator during 
his monthly inspections. 
As the record shows, the accused and his 
lawyer familiarized themselves with the facts 
of the case from 27 to 30 July 2007 by 
personally reading and reviewing the material 
evidence. 
The criminal proceedings against Russkin and 
other persons took place in strict accordance 
with the requirements of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, which set out the conditions and 
procedures for conducting court proceedings.

<p>Ms.<b> A. C.</b>, a 20-year-old university student. 
Ms. C. claims that she continues to be a victim of 
&#8220;ritual abuse-torture&#8221; (sic), both within her family 
and by a group of persons unknown to her. Her 
father, W. C., and mother, J. C., abused her 
physically and sexually at home. Her father 
brought her to &#8220;ritual abuse-torture&#8221; meetings, 
where members of the group abused and tortured 
her, both alone and in front of others. Amongst 
the perpetrators were her grandparents, D. and 
D. W., and other persons, some of who were 
members of a local Mormon church her family 
used to go to. During one of the meetings Ms. C.<b> 
</b>was required to attend, she was forced to 
prematurely give birth to her baby, whose body 
was used as an object of the group&#8217;s rituals. The 
alleged abuse took place in various places around 
Calgary and in Toronto. Ms. C. attempted to 
report her abuse to the police in Toronto and in 
Calgary between 2002-2007 but she was never 
believed and no report was taken. The police told 
her there would probably be no evidence, or 
treated her as if she was crazy. She also tried to 
talk to nurses and doctors in the places she was 
hospitalized several times between 2001 and 2005 
for depression and suicidal tendencies. No action, 
investigations, or protection measures were taken 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 29/07/08, the Government 
responded that the matters raised by the 
Special Rapporteurs are not only within the 
competence of the Canadian government but 
also that of two provinces, the Province of 
Alberta; and the Province of Ontario.  
The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of request 
contains almost no details concerning the 
allegations made by the complainant. This lack 
of specific information makes it difficult to 
find information relevant to her allegations: 
While the letter of request indicates that the 
complainant approached the police in Toronto 
(Ontario) and Calgary (Alberta) between 2002 
and 2007, it does not indicate the facilities in 
which she was hospitalized or otherwise 
sought medical treatment nor does it indicate 
where she was taken into foster care or the 
authorities through which she was placed into 
foster care. Without these details, it is difficult 
to focus the necessary inquiries, which slows 
down the work. 
An initial search by the Canadian government 
for details concerning Ms.C. or her case 
yielded no information. That is, her allegations 
are not notorious or otherwise in the public </p>

home a number of times, was placed in foster

she continued to be abused. In 1993, the final 
report of the Canadian Panel on Violence Against 
Women, (Changing the landscape; 
Catalogue No. SW45-1/1993; Ottawa: Minister of 
Supply and Services Canada), informed the 
Gvernment that action needed to be taken to 
protect women and children from &#8220;ritual abuse 
and torture&#8221;, which according to the panel&#8217;s 
report, was occurring in every region of Canada. 
The panel also referred to Ms. C&#8217;s case, among 
others. No action has been taken to address the 
alleged abuses.

<p>domain. They do not appear in any search of 
public records such as the popular press, the 
internet or databases of court cases. There does 
not appear to have been any public inquiry or 
any court case involving the allegations 
contained in the complaint. What is significant 
in this is that the information concerning the 
allegations raised by Ms. C. cannot be 
confirmed by Canada without a search for 
protected personal information contained in 
government records or the records of other 
public or private entities or persons. 
Privacy and the protection of the personal 
information of individuals are values of 
significant importance in Canada. Legislation 
exists at the federal and provincial levels of 
government that place requirements on 
government to respect the privacy of 
individuals and to protect personal information 
in their possession. Some of these laws make it 
impossible to gather and divulge personal 
information without the written consent of the 
individual. 
The allegations of a lack of appropriate 
response from the police and medical and 
other professionals into ritual abuse or other 
forms of violence against women require an 
investigation into matters which lie at the core 
of personal information. The laws of both 
Alberta and Ontario are such that written  </p>

consent is required from the complainant 
before relevant information can be collected 
and shared. 
Canada, therefore, asks that the Special 
Rapporteur attempt to obtain the express 
signed consent of the complainant in respect of 
information held by relevant entities or 
persons. Canada must rely on the complainant 
and the Special Rapporteur to ensure that all 
relevant entities are identified by the 
complainant and that her consent for the 
release and sharing of relevant information in 
the possession of each such entity is given (the 
respective consent forms were attached to the 
letter). 
If and when the signed consent forms are 
received by Canada, an investigation into the 
allegations of the complainant can begin in 
earnest and will assist in the collection of 
information and response to the Special 
Rapporteur in a further submission.

<p>Ms. <b>Liu Jie</b>, human rights defender and veteran 
rural campaigner (subject of a previously 
transmitted communication, A/HRC/7/14/Add.1, 
para. 118). On 26 October 2007, Liu Jie&#8217;s 
husband was told by officers at the Bei&#8217;an City 
Nongken Detention Center, where Liu Jie was 
detained, that she would be released on that day. 
However, when he went to the detention center 
that afternoon, he was told that it had been 
decided to send Liu Jie to Re-education through 
Labor (RTL). She is serving her 18-month RTL 
term in Qiqihaer, Heilongjiang Province, where 
she has to work 14 hours a day, six days a week. 
According to a doctor who examined her on 
20 December 2007, Ms. Liu Jie will go blind if 
she does not receive proper eye treatment 
immediately. She must be sent to Beijing for 
treatment. Her family has requested RTL 
authorities to grant her bail for medical treatment. 
The eye injuries are said to be linked to beatings 
by personnel of Heilongjiang Provincial Nongken 
(Military Farm Bureau) Public Security Bureau, 
Beian Sub-division. In March 2002, in one such 
beating, she suffered permanent injury to her eye, 
and drastically reduced vision. In detention, she 
was again beaten and suffered further injuries to 
her eyes. Her lawyers have also filed a request for 
an administrative review of the decision to send 
her to the RTL camp. The authorities have not 
responded to either of these requests. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 6/03/08, the Government 
informed that because Liu Jie had caused a 
public nuisance and disturbed the peace, Jie 
was ordered to serve a term of one year and six 
months&#8217; labour re education, to run from 
13 October 2007 to 12 April 2009. On 
14 November 2007, Liu was sent by the public 
security bureau in the city of Bei&#8217;an to the 
labour re-education facility in the city of 
Qiqihar to serve her term of labour re 
education. After entering the facility, Liu had 
problems with her vision in both eyes. On 
15 November 2007, the doctor at the re 
education facility first took Liu to the hospital 
and then to the eye, ear, nose and throat 
hospital in Qiqihar to be examined. The results 
of the examination were as follows: 
&#8220;1. Ametropia and vitreous opacity in the right 
eye; 2. traumatic cataract in the left eye 
(aphacia); 3. high degree myopia in the right 
eye.&#8221; As Liu was not prepared to cooperate, it 
was not possible for any further examinations 
to be carried out. On 20 December 2007, the 
hospital at the labour re-education facility once 
again sent Liu for an examination by eye 
specialists at Qiqihar hospital No. 1. The 
results of the consultation were as follows: 
&#8220;The left eye has undergone cataract surgery; 
high degree myopia in the right eye; 
pathological retinal degeneration.&#8221; The 
consultant suggested that Liu see an 
optometrist to have glasses prescribed, but she </p>

refused. At that time Liu asked the doctor 
about the possibility of a lens implant in her 
left eye, and whether implanting a lens could 
have other consequences for her eyes. The 
doctor told her that whether she had this done 
sooner or later would not affect the 
consequences, but that it would be better to 
have it done sooner. The doctor did not on any 
account say that, if she did not receive urgent 
treatment, she could lose the vision in her eye 
or that Heilongjiang province did not have 
adequate facilities to treat Liu&#8217;s eye injury and 
that she must be sent to Beijing for treatment, 
and other such allegations. In mid 
January 2008, Liu&#8217;s husband came to the 
labour re education facility to demand that Liu 
be allowed to see a doctor outside the facility 
immediately. As Liu herself was not 
cooperating in having examinations, it was 
impossible to determine whether or not, in 
accordance with the stipulations of the law, her 
medical condition warranted her being allowed 
to leave the facility for medical treatment. 
Following Liu&#8217;s admission to the facility, she 
has not been beaten, subjected to punishment 
or to any form of ill treatment. Liu&#8217;s eye 
problems are not growing worse.

and other such laws and regulations. It is not a 
criminal punishment but an administrative one. 
Under the regulations, re-education through 
labour is applicable only to people aged 
16 years and older who have disrupted the 
social order in large or medium-sized cities 
and refused to mend their ways, or who have 
committed petty offences not meriting a

system. Persons wishing to challenge a 
re-education order can appeal to the 
re-education through labour management 
committee or, under the terms of the

<p>04/02/08 AL TOR Ms. <b>Vera Musilov&#225;</b>. She was kept in a cage bed 
in Bohnice Hospital in Prague for an extensive 
period of time, and died there as a result of 
suffocating in her own faeces on 14 April 2006. 
The case was investigated by various institutions, 
including the investigation commission of the 
Ministry of Health, the Public Defender of Rights 
and law enforcement authorities. The report of the 
Deputy Public Defender identified a number of 
violations, including her placement in the cage 
bed, which was found to be an unnecessary 
measure of restraint as she was held there every 
day for a prolonged period. Bohnice Hospital also 
failed to monitor Mrs. Musilov&#225;&#8217;s worsening state 
of health and to offer any treatment other than 
tranquilizers. In contrast, the Ministry of Health 
and law enforcement authorities found no 
shortcomings in the care and treatment of 
Mrs. Musilov&#225;. In more general terms, cage beds 
(which include beds covered by nets) are used in 
psychiatric hospitals (and psychiatric wards of 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 04/02/08, the Government 
agreed that the summary, although brief, 
accurately expresses what happened in 
Bohnice Psychiatric Hospital in April 2006. 
The only inaccuracy may be found in the 
technical term &#8220;cage bed&#8221;. The beds used in 
psychiatric hospitals in the Czech Republic are 
referred to as &#8220;net beds&#8221; as the protective mesh 
is made of a fabric net. 
Regarding the legal framework of the usage of 
net beds, the Special Rapporteur is rightly 
pointing at the unbinding character of the 
current &#8220;Guidelines on Restraint Use&#8221; (2005). 
The Guidelines are a methodological 
instruction issued within the scope of the 
Health Care Act (1966) that sets out the 
principles of health care and medical 
treatment. The Health Care Act clearly states 
that medical treatment can be provided without 
consent of a patient or its guardian only in a </p>

general hospitals) under the authority of the 
Ministry of Health. The hospitals that use cage 
beds most are: Havlickuv Brod (Vysocina region), 
Kosmonosy (Central Bohemia region), &#352;ternberk 
(Olomouc region), Dobrany (Plzen region), 
Opava (Moravkoslezsk&#253; region), and Jihlava 
(Vysocina region). In social care institutions 
under the authority of the Ministry of Labour and 
Social Affairs, cage beds have officially been 
banned from 1 January 2007, but the ban has not 
been implemented. In some social care centres for 
minors, cage beds continue to be used, sometimes 
for prolonged periods. On 1 December 2004, the 
Ministry of Health issued &#8220;Methodical Guidelines 
on Restraint Use&#8221;. Under the guidelines, restraint 
use can be ordered only by doctors, only in 
exceptional circumstances, and for the shortest 
possible time. The guidelines fail to establish any 
independent monitoring mechanism to control 
and register restraint use. Whereas the Ministry of 
Health claims to carry out internal inspections of 
psychiatric institutions, reports about the 
frequency, methodology and results of these visits 
are not accessible to the public. Further, statistical 
documentation of restraint use is not collected by 
hospitals, and information on individual restraint 
use is inaccessible to outsiders. Often the access 
of patients themselves to their files is restricted. 
Czech psychiatric hospitals remain closed to 
independent human rights observers, with the 
exception of the Ombudsman Office, which is 
allowed to visit places of detention, but lacks the 
</p>
<p>few exceptional cases, such as a 
life-threatening situation where there is no 
possibility to obtain consent prior to treatment. 
The use of restraint falls under this general 
limitation of medical treatment. As the 
Ministry of Health is aware of the possible 
discrepancy in the legal application of the 
Guidelines, it included its provisions into a bill 
on health care that will replace the Health Care 
Act, making the provisions on the use of 
restraints binding. The bill will be introduced 
to the Czech Government in August 2008 and 
it is envisaged that it will enter into force in 
January 2009. 
Ms. Vera Musilov&#225;&#8217;s mother lodged a criminal 
complaint against personnel of the hospital on 
16 April 2006. The prosecution was 
discontinued on 6 March 2007. 
Ms. Musilov&#225;&#8217;s mother also addressed herself 
to the Public Defender of Right and intends to 
lodge a civil complaint with the Prague 
Regional Court as well. 
Several investigations were conducted. An 
autopsy of the body showed that the reason of 
death was suffocation caused by a massive 
aspiration of excrements. The result was 
confirmed by another forensic expert. Police 
interviewed hospital staff about the 
circumstances of death. The results have 
shown that at 3:00 p.m., a nurse had noticed 
during a spot check that Ms. Musilov&#225; was </p>

phone of the death of her daughter. The law 
enforcement authorities found no shortcomings 
in Ms. Musilov&#225;&#8217;s case or treatment. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, the Ministry of Health 
undertook an inquiry into the medical care 
provided in this case, the use of means of 
restraint and lawfulness of the civil 
commitment with the medical care and the stay 
in the hospital itself. The Ministry did not find 
any violation. According to its statement, the 
medical care provided to the patient was 
correct, corresponded to the current knowledge 
of medical science, and was in accordance 
with the valid legislation. No fault or error on 
the part of the medical personnel occurred and, 
with regard to the poor state of health of the 
patient, the response to the situation was 
adequate. 
In opposition to this, the inquiry undertaken by 
the Deputy Public Defender of Rights found 
several violations. It included a misuse and 
overuse of means of restraint (net bed), bad 
communication between the Bohnice Hospital 
and Ms. Musilov&#225; and shaving of her head, 
which was carried out without her or her 
mother&#8217;s permission.  </p>

was HIV-positive, both were taken directly to the 
Morality Police Department in Mugamma&#8217; 
al-Tahrir, where they were detained, and later 
interrogated by an officer named M. O. A. The 
officers allegedly slapped Mr. R. in the face and 
beat Mr. A. They forced them to sign statements, 
the contents of which they were not allowed to 
read. During the four days they were detained in 
Mugamma&#8217; al-Tahrir, the two men were 
handcuffed to an iron desk and left to sleep on the 
floor. They were denied food and water and were 
required to pay for them later. A forensic anal 
examination was performed on both men in order 
to establish whether they had engaged in anal 
sexual intercourse. On 20 January 2008, 
Mr. A. M. M. was arrested on the street, 
Mr. K. A. A. at his apartment on the following 
day, and Mr. A. H. A. on 3 February 2008 at an 
unknown location. On 19 February 2008, Mr. M. 
was beaten by a police guard. The police guard 
handcuffed his wrists to opposite poles of the bed 
and chained one of his ankles to the bed&#8217;s end to 
prevent him from moving. Allegedly, Mr. M. had 
been punched repeatedly in the face, head and 
body by the same officer. 
On or around 20 November 2007, Mr. <b>M. M. M.</b> 
and Mr. <b>E. H. M.</b> were arrested and held at the 
Appeals Jail in central Cairo, apparently in 
connection with the arrests of Mr. R. and Mr. A. 
Police arrested Mr. M. at his workplace. Both 
men were released on 26 February and 
</p>
<p>enquiring from the two men about the reasons 
for their altercation, Mr. H. claimed that 
Mr. R. had insisted upon him to resume their 
sexual relationship, something he did not wish 
to do in light of his knowledge that Mr. R. had 
contracted HIV/AIDS. 
The two individuals were taken to the police 
station in order to continue the investigation. 
Mr. R. confirmed that he was infected with 
HIV/AIDS which he believed to have 
contracted through homosexual intercourse 
with a number of individuals whom he named. 
</p>
<p>According to procedure, the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (PPO) was notified and 
assumed the responsibility for further 
investigation into the case. The investigations 
indicated that the two individuals and the 
group they named habitually engage in male 
prostitution, and that one of them actually runs 
a brothel for male prostitution. Therefore, the 
Attorney General issued an order summoning 
the individuals named in the testimony of the 
two men and they were later charged with 
&#8220;habitual practices of debauchery&#8221;. During the 
investigations, a number of them admitted to 
the charges pressed against them and 
confirmed that the others also participated with 
them in such practices. </p>

29 February, respectively, upon court orders as 
the maximum preventive detention period had 
expired. Another individual, Mr. <b>G. M.</b>, was 
arrested on an unknown date and later released. It 
is alleged that all men were forcibly tested for 
HIV without their consent. Mr. E. H. M., Mr. M. 
M. M. and Mr. G. M. tested negative and charges 
against them were dropped. Mr. A. S. R., Mr. M. 
H. A., Mr. A. M. M., and Mr. K. A. A. tested 
positive and are being held at Abbasiyya Fevers 
Hospital. They were chained to their beds until 
25 February 2008 when the Ministry of Health 
intervened. Mr. A. H. A. is at present detained at 
Tora Prison. Reportedly, the five detainees were 
indicted on 4 March 2008 on charges of &#8220;habitual 
practice of debauchery&#8221; under article 9 (c) of 
Law 10/1961. Mr. A. S. R. and Mr. M. H. A. 
continued to be detained and were indicted after 
the lapse of the maximum 90-day period of 
preventive detention for misdemeanours. 
Allegedly, the lead prosecutor indicated to a 
defense counsel that the men should not be 
permitted to roam the streets freely as the 
Government considers them to present a danger to 
public health. The first trial hearing scheduled for 
12 March was postponed to 19 March in order to 
provide the defense more time to prepare. Their 
verdict is expected for 9 April. Concerns are 
expressed for the physical and mental integrity of 
the men. Further, it is alleged that the five 
above-mentioned individuals might have been 
discriminatorily arrested and detained and that 
</p>
<p>Once the PPO investigations were completed, 
charges were brought against the 
aforementioned individuals, their cases were 
referred to the courts which ruled against the 
defendants in two of the cases. The defendants 
in both cases appealed the verdict, one was 
rejected while a decision on the second has not 
yet been issued. 
It is worth mentioning that the court verdict 
assigned the convicted individuals infected 
with HIV/AIDS to designated health centers 
and not to regular prisons in order to ensure 
they receive the necessary medical treatment 
while serving their sentences. 
</p>
<p>The verdicts against the individuals named as 
defendants in these cases were not related to 
their &#8220;sexuality&#8221; or due to their &#8220;sexual 
orientation&#8221;. They were clearly based on 
violations of specific provisions of the 
Egyptian penal code, none of which explicitly 
or implicitly criminalizes homosexuality. 
The allegation that the defendants were tried 
simply for being HIV positive or for carrying 
the AIDS virus is also unfounded. As 
demonstrated above, the trial was for violating 
specific provisions of Egyptian law and not for 
health status of the defendants. The infected 
individuals were granted medical services 
throughout the process and continue to receive 
the necessary treatment while serving their </p>

<p>sentences. 
</p>
<p>All proceedings at every stage of this case 
were carried out under strict judicial 
supervision. More specifically, the 
investigations were done by an independent 
judicial authority. Moreover, the rights of the 
accused were fully respected and included, 
inter alia, their right to a fair hearing before a 
competent court, their right to present their 
defense and the right to legal representation 
throughout the investigations and the trial, and 
the right of appeal. 
Allegations of arbitrary detention and torture 
are also unsubstantiated as the entire process 
followed the designated legal course including 
the issuance of the required legal permits to 
summon the group based on a previously 
defined and criminalized act punishable by the 
law. The court rulings were based on articles 
of the Egyptian Penal Code. 
Allegations of inhuman treatment and torture 
are also groundless. Firstly, Egyptian law 
penalizes any mistreatment, including torture 
and inhuman practices, of individuals 
including detainees and prisoners. 
Furthermore, the PPO closely follows and 
investigates any claims of illegal practices by 
security personnel and/or any other executive 
body in Egypt. In case such claims prove to be 
substantiated, whoever commits such crimes is 
presented to court to be tried for his or her </p>

<p><b>H. M. H.</b>,<b> </b>a 12-year-old Djiboutian refugee. On 
17 December 2007, she was abducted by a 
23-year-old Ethiopian, and his family. A 
complaint for abduction and confinement was 
lodged by her father. Reportedly, the young man 
raped H. M. H. over a 17-day period. In order to 
shield him from a rape charge, his uncle, a police 
commander, and one of his assistants, charged 
H. M. H. with theft of a washing tub and detained 
her. She was forced to admit the theft, to state she 
had no family, to change her name and to state 
she was older than she actually was (i.e. over 
age 16). H. M. H. was detained at the Central 
Prison in Addis Ababa, together with adults. On 
24 December, her father was finally informed of 
the situation, however, he was not allowed to visit 
his daughter before 26 January 2008. The 
Ethiopian Embassy in Paris, contacted by mail by 
some organizations supporting H. M. H.&#8217;s father, 
orally replied that the girl was 16 and that she was 
the wife of a young Ethiopian. H. M. H.&#8217;s birth 
certificate and health card issued by an Ethiopian 
hospital stated that she was born on 
20 September 1995. Neighbours and her family 
also declared that she is not married. On 
15 February 2008, H. M. H. was released, 
however, the investigation concerning her alleged 
theft is still ongoing.

<p>  <b>Police actions in connection to mass protests in 
Tbilisi as well as the declaration of state of 
emergency and suspension of some 
fundamental rights </b>(A/HRC/7/3/Add.1, 
para. 77) 
</p>
<p>By letters dated 27/02/08 and 28/02/08, the 
Government responded that the incident on 
7 November 2007 represented part of the chain 
of events that developed since the beginning of 
November 2007 in Georgia. The measures 
taken were aimed at restoring the public order 
and responding to the national security 
concerns in the country, while acting in 
accordance with the international norms and 
standards that govern the limitation of certain 
rights and freedoms as well as situation of 
national emergency. On 2 November 2007, 
according to the best estimates of both the 
Government and respected independent 
sources approximately 50,000 protestors 
gathered in front of the Parliament on 
Rustaveli Avenue. The organizers of the 
assembly had notified the Tbilisi Municipality 
regarding their plans to close the traffic on the 
Avenue as envisaged by Georgian legislation. 
In the following days, the number of protesters 
declined steadily, barely amounting to a 
thousand by 4 November 2007. By this point, 
the demonstrators were already in violation of 
the Law of Georgia on Assembly and 
Manifestation on numerous counts. For 
instance, the law prohibits intentional 
hindrance of the movement of public transport. 
In defiance of this law, opposition leaders kept </p>

Rustaveli Avenue blocked, although the 
number of protestors was small and did not 
require closing the avenue. Furthermore, the 
organizers had notified the Tbilisi 
Municipality that the demonstration would be 
held only on 2 November. When it became 
evident that the population was leaving 
Rustaveli Avenue, the organizers of the 
demonstration began to call for civil unrest and 
the violent overthrow of the Government. 
They called for attacks on government 
institutions. Implicit and explicit incitements 
to overthrow the Government were common at 
the rally. For five days the police refrained 
from interfering in the rally to avoid an 
escalation of the situation as well as not to 
hinder the full enjoyment of the rights of the 
protestors. 
</p>
<p>During the morning of 7 November, the 
number of protestors declined to 
approximately 100 individuals. At 8 a.m., with 
only a few minor incidents with protestors, the 
area was cleaned up and traffic restored. At 
9 a.m., Tbilisi Mayor informed the public that 
the government would no longer tolerate the 
unlawful blockage of Rustaveli Avenue and 
the setting up of tents. At the same time, the 
demonstrators were told that they could 
continue the demonstration in front of the 
Parliament and on the sidewalk. At 11 a.m., 
the opposition leaders started to escalate the </p>

situation by drawing parallels with the 
revolutionary and tragic events of 9 April 1989 
(when brutal actions by the Soviet army 
against the peaceful anti-soviet demonstrations 
on Rustaveli Avenue led to the death of 
17 peaceful protestors, while thousands were 
injured). They called on people to come to the 
streets &#8220;to put an end to the Government&#8221; and 
instigated clashes with the police to block 
Rustaveli Avenue, but unarmed patrol police 
units were able to prevent it. After the third 
attempt, protestors succeeded and forced the 
police out. As a result, numerous police 
officers were injured and several police cars 
were crushed. 
Before bringing in the riot police, 
demonstrators had been warned through 
loudspeakers to dissolve peacefully, and that 
force would be used otherwise. The leaders 
defied this request and made further radical 
statements inciting the protestors to even 
greater violence. The police repeated the 
request to dissolve peacefully, and made a 
specific announcement for women, children 
and the elderly before the water cannon 
machine was deployed. The use of water 
cannons did not have any significant effect. 
However, some protesters left Rustaveli 
Avenue within ten minutes. At the same time, 
new demonstrators, incited by the calls of 
opposition leaders, approached the Avenue </p>

from the other side. They started to throw 
stones at the police and smash police cars. As 
the use of water cannon proved ineffective, the 
police resorted to tear gas. Tear gas had a 
temporary but not immediate effect of 
incapacitating some of the protesters. Many 
left the Avenue, while some stayed, attacking 
policemen with stones and other objects.  
At this point, the policemen resorted to rubber 
bullets in order to prevent attacks from specific 
individuals and protect the parliament 
building, which was approached by the groups 
of protesters aiming to break in. The police 
managed to unblock Rustaveli Avenue only 
after the use of above special means. 
The Government of Georgia realizes that there 
are allegations of a limited number of cases 
where possibly excessive force has been used; 
however, such incidents were isolated cases 
and, if proven, would constitute clear 
violations of the respective orders. Alleged 
cases of excessive use of force could be 
partially attributed to the fact that additional 
police forces, other then riot police, were 
deployed to respond the situation adequately. 
Criminal police assisting the specifically 
trained riot police forces receive neither 
physical, nor physiological training for crowd 
control. Nevertheless, the police was acting in 
accordance with legislation and the order. A

where excessive force was allegedly used, is 
underway led by the office of the General 
Prosecutor. The Ministry of Internal Affairs 
has completed an internal administrative 
inquiry, as a result of which 11 police officers 
were dismissed due to non-compliance with 
ministerial instructions and confrontation with 
civilians. As a result of this internal analysis, 
the Ministry identified specific weaknesses, 
especially training-wise and has already 
initiated measures to improve the police&#8217; 
capacity. On 15 November 2007, the Tbilisi 
Main Division of Internal Affairs launched an 
investigation into the alleged infliction of 
physical injury upon the Public Defender of 
Georgia - Sozar Subari (criminal case 
No 10070583). The investigation was initiated 
in response to his TV interview where he 
alleged that law enforcement officers on 
Rustaveli Avenue physically insulted him on 
7 November. The case was transferred to the 
Investigative Department of the Office of the 
Prosecutor General for further investigation. 
The organ conducting the investigation, on 
several occasions asked Mr. Subari to appear 
before it, in order to provide his testimony that 
would assist in establishing justice in relation

Md. Aptarul Hossain denied and gave his name. 
The BSF soldier did not believe him and suddenly 
fired a round from his rifle at the victim&#8217;s left leg

documents filed by the BSF in connection with 
their complaint against Md. Aptarul Hossain 
(such as the reports concerning his arrest) contain 
such inconsistencies as to undermine the 
BSF version of the incident. Md. Aptarul Hossain 
is currently detained on remand at Dum Dum 
Central Correctional Home. When he was 
produced before the Bongaon Court on 
24 June 2008, his left leg had lost flexibility due 
to the insufficient medical treatment given to his 
wound, which was swelling and releasing fluid. 
On 8 July 2008, Md. Aptarul Hossain was again 
produced before the Bongaon Magistrate&#8217;s Court. 
The wound was not covered by a bandage but tied 
with an unhygienic piece of cloth. Md. Aptarul 
Hossain informed the court that the treatment of 
his injury was not going well, but was cut short 
by the Public Prosecutor. Also counsel acting for 
Md. Aptarul Hossain has repeatedly drawn the

the two Nigerians who were executed by firing

had reportedly attempted to smuggle 7 kg of

to detailed information provided by your 
Government to the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture in November 2007, there were 
(as of October 2007) 99 prisoners sentenced to 
death in Indonesia. Recent reports indicate that 
the number of prisoners on death row has since 
risen, possibly to 108 at present. Five had been 
sentenced to death on terrorism charges, 36 for 
murder and one on charges of robbery. The 
remaining 57 were sentenced to death on charges 
of illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and 
psychotropic substances. On 26 June 2008 (the 
International Day against Drug Abuse and 
Trafficking), National Police Chief General 
Sutanto reportedly stated that the Government 
intends to speed up executions of persons 
sentenced to death for drug trafficking. 
We commend the recent decision of the Supreme 
Court of Indonesia to commute the death sentence 
in the cases of three Australian citizens convicted 
</p>
<p>against them. 
Achmad Suradj was sentenced to death in 
April 1997 by the Lubuk Pakam district court 
in Deli Serdanag, North Sumatra, for killing 
42 women and girls in a series of ritual 
slayings. His appeals in higher courts and 
subsequent application for clemency were all 
rejected. 
Tubagus Maulana Yusuf was convicted of 
murdering eight persons in March 2007 and 
was sentenced to death. He did not appeal the 
conviction, nor did he make any requests for 
clemency. 
Nyonya Sumiarsih and her son, Sugeng, were 
sentenced to death in 1989 for the murder of a 
family of five in Surabaya. Their last appeal 
for clemency was rejected in 2003. 
It should be clearly understood that Indonesia 
has an independent judiciary which has been 
functioning effectively for several years. There 
are several stages which must be respected 
before any execution may be carried out in 
Indonesia.  
Contrary to any negative inferences in the 
letter, Indonesia wishes to recall that it does 
not take lightly the commitments it has 
undertaken when ratifying the ICCPR. 
However, for heinous crimes, which have been 
judicially adjudicated, certain provisions of the 
national law impose the death penalty. </p>

Duc Tan Nguyen and Si Yi Chen. 
According to the data your Government provided 
to the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, while all the death row inmates convicted 
for non-drug related offences are Indonesian 
nationals, of the 57 awaiting execution on drugs 
trafficking charges 43 are foreigners. Half of these 
foreigners (21) are citizens of African countries. 
While it seems clear that foreigners play a 
significant role in smuggling drugs into 
Indonesia, the fact that four out of five prisoners 
awaiting execution on drugs trafficking charges 
are foreigners raises certain questions in terms of 
possible discrimination in relation to both 
criminal enforcement and sentencing in 
drug-related cases. It would be important to know 
if there are four times more foreigners than locals 
involved in the drug trade, if the police use the 
same approach in investigating and charging both 
locals and foreigners, and if the sentences handed 
down are equally harsh in relation to both 
foreigners and locals. In addition, foreigners in 
conflict with the law are particularly vulnerable 
and require special measures to ensure the 
fairness of the proceedings against them, 
including interpretation and consular assistance.  
When the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture visited Pasir Putih prison on 
20 November 2007, he interviewed a number of 
prisoners sentenced to death. As reflected in 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the provisions of the national 
legislation are not discriminatory in relation to 
foreigners as all are judged equally before the 
law. Therefore, the fact that Indonesia is a 
signatory of the ICCPR does not pre-empt 
decisions the Government may take as part of 
its sovereign and democratic legal process, 
within its borders and by applying its judicial 
norms. 
</p>
<p>Once again, the death penalty in Indonesia is 
only imposed for crimes of a very serious 
nature. The law does not prohibit the death 
penalty. Furthermore, nobody was executed 
before the Government reassessed its position, 
and in 2007 the Constitutional court upheld the 
death penalty for serious drug offenses.  
In addition, it bears stating that the names 
mentioned in the Annex of the communication 
remain within the jurisdiction of the judiciary. 
It is up to the court and the constitution to 
determine how the provisions of national 
legislation apply to the mentioned individuals. 
To this effect, the Government of Indonesia is 
not at liberty to comment on the decisions that 
will be taken on their cases at this point in 
time. </p>

the prosecutor treated the case as a minor offence. 
On 8 October 2008, the Bandaraya Aceh District 
Police summoned Mr. H. to give testimony at the 
Banda Aceh District Court. The trial against four 
police officers took place that same day. During 
the trial, the judge did not examine the 
perpetrated acts of torture but rather focused on 
the sexual orientation of Mr. H. He gave the 
impression that the accused should be allowed to 
beat and assault the victim on the grounds of his 
different sexual orientation. After Mr. H. gave his 
testimony, all of the accused accepted it without 
objection.  
The court sentenced the four defendants to three 
month imprisonment, six months probation and a 
fine of IDR 1.000 (0.1 USD) for &#8220;minor 
maltreatment&#8221;. Since the charge was a minor 
offense, the victim has no right to appeal. In its 
reasoning for the light punishment, the court 
stated that the police officers had committed a 
minor offence, had confessed their acts, both 
parties had forgiven each other and they were 
needed by their country.

intercourse. At the time, it was said that the 
assault was a direct result of the disapproval 
felt in their community for their sexual 
misconduct which contravened the local laws, 
traditions and religious values. The police 
came and allegedly asked them to sign a letter 
addressed to the Lamgalang Head of the 
Village informing him that they would not 
repeat their homosexual actions in the future in 
that village. 
On 23 January 2007, the two were arrested by 
the Banda Raya Aceh Sector Police at 
approximately 1:30 a.m. and were taken to the 
local police station in Banda Aceh. The arrest 
was linked to their public disorder. Following 
their arrest, there were allegations that they 
had been mistreated while in police custody. 
During his trial, Mr. H. was requested to give 
testimony before the Banda Aceh District 
Court on 8 October. As homosexuality is 
considered a crime in the legislation in Aceh, 
the judge advised him to &#8220;turn away&#8221; from this 
legal violation. 
Regarding the allegations of torture and 
mistreatment, it is illicit for authority figures to 
misuse their power to the detriment of 
detainees. As a result, four police officers were 
placed on trial, R. H, W. P, W. S. and A. They 
did not deny the accusation and later 
apologized to Mr. H. They were also sentenced </p>

Sabar Olif Iwanggin&#8217;s trial has violated the 
guarantees of the due process of law, as stipulated

international human rights standards. It is alleged 
that Sabar Olif Iwanggin was arrested without an

Moreover, he would have confessed to 
committing the offense as a result of 
psychological pressure exerted by police officers.

nine witnesses of whom none was able to testify 
against Sabar Olif Iwanggin, which led the 
prosecution to ask for further witness 
examination, even though both, the examination 
of the witnesses as well as the examination of the 
defendant, had been closed. This would have 
breached the Indonesian Criminal Procedural 
Code (article 182). Furthermore, it is alleged that, 
although the prosecution did not prove that the

burned down in September 2007, Sabar Olif

Mr. Kazemeini&#8217;s trial was in accordance with

In the judicial system of Muslim countries, 
including Iran, Qesas (lex talionis, or 
retribution in kind) is the verdict for 
premeditated murder. For that purpose, 
enforcement of Qesas depends upon the 
request by guardians of the murder victim, and

out the verdict on behalf of the former. The 
second aspect is the responsibility of the

lawmaker has anticipated 5-15 years 
imprisonment. In case the guardians of the 
murder victim claim Qesas through payment of 
Diyeh (blood money) to guardians of the

imprisonment shall be imposed. Sentences of

With due regard to the insistence of guardians

<b>Sami Ben Khemais Essid</b> (hereafter, Mr. Essid), 
a Tunisian citizen, who was reportedly deported 
from Italy to Tunisia on 3 June 2008 and is being 
held in Mornaguia prison outside the capital city 
of Tunis. Mr. Essid had been scheduled to appear 
in a Milan courtroom on 3 June 2008 for a 
preliminary hearing on terrorism charges, but an 
expulsion order was issued on 31 May 2008 under 
the expedited procedure created by Law 155 of 
31 July 2005. This law denies the right of 
suspensive appeal to those persons subject to 
removal on national security grounds. Having 
been convicted in February 2002 of membership 
in a terrorist organization and sentenced to 
six-and-a-half years in prison, Mr. Essid was 
indicted on new terrorism charges in 2005. He 
was remanded into pre-trial detention in June 
2007 on the eve of his scheduled release from 
prison. It is reported that Mr. Essid had been held 
the maximum amount of time permitted in pre-
trial detention for the charges against him and 
would have had to be released. However, 
according to our understanding, Italian law 
provides for the following alternatives to removal 
where such removal would violate international 
law: 1) compulsory residence (obbligo di 
soggiorno) and 2) special police supervision. 
Such measures could have potentially been

end of the 1990s and 2001. He was sentenced, 
by the Milan Tribunal, to a six year and six 
month prison term, on the ground of his 
membership in a criminal organization aiming 
at terrorist activities. The pre-trial detention 
warrant was issued by the preliminary 
investigation magistrate (GIP) of Milan 
Tribunal. While Mr. Essid was serving his 
term, additional offences presumably 
committed by him came to light based on the 
testimony of another member of the same 
criminal cell. For these other offences, the GIP 
at the Milan Tribunal issued, in June 2007, 
additional detention warrants, affecting 
Mr. Essid and other individuals within the 
framework of the investigation 
&#8220;4457/06-No. 179/07&#8221;. Since the time limit of 
the above pre-trial detention warrant was 
expiring and, thus, Mr. Essid was about to be 
freed, the Ministry of Justice issued an 
expulsion order on the basis of Art. 13 of 
Legislative Decree No.286/98 and Art. 3 of 
Act No.155/2005 concerning the legislation on 
international terrorism, justified by the risk 
that Mr. Essid, once released, might be able to 
facilitate terrorist activities within the Italian 
territory. Meanwhile, the Police&#8217;s Immigration

Mr. Essid was allowed to contact his defence

colleagues, Alimbekov did not enjoy the 
respect of other staff members and was 
argumentative and arrogant. He did not 
maintain close relations with his colleagues, 
nor did he participate in the life of the 
workplace. He was dismissed on account of 
complaints from students about his poor 
teaching and regular absences. In addition, 
Alimbekov&#8217;s fellow students on the Interlink 
Resources, Inc., courses, who were 
interviewed as witnesses in the case, 
confirmed that his behaviour during classes 
had been inappropriate and aggressive and that 
he had insulted them. In response to an appeal 
filed by defence counsel M. Bektasov on 
27 August 2007 requesting the modification of 
the preventive measure taken in respect of 
Alimbekov, the criminal case was referred to 
the Enbek District Court. After considering the 
request, the court left the preventive measure - 
pretrial detention - unchanged. This decision 
was in turn upheld by the South Kazakhstan 
Provincial Court on 6 September 2007. On 
13 September 2007, it was decided that 
Alimbekov should undergo an inpatient 
forensic psychiatric evaluation, to be carried 
out at the National Scientific and Practical 
Centre for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and 
Narcology in Almaty. The evaluation (No. 283 
of 28 October 2007) confirmed the signs of

assess his mental state at the time of the acts

recommended the application of coercive 
measures of a medical character, specifically 
treatment in a special psychiatric hospital 
under intensive observation. On 
18 October 2007, defence counsel 
M. Bektasov lodged a complaint with the 
Shymkent garrison&#8217;s military prosecutor 
alleging assault and battery and use of physical 
force by officers of the National Security 
Committee Department for South Kazakhstan

decided not to institute criminal proceedings 
against A. Omarov, K. Sairambaev and 
T. Mombekov on the grounds of lack of 
evidence that a crime had been committed. On 
21 November 2007, pursuant to a decision of

bag on his head from behind and started 
strangling him. Periodically, he lost 
consciousness. Each time he regained 
consciousness, the abuse would start again. His 
nose and ears bled. After approximately one hour, 
Mr. Gerasimov lost consciousness again and does 
not remember anything else. He was told by his 
interrogators that his two stepsons, who were in 
the neighbouring offices, were also tortured. In 
addition to Mr. Gerasimov, his stepsons also filed 
allegations of torture but withdrew them later, 
saying they had made them up to take revenge 
against the police for illegally detaining them. On 
28 March, Mr. Gerasimov&#8217;s stepsons were 
released, and his interrogation continued. The 
investigator did not beat him, but told him that his 
wife and stepsons had testified against him in 
writing. Mr. Gerasimov did not confess to 
anything and was released without charges that 
same day around 6 p.m. Immediately after he 
returned home, he was taken to hospital in an 
ambulance. At the hospital, the doctors noted 
multiple contusions, a concussion of medium

Further, during his stay in the hospital, 
Mr. Gerasimov was visited by unknown persons 
in plain clothes who asked him how he was 
feeling, and who spoke to his doctors. After his 
discharge he continued to experience headaches 
and did not feel well. A forensic examination 
conducted on 23 April concluded that 
Mr. Gerasimov&#8217;s injuries were of light severity 
and stated nothing about whether his injuries were 
consistent with his allegations. On 14 May, 
Mr. Gerasimov received a reply from the 
Yuzhny Otdel of Kostanay Department of Internal 
Affairs stating that no substantial grounds were 
found for initiating criminal proceedings based on 
his complaint. After intervention by a 
non-governmental organization, the prosecutor&#8217;s 
office in Kostanay ordered that the inquiry into 
Mr. Gerasimov&#8217;s complaint be re-opened in late

crimes relating to abuse of authority. In August, 
he was referred to a psychiatric hospital for

to call the militia, but nevertheless asked her to 
report back on 20 February. When Ms. A. did so, 
she was arrested by three members of the militia. 
The three men violently dragged her into a car, 
which caused her pain in her shoulders and

threatened that she would be detained for many

investigation found that there were grounds for 
the complaint. On 20 February 2008, the 
internal affairs office&#8217;s investigation service 
instituted criminal proceedings dealing with 
hooliganism. On the same day, Ms. A. was 
arrested for the acts in question, and taken into 
police custody at the Aksyisky district internal 
affairs office. On 22 February 2008, Ms. A., in 
the presence of a counsel and of a human 
rights defender Ms. S. V., was charged with 
the offence, and the Aksyisky district court 
issued a pretrial restraining order authorizing

consciousness two days later on 22 February. At 
the hospital she was handcuffed to her bed and 
guarded by policemen, making it impossible for 
her to go to the bathroom, which caused her much 
distress because of her cystitis. One of the police 
guards threatened her again not to report the rape. 
On 22 February, she was summoned to the city 
court of Kerben on charges of hooliganism, and 
the presiding judge did not ask any questions or 
listen to her complaints. After the trial she was 
returned to the hospital. On 25 February, she filed 
a complaint with the Deputy Prosecutor of 
Kerben, who came to the hospital following the 
intervention of a human rights defender. Ms. A. 
remained at the hospital until 26 February when 
she was transferred to the Legal Examination Unit 
of the National Psychiatric Hospital in Kyzylzhar, 
escorted by three guards, one of whom had raped 
her at the police station. Ms. A. currently remains

a view to the application of compulsory 
medical measures. The court issued a decision 
finding Ms. A. guilty of the offence in 
question, and the criminal case against her was 
closed. She was sent to the psychiatric hospital 
in the settlement of Kyzyl-Zhar for

possibly by a fall. No signs of sexual assault

question was examined by the Jalalabad 
provincial procurator&#8217;s office, which found 
that the decision taken was justified. The 
allegation that Ms. A. was raped by staff of the 
Aksyisky district internal affairs office has 
thus been found to be unreliable. Furthermore, 
Ms. A. has not filed a statement with the 
national Procurator-General&#8217;s Office. It should 
be noted that the entire investigation of 
Ms. A.&#8217;s case took place with the participation 
of defence counsel. The assertions that the 
investigator submitted for signature documents 
in Russian, without making them public, are 
untrue: the proceedings in the criminal case 
were conducted in the national language. 
There were no violations of the legislation on

the arrest, the Uzbek authorities requested his 
extradition for alleged involvement in religious 
extremism and anti-constitutional activities, 
which has been granted by the Prosecutor General 
of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan in April 2008. On 
6 March 2008, Jalal-Abad City Court sentenced 
Mr.Kholikov to four years of imprisonment under 
article 339 of the Criminal Code and illegal 
border crossing under article 346 of the Criminal 
Code. On 30 April 2008, Mr.Kholikov&#8217;s lawyer 
attempted to register Mr.Kholikov with 
Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s State Commission for Migration. 
However, the Commission refused to do so. An 
appeal against the refusal is scheduled for 
22 May 2008. Given reliable reports that on 
12 May 2008 Uzbek officials attempted to bring 
Erkin Kholikov from the SIZO to Uzbekistan, 
concern is expressed that his hand-over to Uzbek 
authorities might be imminent.

of the Talas police on suspicion of theft. At the 
Talas Police Department, although she admitted 
having stolen a mobile phone, members of the 
police attempted to force her to confess to other 
thefts, which she denied. Ms. T. was undressed by 
a female police officer in front of male officers, 
who then severely beat her on the head, stomach 
and kidney. They also insulted her and threatened 
her with rape. On 26 July, a human rights

Ms. T.&#8217;s behalf to the Office of the Prosecutor, 
asking for a medical examination and for an 
investigation into the harm Ms. T. had allegedly 
suffered. The resulting medical report confirmed 
the beatings she had suffered. Despite the 
complaint, the medical evidence and the fact that 
Ms. T. identified one of the policemen who 
mistreated her, no investigation has so far been 
ordered into these events. At the time of writing, 
Ms. T. remained in pre-trial detention in a cell at

over eighty civil society groups in Malaysia. The

were deployed to deal with the protestors,

<p>By letter dated 06/10/08, the Government 
informed that the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons is guaranteed by the 
Constitution, which also provides that no 
person shall be deprived of his life or personal 
liberty, save in accordance with the law. 
Although Malaysia is not a party to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Politial 
Rights 1966, it fully appreciates that no one 
shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
as provided under Article 7 of the said 
Covenant. Malaysia also adheres to the 
philosophy and norms set out in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights 1948 and the 
United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials (&#8220;UN Basic Principles&#8221;), which are 
not legally binding on States. Malaysia also 
asserts that the provisions of the Constitution 
and its legislative framework generally 
conform to the applicable international human 
rights law in this matter. In respect of the 
UN Basic Principles, the Government finds it 
important to reiterate that law enforcement 
officials, in carrying out their duty, may use 
force and firearms if other means remain 
ineffective or without any promise of 
achieving the intended result. In the context of 
the cases mentioned in the communication, the 
Government of Malaysia stresses that the </p>

<p>Para. Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
the protest from taking place by setting up road 
blocks in order to monitor all of the vehicles 
entering the area from outside Kuala Lumpur. 
Police also blocked off several of the roads which 
lead to Dataran Merdeka, as well as suspending 
train services and refusing members of the public 
entry to the venue of the protest. Tear gas, water 
cannons, and sprayed water laced with harmful 
chemicals were used by police in order to disperse 
the crowd even before the protest had begun. The 
34 above mentioned protestors were arrested and 
detained at IPK Jalan Hang Tuah and were 
released by 11 p.m. on the same day. The Chief of 
the National Police, Mr. Musa Hassan, threatened 
to charge all parents who took their children to the 
protest with &#8220;placing their children&#8217;s safety at 
risk&#8221;. Of those arrested, five protestors are said to 
have sustained injuries: Mohd. Asri Ahmad, 
Mohd al-Farook, Haji Abdul Hamid Baharuddin, 
Khairul Salleh Ahmad, and Nasrullah bin Ahmad. 
In addition, another protestor, Aleyasak Hamid, 
who was not arrested is said to have suffered a 
broken leg due to being stepped on by a police 
officer. He was sent to the General Hospital, 
Kuala Lumpur, for treatment. 
</p>
<p>exercise of power by the Malaysian Police is 
reasonable and necessary for the protection of 
national security and public order and for the 
purpose of ensuring protection for everyone. 
The actions surrounding the case are therefore 
compatible with international norms and 
standards, and common in almost all 
jurisdictions worldwide. In view of the above, 
the Government reiterates its observation that 
the summary of the facts is not entirely 
accurate and not reflective of the actual 
situation prevailing during the protest. The 
concern with respect to the allegation of 
excessive use of force employed by members 
of the Police against peaceful protestors, as 
well as the arrests of the protestors, are 
therefore unfounded and baseless. The actions 
undertekan by the relevant authorities in 
Malaysia, including the Police force, are 
within the confines of the international human 
rights regime and national laws. All actions 
taken by the Malaysia Police are reasonable 
and necessary for the protection of national 
security and public order, in accordance with 
the constitutional and legislative framework of 
Malaysia and in line with international law. As 
such, the issue regarding the deprivation of the 
right to physical and mental integrity does not 
arise.

Mr. P. Uthayakumar and Mr. M. Manoharan are 
diabetic and access to appropriate medication has 
been denied. On 7 April 2008, Mr. P. 
Uthayakumar collapsed in his cell and was taken 
to a doctor who diagnosed a heart condition. 
Although they have access to their lawyers, it is 
reported that discussions between the men and

Finally, they are denied their right to worship; 
they do not have access to temples and prayer

when P. Uthayakumar, M. Manoharan, 
R. Kenghadharan, V, Ganabatirau and 
T. Vasanthakumar [&#8220;HINDRAF 5&#8221;] through 
HINDRAF, have resorted to various tactics 
that include holding public rallies, gatherings 
and forums. 
Leading up to the month of November 2007, 
the HINDRAF 5 have attended and made 
speeches at a number of HINDRAF-organized 
forums and gatherings at various public 
venues. During those rallies (which were not 
blocked or forced to disperse by authorities 
and police), inflammatory sentiments were 
widely circulated. 
The HINDRAF 5 were arrested on 
13 December 2007 by Special Branch officers. 
The cumulative actions taken by the 
HINDRAF 5 in aggressively inciting feelings 
of ill-will amongst the races in Malaysia with 
deeply hurtful racial and religious rhetoric and 
sowing hatred towards the government have 
resulted in their detention, on the grounds that 
they were a threat to public order and national 
security. The HINDRAF 5 were admitted to 
the Detention Protection Centre Kamunting, 
Taiping, Perak from 13 December 2007. In the 
early admittance, they were placed in the 
orientation block to pursue orientation 
programme for 3 months. In this orientation 
block, they have been placed in a different cell </p>

Throughout this orientation programme they 
were confined in their respective cells for 
12 hours. They may, at any time, request the 
wardens to switch their lights on or off. Each 
cell is also equipped with a bed lamp. 
However, they did not complete the 3 months 
orientation programme. On 10 January 2008, 
Mr. Uthayakumar was places in the normal 
detention block. He was placed in a block 
where each inmate is placed in a different cell. 
However, there cells are not locked during the 
night to enable the inmates to move freely to 
the general area and toilets. Inmates are free to 
choose whether to have the lights on or off. 
As for Mr. M. Manoharan, Mr. R. 
Kenghadharan, Mr. V. Ganabatirau and Mr. T. 
Vasanthakumar, they were transferred to 
normal detention block from 7 February 2005. 
All four of them were placed in the same 
dormitory. Inmates are free to choose whether 
to have the lights on or off.  
Mr. P. Uthayakumar is a diabetic, however, 
Mr. M. Manoharan is not. Nonetheless, Mr. P. 
Uthayakumar was never denied his 
medications. Even at his early stage of 
admission to the Detention Protection Centre 
Kamunting, he was allowed to receive his 
medications, which were supplied by his 
family. There was only one instance which he </p>

was not allowed to receive diabetics 
medication from his family as the government 
hospital at Taiping had supplied similar 
medication to him. Mr. P. Uthayakumar 
protested on this matter and, for this reason, he 
was allowed to receive his regular medication. 
The allegation that Mr. P. Uthayakumar 
collapsed in his cell on 7 April 2008 due to 
heart problems is also untrue. By 7 April 2008, 
he was taken to undergo a follow-up medical 
examination at a government clinic in Taiping. 
During his medical examination, he did not 
show any kind of symptoms. However, the 
sugar reading in his blood taken from the 
previous week showed a reading of 
18.8 mmol/I. For this reason, Mr. P, 
Uthayakumar himself applied to be admitted to 
be warded at the Taiping hospital in order to 
stabilize his blood sugar rate. 
In accordance with the existing procedure, the 
prison officers would stay in the meeting room 
during the meeting between the detainee and 
his lawyer. However, the prison officers did 
not record what was said during the meeting. 
However, due to protests by Mr. P. 
Uthayakumar, a directive was issued on 
12 May 2008 requiring meeting surveillance to 
be carried out at a range where the 
conversation could be seen and heard, but the 
prison officers were not necessarily required to 
sit together with the detainee and his lawyer. </p>

Pursuant to that directive, surveillance has 
been carried out from outside the meeting

are allowed to pray and practice their 
respective religion. A religious teacher is also 
available every week for each religion. 
The Internal Security Act 1960 (Act 82) 
provides for the rights of HINDRAF 5 to make 
representation in front of the Advisory Board

</p>
<p>  <b>Practice of caning</b> (A/HRC/7/3/Add.1, para. 141)<b> </b>By letter dated 22/02/08, the Government 
informed that the sentence of caning, which is 
known as whipping in Malaysia, is imposed 
either as a supplementary or alternative to the 
punishment of imprisonment or fine for certain 
criminal offences. The punishment of 
whipping may also be imposed in cases where 
a person is found guilty of repeat offences. 
Whipping is only executed against male 
prisoners. There has been no execution of 
whipping of women prisoners or young 
prisoners under the age of 18. In most cases 
the sentence is not mandatory but is imposed at 
the discretion of the court taking into 
consideration matters such as the gravity of the 
offence and whether the offender is a repeat </p>

offender. A mandatory sentence of whipping is 
only imposed for grave crimes and crimes 
which involve infliction of injuries to the 
victim or victims. A number of safeguards 
contained in sections 286-290 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code (CPC) are to be adhered to, 
such as: prohibition of the sentence upon 
females, males sentenced to death, and males 
considered to be more than 50 years of age, 
except those convicted of certain sexual 
offences; court instruction as to place and time 
of execution; where imprisonment is also 
imposed, expiration of at least seven days from 
the date of sentence; the sentence shall specify 
the number of strokes, and even in relation to 
multiple offences, shall not exceed 24 for an 
adult offender, or ten for a youthful offender 
(from 18 to less than 21 years of age), for 
whom whipping shall be inflicted in the way of 
school discipline with a light rattan; the part of 
the body subjected to whipping is designated 
by the Government; and the whipping is 
conducted under the supervision of a doctor. A 
male child under 18 may be subject to 
whipping up to ten strokes under section 91 of 
the Child Act 2001. The whipping will take 
place with a light cane within the court 
premises, and in the presence of a parent or 
guardian, if the child so wishes. Safeguards 
provided for under article 92 of the Act 
include: supervision of the whipping by a 
medical doctor; manner of whipping; whipping </p>

on any part of the body except the face, head,

shall wear clothes. In fulfilling the obligations 
under the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the Government is in the process of 
amending the Child Act to abolish the 
punishment of whipping of children.  
With respect to illegal entry into Malaysia, any 
person found guilty of having committed any 
of the offences of illegal entry, unlawful return 
after removal, and section orgery or alteration 
of endorsement or document may be subject to 
whipping. As a large number of illegal 
immigrants enter Malaysia on a daily basis, it 
is impossible to determine who among them is 
entering for economic purposes or otherwise. 
These provisions were introduced into the Act 
to deter the influx of illegal immigrants into 
Malaysia. The punishment of whipping on 
drug-related offences is also a form of 
deterrent for those contemplating committing a 
similar offence. This is to control the 
trafficking of certain dangerous drugs in 
Malaysia. The Government provided relevant 
legislation, annexed to its response.

reconocer a uno de los oficiales que 
supuestamente la oblig&#243; a realizarle sexo oral. El 
28 de agosto de 2006, habr&#237;a sido dictado el auto 
de formal prisi&#243;n en contra de dicho polic&#237;a por el 
delito de &#8220;actos libidinosos&#8221; en contra de 
A. M. V. R. Sin embargo, se alega que este delito 
no refleja la magnitud ni la gravedad de las 
violaciones sufridas por la Sra. A. M. V. R., ya 
que contempla una pena menor a la prevista para 
el delito de violaci&#243;n sexual. Tambi&#233;n se informa 
que el delito de &#8220;actos libidinosos&#8221; no es 
considerado como grave, por lo tanto el polic&#237;a se 
encontrar&#237;a en libertad bajo cauci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n las 
alegaciones, al menos 17 mujeres habr&#237;an sido 
sometidas a abusos sexuales como los sufridos 
por la Sra. A. M. V. R. durante los incidentes en 
Salvador de Atenco. Sin embargo, ning&#250;n agente 
policial habr&#237;a sido consignado por el delito de 
violaci&#243;n sexual. Hasta la fecha, s&#243;lo un polic&#237;a 
ha sido formalmente acusado por abusos sexuales

confesar su participaci&#243;n en dichos cr&#237;menes. 
Posteriormente, un juez autoriz&#243; su puesta en

gestionado por la Procuradur&#237;a General de la

abril de 2008, el Ministerio P&#250;blico solicit&#243; al 
Juez Penal del Distrito Judicial de Allende, una 
orden de arraigo por el t&#233;rmino de 30 d&#237;as; 
medida que fue ampliada por 30 d&#237;as m&#225;s. 
Las diligencias practicadas por el Ministerio

fueron las siguientes: levantamiento e

Polic&#237;a Investigadora Ministerial (PIM) la ataron

coloc&#225;ndole una bolsa en la cabeza. Tanto ella 
como los otros familiares del Sr. Tornez

esta persona, dado el grado de imposibilidad de

Hern&#225;ndez, si bien estuvo en el lugar del crimen, 
fue porque hab&#237;a sido secuestrado por los 
delincuentes, quienes le obligaron a sacarlos del

Mr. Enkhbaatar Tserenjav and Mr. Batsaikhan 
Togtokh were shot dead in a central street in 
Ulaanbaatar, at a short distance from where the 
main protests were taking place. Reports claim 
that their injuries show that they had been 
severely beaten before being shot. An official 
police investigation has reportedly been launched 
into the incident. However the results have yet to 
be made public. Numerous complaints have also 
been made regarding alleged mistreatment of 
those detained for questioning after the protests, 
including women and children, many of whom 
were subjected to beatings, detained in cramped 
cells without food and water, and forced to sign 
statements implicating themselves in violent 
activities during the protests. According to the 
Mongolian Criminal Procedures Code individuals 
can be detained without charges for a period of up 
to 72 hours. The majority of those who were 
detained were released within 72 hours. However 
legal counsel was not made available during 
detention. Reports also claim that following the 
protests, new arrests may have been made based 
on the identification of individuals through video 
footage recorded during the demonstrations. Since 
4 July, silent protests have been held on a daily 
basis in Sukhbaatar Square by citizens collecting 
signatures for the release of approximately 
200 individuals who remain in detention. To date

the weapons had been found in their possession. 
Ms. Win refused to sign and was subsequently 
struck on the head with a bamboo rod. That night 
Ms. Win was sent to Kyaikkasan Interrogation 
Camp, where she was kept without charge or 
warrant until 7 October. She was transferred to 
Insein Prison and held there until 25 October. On 
25 October, she was sent to the Hlaing Township 
Peace and Development Council office where she 
was told to sign a pledge that she would not take 
part in any anti-state activities, after which she 
was released. During the 26 days of her detention, 
she was denied access to a lawyer and not 
allowed to contact her family. On 1 November, 
two police officers from Kyauktada Township 
Station came to her house and informed her that 
she would be charged with illegal possession of 
arms as per section 19 (e) of the Arms Act, 
although the &#8220;arms&#8221; they claimed to have found 
were a slingshot and some pellets, which are not 
listed under the act. When Ms. Win went to court 
the next day, the charge put against her was acting 
&#8220;to endanger human life or the personal safety of 
others&#8221; under section 336/511 of the Penal Code. 
She was granted bail for five million kyat, an

was finally taken to Om Hospital and Research 
Center, Chabahil, and further referred to Bir

stated that Mr. Lama had fever for seven days, he 
suffered from abdominal pain and vomiting, and 
the colouring of his skin and eyes was yellowish. 
He was therefore taken to the police hospital and 
found to have jaundice. The doctor&#8217;s examination 
also indicated that he had several marks and that 
his legs and fingers were swollen. In accordance

In July 2004, the husband had been kidnapped 
and detained in Faisalabad by the &#8216;Bajwa gang&#8217;, 
and some police officers. Upon receipt of Rupees 
(Rs.) 2.2 million, he was released. Both 
complained to the police about the kidnapping but 
instead of opening a case, the police officers 
arrested the husband, illegally detained him and

employee of the Excise Department, and 
involved in the registration of stolen vehicles.

more than one year ago, but escaped. He has 
been declared a fugitive. During the judicial </p>

asked him for Rs. 1.4 million. When they 
demanded an additional Rs. 5 millions, Ms. S. N. 
filed a writ at the Lahore High Court for her 
husband&#8217;s release, but without success. It is 
alleged that the Chief Justice of Lahore High 
Court is a close relative of the policeman who 
refused to act on the complaint. Ms. S. N. also 
complained to the national accountability bureau, 
but the officers there refused to register her case. 
All of Ms. S. N.&#8217;s property was confiscated. The 
husband was finally released. In April 2005, 
Ms. S. N. went to Parliament to make a complaint 
but she was taken to jail. She was subsequently 
released on bail, and a few days later kidnapped 
by four persons outside her house in Johar Town, 
Lahore. She was taken to an unknown place and 
allegedly raped and ill-treated by the policeman 
who had refused to register her complaint in the 
presence of several other persons. On 
2 September 2005, Ms. S. N. recorded her 
statement before the inquiry committee at the 
Office of the Human Rights Commission of 
Pakistan (HRCP). On that occasion, Ms. S. N. 
presented some evidence, such as her clothes, 
which the perpetrators had torn apart, several 
marks on her body and eye witnesses who saw 
her injured after she had been ill-treated. 
Subsequently, Ms. S. N.&#8217;s lawyer filed a writ 
petition at the judicial tribunal in the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, which ordered the police to 
register Ms. S. N.&#8217;s First Information Report. The 
police only registered it three months later and 
</p>
<p>inquiry, sufficient evidence was provided to 
show that he is still alive and was in contact 
with his wife, and a few other individuals, 
during the last year. The allegation that 
Ms. S. N.&#8217;s husband has been killed is 
therefore incorrect. Ms. S. N. also filed a 
petition before the High Court, Lahore. The 
court dismissed the petition on 13 July 2005. 
Neither Ms. S. N. nor her husband have ever 
appeared before any court or tribunal after 
leveling the allegations of atrocities, high 
handedness and gang rape committed by police 
officials. Ms. S. N. regularly met with the 
process server on each hearing date of the 
tribunal but did not appear before it. On 
30 August 2005, it was reported in the media 
that Ms. S. N. was abducted by the police in 
the first week of May 2005 and raped. She 
never leveled such allegations during the 
hearing before the High Court. Both, shef and 
her husband made the allegations before the 
media but avoided the proceedings of the 
tribunal. These allegations have not been 
proved. Among the recommendations of the 
tribunal, Ms. S. N. should be prosecuted for 
publishing accusations of <i>Zina</i> without proof 
and thereby harming the reputation of the 
accused; and her husband should be subjected 
to disciplinary sanctions and a high-level 
inquiry into his corruption activites. </p>

offered no protection to Ms. S. N. At that point, 
judicial proceedings on the case began at the trial 
court. On 17 October 2005, the Supreme Court 
ordered the immediate arrest of the policemen 
mentioned above on charges of abduction, torture 
and rape. On 24 November 2005, the district and 
sessions court in Lahore granted bail to the 
perpetrators. The victim&#8217;s lawyer wrote many 
letters to the Government requesting protection 
for Ms. S. N., but no protection was made 
available and she and her children have been 
regularly ill-treated or attacked by by members of 
the police. The same group of persons also 
prevented her from physically reaching the Court 
in January 2007, so that in March 2007 the case 
was dismissed. On 7 May 2007, Ms. S. N. was 
going to her lawyer&#8217;s office to prepare an appeal 
to be lodged at the High Court but some police 
officers, under the orders of Punjab Chief 
Minister Pervaiz Elahi, kidnapped her in front of 
her lawyer&#8217;s office and kept her in an unknown 
location for approximately six months. During 
that period, Ms. S. N. was filmed and 
photographed naked, was buried in a grave, and 
was allegedly raped by the policeman who had 
refused to register her complaint, his two 
sons-in-law, a Federal Minister and a Provincial 
Minister, both close relatives of Punjab Chief 
Minister Pervaiz Elahi. S. N. was finally released 
and is currently in hiding. She fears being taken 
and ill-treated by the police if she tries to contact 
her lawyer again. </p>

held at the 24th Infantry Batallion (IB) camp in 
Limay, Bataan. There Ms. C. was tied to a bench

<p><b>P. I. </b>has three children. A fourth child, her eldest 
daughter E., died on 16 July 1994, when she was 
18 months old, as a result of profuse bleeding 
arising from the forcible perpetration of female 
genital mutilation (FGM) on her. P.&#8217;s husband&#8217;s 
family had insisted on carrying out FGM on E. 
On at least three occasions, members of the 
extended family tried to kidnap the two remaining 
girls, <b>N.</b>, and <b>J</b>. On the last occasion, Mrs. I.&#8217;s 
husband was injured when he struggled with 
relatives to prevent them from taking her children. 
It was after this incident that Mrs. I. and her 
husband decided that she and the children should 
leave Nigeria for their safety. As a result, P. I., 
together with her two daughters, claimed asylum 
in Ireland in January 2005 on the basis that she 
feared for the safety of her two younger 
daughters. 
P. I.&#8217;s application for asylum was rejected by both 
the Office of the Refugee Applications 
Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. 
Deportation orders were issued for her and her 
two daughters in November 2005. Upon her arrest 
for deportation, a solicitor brought an application 
for judicial review in the high court, challenging 
the Minister for Justice&#8217;s refusal to allow Mrs. I. 
to remain in Ireland on humanitarian grounds.

These proceedings were concluded on 
30 January 2008, resulting in a refusal to accept 
P.&#8217;s application for judicial review. 
Mrs. I. then applied for subsidiary protection, 
which was refused by the Minister for Justice. 
This refusal was again challenged for judicial 
review, which was granted on 19 March 2008. An 
injunction on their deportation orders was also 
placed until 12 November 2008, pending a full 
hearing of her judicial review. The case 
was due to be heard in the high court on 
6 November 2008. As a case with similar points 
of law was recently decided in the high court and 
appealed to the Supreme Court, it was agreed that 
P.&#8217;s case should await the outcome of the 
Supreme Court decision. However, at the time of 
writing P. had still not been given a definite date 
for the judicial review and the State has explicitly 
refused to agree to extend the stay on their 
deportation orders until the hearing. In light of 
this, an application was made to the European 
Court of Human Rights under Article 34 to 
review the case of Mrs. I. The Court has 
apparently agreed to hear the case. 
It is alleged that the case was never subject to 
effective judicial scrutiny and that at no point in 
the appeal or judicial review of the asylum 
decision was a fresh or comprehensive review of 
the facts undertaken. Mrs. I. and her two 
daughters are facing deportation back to Nigeria. </p>

imports from the United States to the Republic of 
South Korea be re-negotiated, has since become a

from high fuel prices to health care privatization

there have been numerous complaints related to

and the rights of other citizens, however, a

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
prescribe that the exercise of rights may be 
subject to certain restriction for respect of the

On 17 July 2008, riot police reportedly dispersed 
thousands of citizens who were participating in 
candlelit protests, with water canons containing 
florescent material, apparently to identify 
protesters for arrest. Furthermore, in the morning 
of 26 June 2008, Mr. Joon-Hyeong Lee was 
monitoring one of the protests on behalf of 
MINBYUN&#8217;s Human Rights Infringement 
Monitoring Team in Seoul. At the time, Mr. Lee 
was reportedly wearing a jacket which clearly 
indicated that he was attending the protest in his 
capacity as a monitor. At approximately 1 a.m., 
police officers purportedly attempted to disperse 
the crowd with water canons and a short time 
later used their shields to force an end to the 
protest. One of the police officers reportedly 
struck Mr.Lee on the head with his shield, causing 
him to fall to the ground unconscious. Mr. Lee 
was transferred to Seoul National University 
Hospital, where he was treated for a fractured 
skull and internal bleeding. In the evening of

Mr. Geol Ahn reportedly suffered bruising as a

national from Karakalpakstan and former Islamic 
teacher, residing in Krasnogorsk since 
February 2007. On 13 June 2007, he received a 
call from an unknown Uzbek who wanted to meet 
him. When he left the house, four men in civilian 
clothes, who were members of the National 
Security Service of Uzbekistan, were waiting for 
him on the street. They forcibly took him to the 
Krasnogorsk Department of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs for the purpose of processing his 
return to Uzbekistan. However, the Uzbek 
officers had no arrest warrant for Mr. Abutov and 
he was not listed on any international arrest 
warrants. The Uzbek officers quickly produced an 
Uzbek arrest warrant, dated 26 February 2007, in 
connection with setting up a religious extremist 
organization, and on 26 June 2007, the City Court 
of Krasnogorsk ruled that Mr. Abutov should be 
detained for the purpose of his extradition to 
Uzbekistan. Mr. Abutov&#8217;s lawyer appealed, but 
the appeal court dismissed his complaint. On 
27 June 2007, Abutov was transferred to the 
50/10 probationary ward in Mozjaisk. Mr. Abutov 
remains in an overcrowded cell. He has chronic 
liver disease but has only been seen by a doctor 
once, in July, following several requests. He has

22 January 1993 (&#8220;the Minsk Convention&#8221;) 
and conveyed to the headquarters of the 
Ministry for Internal Affairs for Krasnogorsk 
municipal district, Moscow region. The 
inquiry about Mr. Abutov&#8217;s detention is based 
on a decision issued on 26 February 2007 in 
relation to Criminal Case No. 197-07 by the 
Public Prosecutor of the Surkhandarya region 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan, stating that he 
was under international investigation and 
should be held in custody under a pretrial

having committed crimes against the 
constitutional order of the Republic, 
production or dissemination of material 
constituting a threat to public security and 
public order, and establishment, leadership or 
membership of religious extremist, 
fundamentalist or other prohibited

the Migration service visited him for an interview. 
Currently, the Moscow Regional department of 
the Migration Department is reportedly 
considering his asylum application on its merits. 
At present, the extradition case is under 
consideration by the office of the General 
Prosecutor of the Russian Federation. In 
July 1996, Mr. Abutov had been sentenced to 
seven years in prison on charges of deliberate 
destruction and damage to property, for burning 
down the home of the imam of the Turtkul 
mosque. In detention he was subject to regular 
beatings by the guards and some of the prisoners 
working for them. He was put in solitary 
confinement for long periods. In winter he was 
subjected to extreme cold, and he was not given 
enough to eat. His access to toilets was restricted, 
his sleeping quarters were overcrowded, he had to 
perform hard labour, which included carrying 
very heavy loads, and he was subjected to regular 
punishment for following his religious rituals 
(i.e. sleep deprivation, mocking of his religious 
convictions, placed with persons seriously ill with 
tuberculosis). The overall conditions of 
imprisonment led him to attempt suicide twice. In 
2000 his term of imprisonment was extended by 
three years for &#8220;contemptuous violation of the 
prison regime&#8221;. In total he spent eight and a half 
years in prison. In May 2004, Mr. Abutov was 
released and he regularly went to Kazakhstan for

<p>order under Case No. 1488 of 15 May 2007. 
Before being placed in custody, he was 
examined by a doctor from Krasnogorsk City 
Hospital No. 1. No physical injuries of any 
kind were found and no urgent medical 
attention was required. On 14 June 2007, 
Mr. Abutov complained of pain in the lumbar 
region and also informed the management of 
the detention unit that he would refuse food, 
on the grounds that his detention was 
unlawful. The same day, Mr. Abutov was 
examined by the police medical officer. As a 
result of the examination, symptomatic 
anti-inflammatory treatment was carried out to 
deal with chronic pyelonephritis. X-rays 
conducted on 18 June 2007 revealed no 
pathological change. Medical staff concluded 
that Mr. Abutov&#8217;s state of health was currently 
satisfactory and he did not require medical 
assistance. The management of the detention 
unit and a representative of the Krasnogorsk 
public prosecutor&#8217;s office held discussions 
with Mr. Abutov, in which it was established 
that there were no grounds for his planned 
hunger strike. The detained man therefore 
abandoned his hunger strike and, from 
14 June 2007, received the regulatory three 
meals a day. For the whole period of his 
detention, Mr. Abutov was not held in solitary 
confinement, his cell measured 4 square 
metres as required by the regulations, and no 
physical force was used against him. In the </p>

was questioned by the Krasnogorsk First 
Deputy Public Prosecutor, who, on 
15 June 2007, concluded that, in accordance 
with the Minsk Convention and the legislation 
of the Russian Federation, Mr. Abutov should 
be handed over to the law enforcement 
agencies of the Republic of Uzbekistan. On 
25 June 2007, the Krasnogorsk public 
prosecutor&#8217;s office issued a decision that an 
application should be made to the courts so 
that Mr. Abutov should be held in custody 
under a pretrial restraining order. On 
26 June 2007, Judge E.V. Isaeva of the 
Krasnogorsk municipal court ordered 
Mr. Abutov to be held in custody in pretrial 
detention. On 2 July 2007, Mr. Abutov was 
transferred to Federal State Pretrial Detention 
Centre 50/10 of the federal headquarters of the 
Russian Federal Corrections Service for the 
Moscow region. On 29 June 2007, the

application from Mr. Abutov to be recognized 
as a refugee on the territory of the

feared political and religious persecution in the

the Migration Service decided to refuse

grounds that he did not meet the criteria 
established in the definition of a refugee. 
Notification of the decision was sent to 
Mr. Abutov on 31 January 2008, together with 
an explanation of the appeal procedure. 
Mr. Abutov has the right to appeal against the 
decision of the Migration Service. Under

examination and laboratory tests conducted by 
specialists showed that he was not suffering 
from any infectious lung disease. The 
allegation that, as a result of illness and the 
lack of essential treatment, Mr. Aleksanyan 
went blind is also unfounded. As stated in

diagnosed in childhood. The deterioration in

was not caused by conditions in custody. The 
assertion that many requests have been made 
by the European Court of Human Rights for 
Mr. Aleksanyan&#8217;s transfer to a specialized 
clinic where he would be able to receive the 
appropriate medical care is also incorrect. The

raised funds for the LTTE, and purchased

On 9 October 2008, the High Court trying the 
criminal case against the policeman accused of 
subjecting Lalith Rajapakse to torture acquitted 
the defendant. It would appear that the judge, who 
reportedly is the same judge who acquitted the 
defendant in the case regarding the torture of 
Gerald Mervin Perera, found that the evidence 
was insufficient to establish that Mr. Lalith 
Rajapakse had been tortured. This conclusion was 
reached in spite of medical evidence allegedly 
indicating that Lalith Rajapakse (who spent 
16 days in hospital at the time of the alleged 
torture incident in 1992) had injuries on the soles 
of his feet and a cerebral contusion which had

was not present at these times. It is alleged that 
these two attempts to arrest him are linked to his 
activities in assisting students who were arrested 
and detained by the NISS after clashes between 
students at the al-Bahr al-Ahmar University in 
Port Sudan on 11 May 2008, such as Faries Abd 
Alhay Mohmed Ali, who was arrested at the gates 
of the Port Sudan Hospital when he was taking 
wounded students for treatment. During his 
detention Mr.Faries Abd Alhay Mohmed Ali was 
beaten with water pipes and kicked with boots by 
members of NISS. He was released on 12 May 
after being warned that, should he be detained 
again, it would be for a much longer period.

created in early June in response to the attack on 
Omdurman and these 30 men and other 
defendants were brought before three of these 
special courts. Observers noticed that the 
defendants looked tired and appeared to be in 
pain. The defendants complained that they were 
subjected to torture or ill-treatment, but the court 
did not investigate these allegations and refused 
to grant requests by the defendants&#8217; lawyers for 
independent medical examinations. On 29 and 
31 July 2008, the courts announced their verdicts. 
They sentenced the 30 above-named defendants 
to death, acquitted one, and ordered the transfer of 
four minors to a detention facility where more 
than 90 children captured after the attacks are 
being held. One of those sentenced to death, 
M. A. Z., is reportedly a minor of 16 years of age, 
but his age was not determined by a medical 
examination. The 30 defendants were found 
guilty of a range of criminal charges 
defined in the 1991 Criminal Act, the 
2001 Counter-Terrorism Act and the 1986 Arms, 
Ammunitions and Explosives Act. The charges

accompanied by two Southern Sudan Police 
Service (SSPS) officers arrested five Ugandan 
female traders at a Ugandan Bar in Malakal

at the Malakal police station and only released at 
16:30 on 23 June 2008. While in detention, the

engaging in prostitution, while at the same time 
allegedly trying to force them to have sex with the

threatened and warned not to report this incident 
to anybody. The Director of the CID in Malakal

counter-terrorism court on 17 August 2008 is a

It found, however, that since A. was found guilty 
of hiraba, or brigandage (Article 167 of the

nevertheless be sentenced to death. Article 27 (2) 
of the Sudanese Criminal Act allows the death

<p>Attacks against the civilian population of the 
villages Logurony and Iloli in Eastern Equatoria 
State by the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army, 
which resulted in the <b>killing and beating of 
civilians and destruction of dwellings and 
livelihoods </b>on 4 June 2008 and in the following 
days. The villages of Logurony and Iloli, located 
near Hiyala, in Torit county, Eastern Equatoria 
State, Southern Sudan, have a history of 
occasionally tense relationships, due primarily to 
cattle raiding incidents. In early June 2008, the 
Governor of Eastern Equatoria State dispatched 
the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army (SPLA) to 
the two villages, apparently with orders to carry 
out arrests and disarm the population. On 
4 June 2008 at around 4 a.m. in the morning, 
SPLA forces surrounded Logurony. While it was 
still completely dark, they started shooting, at first 
aiming in the air. The villagers, who were on high 
alert due to an expected attack from Iloli, returned 
fire. Only when it became light, they realized that 
they had killed SPLA soldiers. Fearing retaliation 
by the SPLA, they fled into the bush. SPLA 
soldiers shot at Logurony villagers, reportedly 
killing four: Tome Marcello, the headmaster of 
the primary school; Ogesa Orlando, a police 
officer; Oreste Ogubung, and Origo Agala. They 
also started burning down the village. Two elderly 
people, Ojeno Itak and his wife Amisia Itak, died 
in their dwelling during the fire. On 21 June 2008, 
another elderly woman, Anisa Anohira Oteng, 
succumbed to the burn injuries sustained at the

hospital to which she had been taken by SPLA 
soldiers. Also on 4 June 2008, SPLA forces 
(reportedly counting 300 men) surrounded Iloli. 
The soldiers took the inhabitants outside the 
village and then started burning down the village, 
which killed one woman, Abung Elizabeth. The 
SPLA also arrested five men and tied their hands 
behind their backs. When news of the SPLA 
members killed in Logurony reached Iloli, the 
SPLA Operational Commander came to Iloli and 
allegedly ordered the soldiers to execute those 
arrested. The five men were led back to Iloli. 
Three men, named Bertino Odiongo, Angelo 
Otuno Ogede and Francesco Asai Omudek, were 
executed on the spot in front of the remaining 
village community. One of those arrested was 
injured but managed to escape. As the fifth man 
was beaten by the soldiers and chased away, the 
population started running towards the bush. The 
SPLA opened fire on them, injuring another man. 
The bodies of two children, aged 5 and 6 (R. J. 
and O. L.), were found in the bush surrounding 
the village on 9 June 2008, as were the mortal 
remains of a woman suffering from epilepsy, 
Kelenga Obong, who probably did not survive the 
stress resulting from her flight. Iloli village was 
burned to the ground. Soldiers gathered the 
remaining Iloli and Logurony villagers, 
approximately one thousand persons, and brought 
them to the SPLA barracks in Ramshel. There 
they spent the remainder of the day under the 
trees. Women were reportedly beaten with sticks. </p>

In the evening of 4 June 2008 they were released, 
apparently on orders of the Torit County 
Commissioner. Twelve male villagers, five from 
Logurony and seven from Iloli, remained in SPLA 
detention until 7 June 2008 (one of them seven 
days longer). Some were allegedly held in a tukul, 
while others were kept in a hole in the ground. All 
were beaten on their head and stomach with gun 
barrels and other wooden and iron objects. Two 
Logurony detainees sustained severe head 
injuries, while another had whipping marks on his 
buttocks. These men did not report the ill-
treatment to the police as they feared re-arrest by 
the SPLA. On 10 June 2008, a young man from 
Hiyala was arrested on suspicion of involvement 
in the shooting that led to the death of SPLA 
soldiers. He was taken to the SPLA barracks and 
severely beaten. He was released following a 
meeting between the Hiyala Head Chief and the 
SPLA, and had to be taken to Hiyala Hospital for 
medical treatment. SPLA retaliation against the 
civilian population of Logurony, Iloli and Hiyala 
continued in the days following 4 June 2008. On 
6 June 2008, SPLA men shot at Hiyala villagers 
who were working in the field. A man and a 
woman were killed (Oronjo Safarino and Odiongo 
Salvatore), and another woman injured. On 
7 June 2008, Omudek Alajut, a man from Iloli, 
returned to the village, was apprehended by SPLA 
soldiers, tied up and executed on the spot. On

found shot dead near Hiyala village square. These 
events resulted in major displacement from Iloli 
and Logurony villages. Approximately 
2,800 inhabitants of Logurony and approximately 
1,500 of Iloli were displaced. Their dwellings 
were destroyed and they lacked the materials to 
rebuild them. Moreover, on 4 June 2008, the 
SPLA seized the cattle belonging to the Iloli and 
Logurony villages, on which the population relied 
for their livelihood. Additionally, SPLA soldiers 
destroyed or took away the solar panels operating 
the Iloli water boreholes. Government 
representatives from Eastern Equatoria State have 
visited the area and submitted reports to both the 
President and Vice-President of the Government 
of Southern Sudan. The Eastern Equatoria State 
authorities and the Ministry of SPLA Affairs have 
announced that a high-level Committee will be 
investigating the incidents.

<p>On 24 November 2008 at around noon, <b>Abdel 
Monim Elgak</b> and <b>Osman Ali Hummaida</b>, 
human rights defenders, were arrested by officers 
of the National Intelligence and Security Services 
(NISS) outside the offices of the Sudanese 
non-governmental organization SIHA in 
Khartoum 3. On the same day, <b>Amir Mohamed 
Suliman</b>, another human rights defender, was 
also arrested by NISS officers. All three men 
were taken to the political department of the NISS 
in Bahri (Khartoum North) for interrogation and 
were reportedly questioned on their human rights 
activities, in particular suspected cooperation with 
the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is 
currently investigating a request by the prosecutor 
for an arrest warrant against the Sudanese 
President on charges of war crimes, crimes 
against humanity and genocide. 
Messrs. Amir Mohamed Suliman and Abdel 
Monim Elgak were released without charge in the 
evening of 24 November and early hours of 
25 November respectively. On 25 November, 
Abdel Monim Elgak made a statement to a 
Sudanese online news outlet in which he 
criticized the arrests as a means to seek to 
intimidate Sudanese human rights defenders. That 
day, the NISS summoned him once more and 
detained him until the early hours of 
26 November. About two hours after his release

he was again arrested and detained until the early 
hours of the following day. Amir Mohamed 
Suliman and Abdel Monim Elgak were both 
summoned to return to the NISS office on 
27 November at 11 a.m. to hand over bags and 
computers which NISS officers said they needed 
to examine. Amir Mohamed Suliman turned in 
the equipment and was allowed to leave. 
Mr. Osman Ali Hummaida remained in detention 
without charge and without contact with the 
outside world until 1 a.m. on 28 November, at 
which point he was released without charge. The 
day after his arrest, members of his family 
brought clothes and medicine for his asthma and 
high blood pressure to the office of the NISS but 
were not allowed to see him. 
On 25 and 26 November, both Abdel Monim 
Elgak and Osman Ali Hummaida were reportedly 
subjected to different forms of torture and other 
ill-treatment in order to force them to hand over 
their computers and other belongings which the 
NISS officers sought to confiscate. They were 
asked repeatedly whether they had cooperated 
with the ICC prosecutor and told to disclose 
details of the information passed on to the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office. Abdel Monim Elgak was 
reportedly so severely beaten on various parts of 
his body, including his head, and subjected to 
other forms of ill-treatment that he required 
medical treatment following his release. In an

detained in different detention facilities of the 
NISS in Khartoum, blindfolded during transports

has no right of entry to Saudi Arabia. Mr. J. M. B. 
entered Sweden in August 2002 and sought 
asylum. He is a member of a political 
organisation and has participated in several 
demonstrations in Sweden against the policy of 
the Eritrean Government. It is believed that 
Mr. J. M. B. was being photographed by 
personnel of the Eritrean embassy in Stockholm

<p>Para. Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
that he has been liable for removal from Sweden. 
His appeal was dismissed on the grounds that by 
his own account he had never been to Eritrea. 
Hence he would be of no interest to the Eritreans 
authorities if deported and therefore his physical 
or mental integrity would not be at risk. In 2008, 
Swedish authorities have already attempted twice 
to deport Mr. J. M. B. to Eritrea. The deportation 
of 23 January 2008 failed since the pilot of the 
plane refused to take Mr. J. M. B. on board as he 
was protesting loudly for fear of being removed to 
Eritrea. On 13 February 2008 he was flown to 
Eritrea on a chartered flight, however, Eritrean 
authorities did not recognise his identity 
documents and refused entry. Mr. J. M. B. 
returned to Sweden the following day. Swedish 
authorities are at present trying to obtain the 
necessary documentation from the Eritrean 
embassy. Given these circumstances it is believed 
that Mr. J. M. B.&#8217;s removal from Sweden is 
imminent. The enforced removal attempt of 
13 February 2008 and especially his return to 
Sweden the next day featured prominently in the 
Swedish media, making him a public figure also 
well known to Eritrean authorities. A rule 39 
application before the European Court of 
Human Rights was rejected mid-February 2008 
and a complementary submission rejected on 
28 February 2008. The currently applicable 
advice from the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees to all 
Governments is to &#8220;refrain from all forced returns 
</p>
<p>punishment, torture or other inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. The 
correspondence between national legislation 
and article 3 of the Convention against Torture 
is emphasized as a result. 
If a residence permit cannot be awarded on 
other grounds, a permit may be granted to an 
alien if, on an overall assessment of the alien&#8217;s 
situation, circumstances so exceptionally 
distressing are found that he or she should be 
allowed to stay in Sweden. If an application 
for a residence permit is rejected, a 
refusal-of-entry or expulsion order shall be 
issued at the same time. When a question of 
refusal of entry or expulsion is examined, 
account shall be taken of whether the alien 
cannot be sent to a certain country. A refusal 
of entry and expulsion of an alien may thus 
never be enforced to a country where there is 
fair reason to assume that the alien would be in 
danger of suffering the death penalty or being 
subjected to corporal punishment, torture or 
other inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. Nor may it, in principle, be 
enforced if the alien risks being subjected to 
persecution in that country. 
If new circumstances come to light that mean 
that there is such an impediment to 
enforcement as described above, or there is 
reason to assume that the intended country of 
return will not be willing to accept the alien or </p>

Under the Aliens Act, an alien who has

shall be set aside immediately if there are no

A detention order made by a police authority

limitation to a certain period of time. A

be appealed to the Migration Court of Appeal,

prohibited in the Syrian Arab Republic under 
ordinary law, which was established in 1949 
and has been updated on a number of 
occasions to bring it into line with changes at 
the national and the international levels. 
Interviews with these persons confirmed that 
they had violated the regulations and laws in

were confirmed in writing in their confessions, 
during the police inquiry and also during the 
examination conducted by the investigating 
judge in the presence of their defence lawyers.

committed the offence of membership in an 
unauthorized association, the objectif of which 
is to alter the character of the State, and that 
they had issued a statement which aimed to 
incite sectarian and racial conflict and spread 
false information. They did so under the cover 
of disseminating democratic ideas, whereas in

back, &#8220;Father is dead.&#8221; The body was taken to

organizations, UN special agencies, as well as 
international humanitarian NGOs, on a 
case-by-case basis, in promoting and 
protecting these illegal immigrants&#8217; rights. On 
20 June 2008, a large number of Laotian 
Hmongs destroyed the fence encompassing 
their temporary shelter area in Petchaboon 
Province and walked out in protest, with the 
intent of travelling all the way to the UNHCR 
office in Bangkok. The Thai officials exercised 
the utmost restraint, and allowed the protesters 
to continue their walk. After long hours of 
negotiations between the Laotian Hmongs and 
the Thai side and after many hardcore 
protesters threatened other Laotian Hmongs </p>

not to return to the shelter area, most Laotian 
Hmongs realized that there was no use to 
continue protesting. At that time, the Thai side 
offered the protestors to return to the shelter 
area without any form of punishment; return to 
Laos and receive financial assistance for 
re-integration from the Thai Government as 
had been the case for prior groups of voluntary 
returnees; or acquiesce to being dealt with in 
accordance with Thai immigration law. More 
than 800 Laotian Hmongs chose to return to 
Laos. The rest chose to return to the temporary 
shelter. All clearly expressed the wish to return 
of their own accord after negotiations with the 
Thai officials proved that their demands could 
not be met. The Thai side thereafter facilitated 
their return in accordane with the Immigration 
Act in a dignified and humane manner. The 
formal return ceremony was attended by Thai 
and Laotian media and the entire process was 
witnessed by Thai diplomatic officials who 
served as additional witnesses to the 
transparency and smooth conduct of the entire 
return process. Such return on a large scale 
was impossible to be forcibly conducted, 
especially in front of so many witnesses and 
without physical means.

indicates that a further 391 Lao Hmong were 
returned to the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic 
from a camp in northern Thailand on 
11 July 2008, some of them against their will. We

Laotian Ministries of Foreign Affairs, but it 
was also covered by both the Thai and Laotian 
media, who were able to interview some 
Laotian Hmongs and take footage of the 
crossing into Laos and the handover ceremony. 
The Government has formally established a 
domestic status determination process or 
screening mechanism for the Laotian Hmongs. 
The process not only involves interviews at the 
local level, but also contains safeguards with 
further consideration at the national level. The 
return of the group of 391 Laotian Hmongs 
was undertaken in response to an expression of 
their wish to return home to Laos. That wish 
was expressed freely and without any form of 
coercion, prompting the Thai side to respond 
swiftly and accomodate their wish by 
facilitating their smooth return to Laos. The 
Thai authorities informed the Laotian Hmongs 
that they had the opportunity to change their 
minds at all times. Had any person decided not 
to return Laos that time, the Thai authorities 
would have accomodated that decision. 
Besides, all of them signed the affidavit 
document confirming their voluntary decision 
to return to Laos. In keeping with the Thai 
humanitarian tradition, each and every member 
of the group was screened and determined to 
be economic migran whose illegal entry into 
Thailand was in violation of Thai immigration 
laws. Therefore, in keeping with the sovereign </p>

<p>  <b>Sukri Ar-dam</b> (A/HRC/7/3/Add.1, para. 224) By letter dated 25/06/08, the Government 
informed that, on 14 April 2007, four days 
after the arrest of Mr. Sukri Ar-dam, his family 
members visited him at the Inkayuth army 
camp. Camp officials took him to the visiting 
area where his family was able to see him and 
talk to him via internal telephone. His family 
was thus assured that Mr. Sukri Ar-dam was 
actually detained in the camp and was still in 
normal condition. 
On 21 April 2007, his family revisited 
Mr. Sukri Ar-dam at the camp. His family 
believed that Mr. Sukri Ar-dam had been 
assaulted because he had a bruise on his upper 
lip. On 23 April 2007, his family lodged a 
complaint with the National Commission on 
Human Rights, following which a member of 
the Commission together with one medical 
doctor came to see Mr. Sukri Ar-dam at the 
camp and provided him with the services of a 
lawyer.  
On 6 May 2007, four days after Mr. Surki 
Ar-dam was transferred from the Inkayuth 
army camp to Kokpo District Police Station, </p>

the police undertook on inquiry before 
Mr. Sukri Ar-dam&#8217;s lawyer and his elder sister. 
During the inquiry, neither Mr. Sukri Ar-dam 
nor his family members availed themselves of 
the opportunity to lodge a complaint with the 
police concerning the alleged assault while 
being detained in the army camp. The 
inquiring officer did not also note any 
evidence of injury on Mr. Sukri Ar-dam. 
On 8 May 2007, Mr. Sukri Ar-dam was 
transferred to Pattani Provincial Penitentiary, 
where he underwent a physical examination, in 
accordance with the regulation of the 
Department of Corrections that every new 
detainee must be physically examined upon 
arrival. The technical nurse of the Pattani 
Provincial Penitentiary who conducted the 
physical examination of Mr. Sukri Ar-dam 
confirmed that he did not see any scars nor 
marks of severe injury on his body. No 
medical treatment was requested by 
Mr. Sukri Ar-dam at any stage. 
In the meantime, the National Commission on 
Human Rights continued to pursue the case on 
behalf of Mr. Sukri Ar-dam&#8217;s family, and a 
complaint was filed with the commander of 
Inkayuth army camp to investigate the alleged 
assault. In response to that complaint, the 
camp set up an investigation committee on 
14 May 2007. The committee found that a 
certain official did slap Mr. Sukri Ar-dam once </p>

on his mouth because he got into temper after 
being heavily insulted by the latter. That 
official was given a warning notice in response 
to his misconduct, which was in contravention 
of the established procedures, and was 
subsequently punished by being transferred out 
of the area. This disciplinary punishment 
represented the official accountability and 
awareness that the right of any person in 
detention must be equally respected without 
discrimination. It also reflected the camp&#8217;s 
adherence to its own rules and regulations that 
take into account the rights as well as cultural 
sensitivity of every detainee.  
The Royal Thai Government would like to 
emphasize that just treatment will continue to 
be accorded to Mr. Sukri Ar-dam who is now 
being detained in the Pattani Provincial 
Penitentiary. The Department of Corrections 
has issued an order to all provincial 
penitentiaries to place utmost importance to 
the right and welfare of every person in 
detention in compliance with human rights 
principles, the laws on correction, the 
United Nations minimum standards on the

concerns that have already been raised in the

(A/HRC/6/17/Add.3) regarding the jurisdiction 
and composition of the military commissions, the

penalty for certain offences, and shortcomings in 
securing a fair trial. On the issue of the use of 
evidence, we are concerned about allegations that 
some, or even all, of the six detainees have been 
subjected to highly abusive interrogation 
techniques that may have amounted to torture, or 
to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, equally 
prohibited under the non-derogable guarantees 
provided by article 7 of the ICCPR and under

reportedly other evidence contained in 
interrogation logs that may confirm that some, or 
perhaps all, of the six detainees were subjected to 
abusive interrogation techniques, including stress 
positions and sleep deprivation. The wording of 
the MCA allows testimony obtained through 
abusive interrogation techniques that were used 
prior to the Detainee Act of 2005 if such evidence 
is found to be &#8220;reliable&#8221; and its use &#8220;in the 
interests of justice&#8221;. This is contrary to the clear 
and well established principle of international law 
that excludes the use of evidence obtained by 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
for the purpose of trying and punishing a person. 
Concern is expressed for the use of evidence 
based on classified information and by the 
admission of hearsay evidence in proceedings 
before military commissions, in the form of a 
written summary of the evidence, if the military 
judges consider it to be &#8220;reliable&#8221; and 
&#8220;probative&#8221;. The admissibility of such evidence 
presents serious problems with regard to the right 
to fair trial since the accused is not secured the 
possibility of cross-examination of witnesses, as 
foreseen under article 14, paragraph 3 (e) of the 
ICCPR. If hearsay evidence was obtained through 
torture or coercion in respect of other persons and 
the interrogation techniques applied were 
themselves classified, the defendant would not 
know whether the evidence was obtained by such 
methods and therefore should be subject to a legal 
challenge. Against this background, strong </p>

regarding the six detainees on grounds of

governed by the MCA seriously undermine the

strapped onto an iron bed or chair with four or

without food, water, or bathroom breaks. A 
football helmet is put on their heads to keep them 
from beating their unrestrained heads in

Mr. <b>Coleman</b> was arrested on 4 October 2002 
and incarcerated on 24 February 2005. He went 
on hunger strike in late 2007. As a result, he has 
lost weight (he is currently underweight for a 
healthy adult with his body type). Consequently, 
on the basis of a broad temporary court order 
granted in early 2008, which permits intravenous 
and nasal-gastric feeding, he has been force-fed. 
Between 22 September and 22 October 2008, 
Mr. Coleman was force-fed intravenously 
approximately ten times. On 23 October, 
employees of the Connecticut Department of 
Corrections (CDOC), including medical staff, 
placed Mr. Coleman in an isolated area, where 
they locked him down in four-point restraints and 
inserted a nasogastric feeding tube into his nose 
and down his throat. 
With Mr. Coleman&#8217;s body weakened from a 
year-long hunger strike, the above described 
force-feeding procedure carries the following 
risks: major infection, pneumonia, or a collapsed 
lung. Immediately after the procedure, 
Mr. Coleman began sneezing up blood. He is

aftermath of recent elections</b>. Between 
29 March and 14 April 2008, 160 cases of injury 
resulting from organized violence and torture 
have been treated by various doctors with many 
of the patients still remaining in hospital. One 
third of the patients were women. A fifth of the 
victims were members of the opposition 
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and 
another 20% were involved in the elections for 
the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC). 
Nine patients sustained broken bones, typical of 
&#8220;defence injuries&#8221; resulting from the victim 
raising his or her hands and arms to protect the 
face and upper body from assault. This period 
saw at least two politically-motivated murders, 
15 abductions of women, and 288 cases of homes 
destroyed through politically-motivated arson 
leaving 175 families and 14 persons displaced. 
The majority of persons displaced are said to be 
women and children. About 70 MDC members 
have been arrested in the last few days. The 
above-described violence has been perpetrated by

<p>By letter dated 11/06/08, the Government 
responded that the President, the Cabinet of 
Ministers, Service Chiefs and various ruling 
party functionaries before, during and after the

repeatedly publicly declared their disapproval 
for violence and warned all 
would-be-perpetrators of the full consequences 
of the law. 
On the eve of the election, Police 
Commissioner General Augustine Chihuri, 
flanked by his fellow Service Chiefs, issued 
his most stern warning against violence. A 
copy of this statement has been provided to the 
Special Rapporteurs. This policy has been and 
continues to be enforced without 
discrimination, fear or favour. 
The Government also informed that all cases 
that have been reported to the police are the 
subject of investigations as part of the due 
processes of the law. In Zimbabwe, a report by

police officers, soldiers and members of the ruling 
Zanu PF party as part of a retributive and reprisal 
campaign mainly in rural areas, where people 
have voted for opposition candidates. In many 
instances victims were told that they were being 
victimized because they support the opposition; 
they were accused of &#8220;celebrating the MDC 
victory&#8221;, &#8220;of selling the country to the whites&#8221; 
and/or &#8220;of being responsible for the rigging of 
elections in favour of the MDC&#8221;. Reports also 
indicate that the authorities are targeting the 
independent local and foreign media, attempting 
to impede reporting on the current situation and 
the aftermath of the election, by resorting 
increasingly to police harassment and the arrest 
and detention of journalists. 
</p>
<p>crime having been committed or about to be 
committed is a critical step in launching this 
due process of the law. Once reported, the 
Zimbabwean Republic Police (ZRP) would 
then exercise its mandate to docket, investigate 
and bring suspects before the courts of law for 
prosecution and, ultimately, judgment. 
Where no report has been made to the police, 
as appears to be the case regarding the 
31 politically motivated murders claimed by 
the MDC-T as having occurred since 
29 March 2008, the Police would find it 
impossible to take the initial steps to launch 
the due process described above, bearing in 
mind that, according to Zimbabwean law, a 
person is presumed innocent until proven 
guilty. 
The eight murders officially attributed to the 
two sides fall far below the 31 claimed by 
MDC-T. It is impossible to verify the 
MDC-T&#8217;s claims, particularly because it 
appears to be complaining to the press before 
reporting them to the police. Even then, of the 
six murders allegedly committed by ZANU-PF 
supporters, subject to ongoing investigations, 
at least two do not seem to have been 
politically motivated. One of these was the 
case of Clemence Dube, who MDC-T&#8217;s 
Antony Chamisa claimed to have been 
murdered in Shurugwi by a ZANU-PF 
supporter on 27 April 2008. According to </p>

established facts, however, Dube died of 
immuno-suppression and tuberculosis at Mpilo 
Hospital, in Bulawayo, on 27 April 2008. 
Incidentally, on 11 April 2008, he had fought 
with a ZANU-PF supporter at a local township 
over money, but eye witnesses say the two 
later went their separate ways. 
In the other case, the alleged victim, a teacher 
in Muzarabani area, has turned out ta be alive. 
He has actually denounced the MDC-T for 
using his name to justify &#8220;dubious statistics&#8221;. 
It seems, from these two cases alone, that the 
MDC-T is fabricating and exaggerating its 
tally of victims in order to give substance to its 
claims that there is a raging civil war in 
Zimbabwe. Some of the alleged crimes in the 
MDC-T&#8217;s tally, such as politically motivated 
rape, are completely alien and unheard of in 
Zimbabwe&#8217;s political culture. However, every 
complaint received will be investigated and 
pursued to its logical conclusion, with all 
perpetrators facing the full wrath of the law. It 
has never been Government&#8217;s policy to support 
or condone violence or impunity. 
It is unfortunate that, quite to the contrary of 
the objective reality on the ground, all the 
&#8216;evidence&#8217; cited by the Rapporteurs paints the 
MDC-T as the victim and implicates 
ZANU-PF as the principal perpetrator of 
violence. During the &#8216;mass action&#8217; called by 
the MDC-T on 15 March 2008, marauding </p>

gangs of MDC-T DRCs (Democratic 
Restistance Committees) burnt to ashes one 
conventional 77-seater bus belonging to the 
Nyamweda Bus Company which was full of 
cross-border traders en route from Botswana, 
stoned another bus belonging to the 
state-owned Zimbabwe United Passenger 
Company (ZUPCO) and two private motor 
vehicles, and also committed a wide range of 
other crimes ranging from disrupting traffic 
through makeshift road blockades to attempted 
murder. Police arrested 76 activists who have 
all confessed to be hired members of the 
DRCs. 
As a result of the ongoing investigations 
pertaining to electoral fraud, close to 
100 arrests have been made. Five of these have 
already been convicted for contravening 
Section 87 of the Electoral Act Chapter 2: 13 
and sentenced to fines ranging between 
ZW$12 billion and ZW$30 billion. The 
remaining cases are either at various stages of 
investigation or before the courts. 
This is not victimization of &#8216;human rights 
defenders&#8217; as the MDC-T claims. No one is 
above the law in Zimbabwe. Where a crime is 
suspected to have been committed, the 
perpetrator will be brought to justice regardless 
of his or her race, colour, religion or political 
affiliation. This principle demands that the law

the &#8216;responsibility to protect&#8217; principle against 
Zimbabwe on the basis of the MDC-T&#8217;s litany 
of fabrications and exaggerations, it is equally 
important to understand that the Constitution 
of Zimbabwe demarcates the sovereign 
boundaries of responsibility within which the 
Government must protect its citizens. 
Regarding questions of compensation for 
alleged victims which are also raised in the 
communication, Government submits that the 
victims are receiving the usual basic assistance 
from the the Civil Protection Department and 
the resident humanitarian agencies in the 
country. However, contrary to the over 
5,000 &#8216;IDPs&#8217; that the MDC-T claims to have 
registered, the Government, with the support 
of non-partisan civil society, are attending to 
no more than 100 households comprising 
700 people. There are no new cases. Besides, it 
is still too early to start talking about long-term 
resettiement support at this stage when the 
problem is still being quantified, the victims 
screened and registered according to their 
needs.

(PTUZ). Both Mr. Matombo and Mr. Chibebe 
were the subjects of a previously transmitted 
communication (A/HRC/4/33/Add.1, para. 340). 
On 8 May 2008, Mr. Lovemore Motombo and 
Mr. Wellington Chibebe were both arrested 
allegedly in connection with May Day speeches, 
during which they spoke about the political crisis 
due to the postponement of the announcement of 
the election results, and the ensuing wave of 
violent intimidation of opposition supporters. 
They were charged with &#8220;inciting people to rise 
against the Government and reporting falsehoods 
about people being killed&#8221;. On 6 May, heavily 
armed police personnel had come to their homes 
to search them. On 7 May, they voluntarily 
reported to the police station, but were not taken 
in before 8 May 2008. They are currently held at 
the Harare Remand Prison. They have applied for 
release on bail, but the High Court of Zimbabwe 
will not deliver its judgment on this application 
until 19 May 2008. On 16 May 2008, 
Mr. Raymond Majongwe was arrested by the 
police at the High Court of Zimbabwe in Harare 
while he was attending the bail hearing of 
Mr. Lovemore Matombo and Mr. Wellington 
Chibebe. This arrest is allegedly in connection 
with the work of PTUZ in documenting the 
harassment of teachers at their workplace within 
the context of the current political violence in the 
country. 
</p>
<p>members of the Progressive Teachers 
Association of Zimbabwe (PTUZ). On 
19 February, PTUZ members went to ZANU 
PF Harare Provincial Headquarters whereupon 
they threw flyers within the party premises. 
The flyers contained abusive political 
messages and this did not go down well with 
the ZANU PF youths who were there. 
Subsequently a skirmish ensued between the 
youths and members of PTUZ led by 
Raymond Majongwe. The police got wind of 
the disturbances and, upon arrival at the party 
headquarters, arrested nine members of PTUZ 
and two ZANU PF youths. Observations made 
by the police during the time of arrest were 
that some of the members of PTUZ had 
sustained injuries as a result of the scuffle. All 
suspects were taken to the police station where 
the initial documentation was done and 
arrangements made for the injured to be taken 
to hospital. At no time were the suspects 
subjected to any form of ill-treatment. It was 
important for suspects to be taken to a 
government hospital first, to facilitate 
obtaining a medical report that would be 
acceptable in court, since the injuries were as a 
result of an assault that was subject to 
investigation. It is therefore not true that they 
were assaulted by unidentified youths. Two 
ZANU PF youths are facing assault charges. It 
is also not true that the injured were denied 
access to medical attention, as it is the police </p>

who ferried the suspects in a police vehicle to 
a government hospital. It is unfair to suggest 
that the delay in attending to the suspects at the 
hospital is attributable to the police. We do not 
run hospitals but police stations. We did our 
part by taking them to the hospital. In 
Zimbabwe most of our operation vehicles are 
pick-ups and to infer that we should have used 
a more comfortable vehicle is also misplaced. 
It is a blatant lie that the accused were released 
without any charge. All were discharged from 
the Avenues Clinic and appeared in court on 
5 March. Members of PTUZ were charged for 
contravening Chapter 46 of the Criminal 
Codification Reform Act Chapter 9.23, 
Criminal nuisance, and were released on 
50 million Zimbabwe dollars bail each, while 
the two youth were also released on the same 
bail conditions. The matter is still pending at 
court.
