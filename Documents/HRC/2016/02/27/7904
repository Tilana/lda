<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth session from 
21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Serbia was held at the 15th meeting on 30 
January 2013. The delegation of Serbia was headed by Gordana Stameni&#263;, State Secretary, 
Ministry of Justice and Public Administration. At its 17th meeting, held on 1 February 
2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Serbia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Serbia: Chile, Republic of Korea, and 
Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Serbia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/SRB/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b)

</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/SRB/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belarus, the Czech Republic, Iceland, 
Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Serbia through the troika. These questions 
are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since the first UPR cycle, Serbia had done much to implement received 
recommendations and to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. Serbia regularly submitted periodic reports to the United Nations treaty bodies. 
Currently, the preparation of the second periodic report under the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the 
second and third periodic report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) 
and the initial report under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance (CPED) was under way. The initial report under the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) had been submitted in mid-
</p><p>2012. 
</p>
<p>7. Serbia supported the activities of the United Nations and was open to cooperation 
with its special procedures, as evidenced by its standing invitation to all thematic 
procedures, issued on 11 October 2005. 
</p>
<p>8. In Serbia, human rights training was carried out by competent State institutions and 
relevant non-governmental organizations (NGOs). </p>


<p>9. A reform of the judiciary had been initiated in 2009, with a package of judicial laws 
establishing the High Judicial Council and State Prosecutorial Council as key authorities 
with competence and powers to appoint, nominate and dismiss judges, prosecutors and 
presidents of courts and ensure the efficient work of courts and public prosecutors&#8217; offices. 
The drafting of a national judicial reform strategy was under way, aimed at building and 
strengthening an independent, transparent and efficient judicial system. 
</p>
<p>10. Amendments to the Criminal Code had allowed the harmonization of national 
legislation with recommendations of the Council of Europe Group of States against 
Corruption; defamation had been decriminalized; and the ban on unauthorized public 
comments on court proceedings had been lifted. 
</p>
<p>11. Criminal legislation did not include &#8220;hate crime&#8221; as a separate criminal offence, but 
it did include a number of other offences that indirectly related to such offence. 
Amendments to the Criminal Code in 2012 provided that, when a criminal offence was 
committed on the grounds of the victim&#8217;s race or religion, national or ethnic affiliation, 
particular gender, sexual orientation or gender identity, the court was to consider it as an 
obligatory aggravating circumstance, relevant for determining the sanction, whenever it 
was not stipulated as a distinctive feature of a criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>12. The Strategy for Reducing Overcrowding in Institutions for Enforcement of Penal 
Sanctions (2010-2015) and its related Plan of Action had been adopted. Independent 
inspection of prison conditions was performed by the Ombudsman, the Parliamentary 
Commission Monitoring the Enforcement of Penal Sanctions, and NGOs.  
</p>
<p>13. To address issues relating to persons without documents, Serbia had adopted the 
Law on Civil Registers (2009) and the Law on Permanent and Temporary Residence (2011) 
and had made amendments to the Law on Non-Contentious Procedures (2012). 
</p>
<p>14. An inclusive system of mandatory health insurance was being developed for all 
citizens, including marginalized categories, funded from the State budget. 
</p>
<p>15. The Law on Prohibition of Discrimination (2009) banned a wide range of forms of 
discrimination and established the office of the Commissioner for Protection of Equality, 
operational since 2010, with 18 employees. 
</p>
<p>16. The Law on Gender Equality (2009) defined in more detail the ban on gender-based 
discrimination and rights of both genders in employment, social and health care, family 
relations, political and public life, education, culture, sports and judicial protection. The 
National Strategy for the Advancement of Women and the Promotion of Gender Equality 
and the related Plan of Action had been adopted, covering six key areas relating to the 
advancement of women and the promotion of gender equality. The implementation of the 
equal-opportunity policy had resulted in equal pay for equal work for both genders and the 
increased presence of women in State administration bodies, the judiciary and in the most 
important and responsible positions of the State. Women had served as the Speaker of the 
National Assembly (2008-2012); President of the Supreme Court of Cassation (2005-2009, 
2009-2010, 2010-2013), known as the Supreme Court until 2010; President of the 
Constitutional Court (2007-2011), and Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Serbia (since 
2008). 
</p>
<p>17. The National Strategy to Prevent and Combat Violence against Women in the 
Family and in Intimate Partner Relationships had been adopted. The special protocol of the 
Ministry of Health for the protection and treatment of women exposed to violence had been 
in force since 2010. The General Protocol on Conduct and Cooperation of Institutions, 
Bodies and Organizations in Cases of Violence against Women in the Family and in 
Intimate Partner Relationships had been adopted (2011), establishing cooperation among 
relevant bodies. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/15/ 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>18. The education system did not allow differences in the education of children with 
development difficulties and disabilities or of other children. An inclusive education 
concept had been developed; the Law on the Fundamental Principles of Education and 
Upbringing gave persons with development difficulties and disabilities, regardless of their 
material conditions, the opportunity to access all levels of education in institutions. On 
average, 120 students with disabilities were granted scholarships each year.  
</p>
<p>19. The Law on Professional Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with 
Disabilities (2009) had introduced, for any employer having at least 20 employees, the 
obligation to employ persons with disabilities. The procedure for the adoption of the Law 
on Social Entrepreneurship and Employment at Social Enterprises had also been initiated.  
</p>
<p>20. The Law on Planning and Construction (2009) stipulated that public and business 
premises must be accessible by persons with disabilities, children and the elderly. 
</p>
<p>21. The National Councils of National Minorities were an organizational form of 
minority self-government and constitutional category. The Law on National Councils of 
National Minorities transferred to those institutions several State competences concerning 
official use of language and script, education, information and culture. The Law facilitated, 
for the first time, the direct election of members of national councils for 16 national 
minorities. Three national minorities elected their national councils through an electoral 
assembly; the Executive Board of the Federation of the Jewish Communities performed 
functions of a national council pursuant to the Law; and Albanian, Czech, Ashkali and 
Slovene national councils had been elected for the first time. Funds for national councils 
were provided from State, provincial and local self-government budgets; the State budget 
had allocated &#8364;2.2 million for 2012 and &#8364;2.3 million for 2013. 
</p>
<p>22. The Government had established the Council for Advancement of Roma (2008), the 
Strategy for the Advancement of the Status of Roma (2009) and the related Plan of Action 
(2010) covering 13 key areas. Under the Law on the Fundamental Principles of Education 
and Upbringing and the Law on Students&#8217; and Pupils&#8217; Standard, affirmative action for 
Roma pupils and students was being implemented in the areas of enrolment, the granting of 
scholarships, and loan advancement, including free and compulsory pre-primary education 
and the introduction of pedagogical assistants. The percentage of Roma enrolled in 
secondary schools had risen from 8.3 per cent in 2004 to almost 20 per cent in 2010. 
Affirmative action also applied to the enrolment of Roma applicants at universities. The 
National Employment Strategy (2011-2020) referred to the upgrading of human capital and 
greater social inclusion of socially excluded individuals and groups, including Roma. The 
National Employment Plan of Action for 2013 defined them as less employable persons. 
The National Strategy on Social Housing (2012) envisaged special measures related to 
informal Roma settlements. The City of Belgrade, together with international donors, had 
introduced a social housing programme mostly targeting Roma; the programme was under 
way and funds needed to be secured. 
</p>
<p>23. The anti-discrimination law and the Labour Law explicitly prohibited discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. The conference on combating discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity (2012) was the first conference organized by the State on 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues. 
</p>
<p>24. Amendments to the Criminal Code (2009) had introduced stricter penalties for 
human trafficking, especially when committed against minors. The new Strategy for the 
Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking (2013&#8211;2018) and the related Plan of 
Action (2013&#8211;2014) had been prepared. Assistance to victims of trafficking was provided 
by State institutions and NGOs. In 2012 the Government had established the Centre for the 
Protection of Victims of Trafficking. As part of the social welfare system, victims of 
trafficking were afforded a variety of assistance. </p>


<p>25. There were problems concerning human rights in the territory of the southern 
Serbian Province of Kosovo and Metohija, administered by the United Nations since June 
1999 under Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). Serbia had been unable to implement 
international treaties in the field of human rights protection in that part of its territory. 
</p>
<p>26. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) forced to leave their homes in Kosovo and 
Metohija could not sustainably return in line with the criteria recommended in the 
Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons. Even 12 years later, 
IDPs had no access to their property or effective protection of their ownership rights before 
local courts, which were prerequisites for sustainable return. Returnee communities lacked 
access to basic services, an education system and employment, which made return, already 
negligible, unsustainable. 
</p>
<p>27. Between 2008, when the Law on Asylum entered into force, and 2012, the number 
of asylum seekers had increased from 77 to 2,732. They were given lodging, clothing, free 
legal aid, psychosocial support, and interpretation services. Unaccompanied minors seeking 
asylum were given special care and appointed a guardian by a competent social centre. A 
new criminal offence had been introduced: &#8220;enabling the abuse of the enjoyment of the 
right of asylum in foreign State&#8221; in order to reduce the number of fake asylum seekers. 
</p>
<p>28. The Strategy for the Reintegration of Returnees under Readmission Agreements 
(2009) set as priorities: personal identity documents, accommodation issues, job 
opportunities and access to health care, education, social care and family legal protection. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>
<p>41. Lithuania shared the concern of the Human Rights Council on existing stereotypes 
of women in society, including women belonging to minority groups. It invited Serbia to 
focus on non-discrimination of national minorities throughout the country, possibly through 
direct dialogue on the issue. Lithuania made recommendations. 
</p>

the Palermo Protocol. It made recommendations. 
</p>

Persons. 
</p>
<p>61. Sweden noted a strengthened anti-discrimination legal framework, but remained

service and the judiciary. Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Serbia informed the Working Group that the plan of action for the Roma strategy 
would be adopted within a few months. 
</p>
<p>63. A working group comprising members of competent bodies and NGOs had handled 
the displacement of the informal Roma settlement in Belgrade Block 72. The working 
group had been monitored by the Ombudsman. The displacement had been carried out in 
accordance with the basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and 
displacements, created by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of 
the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this 
context. All families had been provided with alternative accommodation. 
</p>
<p>64. New legislation on legally invisible persons brought improvements regarding the 
exercise of the right to birth registration. It also governed the court procedure for 
determination of the date and place of birth of unregistered persons. Those persons were 
exempt from all taxes and costs of expertise were paid from the court&#8217;s funds. 
</p>
<p>65. Serbia had been implementing a number of programmes aimed at the improvement 
of living conditions of IDPs, addressing primarily housing problems and economic 
empowerment projects. IDPs who decided to return to the Serbian Province of Kosovo 
were supported with returnee packages. Legal aid projects were also financed, in the form 
of assistance in obtaining personal identity documents and in representation before Kosovo 
courts. A number of IDP associations were financed from the State budget. 
</p>
<p>66. Political will for combating corruption did not mean that the executive and political 
authorities conducted arrests. Executive authorities created conditions for law enforcement 
agencies and judiciary so that they could prosecute the perpetrators of criminal offences. 
Executive authorities had no power to influence the courts with respect to detention and the 
conduct of the concrete proceedings. </p>


<p>67. The fight against corruption entailed the legal obligation to submit to the Anti-
Corruption Agency reports on the property of public officials; those reports had been 
published on the Agency website. Public administration bodies and judicial authorities 
prepared integrity plans. 
</p>
<p>68. In accordance with the latest legislative amendments, endangering the safety of 
journalists in the performance of their profession was considered as serious an offense as 
endangering State officials, such as, for example, the President of the Republic, the Prime 
Minister, judges and public prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>69. Competent authorities had taken action aimed at identifying the perpetrators of three 
unsolved murders of journalists. The Government had established a commission tasked 
with preparing an opinion on effective ways to improve the investigation. 
</p>
<p>70. Criminal proceedings had been initiated against members of extremist groups, and 
the Constitutional Court conducted proceedings to prohibit the operation of associations 
that violated guaranteed human and minority rights and spread hatred, which was also a 
form of protection of human rights defenders. The deletion of such associations from the 
register was mandatory. All proceedings in such matters were urgent <i>ex lege</i>. 
</p>
<p>71. National Councils were elected and constituted in accordance with the Law on 
National Councils of National Minorities (2009), except for the Bosniak National Council. 
The latter had not been constituted after the elections, but its work had been continued by 
the members who had been elected in 2003, pursuant to the transitional provision of the 
Law. The State continued to finance the work of the Bosniak National Council. The plan 
for the current year was to make amendments to the Law that would eliminate the observed 
deficiencies. 
</p>
<p>72. Social care institutions, in cooperation with other stakeholders in the protection of 
victims of human trafficking, fulfilled their duties under the Council of Europe Convention 
on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. Activities were ongoing to put in operation 
a special facility with the first emergency reception ward for victims of trafficking, as a 
special unit of the Centre for the Protection of Victims of Trafficking. Over 170 employees 
at social-work centres had completed training on the protection of victims of human 
trafficking in 2011-2012. 
</p>
<p>73. Competent State institutions had programmes for the perpetrators of domestic 
violence and sexual and gender-based violence who were currently serving sentences. 
Seminars for prosecutors on treatment of perpetrators of domestic violence and violence in 
intimate partner relationships were also organized. 
</p>
<p>74. Centres for social work were required to provide 24-hour emergency intervention 
services, directly and in cooperation with other services and agencies in the local 
community, and where it was necessary to protect the life, health and safety of children, 
adults or the elderly. The operating model used at the social-work centres was case 
management, and victims of violence were also referred to services provided in the 
community. 
</p>
<p>75. In 2013 Serbia planned to take steps envisaged by the law to ratify the Council of 
Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic 
violence. 
</p>
<p>76. The legislative framework for promotion and protection of the rights of the child had 
been completed and several laws related to the rights of child had been passed, namely, on 
social protection, education, health care, justice, policing and other relevant services. A law 
on the rights of the child was being drafted. The National Assembly Committee on the 
Rights of the Child was tasked with verifying compliance of national legislation with 
international standards on the rights of the child. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/15/ 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11
