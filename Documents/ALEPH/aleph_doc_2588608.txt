NOW INC.
Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Organization and Basis of Presentation
Nature of Operations
NOW Inc. (“NOW” or the “Company”) is a holding company headquartered in Houston, Texas that
was incorporated in Delaware on November 22, 2013. NOW operates primarily under the
DistributionNOW and Wilson Export brands. NOW is a global distributor of energy products as
well as products for industrial applications through its locations in the U.S., Canada and
internationally which are geographically positioned to serve the energy and industrial markets in
over 90 countries. NOW’s energy product offerings are used in the oil and gas industry including
upstream drilling and completion, exploration and production, midstream infrastructure
development and downstream petroleum refining – as well as in other industries, such as
chemical processing, power generation and industrial manufacturing operations. The industrial
distribution portion of NOW’s business targets a diverse range of manufacturing and facilities
across numerous industries and end markets. NOW also provides supply chain management to
drilling contractors, E&P operators, midstream operators, downstream energy and industrial
manufacturing companies. NOW’s supplier network consists of thousands of vendors in
approximately 40 countries.
Basis of Presentation
All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The unaudited
consolidated financial information included in this report has been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. The principles for interim financial information
do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company’s most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring
nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The results of
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.
The Separation
On May 1, 2014, the National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (“NOV”) Board of Directors approved the Spin-
Off (the “Spin-Off” or “Separation”) of its distribution business into an independent, publicly traded
company named NOW Inc. In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement, the two
companies were separated by NOV distributing to its stockholders 107,053,031 shares of
common stock of the Company after the market closed on May 30, 2014. Each NOV stockholder
received one share of NOW common stock for every four shares of NOV common stock held at
the close of business on the record date of May 22, 2014 and not sold prior to close of business
on May 30, 2014. Fractional shares of NOW common stock were not distributed and any
fractional shares of NOW common stock otherwise issuable to a NOV stockholder were sold in
the open market on such stockholder’s behalf, and such stockholder received a cash payment
with respect to that fractional share. In conjunction with the Spin-Off, NOV received an opinion
from its legal counsel to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and
undertakings, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution of NOW common stock and
certain related transactions generally was not taxable to NOV or U.S. holders of NOV common
stock, except in respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares, which generally will be
taxable to such holders as a capital gain. Following the Spin-Off, NOW became an independent,
publicly traded company as NOV had no ownership interest in NOW. Each company has
separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. A Registration Statement on
Form 10, as amended, relating to the Spin-Off was filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and was declared effective on May 13, 2014. On June 2,
2014, NOW stock began trading the “regular-way” on the New York Stock Exchange under the
ticker symbol “DNOW”.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported and contingent amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
7
Reclassification
Certain amounts in the prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current
period financial statement presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on previously
reported operating loss, loss before income taxes or net loss.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximated fair
value because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Cash equivalents include only
those investments having a maturity date of three months or less at the time of purchase. See
Note 12 “Derivative Financial Instruments” for the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard
Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606. ASU 2014-09
affects any entity using GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or
services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are
within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). This ASU will
supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most
industry-specific guidance. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or
loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets
within the scope of Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets within the
scope of Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the
guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in this ASU.
The ASU provides two transition methods: (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period
presented or (ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this ASU
recognized at the date of initial application. The amendments in this ASU were originally set up
to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods within that reporting period. In August 2015, FASB proposed the effective date to be the
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. Early
application is permitted as early as the original effective date. In May 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers in Topic 606: Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients, which clarifies implementation guidance on assessing
collectability, presentation of sales tax, noncash consideration and completed contracts and
contract modifications at transition. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
Under ASU 2015-11, inventory will be measured at the “lower of cost and net realizable value.”
ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as the “estimated selling prices in the ordinary course
of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.” ASU
2015-11 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
application is permitted and should be applied prospectively. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases: Topic 842.  ASU 2016-02
requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-to-use asset for all leases, including
operating leases, with a term greater than twelve months on its balance sheet.  ASU 2016-02 is
effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with
early adoption permitted, and requires a modified retrospective transition method. The Company
is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory
tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-
09 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-09
on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which
replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that
reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and
supportable information to determine credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 requires entities to
measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on
historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Entities will
now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates.  This ASU is
effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with
early adoption permitted as of December 15, 2018, and requires modified retrospective transition
method. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated
financial statements.

On January 20, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its credit
facility dated as of April 18, 2014 (the “Credit Agreement”). The Amendment, among other things,
(i) suspends, until the Company elects otherwise, the Credit Agreement’s minimum interest
coverage ratio effective as of December 30, 2015, (ii) adds a minimum asset coverage ratio (as
defined in the Credit Agreement), which requires that the ratio of the value of the Company’s
eligible assets to the amount of its outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement is no less
than 1.50 to 1.00, (iii) reduces the maximum capitalization ratio (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) from 50% to 45%, and (iv) increases the applicable interest margin on current
borrowings by 75 basis points and the current commitment fee by 5 basis points. In connection
with the Amendment, the Company also entered into a Security Agreement dated as of January
20, 2016 (the “Security Agreement”) pursuant to which it granted the lenders under the Credit
Agreement customary security interests in substantially all of the Company’s U.S. assets and in
approximately 65% of the equity interests of the Company’s first-tier foreign subsidiaries. As of
June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility.
Total commitments under the amended credit facility remain at $750 million (provided that
borrowings above 75% of such commitments are conditioned upon compliance with a minimum
fixed charge ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement)). The amended credit facility continues to
include the $250 million accordion feature and still expires on April 18, 2019.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had borrowed $180 million against its senior secured
revolving credit facility. The Company was not obligated to pay back the borrowing against the
senior secured revolving credit facility until the expiration date of April 18, 2019.

The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. A majority of the Company’s international
entities in which there is a substantial investment have the local currency as their functional
currency. As a result, foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the process of
translating the entities’ financial statements into the reporting currency are reported in other
comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with ASC Topic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters”

In connection with the Separation, the Company and NOV entered into a Tax Matters Agreement,
dated as of May 29, 2014 (the “Tax Matters Agreement”).  The Tax Matters Agreement sets forth
the Company and NOV’s rights and obligations related to the allocation of federal, state, local
and foreign taxes for periods before and after the Spin-Off, as well as taxes attributable to the
Spin-Off, and related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of IRS and other
audits.  Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, NOV has prepared and filed the consolidated
federal income tax return, and any other tax returns that include both NOV and the Company for
all the liability periods ended on or prior to May 30, 2014.  The income tax provision (benefit) for
periods prior to the Separation has been computed as if NOW were a stand-alone
company.  NOV will indemnify and hold harmless the Company for any income tax liability for
periods before the Separation date.  The Company will prepare and file all tax returns that
include solely the Company for all taxable periods ending after that date.  Settlements of tax
payments between NOV and the Company were generally treated as contributions from or
distributions to NOV in periods prior to the Separation date.
10
The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was 26.3% and 15.1%,
compared to 33.9% and 29.7% for the same periods in 2015. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate,
the effective tax rate was impacted by recurring items, such as lower tax rates on income earned
in foreign jurisdictions that is permanently reinvested, offset by nondeductible expenses, state
income taxes and the change in valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Due
to the continuing uncertainty in our industry and thus our outlook, the Company has adopted the
method of recording income taxes on a year-to-date effective tax rate for the six months ended
June 30, 2016. The Company will evaluate its use of this method each quarter until such time as
a return to the annualized estimated effective tax rate method is deemed appropriate.
Effective December 31, 2015, the Company early adopted, on a prospective basis, FASB ASU
No. 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”.  This ASU requires all deferred
tax assets and liabilities to be reported as noncurrent.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company acquired Power Service (see Note 13
“Acquisitions”) and recorded a deferred tax liability of $19 million related to basis differences
between U.S. GAAP and U.S. Tax associated with the acquisition and step-up to fair value of
certain assets, primarily intangible assets.  The step up in basis resulted in higher future taxable
temporary differences and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance recorded
against deferred tax assets in the U.S.  At the Company’s discretion, the Company has the option
to make a future election under Internal Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10) to treat the Power
Service acquisition as an asset acquisition for U.S. tax purposes.  The Company is continuing to
assess market conditions and is working with the former shareholders of Power Service to
determine the feasibility of making the election.  If the Company ultimately decides to make the
election, its tax basis in the intangibles will be stepped-up to fair value and, as a result, the
Company’s deferred tax balance would change.  At that time, the Company will reassess the
need for a valuation allowance and reflect the tax implications in any period of change.
To the extent penalties and interest would be assessed on any underpayment of income tax,
such accrued amounts have been classified as a component of income tax provision (benefit) in
the financial statements consistent with the Company’s policy.
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various states and foreign jurisdictions.
The Company has significant operations in the United States, Canada and, to a lesser extent, in
various other international jurisdictions. Tax years that remain subject to examination by major
tax jurisdictions vary by legal entity, but are generally open in the U.S. for the tax years ending
after 2012 and outside the U.S. for the tax years ending after 2010. The Company is indemnified
for any income tax exposures related to the periods prior to the Separation.

8. Loss Per Share (“EPS”)
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, 7,412,133 and 7,181,595, respectively, of
potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share due to
the Company recognizing a net loss for the period, compared to 6,566,619 for the corresponding
periods of 2015.

(1)ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share” (“ASC Topic 260”) requires companies with unvested participating securities
to utilize a two-class method for the computation of net income attributable to the Company per share. The two-
class method requires a portion of net income attributable to the Company to be allocated to participating
securities, which are unvested awards of share-based payments with non-forfeitable rights to receive dividends or
dividend equivalents, if declared. Net losses are not allocated to nonvested shares in periods that the Company
determines that those shares are not obligated to participate in losses. For periods in which the Company
recognizes net income, net income attributable to the Company allocated to these participating securities was
excluded from net income attributable to the Company’s stockholders in the numerator of the earnings per share
computation.
9. Stock-based Compensation and Outstanding Awards
The Company has a stock-based compensation plan known as the NOW Inc. Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Under the Plan, the Company’s employees are eligible to be granted
stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance
stock awards (“PSAs”).
For the six months ended on June 30, 2016, the Company granted 952,200 stock options with a
weighted average fair value of $5.23 per share and 285,446 shares of RSAs and RSUs with a
weighted average fair value of $14.53 per share. In addition, the Company granted PSAs to
senior management employees with potential payouts varying from zero to 318,722 shares.
These options vest over a three-year period from the grant date on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-
substance, multiple awards. The RSAs and RSUs vest on the first and the third anniversary of
the date of grant. The PSAs can be earned based on performance against established metrics
over a three-year performance period. The PSAs are divided into three equal, independent parts
that are subject to three separate performance metrics: (i) one-third of the PSAs have a Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) metric, (ii) one-third of the PSAs have an EBITDA metric, and (iii) one-
third of the PSAs have a Working Capital (WC) metric.
Performance against the TSR metric is determined by comparing the performance of the
Company’s TSR with the TSR performance of designated peer companies for the three year
performance period. Performance against the EBITDA metric is determined by comparing the
performance of the Company’s actual EBITDA average for each of the three-years of the
performance period against the EBITDA metrics set by the Company’s Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors. Performance against the WC metric
12
is determined by comparing the performance of the Company’s actual WC average for each of
the three-years of the performance period against the WC metrics set by the Company’s
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Stock-based compensation expense totaled $6 million and $12 million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $6 million and $13 million for the same periods
in 2015, respectively.
10. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is involved in various claims, regulatory agency audits and pending or threatened
legal actions involving a variety of matters. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has recorded an
immaterial amount for contingent liabilities representing all contingencies believed to be
probable. The Company has also assessed the potential for additional losses above the amounts
accrued as well as potential losses for matters that are not probable, but are reasonably possible.
The total potential loss on these matters cannot be determined; however, in the Company’s
opinion, any ultimate liability, to the extent not otherwise recorded or accrued for, will not
materially affect the Company’s financial position, cash flow or results of operations. These
estimated liabilities are based on the Company’s assessment of the nature of these matters, their
progress toward resolution, the advice of legal counsel and outside experts as well as
management’s intention and experience.
The Company’s business is affected both directly and indirectly by governmental laws and
regulations relating to the oilfield service industry in general, as well as by environmental and
safety regulations that specifically apply to the Company’s business. Although the Company has
not incurred material costs in connection with its compliance with such laws, there can be no
assurance that other developments, such as new environmental laws, regulations and
enforcement policies hereunder may not result in additional, presently unquantifiable, costs or
liabilities to the Company.
The Company does not accrue for contingent losses that, in its judgment, are considered to be
reasonably possible, but not probable. Estimating reasonably possible losses also requires the
analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often depend on judgments about potential actions
by third parties. NOW’s management currently estimates a range of loss for reasonably possible
losses for which an estimate can be made is between zero and $18 million in the international
segment primarily attributable to accounts receivable with one customer. The Company has
accrued its best estimate for loss as of June 30, 2016. Factors underlying this estimated range of
loss may change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate.
In connection with one of the Company’s acquisitions in 2015, the Company agreed to make
contingent consideration payments of up to $6 million upon the attainment of certain profitability
milestones through February 2018. As of June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the
contingent consideration of less than $1 million is included in other long-term liabilities.
The Company maintains credit arrangements with several banks providing for short-term
borrowing capacity, overdraft protection and other bonding requirements. As of June 30, 2016,
these credit arrangements totaled approximately $51 million, of which the Company was
contingently liable for approximately $11 million of outstanding standby letters of credit, including
bid and performance related bonds and surety bonds. The Company does not believe, based on
historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
be required to be paid.
11. Related Party Transactions
In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company and NOV entered into a Separation and
Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, and Transition
Service Agreement each dated May 29, 2014.
The Separation and Distribution Agreement contains the key provisions related to the separation
from NOV and the distribution of the Company’s common stock to NOV shareholders. The
Separation and Distribution Agreement separated the assets related to the Company’s business
from NOV, along with liabilities related to such assets, which now reside with the Company. In
general, the Company agrees to indemnify NOV from liabilities arising from the Company’s
business and assets, and NOV agrees to indemnify the Company from liabilities arising from
NOV’s business and assets (that remained with NOV), except as otherwise provided in such
agreement.
The Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of
each party with respect to taxes and tax benefits, the filing of tax returns, the control of audits,
restrictions to preserve the tax-free status of the Spin-Off and other tax matters.
The Employee Matters Agreement governs the Company and NOV’s compensation and
employee benefit obligations with respect to current and former employees of each company,
and generally allocates liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee
13
compensation and benefit plans and programs. Such agreement also provides the adjustment
mechanisms to be applied as a result of the Spin-Off to convert outstanding NOV equity awards
held by Company employees to Company awards.
12. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary
risk managed by using derivative instruments is foreign currency exchange rate risk. The
Company has entered into certain financial derivative instruments to manage this risk.
The derivative financial instruments the Company has entered into are forward exchange
contracts which have terms of less than one year to economically hedge foreign currency
exchange rate risk on recognized nonfunctional currency monetary accounts. The purpose of the
Company’s foreign currency economic hedging activities is to economically hedge the
Company’s risk from changes in the fair value of non-functional currency denominated monetary
accounts.
The Company records all derivative financial instruments at their fair value in its consolidated
balance sheets. None of the derivative financial instruments that the Company holds are
designated as either a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge and the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recorded in earnings. The Company has determined that the fair value of its
derivative financial instruments are computed using level 2 inputs (inputs other than quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or
indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability) in the fair value hierarchy as the fair
value is based on publicly available foreign exchange rates at each financial reporting date.  As
of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Company’s foreign currency
forward contracts totaled an asset of $6 million and less than $3 million, respectively, and is
included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and a liability
of less than $1 million and less than $2 million, respectively, and is included in other current
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded gains of
approximately $6 million and $5 million, respectively, related to the changes in fair value. For the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded losses of
approximately $5 million and $6 million, respectively, related to changes in fair value. All gains
and losses recorded are included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations. The notional principal associated with those contracts as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 was $87 million and $187 million, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s financial instruments do not contain any credit-risk-related
or other contingent features that could cause accelerated payments when the Company’s
financial instruments are in net liability positions. The Company does not use derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
13. Acquisitions
On June 1, 2016, the Company acquired Power Service, Inc., Industrial Tool & Repair, Inc. and
Power Transportation LLC (collectively, “Power Service”) for a purchase price consideration of
$176 million. The purchase price was comprised of $182 million of cash paid and $6 million of
working capital adjustments. Power Service is known as a premier one-stop shop for
modularized well hook-ups. This acquisition primarily expands NOW’s market in the Western
United States. The Company has included the financial results of the acquisition in its
consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.
The Company completed its preliminary valuations as of the applicable acquisition date of the
acquired net assets and recognized goodwill of $130 million and intangible assets of $46 million
which is subject to change. If additional information is obtained about these assets and liabilities
within the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition), including
through asset appraisals and learning more about the newly acquired businesses, the Company
will refine its estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price more accurately; any such
revisions are not expected to be significant.
With the completion of the Power Service acquisition and the related changes in the
management structure, the Company established a new reporting unit, U.S. Process Solutions,
under the United States reportable segment.  The U.S. Process Solutions reporting unit primarily
consists of the Power Service business and the Odessa Pumps business (formerly a U.S. Energy
component with zero goodwill value). The U.S. Process Solutions reporting unit has a goodwill
balance of $130 million, as a result of the fair value measurement of the net assets acquired in
the Power Service acquisition. A qualitative assessment of the carrying value of goodwill was
performed, which included evaluation of factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and
market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and reporting unit factors, among
others.  The Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of this
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
14
The Purchase Agreement with Power Service contains non-compete agreements with certain
employees. The Company identified these agreements as a separate transaction and recognized
a non-compete intangible asset of $7 million with a 2-year life. Amortization expense recognized
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was less than $1 million.
The Company has not presented supplemental pro forma information because the acquired
operations would not have materially impacted the Company’s consolidated operating results.

Goodwill includes the expected benefits that the Company believes will result from combining its operations with
those of businesses acquired. An immaterial amount of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for
income tax purposes.
In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into leases with the former owner
primarily for premises utilized by the acquired entities in the performance of their operations. Most
of these leases are renewable at our option and contain clauses for payment of real estate taxes,
maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses of the properties. Rent expense
attributable to the related party was less than $1 million for the three months and six months
ended June 30, 2016.

Forward-Looking Statements
Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward-
looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Statements that are not
historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as “may,”
“believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “plan,” “predict,” “estimate,” “will be” or other similar words and
phrases, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. You should be
aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking
statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in oil and gas prices,
changes in the energy markets, customer demand for our products, significant changes in the
size of our customers, difficulties encountered in integrating mergers and acquisitions, general
volatility in the capital markets, changes in applicable government regulations, the inability to
realize the benefits of the Spin-Off, increased borrowing costs, competition between us and our
former parent company, NOV, unfavorable reactions from our employees, the triggering of rights
and obligations by the Spin-Off or any litigation arising out of or related to the Separation,
impairments in goodwill or other intangible assets and worldwide economic activity. You should
also consider carefully the statements under “Risk Factors,” as disclosed in our Form 10-K, which
address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are

Company Overview
We are a global distributor to the oil and gas and industrial markets with a legacy of over one-
hundred and fifty years. We operate primarily under the DistributionNOW and Wilson Export
brands. Through our network of over 300 locations and approximately 4,600 employees
worldwide, we stock and sell a comprehensive offering of energy products as well as an
extensive selection of products for industrial applications. Our energy product offering is required
throughout all sectors of the oil and gas industry – from upstream drilling and completion,
exploration and production (“E&P”), midstream infrastructure development to downstream
petroleum refining – as well as in other industries, such as chemical processing, utilities and
industrial manufacturing operations. The industrial distribution portion of our business targets a
diverse range of end markets, including manufacturing, engineering and construction and
refineries. We also provide supply chain management to drilling contractors, E&P operators,
midstream operators and downstream energy and industrial manufacturing companies around
the world.
Our global product offering includes consumable maintenance, repair and operating (“MRO”)
supplies, pipe, valves, fittings, flanges, electrical, artificial lift solutions, pumps, mill tools, safety
supplies and spare parts to support customers’ operations. We provide a one-stop shop value
proposition within the energy market and particularly in targeted areas of artificial lift, pumping
solutions, measurement and controls and valve actuation. We also offer warehouse and
inventory management solutions as part of a comprehensive supply chain and materials
management offering. Through focused effort, we have developed expertise in providing
application systems and parts integration, optimization solutions and after-sales support.
Our supply chain solutions include outsourcing the functions of procurement, inventory and
warehouse management, logistics, point of issue technology, project management, business
process and performance metrics reporting. This solution allows us to leverage the infrastructure
of our SAP™ Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system and others to streamline our
customers’ purchasing process, from requisition to procurement to payment, by digitally
managing workflow, improving approval routing and providing robust reporting functionality.
We support major land and offshore operations for all the major oil and gas producing regions
around the world through our comprehensive network of locations. Our key markets, beyond
North America, include Latin America, the North Sea, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the
Former Soviet Union (“FSU”). Products sold through our locations support greenfield and
expansion upstream capital projects, midstream infrastructure, turnkey tank battery solutions and
MRO and manufacturing consumables used in day-to-day production. We provide downstream
energy and industrial products for petroleum refining, chemical processing, power generation
and industrial manufacturing operations and customer on-site locations.
16
We stock or sell more than 300,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) through our branch network.
Our supplier network consists of thousands of vendors in approximately 40 countries. From our
operations in over 20 countries we sell to customers operating in approximately 90 countries.
The supplies and equipment stocked by each of our branches are customized to meet varied and
changing local customer demands. The breadth and scale of our offering enhances our value
proposition to vendors, customers and shareholders.
We employ advanced information technologies, including a common ERP platform across most
of our business, to provide complete procurement, materials management and logistics
coordination to our customers around the globe. Having a common ERP platform allows
immediate visibility into the financials and operations of most branches worldwide, enhancing
decision making and efficiency.
Demand for our products is driven primarily by the level of oil and gas drilling, servicing and
production, transmission, refining and petrochemical activities. It is also influenced by the global
economy in general and by government policies. Several factors drive spending, such as
investment in energy infrastructure, the North American shale plays and market expectations of
future developments in the oil, natural gas, liquids, refined products, petrochemical, plant
maintenance and other industrial, manufacturing and energy sectors.  These arrangements are
generally repetitive activities that address recurring maintenance, repair, operational work, well
hookups and drilling activities. Project activities, including facility maintenance (turnarounds),
expansions, exploration and new construction projects, are usually associated with customers’
capital expenditure budgets, sometimes in association with their construction partners. We
mitigate our exposure to price volatility by limiting the length of price protection on such projects
which allows us to adjust pricing depending on factors that influence our supply chain.
We have expanded globally, through acquisitions and organic investments, into Australia,
Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines,
Russia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.
On June 1, 2016 the Company completed its acquisition of Power Service, a distributor of
original equipment manufacturer parts including pumps, generator sets, air compressors and
blowers and a fabricator of custom lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) units, vapor recovery
units, ASME code vessels and water production skids serving the upstream, midstream and
downstream oil and gas markets. With this acquisition, the Company has a larger presence in the
turnkey tank battery solutions market in the United States.
Summary of Reportable Segments
We operate through three reportable segments: United States (“U.S.”), Canada and International.
The segment data included in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) are
presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information
appearing in Note 6 “Business Segments” of the notes to unaudited consolidated financial
statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) is also presented on this basis.
United States
We have more than 200 locations in the U.S., which are geographically positioned to best serve
the upstream, midstream and downstream energy and industrial markets.
We also have extensive one-stop shop specialty operations in the U.S. that provide our
customers a unique opportunity to purchase artificial lift, pumps, valves and valve actuation,
LACT units, measurement and controls and fluid transfer products which enables them to better
focus on their core business. In these businesses, we provide additional value to our customers
through the design, assembly, fabrication and optimization of products and equipment essential
to the safe and efficient production of oil and gas and industrial manufacturing processes.
Canada
We have a network of approximately 60 locations in the Canadian oilfield, predominantly in the
oil rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in Western Canada. Our Canada segment
primarily serves the energy exploration, production and drilling business, offering customers the
same products and value-added solutions that we perform in the U.S. In Canada, we also
provide training for and supervise the installation of fiberglass pipe, supported by substantial
inventory and product expertise to serve our customers.
17
International
We operate in approximately 20 countries and serve the needs of our international customers
from approximately 40 locations outside of the U.S. and Canada, which are strategically located
in major oil and gas development areas. Our approach in these markets is similar to our
approach in the U.S., as our customers turn to us to provide inventory and support closer to their
drilling and exploration activities. Our long legacy of operating in many international regions,
combined with significant expansion into several new key markets, provides a competitive
advantage as few of our competitors have a presence in the U.S., Canada and international
markets.
The Separation
On May 1, 2014, the NOV Board of Directors approved the Spin-Off of its distribution business
into an independent, publicly traded company named NOW Inc. In accordance with a separation
and distribution agreement, the two companies were separated by NOV distributing to its
stockholders all 107,053,031 shares of common stock of NOW Inc. after the market closed on
May 30, 2014. Each NOV stockholder received one share of NOW common stock for every four
shares of NOV common stock held at the close of business on the record date of May 22, 2014
and not sold prior to close of business May 30, 2014. Fractional shares of NOW common stock
were not distributed and any fractional shares of NOW common stock otherwise issuable to a
NOV stockholder were sold in the open market on such stockholder’s behalf, and such
stockholder received a cash payment with respect to that fractional share. In conjunction with the
separation, NOV received an opinion from its legal counsel to the effect that, based on certain
facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
distribution of NOW common stock and certain related transactions generally was not taxable to
NOV or U.S. holders of NOV common stock, except in respect to cash received in lieu of
fractional shares, which generally will be taxable to such holders as capital gain. Following the
separation, NOW is an independent, publicly traded company, and NOV has no ownership
interest in NOW. Each company now has separate public ownership, boards of directors and
management. A Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, relating to the Spin-Off was
filed by the Company with the SEC and was declared effective on May 13, 2014. On June 2,
2014, NOW Inc. stock began trading the “regular-way” on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol “DNOW”.
Basis of Presentation
All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The unaudited
consolidated financial information included in this report has been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. The principles for interim financial information
do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company’s most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring
nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The results of
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.
Operating Environment Overview
The Company’s results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas
drilling, well remediation activity, crude oil and natural gas prices, capital spending by oilfield
service companies and drilling contractors, and worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key
industry indicators for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 include

Executive Summary
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company generated a net loss of $44
million and a net loss of $107 million, respectively, on $501 million and $1,049 million in
revenue, respectively. Revenue decreased $249 million or 33.2%, and decreased $564 million or
35.0%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, when compared to the
corresponding periods of 2015. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, net loss
increased $25 million and increased $78 million, respectively, when compared to the
corresponding periods of 2015.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company generated an operating loss of
$57 million or negative 11.4% of revenue, and an operating loss of $122 million or negative
11.6% of revenue, compared to an operating loss of $27 million or negative 3.6% of revenue, and
an operating loss of $35 million or negative 2.2% of revenue, respectively, for the corresponding
periods of 2015.
Outlook
Our outlook for the Company remains tied to worldwide rig count, particularly in North America.
The significant declines in rig count contribute to an unpredictable environment and several
factors could alter activity significantly. Projections for oil and gas prices and resulting rig counts
fluctuate considerably and energy-related companies are taking varied approaches during these
uncertain times. Sustained lower oil prices may heighten the risk of political disturbances in oil-
export-dependent economies, but can also offer an incentive to maximize output and stimulate
growth.
Given the lack of visibility into when this market will recover, our approach during this time is to
focus on what we can control. We take a quarter-to-quarter approach to managing the Company
based on market conditions, while also continuing to advance our long-term strategic goals. We
believe recent and current market conditions present a unique opportunity to execute strategic
acquisitions that will help position the Company to emerge as a stronger global distribution
business as the market recovers. We also believe that our long history of managing through
these cycles will enable us to capitalize on new opportunities.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, revenue was $337 million and $694 million,
respectively, a decline of $159 million or 32.1% and a decline of $403 million or 36.7%,
respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015. These decreases were
primarily driven by a 54% decline year over year in U.S. rig count, offset by incremental revenue
gains of approximately $46 million and $88 million, respectively, from acquisitions in the periods.
20
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the U.S. generated an operating loss of $44
million or negative 13.1% of revenue and loss of $103 million or negative 14.8% of revenue,
respectively, an increase of $21 million and an increase of $68 million, respectively, when
compared to the corresponding periods of 2015. For the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, U.S. operating losses increased due to lower volumes.
Canada
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, revenue was $55 million and $118 million,
respectively, a decline of $34 million or 38.2%, and a decline of $87 million or 42.4%,
respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015. These decreases were in
line with the declines in Canadian rig counts coupled with the impacts of the strengthening of the
U.S. dollar.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Canada generated an operating loss of $8
million or negative 14.5% of revenue and an operating loss of $14 million or negative 11.9% of
revenue, respectively, an increase of $3 million and an increase of $12 million, respectively,
when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015. Operating losses increased in the periods
primarily due to the decline in revenue discussed above, offset by expense reductions realized in
the periods.
International
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, revenue was $109 million and $237 million,
respectively, a decline of $56 million or 33.9% and a decline of $74 million or 23.8%,
respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015. These decreases were a
result of an overall decline in international drilling activity and reduced customer spend. For the
six months ended June 30, 2016, revenue decline was offset by incremental revenue gains from
acquisitions of approximately $20 million.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the international segment generated an
operating loss of $5 million or negative 4.6% of revenue and an operating loss of $5 million or
negative 2.1% of revenue, respectively, a decline of $6 million and a decline of $7 million,
respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015. These decreases were
primarily attributable to revenue declines.
Cost of products
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, cost of products was $418 million and $879
million, respectively compared to $626 million and $1,334 million, respectively, for the
corresponding periods in 2015. The changes were primarily due to the decline in revenue,
coupled with inventory adjustments made in the periods. Cost of products includes the cost of
inventory sold and related items, such as vendor consideration, inventory allowances,
amortization of intangibles and inbound and outbound freight.
Warehousing, selling and administrative
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, warehousing, selling and administrative
costs were $140 million and $292 million, respectively, compared to $151 million and $314
million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2015. These decreases are related to cost-
cutting initiatives taken in the periods as a result of the declines in market activity, offset by the
impacts of additional operating expenses associated with newly acquired companies.
Warehousing, selling and administrative costs include branch location, distribution center and
regional expenses (including costs such as compensation, benefits and rent) as well as
corporate general selling and administrative expenses.
Other expense
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, other expense was $2 million and $4 million,
respectively, compared to $2 million and $6 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of
2015. These changes were mainly attributable to exchange rate fluctuations.
21
Income tax benefit
The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was 26.3% and 15.1%,
respectively, compared to 33.9% and 29.7%, respectively, for the same periods in 2015.
Compared to the U.S. statutory rate, the effective tax rate was impacted by recurring items, such
as lower tax rates on income earned in foreign jurisdictions that is permanently reinvested, offset
by nondeductible expenses, state income taxes and the change in valuation allowance recorded
against deferred tax assets. Due to the continuing uncertainty in our industry and thus our
outlook, the Company has adopted the method of recording income taxes on a year-to-date
effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company will evaluate its use of
this method each quarter until such time as a return to the annualized estimated effective tax rate
method is deemed appropriate.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Reconciliation
In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by
GAAP, we disclose a non-GAAP financial measure in our quarterly earnings press releases and
other public disclosures. The primary non-GAAP financial measure we focus on is earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding other costs (“EBITDA excluding
other costs”). This financial measure excludes the impact of certain amounts as further identified
below and has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP
financial measure to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is included below.
We use this non-GAAP financial measure internally to evaluate and manage the Company’s
operations because we believe it provides useful supplemental information regarding the
Company’s ongoing economic performance. We have chosen to provide this information to
investors to enable them to perform more meaningful comparisons of operating results, and as a
means to emphasize the results of ongoing operations.
The following table sets forth the reconciliation of EBITDA excluding other costs to its most
comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions):

(1)We believe that net loss is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to EBITDA excluding other costs. EBITDA
excluding other costs measures the Company’s operating performance without regard to certain expenses. EBITDA
excluding other costs is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP and the Company’s computation of
EBITDA excluding other costs may vary from others in the industry. EBITDA excluding other costs has important
limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the
Company’s results as reported under GAAP.
(2)Interest, net was less than $1 million for all periods presented.
(3)Other costs primarily includes the transaction costs associated with acquisition activity, including the cost of
inventory that was stepped up to fair value during purchase accounting related to acquisitions and severance
expenses which are included in operating loss.
(4)EBITDA % excluding other costs is defined as EBITDA excluding other costs divided by Revenue.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and
financing activities. We expect to remain in a strong financial position, with resources expected to
be available to reinvest in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to
meet short- and long-term objectives. We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from
expected results of operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be
sufficient to fund operations, anticipated working capital needs and other cash requirements,
including capital expenditures.
22
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $136 million
and $90 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, approximately $100 million of our cash and
cash equivalents was maintained in the accounts of our various foreign subsidiaries and, if such
amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., such amounts may be
subject to additional tax liabilities, which would be recognized in our financial statements in the
period during which such decisions were made. We currently have the intent and ability to
permanently reinvest the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and there are currently no plans
for the repatriation of such amounts.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had $180 million of borrowings against its revolving credit
facility. The credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants for
credit facilities of this type including financial covenants. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was
in compliance with all covenants. The Company continuously monitors compliance with debt
covenants. A default, if not waived or amended, would prevent the Company from taking certain
actions, such as incurring additional debt.
The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash
used in investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities for the periods presented
(in millions):

Operating Activities
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $155
million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $81 million in the corresponding
period of 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating
activities was negatively impacted by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of
$26 million, a decrease in prepaid and other current assets of $6 million and a net decrease in
other liabilities of $1 million, offset by a decrease in receivables and inventories of $115 million
and $104 million, respectively.  The decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are a
result of paying down outstanding liabilities as well as limiting new purchases due to the market
conditions. Accounts receivable and inventories had a positive impact on cash flow in the period
as a result of improved collections and curtailed spending.
Investing Activities
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $190 million
compared to net cash used in investing activities of $229 million in the corresponding period of
2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company used $182 million for business
acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $7 million for purchases of intangible assets. Additionally,
the Company spent $2 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, which was
partially offset by proceeds from the disposals of fixed assets. In the comparative period in 2015,
the Company used $223 million for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $6 million
for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Financing Activities
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $68
million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $78 million for the corresponding
period of 2015. The activity for both periods was primarily attributed to the Company making
repayments under, and borrowing against, its credit facility.
Other
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the effect of the change in exchange rates on cash and
cash equivalents was an increase of $13 million compared to a decrease of $11 million for the
corresponding period of 2015. The primary reason for the change in 2016 compared to 2015 was
a decline in the foreign exchange rate for the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar,
Kazakhstan tenge and Mexican peso compared to the U.S. dollar.
23
We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any
acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be determined with
certainty. We continue to expect to fund future acquisitions primarily with cash flows from
operations and borrowings, including the undrawn portion of the credit facility or new debt
issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions.
There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms
acceptable to us.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
For a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In preparing
the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts
reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature
which are related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, goodwill, purchase
price allocation of acquisitions, vendor consideration and income taxes. Our estimates are based
on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The
combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from our current estimates and those differences may be material.
Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually (performed in the fourth quarter)
or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Adverse market conditions could result in the
recognition of impairment if the Company determines that the fair values of its reporting units
have fallen below their carrying values. Events or circumstances which could require interim
testing include (but are not limited to) a significant reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or
drilling; a significant reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling
contractors; a significant reduction in worldwide well remediation activity; a significant reduction
in capital investment by other oilfield service companies; or a significant increase in worldwide
inventories of oil or gas.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise
from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative
financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative
financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. We do not currently have any material
outstanding derivative instruments. See Note 12 “Derivative Financial Instruments” to the
consolidated financial statements.
A discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We have operations in foreign countries and transact business globally in multiple currencies.
Our net assets as well as our revenue and costs and expenses denominated in foreign
currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the
U.S. dollar. Because we operate globally and approximately one-third of our year-to-date 2016
revenue was outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rates can impact our financial
position, results of operations and competitive position. We are a net receiver of foreign
currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected
by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. As of June 30, 2016, our
most significant foreign currency exposure was to the Canadian dollar with less significant
foreign currency exposures to the Australian dollar, British pound, Kazakhstan tenge and
Mexican peso.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into their U.S. dollar equivalents at
end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities, while revenue, costs and expenses are
translated at average monthly exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are components of
other comprehensive income (loss) as reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
income (loss). For year-to-date 2016, we realized a net foreign currency translation gain totaling
$15 million, which was included in other comprehensive loss.
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations generally do not materially affect our earnings since
the functional currency is typically the local currency; however, our operations also have net
assets not denominated in their functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates that impact our earnings as foreign currency transaction gains and
losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income
(expense). For year-to-date 2016 and 2015, we reported foreign currency transaction losses of
less than $1 million and $4 million, respectively. Gains and losses are primarily due to exchange
rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency and fair value adjustments to economically hedged positions as a result of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Some of our revenue for our foreign operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore,
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact earnings to the extent that costs associated
with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly, some of our
revenue for our foreign operations are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated
U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to
mitigate those risks, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the
currency of the revenues and the associated costs. Although we may utilize foreign currency
forward contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated balances or
transactions, we do not currently hedge the net investments in our foreign operations. The
counterparties to our forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and
concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored by us on a continuing basis. In
the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our
exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential.
The average foreign exchange rate for year-to-date 2016 compared to the average for the same
period in 2015 decreased by approximately 9% compared to the U.S. dollar based on the
aggregated weighted average revenue of our foreign-currency denominated foreign operations.
The average foreign exchange rate for year-to-date 2016 compared to the average for the same
period in 2015 of the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Kazakhstan tenge and
Mexican peso compared to the U.S. dollar decreased by approximately 6%, 6%, 7%, 47% and
16%, respectively, compared to the U.S. dollar.
We utilized a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact on earnings based on a
hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates. A 10% change from the levels experienced
during year-to-date 2016 of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affected the
Company would have resulted in an approximate $2 million change in net loss for the same
period.
25
Commodity Steel Pricing
Our business is sensitive to steel prices, which can impact our product pricing, with steel tubular
prices generally having the highest degree of sensitivity. While we cannot predict steel prices, we
manage this risk by managing our inventory levels, including maintaining sufficient quantity on
hand to meet demand, while reducing the risk of overstocking.
Interest Rates
We are subject to interest rate risk with our credit facility. The credit facility requires us to pay
interest on outstanding borrowings at variable rates. Each one percentage point change in
interest rates associated with the facility would result in a less than one million dollars change in
our quarterly cash interest expense based on the balance at June 30, 2016.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon that
evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered
by this report at a reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-
15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
