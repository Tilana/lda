<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, conducted an official visit to 
Croatia from 7 to 16 November 2012. The objective of the visit was to examine the 
situation of violence against women in the four spheres, namely in the home, the 
community, violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, and violence in the 
transnational context.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to express her gratitude to the Government for 
the excellent cooperation extended prior to and during her visit to the country.1 During the 
visit to Zagreb, Lobor-grad, Zadar, Po&#382;ega and Vukovar, consultations were held with 
officials from the following Ministries: Defence; the Interior; Public Administration; 
Regional Development and EU Funds; Social Policy and Youth; War Veterans; Health; 
Justice; Science, Education and Sports; Labour and Pension System; and Foreign and 
European Affairs. The Special Rapporteur also met with officials from the Government 
Offices for Human Rights, for National Minorities and for Gender Equality as well as the 
Ombudspersons on Gender Equality and for Persons with Disabilities. She also held 
meetings with members of the Parliamentary Committee on Gender Equality. 
</p>
<p>3. Her meetings  included the Deputy President of the Supreme Court, the President of 
the Misdemeanour Court and the Deputy State Attorney-General, as well as  representatives 
from the penitentiary administration and the police. The Special Rapporteur also met with 
the United Nations Country Team and thanks the United Nations Development Programme 
for the assistance and support provided prior to and during her visit. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited public and NGO-run shelters in Zagreb and Vukovar 
as well as a centre for social welfare (CSW) in Zagreb. She met with representatives of civil 
society organizations in Zagreb, Zadar and Vukovar. Her mission also included visits to a 
social welfare home in Lobor-grad (Krapina) and a women&#8217;s detention centre in Po&#382;ega.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all her interlocutors, including survivors of 
wartime violence and women in custody and shelters who shared their traumatic 
experiences with her. She looks forward to a fruitful and continued dialogue with the 
Government and other stakeholders on the implementation of her recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The political and economic context and its implications for 
</b>women&#8217;s rights <b> 
</b></p>
<p>6. Croatia is a parliamentary, representative democratic republic, and the Prime 
Minister is the Head of government in a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised 
by the Government (<i>Vlada</i>) and the President. The executive branch is composed of 17 
ministers.  
</p>
<p>7. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament (<i>Sabor</i>), a unicameral body of 151 
members who serve four-year terms and are elected by direct vote.  
</p>
<p>8. Croatia has an independent judicial system governed by the Constitution and 
national legislation. The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal. Judges are appointed 
by the National Judicial Council and judicial office is permanent until retirement. The 
</p>
<p>  
 1  The Special Rapporteur would particularly like to thank the Government of Croatia for agreeing to 
</p>
<p>the visit in a very short time frame. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>lower two levels of the three-tiered judiciary consist of county courts and municipal courts. 
There are 15 county courts and 67 municipal courts in the country. There are other 
specialized courts such as commercial courts, misdemeanour courts, an Administrative 
Court and a Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>9. Although Croatia&#8217;s economy suffered badly during the 1991&#8211;1995 war, in the period 
2000 to 2007, the average rate of economic growth was considerably higher than in the 
European Union. In 2008, economic stagnation was recorded, due to the global economic 
crisis. The structural composition of the economy has been shifting from agriculture 
towards trade and services. Croatia&#8217;s high foreign debt, poor export sector, strained state 
budget and overreliance on tourism revenue may result in a higher risk to economic 
progress over the medium term. 
</p>
<p>10. In 2010, there were approximately 2 million women of working age between the 
ages of 15 and 64. The formal labour sector included 702,000 women and 838,000 men,2 
with 34 per cent per cent of men within the working age group and 40 per cent of working 
age women inactive. Women have an unemployment rate of 12.2 per cent, compared to 11 
per cent for men. Women tend to be more dependent on others for their upkeep due to their 
socioeconomic situations, and this usually results in fewer individual choices. Limited and 
less attractive employment opportunities also limit their access to benefits, including 
pension rights, in the absence of adequate years of service and in view of low levels of pay. 
</p>
<p>11. The dual female roles, both at home and in the workplace, have had a profound 
influence on the choice of occupation for women. Home-based, unpaid production is 
mostly done by women and is not reflected in the formal economy. Also, unpaid family 
workers are predominantly women involved in household work and work in the family 
business, be it a farm, craft or a business enterprise. Women are often neither the legal 
owners of property nor the directors of these businesses, although they contribute 
substantially to their survival &#8211; often doing the work of those who had to be dismissed in 
difficult economic times. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Current manifestations of violence against women and girls 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>12.  Domestic violence is a widespread problem throughout the country, usually 
perpetrated by intimate partners, including current or former spouses or boyfriends. For 
2010, the Ministry of the Interior recorded 15,189 reported domestic violence offences. 
Data on police interventions similarly reflect a high prevalence. In 2008, the police received 
16,885 requests for intervention in domestic violence cases, followed by 9,833 requests for 
protective measures.3 Although the Government has developed an important framework in 
order to combat domestic violence, both legislative and institutional, there are significant 
gaps in implementation which impede effective protection for women victims. The Special 
Rapporteur heard numerous stories from women victims of domestic violence, including 
the following:  
</p>
<p>Irina4 was attacked by knife by her husband when she was pregnant. Although she 
reported the attack to the police, her husband was arrested but released after 24 hours.

</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Being afraid, she left the household and went to the local CSW, who advised her to 
take the baby and go through the court process. She only had one interview with a 
social worker, and her husband was given the opportunity to attend psychosocial 
rehabilitation treatment. He did not attend treatment sessions and made threats 
including demanding to see the child. She managed to find accommodation at an 
NGO shelter and was provided with a lawyer who is applying for protection 
measures. 
</p>
<p>13. In 2003, the Government adopted the Law on Protection against Domestic Violence 
(LPDV). In theory it provides protective measures focused on victim safety as well as 
measures directed at offenders&#8217; behaviour. However, there was overall consensus in 
interviews with civil society broadly, and with victims in particular, that the goals of victim 
safety and offender accountability were not a reality in practice. For example, the practice 
of dual arrests is implemented against the victim, regardless of the danger or threat that the 
perpetrator poses to the safety of the victim. A victim who has verbally insulted her 
offender can be prosecuted and held accountable alongside her abuser who has physically 
beaten her. Also, police officers do not systematically identify the primary aggressor in 
domestic violence cases, and instead of making determinations of the primary aggressor 
and defensive injuries, they generally defer the identification to judges and physicians, 
respectively. As a result, many victims not only face the potential for arrest when they call 
for help, but also ensuing charges and punishments for defending themselves against the 
assault.  
</p>
<p>14. Another challenge has arisen due to the 2009 European Court of Human Rights 
decision in <i>Maresti</i> v. <i>Croatia</i>,5 which has dramatically limited the courts from effectively 
protecting victims and holding offenders accountable for their crimes. The <i>Maresti </i>case 
renders misdemeanour and criminal prosecutions mutually exclusive, requiring the 
prosecution services to choose between misdemeanour charges under the LPDV (which 
would allow long-term protective measures) and criminal charges, which carry stricter 
sentences. Under the LPDV, protective measures are only issued when there is a 
misdemeanour and not when the case involves criminal charges. Even if an offender 
perpetrates serious injuries, compelling the victim to seek protection through an eviction or 
restraining order, the maximum sentence that the offender could face through the 
misdemeanour courts is 90 days&#8217; imprisonment or a fine. Conversely, if the State Attorney 
chooses to prosecute the case and seek criminal-level punishment, the victim is then 
precluded from obtaining long-term protective measures for herself under the LPDV.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur was informed that a new Criminal Code, adopted in 2011, 
came into force on 1 January 2013 and introduced amendments related to family violence. 
The offence of &#8220;violent behaviour&#8221; included in the previous Criminal Code was often 
treated both as misdemeanour and criminal offence, resulting in the application of dual 
criteria. Through <i>Maresti</i> v. <i>Croatia</i>, the European Court of Human Rights stated the 
unacceptability of such practice. In the new Criminal Code, the &#8220;violent behaviour&#8221; offence 
is no longer included as an independent criminal offence but as a qualified (more severe) 
form of certain criminal offences, such as injuries, severe injuries, extremely severe 
injuries, threatening, coercion, or mutilation of female sexual organs, thus reinforcing the 
hierarchy of harm. Furthermore, during the elaboration of the new Criminal Code, attention 
was reportedly paid to harmonization with international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>16. Domestic violence is handled by a law enforcement unit that is primarily responsible 
for juvenile delinquency and crimes against children. Therefore, some of those who

<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>respond to domestic violence cases at the police unit level and at CSWs do not have 
knowledge and training on the dynamics of violence against women, as their expertise is 
related to children. Furthermore, some misdemeanour judges see domestic violence as 
limited to violence against children, and this is also reflected in the State&#8217;s laws and 
practices, where courts commonly hold a victim responsible for her children witnessing 
domestic violence against her.  
</p>
<p>17. The Family Law requires married couples (and their children) going through divorce 
proceedings to complete mediation as part of the divorce process. The Special Rapporteur 
was informed that CSW employees conducting mediation do not screen for domestic 
violence in these cases, nor do they proactively offer separate mediation to mitigate the 
potential harm to a victim of domestic violence of being forced to meet with her abuser 
during mediation sessions. Moreover, even in cases when mediation was not stipulated as 
mandatory by the Family Law, CSW workers have reportedly mediated and encouraged 
victims to reconcile with their offender. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Femicide 
</b></p>
<p>18. The continuum of violence in the home is reflected in the increasing numbers of 
victims of femicide. In 2011, 22.9 per cent per cent of all murder victims were women 
murdered by a male member of their families (husband, common law partner, former 
husband, son, brother-in-law). Although statistics do not disaggregate the causes of 
femicides, both government and civil society interlocutors estimate that economic hardship 
and mental disorders linked to the conflict as well as alcohol and drug addictions may have 
a role in these murders. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence against women in the community 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Rape  
</b></p>
<p>19. Although not as widespread as domestic violence, the Special Rapporteur was made 
aware of the situation regarding rape. From data collected by the police, the vast majority of 
victims were women who knew their perpetrator (91 per cent) &#8211; whether a family member 
or an acquaintance. Between 2000 and 2010 there were 1,228 reported criminal offences of 
rape, 958 committed and 270 attempted. However, there has been no reported analysis of 
the trend of increase or decrease in the number of reported cases. With regard to the age of 
rape victims, they are most frequently young adults aged 19 to 30 (43 per cent) and minors 
(22 per cent).6  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Government Office for Gender 
Equality was preparing a standard set of rules for action in cases of sexual violence (a 
protocol). This protocol would cover not only cases of rape but also sexual harassment 
outside the workplace, as well as other forms of sexual assault. Such a protocol would 
apply to police, courts, CSWs, State Attorneys, health services and other actors providing 
services.7 In November 2012, upon the Office&#8217;s proposal, the Government adopted the 
Rules of Procedure in Cases of Sexual Violence.

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Sexual harassment in the workplace 
</b></p>
<p>21. Although sexual harassment in the workplace is prohibited by law, this phenomenon 
has become more common. According to trade unions, sexual harassment was most 
pronounced in the textile, leather, trade and catering industries. The Ombudsperson for 
Gender Equality reported that in 2011 her Office received a total of 1,391 complaints of 
which 63.9 per cent concerned women. Within this percentage, 65 per cent were related to 
discrimination against women in the areas of the workplace, employment, social care and 
the pension system, of which 42 per cent concerned sexual harassment.8 However, despite 
more visibility and reporting, she stated that many women were reluctant to take action due 
to the fear of reprisal. In 2010, a court handed down the country&#8217;s first conviction for 
sexual harassment in the workplace, sentencing one defendant to six months in prison for 
making repeated sexually harassing comments over a three-year period. A second 
defendant in the case was given a four-month suspended sentence for harassment.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Violence against lesbian and transgender women 
</b></p>
<p>22. Although the Special Rapporteur heard little from interviewees on the situation of 
lesbian, transgender and intersex women, she was nonetheless made aware of cases of 
homophobic hate crimes which occurred around the time of Pride marches, when lesbian 
and transgender women are more visible. Although the police provide some security at 
these events, attacks on participants after the parade in other parts of the cities have been 
frequently reported to LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) organizations, as 
happened in Zagreb in 2007 and 2010, and in Split in 2011.9 Violent incidents took place 
during the 2011 Split Pride March, where more than 3,500 counter-protestors shouted 
violent threats and threw stones and bottles at participants. Due to those incidents, the Split 
City Council issued a decision refusing permission for the 2012 Pride March to take the 
same route, in order to avoid violent incidents. However, the Ombudsperson for Gender 
Equality intervened and challenged the City Council&#8217;s decision, prompting the City Council 
to rescind its decision. The march was held without incident.  
</p>
<p>23. There are other types of homophobic hate crimes which have been denounced by 
civil society where the victims &#8211; both men and women &#8211; were physically assaulted, usually 
during the night, by one or more aggressors. Most of them ended with the same results: 
ineffective action by the police, no registering of the case, loss of documents and 
classification of the act as a minor offence in spite of the injuries sustained.  
</p>
<p>24. The Criminal Code at the time of the visit (article 89) defines hate crime as any 
criminal offence included in the Code committed with a hate motive on the basis of a 
personal characteristic. Sexual orientation is explicitly mentioned as a personal 
characteristic on the basis of which a hate crime can be perpetrated, but the ground of 
gender identity is not included.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Women in detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur visited the Po&#382;ega Women&#8217;s Penitentiary, the only 
correctional facility for women serving a criminal sentence. At the time of her visit, there 
were 146 women detainees in different wards: closed ward, semi-open, open and a 
reception unit. The Special Rapporteur was able to visit the different wards and speak

</p>
<p>privately to the women detained at this facility. She was particularly interested in hearing 
the stories of women serving a prison sentence for having killed their husband or partner as 
a result of domestic violence. While the sentences for these women were generally more 
lenient than for other types of similar criminal offences, these women expressed concern 
about their rehabilitation and future after having served their sentence. 
</p>
<p>Dragana was serving a three-year sentence for having murdered her husband, 
following an abusive marriage where he tried to kill her and their children. Although 
she had sought help from her parents and the police, no one was able to assist. After 
the death of the husband, CSW employees wanted to place her children with her 
husband&#8217;s family, although they were known to be violent. She was sentenced to a 
one-year term, but this was increased to three years on appeal. She had asked the 
prison administration for some psychological treatment, as she had recurring 
nightmares. This request was delayed and she was only recently granted such 
assistance. Her current concerns (as articulated by many inmates) include fears about 
future employment, housing needs and custody of her children, amongst others. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur observed that the prison conditions were generally 
considered adequate, although some concerns regarding poor ventilation, insufficient 
outdoor time, lack of fresh air and few work opportunities were mentioned by the inmates. 
While prisoners generally had access to medical care, medical personnel were not present 
full-time, thereby creating deficiencies in health care. Access to sufficient psychiatric 
services and specialists was also problematic, due to the remote location of the detention 
facility. The geographic location of the prison also made family visits difficult. Women 
who gave birth in prison could keep their children with them for up to three years. The 
Special Rapporteur, however, was concerned by the differential treatment of inmates and 
the categorization in terms of wards &#8211; which was conducted in a diagnostic unit in Zagreb 
before serving the sentence, and which impacted significantly on the experiences of the 
inmates. For instance, women in the closed ward were not allowed to have their personal 
effects with them in their rooms, they could not leave the building and they had no access 
to educational opportunities which were accessible to inmates under a different regime. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Women in institutions 
</b></p>
<p>27. It is estimated that around 10,000 persons with disabilities live in either psychiatric 
hospitals and social care institutions, isolated from their families and away from public 
view and scrutiny. The Special Rapporteur visited the Lobor-grad social care institution, 
where concerns about mental health treatment and the lack of basic safeguards regarding 
the involuntary admission procedure and placement under guardianship were confirmed. 
These persons, a majority of whom are women, once admitted to such institutions, remain 
there for life. The example below reflects the situation of many other women, in middle to 
old age, who are admitted by their families as they become a burden which the children do 
not want to assume: 
</p>
<p>Anja had been living in Lobor-grad for 12 years, following her placement under 
guardianship by her relatives after the death of her grandmother and mother, which 
had led to depression. She seldom receives visits by her family, who live in Zagreb. 
She spends her time doing &#8220;work therapy&#8221; (knitting) and receives some allowance for 
this work. The money is taken by the management to cover the cost of her 
accommodation. 
</p>
<p>28. There is a pilot project of self-organized living in houses in a nearby village that 
provides an example of the emerging practice of attempting to use alternatives to 
institutions, and a possible model for further development. Although at the time of the visit </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>it encompassed 21 persons living in five different houses, this programme would need to be 
replicated in other areas and expanded if proven to be effective. It could be seen as an 
alternative to lifelong institutionalization and also as a reintegration model with the 
possibility of autonomous living for persons who are institutionalized. 
</p>
<p>29. In general, the conditions encountered include overcrowding and degrading living 
conditions in buildings which are ill-equipped to house people on a long-term or permanent 
basis. The remoteness of these places makes it difficult for family and friends to visit 
regularly. Furthermore, mental health treatment is heavily reliant on the administration of 
medication, with less emphasis on rehabilitative and therapeutic activities aimed at 
facilitating a return to community living. During her visit to the social care centre, the 
Special Rapporteur also noticed insufficient de facto legal protection against the abuse of 
rights of patients and residents in psychiatric hospitals and social care institutions.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. State response to violence against women 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Developments in the legislative framework  
</b></p>
<p>30. Croatia is party to a number of international and regional human rights instruments 
including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. At the time of the visit, Croatia was not a party to the Council of Europe 
Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, 
although it signed this Convention subsequently. At the national level, the Constitution 
proclaims, inter alia, freedom, equal rights, peacemaking, social justice and respect for 
human rights (art. 3). All persons shall enjoy rights and freedoms, regardless of race, 
colour, gender, language, religion, political or other conviction, national or social origin, 
property, birth, education, social status or other characteristics (art. 14). The Constitution 
also prohibits any call for or incitement to war or use of violence, to national, racial or 
religious hatred, or to any form of intolerance (art. 39) and sets out the principle of equality 
of all citizens before the law, without distinction as to sex, race, language, religion and 
political opinions, or personal and social conditions. 
</p>
<p>31. In 2008, the Parliament adopted the Gender Equality Act, which includes the general 
prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital or family status and sexual 
orientation. The Act extends the area of prohibition of discrimination in the fields of 
employment, labour and education, and lays out the obligation to promote the raising of 
public awareness concerning the equality of men and women, and to keep statistics that are 
disaggregated by gender. The Act prescribes the obligation to establish commissions for 
gender equality in the counties and in the City of Zagreb, and the obligation to secure funds 
for their work. Improvements have been introduced in the area of protection against 
discrimination including through the use of class actions, the shifting of the burden of proof 
and the principle of urgency of court proceedings.  
</p>
<p>32. The Anti-Discrimination Act came into force in 2009, and provides for protection 
against discrimination on grounds of sex, marital or family status, and gender identity, 
amongst others.  
</p>
<p>33. The adoption of the LPDV in 2003 represented a significant step towards protecting 
domestic violence victims and holding offenders accountable. It provides both urgent and 
long-term protective measures focused on victim safety, including eviction, stalking and 
harassment measures, restraining orders and confiscation of weapons. It also provides 
measures directed at offenders&#8217; behaviour, including psychosocial treatment and addiction 
treatment. While a victim may, on her own, apply for protective measures under the law, 
most often, police file for these measures on behalf of victims. The application of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>provisions of the LPDV lie in the misdemeanour system, where judges decide whether to 
issue the protective measures and under what conditions, as well as whether to impose a jail 
sentence or fine. A violation of the protective measure is punishable by a fine or 
imprisonment of at least 10 days.  
</p>
<p>34. The LDPV was amended in 2009 and promulgated regulations for further 
implementation of the law, including the Rules of Procedure in Cases of Family Violence 
and the National Strategy of Protection against Family Violence. The prevention, sanction 
and suppression of all types of domestic violence and the application of adequate measures 
against perpetrators are now regulated, and the provision of protection of and assistance to 
the victims of violence, aimed at mitigating the consequences of violence already 
committed, is specified. It also extends the definition of domestic violence to &#8220;economic 
violence&#8221;, which includes deprivation of the right to economic independence. The 
prohibition of physical, psychological, sexual and economic violence in the family is 
explicitly articulated. Urgency is prescribed for procedures initiated on the grounds of the 
infringement of this law, and stricter fines and prison sentences have been introduced.  
</p>
<p>35. The Government has also issued protocols for specific sectors, such as the Ministry 
of the Interior&#8217;s Regulations on Implementation of Protective Measures for the LPDV. The 
Rules of Procedure in Cases of Family Violence (protocol) were adopted in 2005 and 
contain a series of mandated procedures for the competent bodies including the police, 
CSWs, health and educational institutions and the judiciary. This protocol includes methods 
of cooperation between different bodies which participate in detecting and eliminating 
violence and providing assistance and protection to a person exposed to any form of family 
violence. These Rules have a gender-sensitive approach to victims, and in cases of a child, 
an obligation to act according to the principle of the best interest of the child. In addition, 
an addendum entitled &#8220;Report on the intervention provided after the report of family 
violence&#8221; has been included to help police officers provide the victim with all the necessary 
information and resources available. Furthermore, an amendment to the Rules was added in 
2006 in order to provide immediate protection of family violence victims, both by CSWs 
and courts. These developments are commendable and need to be implemented in practice. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Developments in the institutional and policy framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National Strategy of Protection against Family violence (2011</b>&#8211;<b>2016) 
</b></p>
<p>36. The six-year National Strategy of Protection against Family Violence was adopted 
on 3 February 2011 upon the expiry of the 2008&#8211;2010 policy. It focuses on seven main 
areas of activity and establishes specific objectives and measures for each of these areas. 
The areas of activity deal with: the prevention of family violence; the improvement of inter-
sectoral cooperation of ministries in terms of the exchange of information and experiences 
regarding family violence; the provision of education to professionals working in the field 
of protection against family violence; the need to provide financial resources for conducting 
psychosocial treatment of perpetrators; the harmonization of legislation regarding the 
protection against family violence; the provision of financial support to shelters and to civil 
society organizations; and the need to raise public awareness regarding this issue.  
</p>
<p>37. However, some concerns have been expressed in relation to the current National 
Strategy.10 For example, the activities of the National Strategy with an implementation

<i>Rights Report</i> (Minneapolis,  2012), pp. 98&#8211;99. </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>deadline in 2011 were only partially met. Although the majority of the measures had been 
implemented at the national level, their implementation at the local level remained poorly 
visible. Other concerns expressed were that violence was focused on the context of the 
family generally, and not on women, despite the acknowledgement of the disproportionate 
impact on women; that it was not clear which bodies were in charge of undertaking certain 
activities; and that the financing of the work of the NGOs was not mentioned.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. National Policy for Gender Equality (2011</b>&#8211;<b>2015) 
</b></p>
<p>38. This National Policy for Gender Equality was adopted for the purpose of eliminating 
discrimination against women and implementing a policy of equal opportunities over a 
five-year period. The body in charge of the supervision and implementation of the measures 
of this Policy is the Government Office for Gender Equality.  
</p>
<p>39. The National Policy builds on the previous one by redefining the national priorities, 
the modes of implementation and the undertaking of special measures in line with the 
altered social and political circumstances, the progress achieved and the further challenges 
in establishing true gender equality. It integrates a gender dimension by implementing 
special measures with regard to seven key fields of action. A novelty in the National Policy 
is the inclusion of activities aimed at establishing and developing cooperation with 
international and regional mechanisms and organizations, including UN-Women and the 
European Institute for Gender Equality, and promoting knowledge about the policies of the 
European Union and the Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>40. There are also other national plans, programmes and strategies, which define goals 
and measures for improving the implementation of gender mainstreaming and the general 
social status of women. These include: the Women&#8217;s Entrepreneurship Development 
Strategy 2010&#8211;2013; the National Programme for the Protection and Promotion of Human 
Rights 2008&#8211;2011; the Action Plan for the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005&#8211;2015; the 
National Programme for the Roma; the National Plan for Combating Trafficking in Human 
Beings 2009&#8211;2011; the National Employment Promotion Plan for 2011 and 2012; and the 
National Strategy of Development of Health Care 2006&#8211;2011.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Support services for women victims of violence  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Shelters/Safe houses 
</b></p>
<p>41. In Croatia, shelters are run either by the public sector (cities) or by NGOs. 
Autonomous women&#8217;s shelters and other NGO shelters are operated by women&#8217;s groups 
and work on the principle of women&#8217;s self-help, and are self-regulating and independent of 
State entities. They provide more than shelter for victims and their children, as they provide 
them with empowerment and holistic assistance. On the other hand, State or city shelters 
also offer services, sometimes to both sexes, including to victims of domestic violence, 
addicts, homeless persons, victims of trafficking, asylum seekers and migrants. These have 
stricter regulations and are found to be more bureaucratic in nature. The Special Rapporteur 
also noted that NGO shelters were more victim-responsive, whereas State shelters were 
more bureaucratic and had stricter rules and admission procedures. 
</p>
<p>42. Shelters face numerous challenges. First, the lack of bed capacity is a serious 
problem. A report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) noted that 
Croatia&#8217;s shelter capacity on a per capita basis was at least 20 per cent below the Council of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>Europe standards.11 Insufficient funding is another problem. The two funding schemes 
under the Ministry of Social Policy and Youth are complicated and pose challenges for 
organizations running these shelters. The Government&#8217;s funding conditions generally fail to 
reflect the actual needs and operations of a shelter. Prescribed conditions, in turn, reduce 
shelters&#8217; autonomy, forcing them to follow strict and, at times, irrelevant criteria in order to 
obtain financing. Moreover, the per-bed basis does not reflect the reality that shelters&#8217; 
baseline operating costs are the same no matter how many residents they admit. The Special 
Rapporteur confirmed the above-mentioned issues while visiting two NGO-run shelters in 
Zagreb and Vukovar and a city-run safe house in Zagreb. 
</p>
<p>43. Another barrier to safe refuge for victims is the referral system by CSWs. Public 
safe houses can only accept victims referred by the CSWs or police. Often, their staff will 
even redirect clients to the CSWs or police first. Shelters typically provide housing to 
victims for a limited period of time, often between six and twelve months. Many NGOs 
allow extended stays, but due to capacity constraints, shelters are unable to provide a long-
term solution. Once they leave a shelter, victims&#8217; housing options are limited, as there is no 
State-subsidized housing specifically for victims of domestic violence, although the status 
of victims of violence can increase eligibility for some public housing. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Victims and Witnesses Protection Units 
</b></p>
<p>44. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with lawyers, psychologists and social 
workers working with Victims and Witnesses Protection Units, which are established in 
some courts to provide assistance to victims and witnesses throughout the court 
proceedings. These units were originally established through a UNDP programme in 2008 
in the Vukovar, Zagreb, Osijek and Zadar county courts and are now established in seven 
different locations at county courts. Their primary goal is to provide general and emotional 
support and practical information to victims involved in criminal cases. Victims and 
witnesses are referred to these protection units through information contained in the court 
summons. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Counselling services and helplines 
</b></p>
<p>45. Counselling services are offered to women victims of violence, in the form of 
telephone helplines and in-person counselling services with professionals. While the NGOs 
providing shelters offer this type of assistance mostly to victims of domestic violence, other 
NGOs have set up specialized psychosocial assistance for victims of sexual violence and 
victims of wartime violence in the areas of the country where this occurred during the 
conflict. In addition, CSWs are mandated to offer free counselling services, among a 
variety of other services. Telephone helplines are provided by NGOs, as CSWs only offer 
their services in person at their offices. Telephone helplines are mostly available in larger 
cities during office hours. They do not provide services at night, when such services are in 
demand.

</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Police 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to interact with Specialized Police 
Officers trained to deal with cases of domestic violence. These police officers, mostly 
women, undergo a few weeks of volunteer specialized training and are posted in each of the 
main police stations to assist victims of domestic violence and intervene on the scene when 
needed. Although they intervene mostly in cases where children are involved, they play an 
important role in securing shelters for victims of domestic violence as well as receiving 
testimony for court cases, whether misdemeanour or criminal. However, these officers are 
not sent to the scene when an incident occurs, whether it is for domestic, sexual or other 
types of violence against women. This is the work of duty officers who are generalist police 
staff. In cases where a woman victim is involved, one of the two duty officers on patrol 
would be a woman.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Other services and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur was informed in her meetings with the Ministry of Labour 
and Pension System of new employment opportunities offered, among others, to women 
victims of violence, as part of their national plan to address employment of certain 
categories of women. On a similar scale, the Ministry of Regional Development and EU 
Funds, responsible for housing issues, informed the Special Rapporteur on how it has 
provided public housing for victims of domestic violence after they leave shelters or the 
family home (as 95 per cent of private property is owned by men). In the current climate of 
economic crisis, there is a reliance on European Union funds to undertake construction of 
new housing units. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Main areas of concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prevention and protection 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Police 
</b></p>
<p>48. Police are often the first responders to domestic violence, and the manner in which 
they respond, their attitude toward the victim and the protection they provide are vital in 
promoting victim safety and offender accountability. In addition, the police serve as an 
important link between victims and the legal system and other services, as police officers 
play an important role in referring or transporting victims to service providers, such as 
shelters, NGOs and hospitals. Although there are now specialized police officers who have 
undergone training in domestic violence, they are not available at all stations and at all 
hours. The first respondents (duty officers) tend to be generalist police officers in most 
cases.  
</p>
<p>49. The police connect the victim and the courts, because in practice the police act as 
prosecutors in misdemeanour cases. Their prosecutorial role in the misdemeanour system 
can help the victim overcome evidentiary challenges she might face. While a victim could 
initiate misdemeanour proceedings on her own and obtain protective measures, she would 
still face the challenge of collecting evidence on her own. Despite this important role in 
preventing and protecting women from violence, the Special Rapporteur found significant 
gaps and weaknesses relating to their responses when faced with cases of domestic 
violence. Police officers tend to assume that domestic violence is a private matter or is a 
result of alcohol abuse. This can result in an ineffective police response, such as the failure 
to take domestic violence seriously, inform victims of their rights, refer them to services or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>charge the perpetrator. Furthermore, in some cases dual arrests are made, where both the 
perpetrator and the victim are arrested and sometimes charged with offences such as 
disturbing public order. Statistics showed that women constitute up to 35 per cent of the 
arrest in cases of domestic violence.12 
</p>
<p>50. This situation may be explained by the absence of clear guidelines given to police 
officers in the Rules of Procedure in Cases of Family Violence and the LPDV. Apart from 
the definitions in the LPDV and in criminal law, which are vague, there are no official 
guidelines as to what level of domestic violence constitutes a criminal or a misdemeanour 
charge. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the police have developed some 
unofficial rules to decide whether to file a case as criminal or misdemeanour by relying on 
a &#8220;three strikes&#8221; approach: after two misdemeanours, the third offence becomes criminal. 
This results in first-time offences without heavy violence to be considered misdemeanours. 
Cases of violence in front of children are similarly inconsistently dealt with and sometimes 
lead to criminal charges, but in other cases, to misdemeanour charges. 
</p>
<p>51. Furthermore, the impact of the <i>Maresti</i> case has resulted in prohibiting prosecution 
and sentencing under both misdemeanour and criminal charges concurrently, as was often 
done before. This has led to a preference for the misdemeanour system for ease of speedy 
trials as well as to seek protective measures for the victim. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that under the LPDV, the police may propose and seek any of the six protective 
measures, including three urgent protective measures: a restraining order; eviction; and a 
stalking and harassment order. The police also have the option of imposing and applying 
for precautionary measures for eight days under the Misdemeanour Law. However, 
although they almost always propose protective measures when responding to domestic 
violence cases, there is a greater tendency to prioritize treatment for perpetrators in the form 
of psychosocial and addiction care and to pay less attention to protection for women and 
children victims of domestic violence. Interviews with civil society have confirmed the 
underutilization of protective measures for women. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Centres for Social Welfare 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur noted the important role conferred on Centres for Social 
Welfare (CSWs) in the response to protect and prevent domestic violence. CSWs are 
mandated under the LPDV and the Family Law to offer a wide range of measures to 
victims. Such services may include referrals to shelters; awarding victims one-off financial 
assistance; requiring victims, perpetrators and children to attend treatment programmes; 
making recommendations to the courts for perpetrator punishment; and making 
recommendations for the custody of children. In addition, CSWs must comply with 
mandatory reporting requirements and conduct investigations. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that CSWs tend to act as gatekeepers between victims and shelter,and even if they 
have gone to the police, victims are required to register with the CSW to be placed in 
publicly-run or -funded shelters.   
</p>
<p>53. Furthermore, the focus of this institution is primarily to retain the unity of the family 
and provide reconciliation through mandated mediation processes. Often this is done with 
the perpetrator and the victim being present together in the same location. Testimony 
during interviews has confirmed that CSWs have shown inadequate and inappropriate 
responses to the protection needs of women victims of family violence. In addition, it was 
stated that CSWs&#8217; employees presented a lack of understanding of the complex nature of 
abusive relationships and showed a failure to respond adequately, including to the point of

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>dismissing victims&#8217; safety. This situation, combined with the restriction of access to 
shelters and other forms of assistance for women victims of family violence, leads to a 
reluctance to use this institution. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Women in social care institutions and psychiatric hospitals 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur was informed of overcrowding and degrading living 
conditions in buildings which are not equipped for persons with physical or mental 
disabilities to stay on a long-term or permanent basis. Furthermore, the lack of adequate 
professional staff employed in psychiatric hospitals and social care institutions and a 
chronic underinvestment in mental health and social care services was pointed out as an 
area of concern.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur was also made aware of inadequate legal provisions and a 
lack of understanding and diligence by mental health and legal professionals and the 
judiciary.13 As a result, it is alleged that some persons may be admitted for psychiatric 
treatment against their will, without recourse to legal guarantees. Persons under 
guardianship who object to their admission and treatment can nonetheless be forcibly 
admitted and classified as voluntary patients if their guardian agrees. This procedure of 
involuntary admission is in contradiction with basic legal safeguards. The lack of legal 
protection against abuse of rights of patients and residents in psychiatric hospitals and 
social care institutions was mentioned during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the Lobor-
grad social welfare home.  
</p>
<p>56. Once admitted into a social care institution, the reality is that residents stay there for 
the rest of their lives. While there are a few possibilities of returning to live in the 
community, most residents and patients find themselves living in monotony and routine 
within the institutions, a fact which is aggravated by the remoteness of these places, making 
it difficult for family and friends to visit regularly. Mental health treatment is also quite 
reliant on medication, with less emphasis on rehabilitative and therapeutic activities aimed 
at facilitating a prompt return to community living. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some women with disabilities in 
institutions have been subjected to sexual violence, forced sterilization and/or abortions and 
forced medication, all without their consent. Generally, patients and residents are 
discouraged from forming romantic relationships with one another within the institution 
where they live, and their right to sexual autonomy is restricted. 
</p>
<p>58. Finally, although the Ombudsperson for Persons with Disabilities has a mandate to 
conduct regular visits of psychiatric hospitals and social care institutions with the purpose 
of inquiring into the human rights of patients and residents, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that such visits do not take place on a regular basis.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Punishment and reparation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>59. The complex nature of prosecution, which needs to differentiate clearly between 
misdemeanour and criminal charges, has resulted in the vast majority of cases of criminal 
domestic violence being pursued as misdemeanours to speed up the process. Additionally, 
the Special Rapporteur was made aware of inaction, insensitive attitudes and a failure to

</p>
<p>with Mental Disabilities (SHINE),<i> Out of Sight: Human Rights in Psychiatric Hospitals and Social 
Care Institutions in Croatia</i> (Budapest, 2011). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>prioritize victims&#8217; safety on the part of the prosecution. It is a common perception that 
prosecutors view the main purpose of custodial detention as preventing the perpetrator from 
influencing the victim&#8217;s testimony, rather than focusing on the safety concerns of victims. 
</p>
<p>60. Although domestic violence cases can be prosecuted under criminal or 
misdemeanour laws, in practice prosecutors do not prosecute cases that fall under the 
LPDV, i.e. that view such cases as misdemeanours. Thus prosecutors will concentrate on 
cases where the perpetrator&#8217;s behaviour is a &#8220;high intensity, quality, and quantity violent 
form of behavior&#8221;, leaving the other violence cases under the misdemeanour offence to be 
handled by the police.14 
</p>
<p>61. As for pre-trial detention, the prosecutor can request investigative detention if there 
is a reasonable suspicion that the suspect committed an offence and may impede criminal 
proceedings by influencing the witness, or if there is a danger he will repeat the offence, or 
if the detention is deemed necessary for the conduct of proceedings, due to the especially 
grave circumstances of an offence that carries a long-term prison sentence. Yet prosecutors 
still allow the release of dangerous aggressors, even where there are high risk indicators. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal Aid 
</b></p>
<p>62. Under the Free Legal Aid Act (2009), victims have the right to legal representation, 
administered by the Ministry of Justice and the counties. However, this right does not 
extend to misdemeanour and criminal proceedings, where the State represents the interests 
of the State through the testimony of victims. If victims want to sue for damages, they can 
do so separately in a civil court, at their own expense. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that free legal aid was often difficult to access, as the application forms were 
extremely complicated. Other barriers, such as the low-income level requirement and the 
lack of awareness about its availability, exclude many women from access. Free legal aid is 
not available to all domestic violence victims, such as those who are not regular residents of 
Croatia or those who fail to demonstrate financial need.15 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Misdemeanour courts 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur was informed that misdemeanour courts handle the vast 
majority of cases regarding domestic violence,16 as these courts are seen as speedier and 
more efficient in leading to a trial. Some judges have been known to view domestic 
violence as abuse that threatens women&#8217;s safety and well-being, but rather as &#8220;disturbed 
relationships&#8221;, &#8220;arguments&#8221; or minor infractions. Judicial practices sometimes do not 
reflect an understanding of the dynamics of domestic violence nor sensitivity towards 
victims of long-term, repeated violence. Some judges have been known to discredit 
victims&#8217; experiences and ask them why they waited so long to report the violence, or allege 
</p>
<p>  
 14  See footnote 10 (above), p. 37. 
 15  Following her mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed of positive amendments made to the 
</p>
<p>Free Legal Aid Act in 2011 that would include: creation of new types of legal aid such as exemption 
from payment of litigation fees and costs; precise definition of all exemption cases in which lawyers 
may refuse to provide legal aid; precise and comprehensive regulation of the reimbursement process; 
establishment of administrative county offices as primary legal aid providers; and new financial 
criteria for granting legal aid. Furthermore, new amendments are reportedly in progress, primarily 
related to primary legal aid (legal advice, preparing submissions, representation in proceedings and 
legal assistance in the peaceful settlement of out-of-court disputes).  
</p>
<p> 16  In 2009, there was a total of 15,225 persons, of which 12,668 men, accused of domestic violence in 
the misdemeanour courts in comparison with a total of 1,046 persons, of which 972 men, in the 
criminal courts; see Republic of Croatia, Central Bureau of Statistics, <i>Women and Men in Croatia 
2011</i>, pp. 51&#8211;52. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>that they are lying so as to abuse the system or obtain financial gains or property. This 
indicates a strong need for comprehensive judicial training on domestic violence. In 
addition, limited resources and personnel diminish the opportunity for the specialization of 
judges. 
</p>
<p>64. The inability of some elements of the justice system to understand the complex 
nature of violent relationships has led to the phenomenon of dual arrests and sentencing. 
Perpetrators may try to convince the judges that the violence was mutual and that they are 
also victims. If both parties are arrested and charged, the possibility that the offender will 
be convicted is diminished. In many dual arrest cases, the perpetrator is charged with 
physical violence and the victim with psychological violence. In other cases involving 
allegations of physical violence from both parties, the victim may have acted in self-
defence in response to the perpetrator&#8217;s physical violence. In such cases, the police simply 
arrest both parties, leaving it to the judge to determine the primary aggressor. 
</p>
<p>65. Although the LPDV gives misdemeanour judges the authority to grant protective 
measures, the judges most often focus on treatment for perpetrators rather than the 
protection of victims. The police often apply directly to the court for protective measures on 
behalf of the victims of domestic violence and also recommend psychosocial or addiction 
treatment for the perpetrator. The latter remedy does not provide protection for the victim.17 
Often, psychosocial and addiction treatments are ordered along with a suspended sentence, 
even in high-risk cases. There are no effective compliance monitoring programmes, and 
this was confirmed in interviews with victims who stated that most often men do not attend 
the programmes consistently. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the efficacy of 
these psychosocial programmes in preventing domestic violence. There are no independent 
studies on the effective implementation and benefits of such treatments. She is also 
concerned about the emphasis on perpetrator treatment, which diverts limited funding from 
victim services, thus conveying the message that the State cares more for the welfare of 
perpetrators than of the victims. 
</p>
<p>66. Protection measures for the victim, such as eviction, restraining orders and measures 
to prevent and prohibit harassment, are highly important to the safety of the victim. 
However, these protective measures are ordered far less frequently than perpetrator 
treatment programmes. When judges do order these protective measures, some problems 
include: orders that are impractical or inappropriate; the duration ordered for both eviction 
and restraining orders, which is often too short; and the issuance of protective measures that 
lack clear directives on the distance abusers should stay from the victim. Furthermore, a 
failure to order one measure, such as eviction, but not another, such as a restraining order, 
can lead to conflicts that compromise victims&#8217; safety. Finally, the high standard in article 
19 of the LPDV which states that these shall be issued to eliminate a &#8220;direct threat to that 
person&#8217;s life or other family members&#8221; creates a serious barrier to obtaining these urgent 
protective measures.  
</p>
<p>67. Although the misdemeanour system is recognized to be faster than the criminal 
system, reports revealed concerns over the time misdemeanour procedures can take.

<p>Outside Zagreb, judges are not always accessible 24 hours per day or on weekends and 
holidays. In addition, the law is silent on a time frame for issuing long-term protective 
measures, and parties&#8217; failure to appear for a hearing can prolong the proceedings. Finally, 
because appeals preclude protective measures from entering into force, delays of several 
days occur, and victims are put at risk of suffering more violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. War crime victims 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur met with women victims of wartime violence, in both 
Zagreb and Vukovar. She was concerned that more than 20 years after the end of the armed 
conflict, deep trauma is still present in many of the survivors. Their perpetrators have not 
been sanctioned for these crimes, and the impunity surrounding such perpetrators was seen 
as a further insult to numerous victims.18 The Special Rapporteur was made aware of the 
failure of authorities to ensure access to truth, justice and reparation for the civilian victims 
of war, including women who survived rape and other forms of sexual violence. Wartime 
crimes committed against them have not been recognized by the courts, and their 
perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity. Some live in the same communities as their 
victims. Women are unable to receive psychological, medical and other support. Many 
stories had similarities, as reflected below:  
</p>
<p>Marija recalled how her husband and father were summarily executed when their 
village was taken by the Serb army. She was taken to a camp and, along with other 
Croatian women, raped by Serbs from her neighbourhood. She managed to escape the 
camp and reach the city of Zagreb. Twenty years later, the perpetrators have still not 
been prosecuted, although she has filed a civil suit. She cannot get the status of war 
veteran/civilian war victim, despite the trauma she endured, nor for the death of her 
family members, since they were civilians. 
</p>
<p>69. Out of hundreds of cases of sexual violence documented by Croatian NGOs, very 
few have been prosecuted. According to the State Attorney&#8217;s Office, to date, 35 cases have 
been prosecuted or are awaiting prosecution. There are no official statistics and studies 
available on the number of victims and their needs. Due to the inadequacy of the legal 
framework, crimes of sexual violence are not prosecuted in accordance with international 
law and the jurisprudence of international courts, including the International Tribunal for 
the Former Yugoslavia. One of the main problems is that in prosecutions based on the 
current Criminal Code, the use of force might need to be proven as an element of rape, 
which is inconsistent with current international standards. Such practice has in fact 
perpetuated impunity for war crimes of a sexual nature.19 It is the State&#8217;s responsibility to 
adequately prosecute and ensure effective sanctions against the perpetrators of such crimes. 
The Special Rapporteur heard that in some instances of prosecution, the perpetrators have 
managed to flee to neighbouring countries either before, during or after the trials. This lack 
of accountability further maintains a sense of distrust in the ability of national courts to 
effectively provide redress and justice to women victims. 
</p>
<p>70. Apart from being denied access to justice, women survivors of wartime violence are 
also unable to exercise the right to reparation. Under international law, the right to 
reparation includes restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of 
non-repetition as defined in the United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the

<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>Right to a Remedy and Reparation of Victims of Gross Violations of International Human 
Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law. Croatian law does 
not envisage the right to reparation. As a result, survivors are denied access to psychosocial 
support, adequate healthcare and other support. The only available form of reparation is 
compensation. However, it is extremely limited, as it requires that the survivors prove that 
the crime was committed against them. For survivors who were raped during the war, often 
by unknown perpetrators, it is impossible to fulfil this requirement. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Although efforts have been made by the Government to address the issue of 
violence against women, including through the adoption of laws, policies and National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Action Plans, as well as the establishment of governmental bodies and independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms r</b>esponsible for the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights, these 
</p>
<p><b>achievements have not led to a decrease in domestic violence nor to effective redress  
</b></p>
<p><b>for women victims of wartime violence, or translated into concrete improvements in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the lives of many women and girls, including women with disabilities and survivors of 
</b></p>
<p><b>wartime sexual violence.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Despite the challenges posed by the current economic situation, targeted and 
coordinated efforts in addressing violence against women, through the practical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>innovative use of limited resources, need to remain a priority. The high levels of 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic violence, in part as a consequence of the tendency for violence to become 
</b></p>
<p><b>privatized in a post-conflict situation, as well as due to existing patriarchal attitudes,  
</b></p>
<p><b>warrant serious attention as regards effective implementation.   
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to offer the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Law and policy reforms: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratify amongst others the Council of Europe Convention on preventing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and combating violence against women and domestic violence and relevant United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations Conventions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Amend the Law on Protection against Domestic Violence (LPDV) to 
</b></p>
<p><b>redefine psychological and economic violence to ensure it includes those acts that 
</b></p>
<p><b>threaten the victim with physical harm or cause fear of such harm, to ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>definition of domestic violence specifically includes stalking, or a pattern of harassing 
</b></p>
<p><b>or threatening behaviours; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Amend the LPDV to allow urgent protective measures to be issued if 
</b></p>
<p><b>there is a fear of imminent physical harm, to allow the judiciary to issue an urgent 
</b></p>
<p><b>protective measure that will stay in place for the full term (two years) allowed under 
</b></p>
<p><b>the law, and to make sure that an appeal does not preclude entry into force of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision on these measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Take urgent steps to ensure that women victims of wartime violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>have access to justice and reparation, including adequate psychosocial and economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>support and access to health-care services. Crimes committed against them have to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>acknowledged and prosecuted in line with relevant provisions of international law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This category of survivors should be granted the status of war veterans to enable them 
</b></p>
<p><b>to access benefits flowing from this status; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Amend laws with regard to guardianship in social care institutions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>psychiatric hospitals; develop alternatives to guardianship; ensure that each case of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>potential guardianship is carefully reviewed and instigate proceedings to restore the 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal capacity of residents who do not want to be under guardianship; encourage 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternative measures to de-institutionalization like the community living in Lobor-
</b></p>
<p><b>grad; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Address the existing gender disparities in the public and private sectors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>by effectively implementing the measures provided by the Constitution and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation and policies, to increase the number of women, including from 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized groups, in the political, economic, social, cultural and judicial spheres;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Continue to remove practical hurdles affecting the employment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women, which is exacerbated through temporary contracts and lower positions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>salary scales for women. Strengthen the social welfare system by removing 
</b></p>
<p><b>impediments to the integration of women into the labour market; 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Judiciary and police practices: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Develop guidelines and provide training to police, judges and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors on distinguishing between misdemeanour- and criminal-level cases of 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic violence;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Provide education and training for judges on all aspects of domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, including the dynamics of domestic violence, sensitivity to victims, risk 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessment, defensive injuries and promoting victim safety, including through regular 
</b></p>
<p><b>communication of court processes. This should be conducted by specialized external 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers with </b>the assistance of specialized women&#8217;s organizations<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)  Develop a system for regular communication and collaboration that 
</b></p>
<p><b>involves all sectors </b>&#8211;<b> judicial, law enforcement, criminal, social welfare, health, 
</b></p>
<p><b>educational sectors </b>and women&#8217;<b>s NGOs </b>&#8211;<b> to address domestic violence;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Cease the practice of having parties confront each other in hearings; 
</b></p>
<p><b>offer and allow for separate testimony in domestic violence cases; ensure separate 
</b></p>
<p><b>waiting areas and adequate security in courthouses; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Promote sentences for domestic violence that are commensurate with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>gravity of crimes and refrain from imposing suspended sentences; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Give priority to protective measures that protect victim safety, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>eviction, restraining orders, harassment protections and confiscation of firearms for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the maximum period allowed under the law. Develop a monitoring and evaluation 
</b></p>
<p><b>system that looks at the implementation and effectiveness of the psychosocial 
</b></p>
<p><b>treatments of perpetrators. Such remedies should be ordered in conjunction with 
</b></p>
<p><b>other protective measures necessary to ensure victim safety; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Continue to set up Victims and Witnesses Protection Units in all judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>districts of the country; ensure these services are adequately advertised and available 
</b></p>
<p><b>to victims of domestic violence; ensure that these units operate in all misdemeanour 
</b></p>
<p><b>c</b>ourts in partnerships with the judiciary and the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Support services for women victims of domestic violence: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Restructure the mission and functions of the Centres for Social Welfare 
</b></p>
<p><b>(CSWs). Specific and specialized institutional structures should provide support and 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance to women victims of violence, ensure family and children welfare and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide financial support to persons in need of State support programmes. Ensure, 
</b></p>
<p><b>through education, a change of mentalities among the various employees of these 
</b></p>
<p><b>Centres from a social/welfare approach to a human-rights based approach 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognizing and focusing on violence against women and taking into consideration the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>nature of relationships based on power and dependency; ensure CSW staff are 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided with effective gender-sensitive training in partnership with women</b>&#8217;s<b> NGOs 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that they treat all cases of domestic violence as urgent. Compulsory mediation 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be prohibited and sanctions imposed on authorities who continue the practice 
</b></p>
<p><b>of forced mediation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Continue to take the necessary measures, including financial, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintain existing and set up new anti-violence shelters for the assistance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of women victims of violence in all areas of the country, which can provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>valuable advice and support for the benefit of public shelters. This should be done in 
</b></p>
<p>partnership with women&#8217;s organizations<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure sufficient funding and capacity in shelters for women victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic violence; develop national standards to address concerns about shelters and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other support provided to women victims of violence. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>In psychiatric hospitals and social care institutions: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Ombudsperson for Persons with Disabilities should seek out 
</b></p>
<p><b>complaints and carefully monitor institutions to clamp down on cases of arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention and should engage actively in advocacy to ensure monitoring of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Adequately resource psychiatric hospitals and social care institutions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including training for the well-being and treatment of their patients and residents;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Address the issue of long-term institutionalization, and the development 
</b></p>
<p><b>of alternatives and possibilities of autonomous living. The experience from the pilot 
</b></p>
<p><b>project of self-organized living in houses in Lobor-grad should be monitored and 
</b></p>
<p><b>evaluated for effectiveness prior to expansion and replication in other parts of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country, if warranted.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Statistics and data collection: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Strengthen the capacity of data collection on violence against women 
</b></p>
<p><b>through a centralized statistical agency and ensure proper and effective collaboration 
</b></p>
<p><b>and exchange of data among institutions and organizations already working to collect 
</b></p>
<p><b>data on violence against women </b>&#8211;<b> including the police, CSWs, courts and civil society. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ensure a system for regular and standardized data collection and analysis, 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregated by relevant characteristics in order to understand the magnitude, 
</b></p>
<p><b>trends and patterns of violence against women;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Facilitate the publication of all c</b>ourts&#8217; decisions and judgements, 
</p>
<p><b>including those at the misdemeanour level; ensure these are effectively entered into 
</b></p>
<p><b>the data collection system, together with the protection measures decided by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>courts for women victims of violence. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Societal changes and awareness-raising initiatives: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Continue awareness-raising campaigns aimed at eliminating 
</b></p>
<p><b>stereotypical attitudes about the roles and responsibilities of women and men in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>family, society and the workplace; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Strengthen the capacity of the Ombudsperson on Gender Equality, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ombudsperson for Persons with Disabilities and the Government Offices for Gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>Equality, for Human Rights and for National Minorities to implement  programmes 
</b></p>
<p>that aim at bringing about change in society&#8217;s perception of women generally, <b>and

</p>
<p><b> (c) Continue to train </b>and sensitize the media on women&#8217;s rights<b>, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>on violence against women, in order to achieve non-stereotyped representations of
